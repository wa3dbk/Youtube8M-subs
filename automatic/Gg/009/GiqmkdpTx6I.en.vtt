00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.090 

in<00:00:00.719> this<00:00:01.380> lesson<00:00:01.589> we'll<00:00:01.829> talk<00:00:01.979> about

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
in this lesson we'll talk about

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.190 
in this lesson we'll talk about
transferring<00:00:02.760> high<00:00:03.060> resolution<00:00:03.600> detail<00:00:03.929> from

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
transferring high resolution detail from

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.019 
transferring high resolution detail from
one<00:00:04.529> mesh<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:05.069> another<00:00:05.279> mesh<00:00:05.460> with<00:00:05.670> different

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
one mesh to another mesh with different

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.540 
one mesh to another mesh with different
topology<00:00:06.589> so<00:00:07.589> there<00:00:07.859> may<00:00:07.950> come<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> time<00:00:08.189> when

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
topology so there may come a time when

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.120 
topology so there may come a time when
we're<00:00:08.730> building<00:00:08.940> our<00:00:09.710> models<00:00:10.710> here<00:00:10.830> we<00:00:11.040> go

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
we're building our models here we go

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.499 
we're building our models here we go
through<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.460> we<00:00:11.519> do<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.759> sculpting<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.389> they

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
through and we do the sculpting and they

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.150 
through and we do the sculpting and they
create<00:00:12.719> all<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.290> resolution<00:00:13.860> detail

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
create all of that I resolution detail

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.039 
create all of that I resolution detail
that<00:00:14.309> we<00:00:14.400> like<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.820> then<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:15.509> decide<00:00:15.750> what<00:00:15.929> we

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
that we like and then we decide what we

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.170 
that we like and then we decide what we
need<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.260> come<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.680> actually<00:00:16.770> modify<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
need to come in and actually modify the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.480 
need to come in and actually modify the
topology<00:00:18.779> now<00:00:19.680> we<00:00:19.740> don't<00:00:19.949> want<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.189> go<00:00:20.279> ahead

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
topology now we don't want to go ahead

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.179 
topology now we don't want to go ahead
and<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.660> rescale<00:00:22.140> Paul<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.710> detail

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
and have to rescale Paul of that detail

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.070 
and have to rescale Paul of that detail
on<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.850> new<00:00:24.000> mesh<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.510> actually<00:00:24.840> want<00:00:25.019> to

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
on the new mesh we actually want to

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.769 
on the new mesh we actually want to
transfer<00:00:25.650> as<00:00:26.580> much<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.119> detail<00:00:27.420> as<00:00:27.689> we

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
transfer as much of that detail as we

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.169 
transfer as much of that detail as we
can<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.920> geometry<00:00:29.699> with<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.939> new

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
can to the geometry with the new

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.440 
can to the geometry with the new
topology<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.109> new<00:00:31.230> edge<00:00:31.439> flow<00:00:31.969> and<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.180> this

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
topology the new edge flow and so this

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.990 
topology the new edge flow and so this
process<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.960> actually<00:00:34.079> very<00:00:34.350> easy<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.790> simple

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
process is actually very easy and simple

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.330 
process is actually very easy and simple
here<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.630> Mudbox<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.219> that

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
here in Mudbox in and we can do that

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.940 
here in Mudbox in and we can do that
using<00:00:38.550> sent<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.210> Maya<00:00:39.450> or<00:00:39.840> sent<00:00:40.110> 3ds<00:00:40.410> max<00:00:40.710> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
using sent to Maya or sent 3ds max and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.250 
using sent to Maya or sent 3ds max and
so<00:00:41.070> forth<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.640> create<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.510> nice<00:00:42.780> back

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
so forth to really create a nice back

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.080 
so forth to really create a nice back
and<00:00:43.469> forth<00:00:43.739> between<00:00:43.950> these<00:00:44.280> applications

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
and forth between these applications

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.150 
and forth between these applications
let's<00:00:45.719> take<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.899> look<00:00:46.079> specifically<00:00:46.590> at<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
let's take a look specifically at the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.100 
let's take a look specifically at the
transfer<00:00:47.879> details<00:00:48.329> though<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.899> lesson

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
transfer details though in this lesson

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.700 
transfer details though in this lesson
and<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:49.469> we'll<00:00:50.039> take<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.309> look<00:00:50.520> at<00:00:50.760> that

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
and then we'll take a look at that

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.290 
and then we'll take a look at that
integration<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.949> other<00:00:53.129> 3d<00:00:53.370> apps<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
integration with the other 3d apps in a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450 
integration with the other 3d apps in a
couple<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.629> lessons<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.770> let's<00:00:56.160> say<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.309> we

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
couple of lessons so let's say that we

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.299 
couple of lessons so let's say that we
have<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.820> model<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:58.350> we've<00:00:58.980> got<00:00:59.100> all<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
have this model and we we've got all the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.770 
have this model and we we've got all the
details<00:00:59.640> sculpted<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.390> go<00:01:00.539> ahead<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
details sculpted in if we go ahead and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.420 
details sculpted in if we go ahead and
jump<00:01:01.289> down<00:01:01.520> to<00:01:02.520> our<00:01:02.730> lowest<00:01:03.149> level<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:04.430> on

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
jump down to our lowest level here on

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.800 
jump down to our lowest level here on
this<00:01:05.580> particular<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.479> actually

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
this particular and this is actually

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.630 
this particular and this is actually
less<00:01:07.020> than<00:01:07.049> 15<00:01:07.530> start<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.250> want<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> use

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
less than 15 start if you want to use

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.390 
less than 15 start if you want to use
that<00:01:08.810> you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.260> what<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.799> geometry

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
that you can see what that geometry

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.880 
that you can see what that geometry
looks<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.119> let's<00:01:12.960> say<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.290> whatever<00:01:13.500> reason

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
looks like let's say for whatever reason

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.780 
looks like let's say for whatever reason
we<00:01:14.010> want<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.220> come<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.549> make<00:01:14.670> some

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
we want to come in and make some

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.670 
we want to come in and make some
modifications<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.780> topology<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.530> we

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
modifications to the topology so we

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.429 
modifications to the topology so we
would<00:01:17.750> import<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.930> into<00:01:18.990> another

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
would import this into another

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.920 
would import this into another
application<00:01:20.040> send<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.580> over<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.790> Maya<00:01:21.060> however

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
application send it over to Maya however

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.170 
application send it over to Maya however
it<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.500> want<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.770> do<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.280> then

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it is that we want to do that and then

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.340 
it is that we want to do that and then
we<00:01:24.299> would<00:01:24.420> come<00:01:24.600> up<00:01:24.720> with<00:01:24.900> let's<00:01:25.170> say

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
we would come up with let's say

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.980 
we would come up with let's say
something<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.060> turn<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.630> this

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
something like this so I turn on this

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.719 
something like this so I turn on this
tier<00:01:28.920> X<00:01:29.100> underscore<00:01:29.700> top<00:01:30.180> oh<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:31.640> turn<00:01:32.640> off

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
tier X underscore top oh and turn off

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.819 
tier X underscore top oh and turn off
our<00:01:32.880> t-rex<00:01:33.210> for<00:01:33.420> now<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.680> see

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
our t-rex for now and so you can see

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.319 
our t-rex for now and so you can see
I've<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.159> added<00:01:35.340> some<00:01:35.520> edge<00:01:35.790> loops<00:01:36.090> let's

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
I've just added some edge loops let's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.370 
I've just added some edge loops let's
say<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.479> want<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.720> level<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> little<00:01:37.259> bit

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
say I want to level have a little bit

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.840 
say I want to level have a little bit
more<00:01:37.470> resolution<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.070> here<00:01:38.400> or<00:01:38.579> around<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
more resolution in here or around the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.080 
more resolution in here or around the
neck<00:01:39.060> I've<00:01:39.270> also<00:01:39.500> kind<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.530> extruded<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.790> area

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
neck I've also kind of extruded the area

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.929 
neck I've also kind of extruded the area
around<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.360> eye<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.110> mouth<00:01:43.670> we<00:01:44.670> want<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
around the eye and the mouth we want to

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.940 
around the eye and the mouth we want to
have<00:01:45.000> maybe<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.329> little<00:01:45.479> bit<00:01:45.659> more<00:01:45.869> ability<00:01:46.799> to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
have maybe a little bit more ability to

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.039 
have maybe a little bit more ability to
sculpt<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.399> here<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.909> specific<00:01:48.360> areas<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.899> so

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
sculpt in here the specific areas and so

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.230 
sculpt in here the specific areas and so
for<00:01:49.619> whatever<00:01:49.890> reason<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.310> want<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.549> modify

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
for whatever reason we want to modify

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.420 
for whatever reason we want to modify
the<00:01:51.390> topology<00:01:51.990> add<00:01:52.140> edge<00:01:52.320> loops<00:01:52.619> whatever<00:01:53.340> we

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the topology add edge loops whatever we

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.630 
the topology add edge loops whatever we
want<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.640> do<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.659> now<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.470> actual<00:01:56.219> mesh

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
want to do so now this actual mesh

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.069 
want to do so now this actual mesh
doesn't<00:01:56.969> have<00:01:57.090> any<00:01:57.240> subdivision<00:01:57.450> levels<00:01:57.960> it

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
doesn't have any subdivision levels it

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.600 
doesn't have any subdivision levels it
doesn't<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.380> any<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.770> high<00:01:59.070> resolution

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
doesn't have any of that high resolution

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.550 
doesn't have any of that high resolution
detail<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.140> has<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.439> new

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
detail on it it just has the new

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.929 
detail on it it just has the new
topology<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.280> what<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.490> want<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:02.790> is

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
topology so what we want to do is

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.260 
topology so what we want to do is
transfer<00:02:03.570> all<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.409> our<00:02:04.740> high<00:02:04.920> res<00:02:05.100> detail<00:02:05.310> from

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
transfer all of our high res detail from

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.499 
transfer all of our high res detail from
this<00:02:06.990> mesh<00:02:07.459> to<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.670> new<00:02:08.879> mesh<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.360> we've

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
this mesh to the new mesh that we've

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.070 
this mesh to the new mesh that we've
created<00:02:10.160> ok<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.640> that

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
created ok so to do that

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.130 
created ok so to do that
we'll<00:02:13.380> go<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.530> mesh<00:02:14.360> transfer<00:02:15.360> details<00:02:15.810> and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
we'll go to mesh transfer details and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.470 
we'll go to mesh transfer details and
you<00:02:17.010> can<00:02:17.130> see<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.370> brings<00:02:17.580> up<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.850> little<00:02:18.090> window

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
you can see it brings up a little window

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.830 
you can see it brings up a little window
here<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.960> we<00:02:19.680> also<00:02:19.800> have<00:02:19.920> some<00:02:20.190> advanced

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
here and we also have some advanced

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.260 
here and we also have some advanced
properties<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:21.960> we<00:02:22.050> can<00:02:22.200> set<00:02:23.090> so<00:02:24.090> if<00:02:24.150> we<00:02:24.240> take

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
properties that we can set so if we take

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.720 
properties that we can set so if we take
a<00:02:24.450> look<00:02:24.540> up<00:02:24.870> at<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.170> top<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:26.100> target<00:02:26.490> metal

the source model is going to be

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.780 
the source model is going to be
obviously<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.170> high<00:02:43.350> res<00:02:43.590> mesh<00:02:44.070> but<00:02:44.430> we<00:02:44.640> don't

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
obviously the high res mesh but we don't

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.810 
obviously the high res mesh but we don't
need<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.090> select<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.720> highest<00:02:46.590> level<00:02:46.950> we're

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
need to select the highest level we're

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.130 
need to select the highest level we're
going<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.000> actually<00:02:48.150> select<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.780> level<00:02:49.050> that

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
going to actually select the level that

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.070 
going to actually select the level that
matches<00:02:49.530> up<00:02:49.710> with<00:02:49.890> our<00:02:50.160> our<00:02:51.150> target<00:02:51.840> model

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
matches up with our our target model

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.840 
matches up with our our target model
which<00:02:52.380> in<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.530> case<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.740> actually<00:02:53.310> level<00:02:53.550> 0

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
which in this case is actually level 0

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.970 
which in this case is actually level 0
okay<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:54.870> even<00:02:55.260> though<00:02:55.410> there's<00:02:55.709> not<00:02:55.830> really

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
okay so even though there's not really

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.470 
okay so even though there's not really
any<00:02:56.190> detail<00:02:56.550> here<00:02:56.730> at<00:02:56.790> level<00:02:57.000> 0<00:02:57.240> we're<00:02:57.360> going

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
any detail here at level 0 we're going

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.870 
any detail here at level 0 we're going
to<00:02:57.540> choose<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:58.190> okay<00:02:59.190> let's<00:02:59.730> search

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
to choose this okay let's search

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.250 
to choose this okay let's search
distance<00:03:00.150> that's<00:03:00.510> going<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.720> be<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.110> distance

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
whether we want to how far we want to

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.660 
whether we want to how far we want to
subdivide<00:03:27.870> our<00:03:28.200> target<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:28.739> creating<00:03:29.519> those

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
subdivide our target in creating those

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.509 
subdivide our target in creating those
levels<00:03:30.150> if<00:03:30.300> we<00:03:30.690> choose<00:03:30.870> automatic<00:03:31.430> it'll<00:03:32.430> go

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
levels if we choose automatic it'll go

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.640 
levels if we choose automatic it'll go
ahead<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:32.910> subdivide<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.690> until<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.320> number

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
ahead and subdivide it until the number

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.350 
ahead and subdivide it until the number
of<00:03:34.769> polygons<00:03:35.160> match<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.640> number<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:35.970> polygons

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
of polygons match the number of polygons

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.070 
of polygons match the number of polygons
in<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:37.050> level<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:39.000> source<00:03:39.720> model

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
in that level of the the source model

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.440 
in that level of the the source model
match<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.100> or<00:03:41.190> look<00:03:41.519> are<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.790> little<00:03:42.120> bit<00:03:42.300> higher

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
match it or look are a little bit higher

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.840 
match it or look are a little bit higher
we<00:03:43.230> can<00:03:43.380> choose<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.680> if<00:03:44.160> there<00:03:44.340> are<00:03:44.400> any<00:03:44.519> missed

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
we can choose to if there are any missed

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.170 
we can choose to if there are any missed
areas<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.780> don't<00:03:45.959> get<00:03:46.519> calculated<00:03:47.519> we<00:03:47.970> can

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
areas that don't get calculated we can

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.570 
areas that don't get calculated we can
select<00:03:48.510> those<00:03:48.840> we<00:03:49.530> can<00:03:49.650> also<00:03:49.769> transfer<00:03:50.340> joint

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
select those we can also transfer joint

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.250 
select those we can also transfer joint
weights<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:50.970> we<00:03:51.060> can<00:03:51.150> also<00:03:51.269> transfer<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.050> as

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
weights and we can also transfer this as

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.910 
weights and we can also transfer this as
a<00:03:52.290> sculpt<00:03:52.830> layer<00:03:53.010> if<00:03:53.850> we<00:03:53.970> want<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.330> okay<00:03:55.019> that's

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
a sculpt layer if we want to okay that's

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.800 
a sculpt layer if we want to okay that's
actually<00:03:56.220> this<00:03:56.340> one<00:03:56.519> here<00:03:56.820> this<00:03:57.420> will<00:03:57.600> allow

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
actually this one here this will allow

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.420 
actually this one here this will allow
us<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.989> transfer<00:03:58.470> any<00:03:58.590> sculpt<00:03:58.920> layers<00:03:59.100> that<00:03:59.310> we

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
us to transfer any sculpt layers that we

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.840 
us to transfer any sculpt layers that we
may<00:03:59.550> have<00:03:59.760> on<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.769> alright<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.010> once

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
may have on this alright and so once

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.900 
may have on this alright and so once
we've<00:04:02.970> got<00:04:03.150> these<00:04:03.300> set<00:04:04.310> let's<00:04:05.310> go<00:04:05.459> ahead<00:04:05.730> and

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
we've got these set let's go ahead and

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.880 
we've got these set let's go ahead and
choose<00:04:06.269> transfer<00:04:06.870> details<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.530> pretty<00:04:07.830> much

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
choose transfer details and pretty much

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.610 
choose transfer details and pretty much
use<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.280> default<00:04:08.610> settings<00:04:09.030> here<00:04:09.500> we'll<00:04:10.500> go

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
use the default settings here we'll go

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.020 
use the default settings here we'll go
ahead<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:10.920> say<00:04:11.010> transfer<00:04:11.549> so<00:04:11.700> it's<00:04:11.850> going<00:04:11.970> to

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
ahead and say transfer so it's going to

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.370 
ahead and say transfer so it's going to
go<00:04:12.120> through<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.330> process<00:04:12.600> of<00:04:12.930> calculating

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
go through the process of calculating

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.830 
go through the process of calculating
this<00:04:13.890> so<00:04:14.790> this<00:04:14.850> is<00:04:14.970> going<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.120> be<00:04:15.269> kind<00:04:15.690> of

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
this so this is going to be kind of

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.390 
this so this is going to be kind of
similar<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.200> transferring<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.010> paint<00:04:17.220> layers

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
similar to transferring the paint layers

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.820 
similar to transferring the paint layers
where<00:04:17.669> we're<00:04:17.840> kind<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:18.900> calculating<00:04:19.709> this

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
where we're kind of calculating this

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.600 
where we're kind of calculating this
using<00:04:20.580> kind<00:04:21.419> of<00:04:21.510> ray<00:04:21.660> casting<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:23.190> look<00:04:23.400> for

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
using kind of ray casting to look for

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.850 
using kind of ray casting to look for
the<00:04:23.880> details<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.390> then<00:04:24.810> transfer<00:04:25.200> that<00:04:25.500> onto

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
the details and then transfer that onto

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.050 
the details and then transfer that onto
our

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
our

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.100 
our
target<00:04:27.840> matched<00:04:28.620> which<00:04:28.860> in<00:04:29.010> this<00:04:29.100> case<00:04:29.160> is

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
target matched which in this case is

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.770 
target matched which in this case is
something<00:04:31.110> that<00:04:31.200> has<00:04:31.380> different<00:04:31.860> topology

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
something that has different topology

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.840 
something that has different topology
okay<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:34.020> we'll<00:04:34.770> talk<00:04:35.010> a<00:04:35.310> little<00:04:35.490> bit<00:04:35.700> more

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
okay and we'll talk a little bit more

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.060 
okay and we'll talk a little bit more
about<00:04:36.150> this<00:04:36.389> in<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:36.690> last<00:04:37.590> lesson<00:04:37.800> where

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
about this in the last lesson where

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.520 
about this in the last lesson where
we'll<00:04:38.220> go<00:04:38.250> over<00:04:38.400> as<00:04:39.020> I<00:04:40.020> said<00:04:40.230> all<00:04:40.380> the

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
we'll go over as I said all the

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.159 
we'll go over as I said all the
integration<00:04:41.100> features<00:04:41.760> here<00:04:42.180> so<00:04:42.930> now<00:04:43.139> that

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
integration features here so now that

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.840 
integration features here so now that
it's<00:04:43.410> done<00:04:43.680> let's<00:04:44.070> go<00:04:44.190> ahead<00:04:44.280> and<00:04:44.370> turn<00:04:44.610> off

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
it's done let's go ahead and turn off

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.170 
it's done let's go ahead and turn off
that<00:04:45.150> original<00:04:46.070> mesh<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:47.370> now<00:04:47.639> we<00:04:47.700> can<00:04:47.970> see

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
that original mesh and now we can see

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.220 
that original mesh and now we can see
this<00:04:48.360> is<00:04:48.570> actually<00:04:49.050> our<00:04:50.300> mesh<00:04:51.300> with<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:51.960> new

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
this is actually our mesh with the new

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.800 
this is actually our mesh with the new
topology<00:04:52.740> if<00:04:52.889> we<00:04:53.010> were<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.190> go<00:04:53.280> ahead<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.810> look

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
topology if we were to go ahead and look

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.150 
topology if we were to go ahead and look
at<00:04:54.900> this<00:04:55.020> it<00:04:55.200> now<00:04:55.350> has<00:04:55.620> all<00:04:55.889> of<00:04:56.040> those

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
at this it now has all of those

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.150 
at this it now has all of those
subdivision<00:04:56.760> levels<00:04:57.410> okay<00:04:58.410> we<00:04:58.650> can<00:04:58.770> go<00:04:58.889> up<00:04:59.070> and

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
subdivision levels okay we can go up and

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.980 
subdivision levels okay we can go up and
down<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.460> levels<00:05:01.610> we<00:05:02.610> go<00:05:02.760> ahead<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.120> page

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
down the levels we go ahead and page

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.190 
down the levels we go ahead and page
down<00:05:04.260> to<00:05:04.910> so<00:05:05.910> we<00:05:06.000> can<00:05:06.030> take<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.300> look<00:05:06.510> and<00:05:06.660> just

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
down to so we can take a look and just

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.110 
down to so we can take a look and just
see<00:05:07.290> that<00:05:07.620> that<00:05:07.889> is<00:05:08.070> in<00:05:08.100> fact<00:05:08.250> our<00:05:08.639> new

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
see that that is in fact our new

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.980 
see that that is in fact our new
topology<00:05:11.030> so<00:05:12.030> what<00:05:12.240> we<00:05:12.330> started<00:05:12.660> out<00:05:12.810> with

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
topology so what we started out with

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.700 
topology so what we started out with
which<00:05:13.350> was<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:14.370> basically<00:05:15.180> level<00:05:15.540> 0<00:05:16.020> mesh

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
which was the basically level 0 mesh

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.890 
which was the basically level 0 mesh
with<00:05:17.400> new<00:05:17.639> topology<00:05:18.150> but<00:05:18.419> no<00:05:18.570> subdivision

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
with new topology but no subdivision

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.200 
with new topology but no subdivision
levels<00:05:19.440> we<00:05:20.160> now<00:05:20.370> have<00:05:20.729> all<00:05:20.940> of<00:05:21.120> the

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
levels we now have all of the

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.090 
levels we now have all of the
subdivision<00:05:21.720> levels<00:05:22.050> in<00:05:22.229> with<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:22.919> new

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
subdivision levels in with the new

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.850 
subdivision levels in with the new
topology<00:05:23.820> taken<00:05:24.120> into<00:05:24.270> account<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.810> we<00:05:25.710> have

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
topology taken into account and we have

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.590 
topology taken into account and we have
all<00:05:26.100> of<00:05:26.220> that<00:05:26.250> high<00:05:26.580> res<00:05:26.820> detail<00:05:27.180> that<00:05:27.510> we

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
all of that high res detail that we

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.750 
all of that high res detail that we
sculpt<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.080> projected<00:05:28.290> in<00:05:28.860> to<00:05:29.400> those<00:05:29.520> new

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
sculpt it projected in to those new

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.180 
sculpt it projected in to those new
levels<00:05:30.150> as<00:05:30.330> we<00:05:30.479> go<00:05:30.630> up<00:05:30.660> so<00:05:31.560> we<00:05:31.650> very<00:05:31.979> quickly

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
levels as we go up so we very quickly

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.130 
levels as we go up so we very quickly
been<00:05:32.580> able<00:05:32.729> to<00:05:32.880> update<00:05:33.090> our<00:05:33.510> mesh<00:05:33.810> with<00:05:34.050> the

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
been able to update our mesh with the

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.960 
been able to update our mesh with the
new<00:05:34.289> topology<00:05:34.740> and<00:05:34.770> keep<00:05:35.130> all<00:05:35.340> the<00:05:35.520> sculpting

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
new topology and keep all the sculpting

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.480 
new topology and keep all the sculpting
information<00:05:36.570> so<00:05:36.750> we<00:05:36.840> don't<00:05:37.020> have<00:05:37.229> to<00:05:37.440> lose<00:05:38.190> any

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
information so we don't have to lose any

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.520 
information so we don't have to lose any
work<00:05:39.210> that<00:05:39.240> we've<00:05:39.630> already<00:05:39.840> done<00:05:40.169> just

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
work that we've already done just

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.590 
work that we've already done just
because<00:05:40.650> we<00:05:40.890> want<00:05:41.070> to<00:05:41.100> update<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.610> mesh<00:05:41.789> so

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
because we want to update the mesh so

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.630 
because we want to update the mesh so
that's<00:05:43.320> a<00:05:43.440> really<00:05:43.470> powerful<00:05:43.860> feature<00:05:44.310> it's

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
that's a really powerful feature it's

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.860 
that's a really powerful feature it's
located<00:05:44.940> here<00:05:45.240> under<00:05:45.390> mesh<00:05:45.860> transfer<00:05:46.860> details

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
located here under mesh transfer details

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.719 
located here under mesh transfer details
all<00:05:48.870> right<00:05:49.080> now<00:05:49.740> one<00:05:49.950> other<00:05:49.979> thing<00:05:50.460> that<00:05:50.490> I

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
all right now one other thing that I

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.900 
all right now one other thing that I
wanted<00:05:51.060> to<00:05:51.210> look<00:05:51.930> at<00:05:52.110> in<00:05:52.350> this<00:05:52.560> lesson<00:05:52.800> is<00:05:53.070> the

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
wanted to look at in this lesson is the

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.360 
wanted to look at in this lesson is the
fact<00:05:54.150> that<00:05:54.270> if<00:05:54.990> we<00:05:55.140> bring<00:05:55.350> in<00:05:55.530> a<00:05:55.650> very<00:05:55.979> high<00:05:56.190> res

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
fact that if we bring in a very high res

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.580 
fact that if we bring in a very high res
mesh<00:05:56.639> so<00:05:56.850> let's<00:05:57.030> say<00:05:57.150> that<00:05:57.300> we've<00:05:57.419> got<00:06:00.080> a<00:06:01.080> high

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
mesh so let's say that we've got a high

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.140 
mesh so let's say that we've got a high
res<00:06:01.800> mesh<00:06:02.220> that<00:06:02.460> you've<00:06:02.610> brought<00:06:02.880> in<00:06:03.030> from

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
res mesh that you've brought in from

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.390 
res mesh that you've brought in from
another<00:06:03.270> application<00:06:03.889> it<00:06:04.889> has<00:06:05.250> been

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
another application it has been

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.279 
another application it has been
subdivided<00:06:05.760> and<00:06:06.180> sculpted<00:06:06.720> maybe<00:06:06.930> in<00:06:07.200> another

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
subdivided and sculpted maybe in another

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.430 
subdivided and sculpted maybe in another
application<00:06:07.590> and<00:06:08.510> and<00:06:09.510> you<00:06:09.960> brought<00:06:10.169> it<00:06:10.320> in

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
application and and you brought it in

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.540 
application and and you brought it in
but<00:06:10.620> it<00:06:10.710> doesn't<00:06:10.979> have<00:06:11.100> any<00:06:11.250> subdivision

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
but it doesn't have any subdivision

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.340 
but it doesn't have any subdivision
levels<00:06:12.150> let's<00:06:12.330> say<00:06:12.479> all<00:06:12.660> we<00:06:12.780> have<00:06:12.990> is<00:06:13.169> this

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
levels let's say all we have is this

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.490 
levels let's say all we have is this
highest<00:06:13.950> level<00:06:14.370> and<00:06:14.400> that's<00:06:14.580> it<00:06:14.880> so<00:06:15.780> for<00:06:16.410> my

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
highest level and that's it so for my

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.469 
highest level and that's it so for my
box<00:06:16.710> to<00:06:16.800> work<00:06:16.889> really<00:06:17.580> well<00:06:17.700> we<00:06:18.120> want<00:06:18.270> to<00:06:18.360> have

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
box to work really well we want to have

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.150 
box to work really well we want to have
all<00:06:18.630> of<00:06:18.780> those<00:06:18.900> subdivision<00:06:19.500> levels<00:06:19.830> in<00:06:19.950> there

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
all of those subdivision levels in there

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.430 
all of those subdivision levels in there
so<00:06:20.700> another<00:06:21.120> feature<00:06:21.570> that<00:06:21.720> will<00:06:21.960> just<00:06:22.320> look

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
so another feature that will just look

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.870 
so another feature that will just look
at<00:06:22.650> real<00:06:22.830> quick<00:06:23.070> and<00:06:23.220> show<00:06:23.340> you<00:06:23.580> where<00:06:23.669> it<00:06:23.729> is

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
at real quick and show you where it is

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.810 
at real quick and show you where it is
is<00:06:24.120> to<00:06:25.110> go<00:06:25.680> in<00:06:25.800> here<00:06:26.039> and<00:06:26.070> say<00:06:26.370> rebuild

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
is to go in here and say rebuild

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.330 
is to go in here and say rebuild
subdivision<00:06:27.539> levels<00:06:27.840> and<00:06:28.020> what<00:06:28.860> that<00:06:29.039> will<00:06:29.190> do

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
subdivision levels and what that will do

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.159 
subdivision levels and what that will do
is<00:06:29.550> come<00:06:30.000> in<00:06:30.150> and<00:06:30.180> assuming<00:06:30.720> that<00:06:30.840> this<00:06:30.930> can<00:06:31.110> be

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
is come in and assuming that this can be

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:33.980 
is come in and assuming that this can be
subdivided<00:06:31.490> the<00:06:32.490> the<00:06:33.120> mesh<00:06:33.330> it'll<00:06:33.660> take<00:06:33.840> the

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
subdivided the the mesh it'll take the

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.440 
subdivided the the mesh it'll take the
high<00:06:34.440> res<00:06:34.590> mesh<00:06:34.770> and<00:06:35.300> reconstruct<00:06:36.300> those

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
high res mesh and reconstruct those

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.180 
high res mesh and reconstruct those
subdivision<00:06:36.990> levels<00:06:37.289> as<00:06:37.409> far<00:06:37.590> down<00:06:37.620> as<00:06:37.800> it<00:06:38.039> can

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
subdivision levels as far down as it can

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.070 
subdivision levels as far down as it can
go<00:06:38.370> so<00:06:39.000> it<00:06:39.270> will<00:06:39.360> allow<00:06:39.599> you<00:06:39.659> to<00:06:39.750> get<00:06:39.900> those

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
go so it will allow you to get those

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.730 
go so it will allow you to get those
subdivision

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
subdivision

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.409 
subdivision
those<00:06:40.860> back<00:06:41.190> if<00:06:41.400> you<00:06:41.520> bring<00:06:41.759> in<00:06:41.910> something

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 
those back if you bring in something

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:44.900 
those back if you bring in something
that's<00:06:42.599> really<00:06:42.870> high<00:06:43.050> res<00:06:43.289> like<00:06:43.860> this<00:06:44.069> and<00:06:44.280> for

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 
that's really high res like this and for

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.490 
that's really high res like this and for
instance<00:06:45.000> it<00:06:45.300> doesn't<00:06:45.599> have<00:06:45.750> any<00:06:45.960> subdivision

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
instance it doesn't have any subdivision

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.320 
instance it doesn't have any subdivision
levels<00:06:47.039> on<00:06:47.160> it<00:06:47.280> okay<00:06:47.819> so<00:06:47.880> that's<00:06:48.180> something

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
levels on it okay so that's something

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.089 
levels on it okay so that's something
else<00:06:48.509> to<00:06:48.599> think<00:06:48.690> about<00:06:48.870> and<00:06:49.229> another<00:06:49.860> feature

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:50.099 
else to think about and another feature

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:51.950 
else to think about and another feature
in<00:06:50.430> Mudbox<00:06:51.060> that<00:06:51.300> can<00:06:51.419> really<00:06:51.539> help<00:06:51.780> us

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
in Mudbox that can really help us

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.129 
in Mudbox that can really help us
working<00:06:52.199> with<00:06:52.410> our<00:06:52.440> meshes<00:06:53.479> alright<00:06:54.479> so<00:06:54.660> the

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 
working with our meshes alright so the

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:56.629 
working with our meshes alright so the
next<00:06:55.289> thing<00:06:55.410> that<00:06:55.560> we<00:06:55.860> want<00:06:55.979> to<00:06:56.069> talk<00:06:56.220> about<00:06:56.370> is

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
next thing that we want to talk about is

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.360 
next thing that we want to talk about is
using<00:06:57.569> the<00:06:57.840> pose<00:06:58.139> tools<00:06:58.470> so<00:06:58.979> that's<00:06:59.190> this

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
using the pose tools so that's this

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.550 
using the pose tools so that's this
third<00:06:59.639> tray<00:07:00.240> down<00:07:00.419> here<00:07:00.780> that<00:07:01.199> will<00:07:01.319> allow<00:07:01.530> us

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
third tray down here that will allow us

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.950 
third tray down here that will allow us
to<00:07:01.740> to<00:07:02.130> modify<00:07:02.550> our<00:07:02.580> model<00:07:03.300> and<00:07:03.419> also<00:07:03.479> to<00:07:03.690> add<00:07:03.930> a

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 
to to modify our model and also to add a

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.279 
to to modify our model and also to add a
pose<00:07:04.440> to<00:07:05.220> our<00:07:05.250> characters<00:07:06.120> pose<00:07:06.630> the<00:07:06.870> limbs<00:07:07.050> up

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:07.289 
pose to our characters pose the limbs up

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:09.710 
pose to our characters pose the limbs up
and<00:07:07.500> and<00:07:07.949> we<00:07:08.069> can<00:07:08.190> now<00:07:08.280> add<00:07:08.490> pose<00:07:08.849> presets<00:07:09.479> and

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 
and and we can now add pose presets and

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.990 
and and we can now add pose presets and
use<00:07:10.680> kind<00:07:10.949> of<00:07:11.009> a<00:07:11.069> hierarchy<00:07:11.340> based<00:07:11.639> approach

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 
use kind of a hierarchy based approach

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.820 
use kind of a hierarchy based approach
with<00:07:12.180> our<00:07:12.300> joints<00:07:12.630> and<00:07:12.780> so<00:07:13.229> we'll<00:07:13.380> take<00:07:13.530> a<00:07:13.560> look

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:13.830 
with our joints and so we'll take a look

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.300 
with our joints and so we'll take a look
at<00:07:14.009> that<00:07:14.220> process<00:07:14.610> in<00:07:14.789> the<00:07:14.970> next<00:07:15.120> lesson
