lighting<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.779> if<00:00:27.869> I'd<00:00:28.050> relied<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
lighting and if I'd relied on the

have<00:00:30.779> got<00:00:30.960> it

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
have got it

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.200 
have got it
instead<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.600> got<00:00:33.750> something<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.200> this

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
instead I have got something like this

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.880 
instead I have got something like this
or<00:00:36.350> depending<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> settings<00:00:38.010> maybe<00:00:38.370> this

Auto<00:00:40.890> metering<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.730> an<00:00:41.879> excellent<00:00:42.270> idea<00:00:42.739> but

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
you can rely on it only so far and when

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.279 
you can rely on it only so far and when
