00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 many girls I hope you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.020
 I'll find you today 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.790
 for a video review on a small package 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.550
 gift that I received from a 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.799
 friend of belgium friend kim we see 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.450
 quite regularly small parcels 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.890
 with gasoline products and that's 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.560
 that here in France I have a lot of trouble 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.930
 find gasoline products so that's it 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.600
 I wanted to introduce them and here 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.800
 I thank her once again for 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.140
 for its products there are also 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.179
 other products that are not of the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.769
 brand essence but hey I'm going 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.090
 start with the products and meaning 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.130
 since I know it's interesting 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.500
 a lot of people so I had some 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.579
 patches for blackheads so that's getting 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.940
 present like these it's a small 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.940
 pouch that contains three sachets 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.710
 like these and patches to apply so 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.250
 at the level of the areas where you have them 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.649
 black spots 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.180
 so I have not tested them yet but 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.510
 I would tell you if they are good or not 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.879
 since I use those of dell 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.189
 ermine and frankly I can not find them 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.250
 tip Top 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.280
 so here is to see with it not mascara 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.400
 so that's mascara and their extreme 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.790
 volume which is like those that I have 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.380
 used today we saw you I 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.939
 think it's pretty good 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.920
 I use in this tutorial so I do not know 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.650
 if you will have the tutorial before or after 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.850
 review frankly I find it very very 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.930
 well he has a huge brush I do not know 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.509
 if you are going to realize the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.280
 cut 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.670
 that's about my eye 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.590
 you see the size and at the beginning I got 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.360
 a little bit scared because here's a 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.060
 big brush like that I thought I 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.890
 fuck all over and not at all 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.960
 end is rather simple to use 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.210
 it wraps them well if there is no 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.240
 need to spend a lot of times to 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.210
 have this result there so I'm 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.630
 really very happy then a gloss 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.050
 from the xxxl shine collection 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.119
 so it's a transparent pink gloss 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.119
 with lots of little glitter 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:22.360
 so that's the hue 14 the bubble beghi 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.160
 So here is to wear it all alone if you 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.890
 want a little glossy effect on 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.650
 lips and also carried over 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.980
 a lipstick to give a side 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:38.769
 glossy and glittery that's what it gives 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:43.269
 at the swatch level then I had a 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:47.440
 kajal pencil like this so that's the 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:50.320
 tint 15 turns of steyn sorry for 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.750
 the English accent which is actually a 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.480
 kind of anthracite gray a little 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.730
 metallic which is really very pretty 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.970
 and I find that to make smoky or 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:06.970
 makeup smoking it's going to be fair 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:08.620
 perfect in addition it is super creamy and 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.720
 fades very well the last 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.070
 products and senses that I received it's a 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:19.360
 this tales of day language lastic eye shadow 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.650
 so just a cream blush that 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.370
 is like this so it's just 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.070
 magnificent 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.489
 it's a color that I love so it's 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.680
 a mix between blue and purple 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.799
 leave again it's really a very 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.680
 very pretty color that is just 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:40.630
 magnificent 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.549
 and it's very well pigmented here at 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:47.260
 swatch level you see I like 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.660
 a lot it's blush cream are just 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.640
 splendid 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.670
 so that was the products 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.910
 essence and then I received a gloss 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.740
 that I also wear is a gloss of 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.990
 in 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.200
 ibl in new york so i did not find any 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:08.520
 hue so sealed sensational color 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.410
 crime gloss here I am about the 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.570
 lips that I find really very very 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.220
 beautiful so I'll still do you 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.220
 a swatch 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.600
 and the last product and that is 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.610
 really a big crush it's a 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:35.080
 palette that looks like this so 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.080
 I will show you more closely 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.240
 so it's a palette that comes from 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.840
 turkey and lighthouses are just 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.150
 splendid these are metal headlights 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.880
 they are just sublime super pigmented 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.530
 these are creamy lighthouses so this does not 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.670
 are not at all flagship powder them 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.070
 who will fall 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.900
 I used one also for my 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.420
 tutorial which is the white I wear in 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.250
 what internal and you see it's very 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.290
 very bright metal so I'm going 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:08.390
 still do you swatch I'll 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:10.070
 start with the first four here 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.550
 who are like these and you see 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.650
 finally, but pigmentation 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.960
 is awesome the colors are beautiful 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.450
 and I do not have a base below 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.460
 there is really nothing for the 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.910
 do even more pop and so here they are 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.280
 are really splendid 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:34.750
 Then I'll go to you 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.750
 four here is the swatch 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.960
 frankly I love it and they are 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:45.230
 scented it looks like it smells scent 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.950
 500 just too good and then the 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:53.360
 last four so that's it 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:55.220
 So that's what it gives this level 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:00.170
 pigmentation there is really nothing to say 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:02.710
 at metallic reflections level such end 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.860
 here I really find this palette 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.810
 sublime 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.280
 So here I am really looking forward to you 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.450

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.980
 am a fan of flashy colors and 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.680
 metal headlights so frankly I 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.360
 I am delighted more as I told you 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.010
 it's a cream texture so it's 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.040
 really super easy headlights to 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.660
