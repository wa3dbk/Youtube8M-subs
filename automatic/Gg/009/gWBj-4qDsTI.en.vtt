00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.420 
three to six months to a year even and
I'm<00:02:57.810> banking<00:02:58.810> on<00:02:58.989> probably<00:02:59.739> three<00:03:00.040> months

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
till like the outside is um you know

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.610 
till like the outside is um you know
nice<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.090> healed<00:03:04.510> but<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.110> heal<00:03:05.319> from<00:03:05.440> the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
nice and healed but you heal from the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.229 
nice and healed but you heal from the
outside<00:03:06.010> in<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:06.489> three<00:03:06.760> months<00:03:06.940> for<00:03:07.180> the

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
outside in so three months for the
