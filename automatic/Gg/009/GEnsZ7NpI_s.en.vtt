00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.350
 this one 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.450
 it's the first game of it 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.620
 season for design and so are the fans 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.360
 dissolves en masse 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.160
 although those fans don't know what to do 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.139
 think of the coming season 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.269
 sir but I ask 2 questions about it 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.480
 what the coming season for antwerps 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.060
 will bring with that hopefully brings one 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.740
 traveling but I have no reason to 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.019
 of course there hope for the best 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.939
 via torfs supporter 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.099
 I don't think it's normal anymore 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.740
 the best hopes 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.660
 their oh how such a separate wait is also 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.100
 what is doing on the field and that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.920
 almost yields acid 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.420
 fortunately chances row do not benefit the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.860
 home team tries why the sheet 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.450
 to pull himself in but in the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.739
 in the first half it doesn't get any further than 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.379
 some long shots 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.059
 at half time it is therefore 0 0 after the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.649
 break is going to throw football higher 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.629
 with the necessary risks 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.820
 vansteenkiste I can find it on 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.680
 cool only fall manifest on a penalty kick 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.020
 for cells 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.410
 stefan certifeye loose at 0 for the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.410
 visitors 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.030
 that is the sign for antwerp with being 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.500
 all to pull forward though it is 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.270
 wait a few minutes before time 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.410
 when joren dom takes the ball and 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.330
 pretty inside stairs 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.530
 a the discharge in the forest already 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.530
 stadium is huge 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.530
 it stays with that one a coach 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.930
 Richard Bows call his boys with 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.550
 one after the market together in the center circle 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.760
 and he threw a heart among boys 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.760
 Belt 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.260
 Brussels 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.460
 had 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.259
 required 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.880
 it was not like I thought because 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.880
 in the preparation explanation the idea we 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.260
 we are a little further but physical 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.340
 we are considering it in there in the fall 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.869
 at least what I want because you see it 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.040
 so on the 211 that you still have an honor of it 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.150
 who make an anchor and yes unfortunately it is 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.580
 become 1st 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.920
 qualitatively not yet today 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.080
 not super clear but not super 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.149
 but I think we do think 90 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.860
 fought like lions and for minutes 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.489
 and also received a reward 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.140
 with tycho and yes also a reasonable one 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.700
 meager rewards because only one 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.700
 draw is very happy if
