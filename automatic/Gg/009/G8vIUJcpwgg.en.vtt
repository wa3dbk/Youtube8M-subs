 vehicle of my course and I'm going to 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:54.559
 teleport in from three men have 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:56.089
 denied or the crate I had trusted him 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.640
 you remember in the first twenty minutes 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.899
 I had entrusted my employee and the visit 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.249
 park as he could I believe that 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.059
 that have views are beautifully our 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:03.710
 thoughts on intelligence 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.760
 artificial 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.110
 it's very pretty it's very good 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.430
 modeled and even shaded effects and 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.479
 lights we are very happy it's very 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.350
 happy except that he's still parked 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.820
 in a tree except he is 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.280
 completely planted so how are we going 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.799
 to do tell me you're fine you can not 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.750
 move otherwise I'm buggy to death 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.009
 agrees so I'll reset 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.619
 they are not crazy developers they 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.969
 know well that 's planters they are 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.390
 conscious here's I click on the 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.090
 vehicle 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.299
 and there , miracle magic is enough 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.369
 come back to our farm at it to me wade 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.829
 put it in the middle of the other vehicles 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.750
 reset everything here ah yes 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.130
 since he's also going to last thing 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.479
 reset and renault what 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.930
 we are interested in planting 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.090
 potatoes 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.859
 so we go get the dibble to 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.729
 potatoes and yes because I need you 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.170
 look for your little one each time 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.750
 the little utensil you have but here you go 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.500
 so I filled them in but 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.119
 at the beginning it is empty 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.009
 ok you see the potato rentiers 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.780
 the more I see it is magnificent 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.399
 let's go then I fill them for not 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.200
 that we waste time but against this 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.310
 what is needed is that we have it so she 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.100
 we are going to tdc there by course 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.659
 olalala nago named well sorry I 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.350
 never driven tractors of his life 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.820
 that's what you want 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.230
 speak by israel 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.760
 so there you will tell me is there 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.470
 not a little thing that will interfere 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.849
 I make you targeted by the fact that your 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.260
 Container ask four is one of 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.620
 rare things they're caught in 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.010
 count in in farming physics 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.040
 simulator 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.689
 yes it is indeed the weight of 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.680
 in the show we do not care 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.299
 trailer weights 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.970
 yes so what do we do when we 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.610
 has a trailer too heavy yes and 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.799
 well already we slip and not a little 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.450
 ipad where we go into total spin 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.670
 the apartment henry so what are we going 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.140
 do we go to all 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.799
 vehicles 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.359
 roddy darragon is still hard 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.590
 to go planting potatoes not the la 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.030
 like that it's not going to be easy 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.980
 again we go back to a little 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.709
 in the freestyle danger skate if I 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.849
 commit my cruise control then 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.230
 you have to go slowly for good 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.159
 hung the ground and as we can 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.030
 obviously not work in these 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.310
 conditions what are we going to do 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.579
 yeah what all the farmers do 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.810
 we will hang a weight 1 cm in front 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.889
 yeah that's a small event 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.780
 random you see he tells us that the 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.230
 wheat has risen sharply in such a 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.389
 establishment 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.500
 ah yes okay so that's nice 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:22.560
 so the here a weight I roll on it 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.750
 always serves it's class here and 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.519
 I had it I go the job and got 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.829
 attached here we are almost no press 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.349
 go there tirlicien touch that that I 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.970
 tied and now I attach the other 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.799
 that's it and have alerted our paws is 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.239
 alas you are stabilizing these woods yes everything 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.799
 in fact so I see the difference when 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.430
 even sailing and yes but here at 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.840
 attacks go softly mean I 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.160
 think I took a tractor a little 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.590
 not fast for this kind of work I 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.879
 think if these cars and who knows 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.639
 very well I put the life regulator 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:53.160
 where it goes almost minimum and we're going 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:56.060
 plant our potatoes so new feature in 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.060
 France and news 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.879
 yes yes I know it's a bone that you 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.840
 plants that precisely I notice when 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.150
 I can seem to be enthusiastic 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.440
 before the new feature in question in 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.470
 case now it's great it's 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.829
 shameful sets to nothing we arrive in 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.169
 the field here and here is a tool a 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:17.430
 uncomplicated so we will first go down 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:19.159
 the plant heusy dakar he activated the 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.190
 plant and tech 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:23.729
 here we put the cruise control and 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.909
 let's go 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.680
 and here we plant our potatoes well played 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:33.050
 beautiful life sir to gorgeous 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.430
 flew away yeah that's because you're a 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.139
 farmer style and I am style and 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.039
 I have here I confess 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.940
 am so cynical I want to put in 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.960
 forbidden view it's a bit of a mixture 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.770
 between jose bovÃ© and jean paul gaultier 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.319
 it's all you and does not look 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.120
 the impression of being there of course of course 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.440
 that I feel like there and mine 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.599
 nothing management level is interesting 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.270
 I understand at the management level that the 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:56.310
 game is successful your form and your 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.750
 franc the game was rated including 11 out of 20 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.150
 power it's a bad note going 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.930
 hide it hip hop but that could 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.479
 to be a slaughter 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.669
 that could be for the in 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.919
 the occurrence is a good game that is worth 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.110
 really nothing for turning them 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.909
 neophytes needed for the ten years 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.289
 who know nothing yeah a game 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.210
 on the other hand there is no better for 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.169
 the moment for farmers 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.669
 virtual ie those who love 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.169
 manage like that a farm 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.969
 it is true that it is very complicated 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.949
 saw it at the level of gear at the level 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.139
 water planted a lot of things in little 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.969
 good we can play several to 10 it's 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.039
 still not nothing what's true 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:30.150
 I'll have your farm with friends 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.099
 really super nice when you see a 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.860
 in the reaper the other bringing 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.210
 the trailer and these sites is caught in 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.560
 the thing that can be great and in the 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.400
 thing is super super like yeah 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.259
 by the way yesterday I was wondering a 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.219
 worker so 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.199
 suppose it's a player 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.550
 but ask a worker here 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.199
 take over me for now I 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.099
 go get my reaper I know that 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:52.139
 no interest but it was for you 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:54.240
 show weaver click here at puy a 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.560
 is a pretty rotten I like and that in 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.449
 interior view I admit that I feel 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.590
 really overpowered but the impression 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.790
 to be the master of the world is your 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.180
 game and not just pears 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.920
 madam and you make me fall I reap and 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.230
 here it is I am like that it is 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.780
 and watch live law 101 it's 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.950
 beautiful it's not beautiful it's beautiful 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.080
 it's very good and it's a little 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.890
 faded there I do not know what they're going 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.820
 to eat is who it does not take it 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.590
 take that what is like here and you 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.260
 see my worker passing by bird 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.670
 it's still awesome at 10 and to say 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.170
 true player since times and we can 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.120
 play up to 10 at the same time 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.740
 yeah that can be super 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.810
 nice after of course it's a 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.310
 simulation, here we have to have a lot 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.720
 of imagination you do not have to be 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.250
 picky about realism 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.230
 it's not necessary there's so much 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.850
 things to fix but hey we can 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.590
 to accommodate starting with the balance 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.570
 precisely that you say the balance of 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.560
 limit missions you can not do 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.980
 the issue 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.560
 if you decide the show you will have to 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.630
 the plan that will galerate fearfully 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.710
 already implanted a veil and more like 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.230
 you said there are modes so there is a 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.669
 followed anyway to keep a lot of 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.889
 fashion and it's true that I'm worth year on 20
