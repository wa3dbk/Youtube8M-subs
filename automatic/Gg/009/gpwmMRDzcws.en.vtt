00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 have a word about coming back here 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.480
 we know you made your pro debut at 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.799
 saint brieuc coming back to play 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.580
 here before my eyes the france team in 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.410
 brittany that's what 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.759
 it's warm to the heart it's true that a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.320
 Breton time it's always 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.690
 pleasure to come back to his region 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.949
 of origin is always a pride of 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.359
 come back here and then besides with the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.010
 jersey of the France team I hope 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.029
 that there will be a good match and that 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.619
 will bring pleasure to people 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.330
 especially since the stake he is 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.590
 important for this game we sat 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.570
 you win it's qualification 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.130
 that's the goal at your fingertips 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.599
 it's true that we have two left 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.969
 matches you have to win one of the two 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.890
 play at home against ireland so we 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.390
 want to in front of our audience to win 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.800
 this match precisely to be qualified 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.460
 you expect what atmosphere 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.110
 Saturday 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.820
 here at the roudourou you have an idea of 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.100
 what can happen? 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.750
 I expect a stadium rather well 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.820
 filled and it's true that in general and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.739
 the Bretons answer present I was 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.789
 came to play last year with lyon in 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.110
 championship against guingamp there was 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.219
 twelve thousand spectators so I hope 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.140
 with the team of France we will do 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.969
 a closed counter in any case it's 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.370
 the goal and after on the ground one 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.539
 will do everything to make the public 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.539
 the goal is the qualification it is 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.949
 almost done after for the for the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.390
 competition itself for the euro-2013 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.710
 what are the ambitions of the team 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.299
 now we know that the competition 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.470
 was rather favorable for the team 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.210
 France now I imagine what 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.680
 lack it's a title of course it's 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.090
 true that we finished twice fourth at 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.770
 the world cup and the games so a 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.689
 moment we want to get on the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.880
 podium and I think at the euro to 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.500
 the team will be even more 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.420
 better is even more experience on 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.979
 gained experience during these 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.439
 last final stages and we want 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.390
 of a title and the quality for after one 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.710
 will give everything this year already for 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.600
 to prepare well 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.460
 upon arrival to the euro in form and in 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.049
 winning something just after 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.490
 its Olympic games where the team has 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.229
 illustrated is what you feel around 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.880
 of you he may have more attention and 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.080
 it's the audience reacts differently 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.720
 did you say it felt like 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.520
 this yeah after the euro after the cut of the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.020
 world too it was the case that it was 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.310
 the geo the world cup the cup of the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.050
 world already have really discovered the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.080
 women's football since it was enough 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.090
 unknown and the games we confirmed our 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.640
 fourth place we would have liked to do 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.229
 better but then it's sport and it's 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.550
 sure that more and more expectations of the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.350
 part of the public because we are part 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.729
 of the world's best nations and all 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.470
 the matches we have to be efficient 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.060
 but any case as I said we get 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:15.260
 prepares for to make each time the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.260
 maximum and gives a beautiful copy here
