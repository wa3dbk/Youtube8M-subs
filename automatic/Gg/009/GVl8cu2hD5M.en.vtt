 Hello, how are you? I am lupita 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.480
 welcome to my channel today 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.470
 let's prepare a delicious ice cream 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.210
 coconut we're going to need a cup of coconut 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.600
 grated 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.750
 a liter of base for ice cream remember 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.269
 that this base we already have in the channel 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.010
 so I'm going to leave you down the link 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.760
 so you can watch the video 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.040
 to make this ice cream base 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.860
 we are also going to need a spoonful 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.670
 of concentrate or coconut extract and 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.759
 well let's start by putting our 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.619
 base for ice cream in the blender and let's go 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.619
 to beat until you double your volume 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.070
 let's beat it 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.880
 here we will wait until you double your 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.460
 volume to be able to add what is the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.460
 Coconut concentrate and grated coconut 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.990
 Here we see how our cream started 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.360
 to double its volume so now we're going 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.360
 to add what is the grated coconut 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.150
 and we are also going to add the extract or 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.150
 coconut concentrate 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.200
 let's pay for our blender 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.370
 and we're going to empty our ice cream to a 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.060
 container 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.850
 aluminum or plastic and we 're going to 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.430
 take to the freezer for a past hour 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.170
 that time we're going to take it out we're going to 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.710
 to beat again in a punch 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.990
 freezer our coconut ice cream 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.990
 and well that's how it is 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:30.069
 we already did the whole procedure this 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.319
 Take it out every hour and beat it for 6 times 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.920
 so now we're going to serve our 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.920
 coconut ice cream 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.890
 well, that's how we have stayed in our 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.200
 coconut ice cream as you can see 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.370
 they are ice creams that are really 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.340
 easy to elaborate and are totally 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.420
 home remember all is the same 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.580
 procedure freeze an hour take out 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.500
 beat return to the freezer another hour 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.110
 and so on 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.200
