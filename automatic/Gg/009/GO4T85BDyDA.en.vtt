AI detract villagers and walk through
the<00:01:10.260> trapdoors<00:01:11.540> so<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.930> kill<00:01:13.320> them<00:01:13.470> using<00:01:13.920> a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the trapdoors so I can kill them using a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.190 
the trapdoors so I can kill them using a
blinder<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:16.280> it<00:01:17.280> will<00:01:17.490> produce<00:01:17.759> mob<00:01:18.570> essence

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
blinder and it will produce mob essence

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.630 
blinder and it will produce mob essence
and<00:01:19.439> give<00:01:20.040> me<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:21.030> items<00:01:21.540> back<00:01:22.110> as<00:01:22.470> long<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.520> I

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and give me the items back as long as I

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.730 
and give me the items back as long as I
give<00:01:23.880> me<00:01:24.000> energy

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
give me energy

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.050 
give me energy
the<00:01:25.740> mob<00:01:25.979> essence<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:27.470> transported<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.430> auto

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the mob essence is transported to a auto

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.390 
the mob essence is transported to a auto
spawner<00:01:30.570> which<00:01:31.020> works<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.740> like<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.920> spawner

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
spawner which works just like a spawner

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.899 
spawner which works just like a spawner
that<00:01:33.150> will<00:01:33.299> spawn<00:01:33.659> mobs<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:35.220> define<00:01:35.610> in

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
that will spawn mobs that you define in

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.010 
that will spawn mobs that you define in
this<00:01:36.479> case<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.619> new<00:01:38.070> skeleton<00:01:38.400> here<00:01:39.020> so

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
this case I have a new skeleton here so

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.170 
this case I have a new skeleton here so
to<00:01:40.530> spawn<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.950> wither<00:01:41.159> skeleton<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.939> need<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
to spawn the wither skeleton you need to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.410 
to spawn the wither skeleton you need to
make<00:01:42.329> an<00:01:42.479> exact<00:01:42.899> copy<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:44.090> existing<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.299> your

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
make an exact copy of existing with your

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.569 
make an exact copy of existing with your
skeleton<00:01:45.899> otherwise<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.710> will<00:01:46.950> spawn<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
skeleton otherwise it will spawn a

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.210 
skeleton otherwise it will spawn a
normal<00:01:48.060> skeleton<00:01:48.689> then<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.890> give<00:01:50.070> it

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
normal skeleton then you have to give it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.249 
normal skeleton then you have to give it
more<00:01:50.399> essence<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.119> energy<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:54.049> when<00:01:55.049> you

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
more essence and energy and when you

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.120 
more essence and energy and when you
stop<00:01:55.740> Givens<00:01:56.729> redstone<00:01:57.659> signal<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.590> it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
stop Givens redstone signal to it it

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.039 
stop Givens redstone signal to it it
will<00:01:59.310> start<00:01:59.610> working<00:01:59.969> as<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.659> said<00:02:00.899> as<00:02:01.020> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
will start working as I said as a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.100 
will start working as I said as a
spawner<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.340> need<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.729> encase<00:02:03.060> an<00:02:03.390> area<00:02:03.960> of

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
spawner so you need to encase an area of

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.069 
spawner so you need to encase an area of
8<00:02:04.619> by<00:02:04.920> 8<00:02:05.219> at<00:02:05.490> least<00:02:05.520> around<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.420> that's<00:02:06.780> why<00:02:07.049> I

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
8 by 8 at least around it that's why I

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.400 
8 by 8 at least around it that's why I
have<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.409> glass<00:02:07.890> here<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.899> they<00:02:09.899> will<00:02:10.080> start

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
have this glass here and they will start

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.459 
have this glass here and they will start
spawning

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:12.469 
spawning

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:20.690 
spawning
so<00:02:13.879> when<00:02:14.879> this<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.299> off<00:02:16.109> I<00:02:17.239> am<00:02:18.709> letting<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:20.040> timer

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
so when this is off I am letting a timer

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.890 
so when this is off I am letting a timer
run<00:02:21.650> which<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:22.920> letting<00:02:23.700> these<00:02:24.120> autonomous

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
run which is letting these autonomous

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.240 
run which is letting these autonomous
activator<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:26.609> give<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> left<00:02:27.900> click<00:02:28.200> on<00:02:29.069> the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
activator to give a left click on the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.670 
activator to give a left click on the
first<00:02:29.579> slot<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.390> its<00:02:30.689> inventory<00:02:31.019> which<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.650> a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
first slot of its inventory which is a

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.210 
first slot of its inventory which is a
cleaver<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:33.030> it's<00:02:33.180> basically<00:02:34.010> heating<00:02:35.010> them

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
cleaver so it's basically heating them

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.580 
cleaver so it's basically heating them
with<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.909> cleaver<00:02:36.299> so<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.290> cleaver

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
with this cleaver so the cleaver

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.009 
with this cleaver so the cleaver
naturally<00:02:38.459> have<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.879> be<00:02:39.000> heading<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.659> I<00:02:39.870> add

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
naturally have to be heading and I add

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.809 
naturally have to be heading and I add
five<00:02:40.470> more<00:02:40.500> levels<00:02:41.099> of<00:02:41.189> beheading<00:02:41.670> and

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
five more levels of beheading and

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.289

if<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.370> turn<00:02:51.359> the<00:02:52.169> farm<00:02:52.500> off<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:54.510> there<00:02:54.659> are

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
still some skeletons there you need to

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.500 
still some skeletons there you need to
let<00:02:57.209> their<00:02:57.419> timer<00:02:57.870> run<00:02:58.290> again<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:59.669> that's<00:03:00.359> why

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
let their timer run again so that's why

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.409 
let their timer run again so that's why
I<00:03:00.540> have<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.900> pressure<00:03:01.200> plate<00:03:01.560> here<00:03:01.889> that<00:03:02.419> will

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
I have the pressure plate here that will

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:08.240 
I have the pressure plate here that will
let<00:03:03.599> the<00:03:03.780> timer<00:03:04.310> continually<00:03:05.569> click<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:07.250> use

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
let the timer continually click and use

the<00:03:14.519> only<00:03:14.700> downside<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:16.049> that<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:17.370> may<00:03:17.849> run
