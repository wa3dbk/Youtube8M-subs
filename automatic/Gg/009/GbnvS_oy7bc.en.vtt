trick tip because I've made one in a

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.950 
trick tip because I've made one in a
while<00:00:05.100> because<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.759> you<00:00:06.210> know<00:00:06.359> being<00:00:06.540> sick<00:00:06.899> and

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
while because of you know being sick and

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.100 
while because of you know being sick and
the<00:00:07.410> weather<00:00:07.589> in<00:00:07.830> school<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.220> all<00:00:08.340> that<00:00:09.019> but<00:00:10.019> I

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
the weather in school and all that but I

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.830 
the weather in school and all that but I
couldn't<00:00:10.410> land<00:00:10.590> anything<00:00:11.130> at<00:00:11.280> all<00:00:11.540> so<00:00:12.540> because

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
couldn't land anything at all so because

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.200 
couldn't land anything at all so because
I've<00:00:13.110> been<00:00:13.139> pretty<00:00:13.950> bad<00:00:14.099> mood<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.670> figured

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
I've been pretty bad mood I figured

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.880 
I've been pretty bad mood I figured
that'd<00:00:15.360> be<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> good<00:00:15.750> time<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.020> review<00:00:16.379> Hawk

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
that'd be a good time to review Hawk

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
completely done for I've already weren't

completely done for I've already weren't
a<00:00:39.870> hole<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.530> sock<00:00:41.000> because<00:00:42.590> this<00:00:43.590> hole<00:00:43.800> was

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
a hole in a sock because this hole was

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.310 
a hole in a sock because this hole was
completely<00:00:44.340> gone<00:00:44.940> through<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.600> shoe<00:00:46.760> I<00:00:48.320> should

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
completely gone through a shoe I should

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.720 
completely gone through a shoe I should
have<00:00:49.379> known<00:00:49.559> buying<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.309> probably<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.640> bad

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
have known buying this is probably a bad

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.090 
have known buying this is probably a bad
idea<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> first<00:00:51.300> place<00:00:51.559> but<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.800> don't<00:00:53.010> have

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
idea in the first place but I don't have

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.240 
idea in the first place but I don't have
you<00:00:53.219> skate<00:00:53.489> shops<00:00:53.730> around<00:00:53.969> here<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.129> want

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
you skate shops around here so if I want

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.220 
you skate shops around here so if I want
to<00:00:56.370> actually<00:00:56.520> try<00:00:56.789> something<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.300> before<00:00:58.199> I

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
to actually try something on before I

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.869 
to actually try something on before I
buy<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.829> got<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.160> be<00:00:59.250> either<00:00:59.460> hawk<00:00:59.850> or

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
buy it it's got to be either hawk or

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.529 
buy it it's got to be either hawk or
vans<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.980> I<00:01:01.980> never<00:01:02.670> been<00:01:02.879> too<00:01:03.030> impressed<00:01:03.390> by

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
vans and I never been too impressed by

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.980 
vans and I never been too impressed by
vans<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.530> figured<00:01:04.860> I'd<00:01:05.010> give<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.610> try<00:01:05.990> but

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
vans so I figured I'd give it a try but

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.960 
vans so I figured I'd give it a try but
you<00:01:07.890> don't<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.220> need<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.549> do<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.700> for

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
you don't really need to do that for

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.620 
you don't really need to do that for
yourself<00:01:09.290> these<00:01:10.850> they're<00:01:11.850> pretty<00:01:12.119> much<00:01:12.180> gone

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
yourself these they're pretty much gone

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.560 
yourself these they're pretty much gone
already<00:01:13.790> I'm<00:01:14.790> probably<00:01:14.939> going<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.299> put<00:01:15.450> some

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
already I'm probably going to put some

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.320 
already I'm probably going to put some
sugar<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:16.049> there<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.590> try<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.970> salvage<00:01:17.970> them

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
sugar on there and try to salvage them

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.410 
sugar on there and try to salvage them
for<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> little<00:01:19.020> while<00:01:19.400> but<00:01:20.400> they<00:01:21.000> didn't<00:01:21.270> last

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
for a little while but they didn't last

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.890 
for a little while but they didn't last
nearly<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:21.900> long<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.850> most<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.210> most<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.780> those

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
nearly as long as most of most of those

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.890 
nearly as long as most of most of those
shoes<00:01:25.080> I've<00:01:25.259> had<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.939> best<00:01:26.970> shoes<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.509> had<00:01:27.689> our

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
shoes I've had the best shoes I had our

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.649 
shoes I've had the best shoes I had our
savior<00:01:28.409> which<00:01:28.590> it'll<00:01:29.100> make<00:01:29.400> anymore<00:01:32.659> but

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
savior which it'll make anymore but

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.940 
savior which it'll make anymore but
pretty<00:01:33.990> much<00:01:34.049> anything<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:36.560> is<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.860> to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
pretty much anything you get is going to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.609 
pretty much anything you get is going to
do<00:01:38.040> better<00:01:38.250> than<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.750> I'd<00:01:40.200> stay<00:01:40.590> away

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
do better than this so I'd stay away

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.700 
do better than this so I'd stay away
from<00:01:40.829> these<00:01:41.100> guys<00:01:45.079> like<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.229> said<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.500> haven't

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
from these guys like I said I haven't

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.770 
from these guys like I said I haven't
been<00:01:46.890> doing<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.189> many<00:01:47.490> flip<00:01:47.790> tricks<00:01:48.060> but

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
been doing that many flip tricks but

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.440 
been doing that many flip tricks but
today<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.890> trick<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.340> was<00:01:50.790> planning<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.119> doing

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
today the trick I was planning on doing

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
today the trick I was planning on doing
was<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> hard<00:01:51.930> flip<00:01:52.670> at<00:01:53.670> first<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.390> there<00:01:55.320> was

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
was a hard flip at first and there was

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.490 
was a hard flip at first and there was
there<00:01:55.799> was<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.920> small<00:01:56.159> slit<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:57.110> and<00:01:58.110> you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
there was a small slit in there and you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.819 
there was a small slit in there and you
could<00:01:58.649> see<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.909> plastic<00:02:00.719> part<00:02:01.110> but

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
could see this like plastic part but

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.039 
could see this like plastic part but
there<00:02:01.979> was<00:02:02.100> no<00:02:02.280> hole<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:05.009> just<00:02:06.049> all

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049
