was probably like $14 I mean don't quote
me<00:02:11.110> on<00:02:11.140> this<00:02:11.380> I'm<00:02:11.680> just<00:02:11.830> guessing<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:13.570> think

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
me on this I'm just guessing and I think

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.980 
me on this I'm just guessing and I think
this<00:02:14.290> was<00:02:14.590> like<00:02:14.800> sixteen<00:02:15.730> dollars<00:02:16.270> they<00:02:16.720> last

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
this was like sixteen dollars they last

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.750 
this was like sixteen dollars they last
you<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.230> really<00:02:17.320> long<00:02:17.680> time<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:18.460> it's<00:02:18.670> really

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
you a really long time so it's really

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.010 
you a really long time so it's really
worth<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.540> sometimes<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.980> use<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:22.360> oil<00:02:22.660> stuff

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
worth it sometimes I use this oil stuff

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.200 
worth it sometimes I use this oil stuff
I<00:02:23.350> used<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.250> use<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.490> more<00:02:24.640> often<00:02:24.790> but<00:02:25.090> now<00:02:25.180> I

know okay all right so once you're done
with<00:03:51.160> that<00:03:51.220> then<00:03:52.030> I<00:03:52.480> take<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:54.690> I<00:03:55.690> just

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
with that then I take this and I just

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.539 
with that then I take this and I just
spray<00:03:56.140> it<00:03:56.379> a<00:03:56.790> couple<00:03:57.790> of<00:03:57.970> times<00:03:58.269> I<00:03:59.370> try<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.430> get

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
spray it a couple of times I try to get

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.599 
spray it a couple of times I try to get
it<00:04:00.670> on<00:04:00.940> my<00:04:01.420> entire<00:04:01.720> head<00:04:02.190> but<00:04:03.190> don't<00:04:03.220> do<00:04:03.459> too

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
it on my entire head but don't do too

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:04.619 
it on my entire head but don't do too
much<00:04:03.730> because<00:04:03.970> then<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.239> makes<00:04:04.329> your<00:04:04.480> hair

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
much because then it makes your hair

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.050 
much because then it makes your hair
really<00:04:05.079> really<00:04:05.379> damp<00:04:06.010> again<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.670> that's<00:04:06.849> just

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
really really damp again and that's just

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.789 
really really damp again and that's just
frustrating<00:04:07.480> no<00:04:08.319> one<00:04:08.440> wants<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.650> deal<00:04:08.769> with

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
frustrating no one wants to deal with

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.819 
frustrating no one wants to deal with
that<00:04:08.980> then<00:04:10.290> once<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:11.379> put<00:04:11.530> that<00:04:11.560> in<00:04:13.500> sometimes<00:04:14.500> I

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
that then once I put that in sometimes I

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.930 
that then once I put that in sometimes I
will<00:04:14.980> use<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.250> oil<00:04:15.400> not<00:04:15.819> really<00:04:17.280> here's<00:04:18.280> and

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
will use the oil not really here's and

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.210 
will use the oil not really here's and
when<00:04:19.239> I<00:04:19.269> do<00:04:19.389> I<00:04:19.840> only<00:04:20.049> put<00:04:20.880> really<00:04:21.880> small<00:04:22.210> enough

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
when I do I only put really small enough

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:31.530 
when I do I only put really small enough
stuff<00:04:24.220> smells<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:24.820> good<00:04:25.030> like
