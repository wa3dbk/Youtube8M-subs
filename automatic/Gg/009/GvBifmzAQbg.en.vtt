 congress in the zone with them Vary 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.530
 review of the mouse spring in the yard May 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.740
 what reality you yourself went to society 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.000
 shoot there and generally need to take off 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.850
 Alan's tablet review study on the six 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.660
 Lay you need to remove the headphone overview 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.949
 learn to play c. and then ha ha yes she 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.949
 hit the wall before 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.040
 need to remove the laptop review learn 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.660
 play skyrim and confusing we do not care 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.260
 exactly what not to pay attention except 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.809
 like at the moment at 35 seconds 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.899
 well, I guess I didnâ€™t sit and 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.160
 I spend all my free time playing games 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.370
 but understand a good mouse or not I quite 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.070
 capable of shorter in my hands raise where 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.140
 north is one of the most appropriate 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.189
 gaming mice but not at the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.299
 adequate price 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.159
 one of the top razer mice 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.180
 this is one and a half times cheaper than 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.150
 clumsy mamba 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.340
 or for example transformer Ouroboros 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.680
 the price is the same as taipan or foot 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.150
 expert in the region of 100 dollars but with 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.250
 there are only two on it 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.320
 extra buttons and not even buttons 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.509
 switch dipay 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.729
 and it's hard for me to find this explanation in 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.689
 In our case, the mouse is stylized with a print. 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.360
 in world of tanks 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.369
 what fans of the game will appreciate for those whom 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.240
 not drawing black color original 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.670
 dcd 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.799
 By the way there is also a rug in the subject to 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.740
 did you have a complete set and 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.500
 all of you for the look we are briefly about the rug though 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.340
 separately and fail in my hands 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.259
 there is a sleeping version which supposedly 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.329
 better suited for dynamic games 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.250
 but if you also work on 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.930
 computer they just torment the video card 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.210
 all sorts of played probably for you 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.939
 Still, it would be better version of the rug 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.100
 contour normal such kulichik even 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.899
 It seems to be like that around the edges 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.709
 although perhaps this is just such a design 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.140
 generally raiser rugs they 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.030
 durable enough so the money on 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.360
 this rug will certainly not be spent 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.540
 in vain 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.110
 but fans of the game will appreciate the box and 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:29.239
 even get a bonus in the form of a code for gold 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:33.260
 In this your way to the mouse is also some 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:38.360
 to operetta here it seems like they are not written 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:41.239
 But here is seen in short on 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.400
 some very rare tank code here under 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.019
 nakleechka how to develop eat well and 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.799
 Generally back to the mouse itself 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:51.620
 maximum sensor resolution 6 407th 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.329
 weight 105 grams cable length 2 meters 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.910
 cover is kind of like soft touch either 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.130
 something very similar to that in general is not 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.410
 thunders and does not foam on the sides 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.079
 rubberized inserts and glued 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.540
 very reliable even if desired 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.850
 here it is very difficult to tear their hands off 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.519
 mouse is very comfortable by the way mouse 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.709
 just for right handed so if for you 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.530
 it is critical it is better to look at that 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.900
 Pan teflon spoon legs of course if 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.670
 you do what it says 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.859
 robust set hard wheel 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.870
 turns very nice it is massive and 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.840
 embossed who's where that wrote that 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.269
 awful backlash but it has I don't know what's there 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.639
 terrible and nothing at all and your 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.410
 sit plus in order and can be left 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.930
 be to keep the scroll smooth 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.359
 all right, okay 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.019
 holder on the side two buttons that can 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.840
 tune 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.280
 or synapse 20 but appear through the sauce 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.799
 additional features 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.319
 and as I said earlier upstairs no 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.200
 the dipiai toggle buttons so for 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.599
 those who like to use this feature in 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.669
 shooters when shooting a pharmacy mouse is not 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.500
 either leave yourself al on 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:00.260
 side buttons wheel on the logo on 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.269
 mouse shine by the way until you connect 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.430
 logo practical video in general 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.920
 the mouse is great and unless of course 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.709
 take into account the lack of a toggle button 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.340
 myself and for that i will just leave 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.140
 giant minus mouse very very 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.169
 comfortable in shape to 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.500
 I personally find here very comfortable things 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.070
 special bends under the side fingers 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.409
 inserts 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.539
 very wear-resistant they create very 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:28.099
 pleasant and comfortable feeling even 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.890
 very long time working at the computer 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:33.500
 and it seems to me that the price is a little night 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.320
 manipulator is overpriced even if its 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.849
 compare the same taypanov where the sensor 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.099
 better and 2 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:42.830
 where more extra buttons here 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.180
 the question is probably the taste and comfort of each 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.250
 the individual so that that 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.360
 like exactly you write in 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:58.210
 comments oh yes for an hour hello ramin 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:58.210
 Colic or Kaliki beautiful inside 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:04.290
 see coming to us a guest i do 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.639

 pancakes spring but already started so well 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.210

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:37.480
 I also brought you friends to the USSR 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:42.660

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:45.419
 did him a striptease and pain in exchange for 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:52.380
 all-metal tablet 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:52.380
 banned we unravel that Russian
