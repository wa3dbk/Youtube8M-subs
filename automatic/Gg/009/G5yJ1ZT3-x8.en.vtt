00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.350
 continue for you at ifa 2014 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.300
 on the way and turn now to the 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.810
 focus on laptops and notebooks 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.279
 to 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.590
 There it has a particularly exciting 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.450
 development given for this year 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.980
 there are the first models with the intel 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.500
 to see the core processor 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.329
 Intel Core Processors became specific 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.220
 consume developed for tablets 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.329
 however, much less energy is available 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.329
 much more powerful 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.350
 toshiba is in the tablet and notebook 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.749
 area with two novelties on the ifa 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.659
 2010 came in my hand I have 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:05.869
 the toshiba by the fireplace is a 7 inches 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:08.600
 tablet with windows 8.1 installs it 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.990
 is 350 grams light and eleven millimeters 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.830
 thin 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.630
 I'll tell it is very handy fits 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.250
 great in a hand on the back 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.899
 Rear plastic camera camera 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.539
 otherwise you have below a 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.549
 loudspeaker that one can namely quite 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.429
 well, you recognize the loud above 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:32.720
 softly click a slot for the micro sd 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:35.959
 and for the structure on the page here 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.170
 the on and off switch is the tablet 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:43.149
 to go with a gigabyte ram and have one 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.149
 battery life of about seven hours 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.150
 Notebook area is an exciting one 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.560
 new chromebook from toshiba toshiba 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.600
 Chromebook 2 is available in two 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.630
 equipment variants we also here 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.420
 both see and there are once the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.670
 Variant both 13 inches but once with 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.570
 a hd screen is matte and 2 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.970
 gb ram 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.760
 while the slightly more expensive probably 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.600
 so 50 euro more expensive variant a full hd 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.650
 has shiny display and 4 gb ram 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.720
 otherwise it is like here 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.830
 chromebooks usual is chrome os 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:22.760
 installed and both devices are 19 mm 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.800
 thin and weigh about 1300 grams like that 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.630
 means they are about 200 grams lighter 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.730
 as the predecessor they are thinner than 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.910
 the predecessor and in total in the measure 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.530
 slimmer won so for people in the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.030
 second notebook need a lot 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.740
 it's actually on the way 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.020
 really an interesting device though 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.790
 Now photoshop or similar things 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.630
 want to do with it then you come here 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.630
 absolutely to the limits 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.040
 sony also has one at ifa 2014 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.730
 be brought with tablet and indeed 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.900
 very first 8 inch tablet with android 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.770
 I have that sony here in hand 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.470
 xperia z3 tablet compact did by the 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.810
 Pretty much the same 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.760
 equipment like the sony xperia z3 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.790
 smartphone means we have here 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.500
 a balcony snapdragon 801 processor 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.300
 with 2 5 ghz kartakt cheater at 3 and 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.220
 16 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.810
 also an adreno 330 cpu display 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.010
 of course bigger 8 inches with one 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.760
 resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.200
 that is 283 ppi is a bit sharper 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.260
 as his big brother 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.040
 and it is currently the lightest 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.120
 as well as the narrowest 8 inch tablet that 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.280
 is in the market 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.920
 I'll show it as it really is 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.069
 very thin 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.610
 is accordingly say well in hand say 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.069
 me once 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.050
 because the edges are a bit fast 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.500
 already a cut in my little one 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.630
 finger 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.550
 it is still a Lte variant 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.599
 give exactly when it comes is still 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.120
 not really clear 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.060
 otherwise it is certainly for people 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.140
 the so a tablet in the central displays 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.010
 search segment 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.520
 In any case, a meaningful 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.520
 investment 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:24.070
 In my hand, I just hold it 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.320
 ifa 2014 presented lenovo thinkpad 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.110
 helix the special thing is it 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.720
 Reminds me quite a different way from Lenovo Yoga 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.180
 different modes is but 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.810
 Finally, a tablet with a 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.810
 keyboard 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.420
 the thinkpad helix has a 11 6 inch 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.610
 display with full hd resolution and im 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.040
 inner runs the new intel core 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.540
 Processor especially for tablets 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.450
 was developed because he is very 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.240
 powerful and yet used up 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.320
 the little energy for tablets so to speak 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.370
 the latest from the 9th 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:06.100
 and there is a 4gb and 8gb variant 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.900
 As far as the internal memory is concerned, one has 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.150
 many different possibilities 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.060
 what's even more interesting is this 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.850
 also as 3g or 4 gb variant 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:20.640
 give and it is in itself if you have it 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.640
 Just look at it without the keyboard 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.490
 Is it for 1 11 inch tablet I think 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.490
 quite light and fits well in the hand 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.360
 yes it has its new at ifa 2014 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.430
 brought convertible and that he 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.500
 13 convertible and the special here 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.900
 we can already see the display 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.600
 with this shania that means you can 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.630
 the display as you want 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.360
 Anwinkeln turn around your but 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.700
 There are hardly any limits to creativity 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.860
 otherwise there is this device it is 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.220
 rather a beginner device with a 5 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.780
 or an i7 processor 8 gb ram and from 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.630
 You have a lot of hard disks here 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.220
 different configurations for selection 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.680
 13 inches tall is available in the display 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.340
 two variants as full hd or as weko 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.990
 hd and of course with an im 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.410
 scope of supply contained know 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:26.230
 no problem at all but otherwise 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:29.110
 is still particularly on this device is 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.870
 the zero aircap technology that means 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.940
 that between the glass and the panel 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.010
 there is no air and that leads to one 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.210
 very high viewing angle stability 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.919
 means you can really look 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.570
 various craziest 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.590
 look on it and look 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.590
 could still recognize something 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.850
 that's what it was about us 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.290
 tablets and notebooks at ifa 2014 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.820
 if you interested in what we do so 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.140
 a lot of technology highlights here on the 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.370
 have dug up 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.170
 then just look at ours 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.370
 youtube channel or down there 

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.020
 in the video description 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.620
 there are the remaining videos linked 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.620
 that soon
