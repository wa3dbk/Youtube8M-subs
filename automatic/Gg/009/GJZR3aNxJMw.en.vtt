00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.559
 sweet is good why she keeps the 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.290

 calories from potato 12 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.100
 only the potato as it a peak of 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.770
 insulin in the blood of three peaks

 the common potato for sweet potatoes 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.100
 typical of insulin would not happen 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.930
 because I have already explained slow digestion and 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.189
 there would not be a peak of blood 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.490
 stay stable
