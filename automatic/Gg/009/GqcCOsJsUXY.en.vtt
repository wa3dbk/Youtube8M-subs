is<00:01:41.180> we're<00:01:41.900> like<00:01:42.050> a<00:01:42.080> division<00:01:42.650> even<00:01:42.890> though

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
is we're like a division even though

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.250

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
division of a big league and naturally

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.490 
division of a big league and naturally
the<00:01:48.950> competition<00:01:49.640> is<00:01:49.730> pretty<00:01:50.390> comparable<00:01:51.200> at

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
the competition is pretty comparable at

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.090 
the competition is pretty comparable at
any<00:01:52.130> given<00:01:52.460> night<00:01:52.490> anything<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.330> win<00:01:54.100> the

saint-marie<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.599> don't<00:02:48.780> have<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.170> much

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
saint-marie so we don't have that much

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.990 
saint-marie so we don't have that much
trouble<00:02:49.739> getting<00:02:50.069> exposure<00:02:50.400> but<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:50.819> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
trouble getting exposure but it's the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.059 
trouble getting exposure but it's the
kids<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:52.019> see<00:02:52.200> from<00:02:52.349> Timmins<00:02:52.769> or<00:02:52.980> you

from way up north and moose factory back

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.280 
from way up north and moose factory back
a<00:02:56.909> bunch<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.239> years<00:02:57.329> ago<00:02:57.450> there's<00:02:57.810> there's

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
a bunch of years ago there's there's

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.809 
a bunch of years ago there's there's
good<00:02:58.470> hockey<00:02:58.739> players<00:02:58.950> everywhere<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.760> I

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
good hockey players everywhere and I

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.699 
good hockey players everywhere and I
think<00:03:00.090> with<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:00.659> leak<00:03:00.930> getting<00:03:01.439> stronger

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
think with this leak getting stronger

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.069 
think with this leak getting stronger
and<00:03:01.890> stronger<00:03:02.129> it's<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:02.940> giving<00:03:03.690> those<00:03:03.780> kids

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
and stronger it's it's giving those kids

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.930 
and stronger it's it's giving those kids
a<00:03:04.170> chance<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.620> not<00:03:05.190> only<00:03:05.220> get<00:03:05.549> down<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.909> a

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
a chance to not only get down to a

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.430 
a chance to not only get down to a
tryout<00:03:06.239> but<00:03:06.659> getting<00:03:06.959> this<00:03:07.049> giving<00:03:07.319> them

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
tryout but getting this giving them

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.990 
tryout but getting this giving them
chance<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.829> make<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.010> team<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.489> prove<00:03:08.819> what

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
chance to make a team and prove what

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.140 
chance to make a team and prove what
they<00:03:09.090> can<00:03:09.269> do<00:03:09.359> the<00:03:10.109> noj<00:03:10.620> NHL<00:03:10.980> also<00:03:11.519> put<00:03:11.819> safety

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
they can do the noj NHL also put safety

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.449 
they can do the noj NHL also put safety
first<00:03:12.389> as<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.470> league<00:03:13.680> implemented<00:03:14.370> a

that Sidney Crosby's using and I think
it's<00:03:30.450> imperative<00:03:30.870> as<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.260> leak<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.430> as

it's imperative as a leak and I as

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.180 
it's imperative as a leak and I as
organizations<00:03:33.720> within<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.019> league<00:03:34.199> that<00:03:34.859> we
