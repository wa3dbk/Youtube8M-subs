bitcoins<00:00:00.810> built<00:00:01.110> on<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.439> type<00:00:01.770> of

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
bitcoins built on this type of

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.700 
bitcoins built on this type of
encryption<00:00:02.190> calls<00:00:02.810> sha-256<00:00:03.810> which<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.680> a

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
encryption calls sha-256 which is a

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.769 
encryption calls sha-256 which is a
certain<00:00:05.190> type<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.400> hash<00:00:05.819> that's<00:00:06.089> calculated

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
certain type of hash that's calculated

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.709 
certain type of hash that's calculated
and<00:00:06.930> it's<00:00:07.319> how<00:00:07.910> Bitcoin<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.300> Bitcoin

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
and it's how Bitcoin and the Bitcoin

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.320 
and it's how Bitcoin and the Bitcoin
miners<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.290> network<00:00:10.650> encrypt<00:00:11.490> data<00:00:11.610> and

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
miners in the network encrypt data and

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.039 
miners in the network encrypt data and
so<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.860> allows<00:00:14.160> me<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.450> decrypt<00:00:15.450> blocks<00:00:15.809> that

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
so this allows me to decrypt blocks that

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.130 
so this allows me to decrypt blocks that
are<00:00:16.170> coming<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.590> through<00:00:16.830> my<00:00:16.980> pool<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.520> then

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
are coming in through my pool and then

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.480 
are coming in through my pool and then
verify<00:00:19.140> them<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.619> then<00:00:19.710> re<00:00:19.859> encrypt<00:00:20.250> them<00:00:20.369> and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
verify them and then re encrypt them and

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.220 
verify them and then re encrypt them and
send<00:00:20.670> them<00:00:20.789> back<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.510> blockchain<00:00:21.779> which

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
send them back to the blockchain which

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.590 
send them back to the blockchain which
then<00:00:22.500> lists<00:00:23.189> them<00:00:23.340> as<00:00:23.369> completed<00:00:24.150> verified

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
then lists them as completed verified

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.410 
then lists them as completed verified

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
processing and does the hashing and that

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.979 
processing and does the hashing and that
is<00:00:34.380> done<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.860> these<00:00:35.250> two<00:00:35.730> computer<00:00:36.719> boards

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
is done in these two computer boards

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.720 
is done in these two computer boards
right<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:37.770> they<00:00:37.950> each<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.280> 32

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730

it's<00:01:01.109> going<00:01:01.469> an<00:01:02.100> important<00:01:02.520> issue<00:01:02.640> with<00:01:02.940> this

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
it's going an important issue with this

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.820 
it's going an important issue with this
is<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.539> power<00:01:03.750> because<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.229> needs<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.559> lot<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
is the power because it needs a lot of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.710 
is the power because it needs a lot of
very<00:01:05.250> very<00:01:05.549> steady<00:01:05.790> power<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.600> any

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
very very steady power if you have any

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.320 
very very steady power if you have any
kind<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.960> power<00:01:07.170> surges<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.180> you<00:01:09.180> might

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
kind of power surges the you might

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.630 
kind of power surges the you might
destroy<00:01:09.780> parts<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.350> your<00:01:10.530> board<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.610> I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
destroy parts of your board and so I

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.320 
destroy parts of your board and so I
have<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.439> basically<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.560> gaming<00:01:14.070> power<00:01:14.850> supply

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
have a basically a gaming power supply

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.260 
have a basically a gaming power supply
it's<00:01:15.840> rated<00:01:16.200> at<00:01:16.259> 600<00:01:16.530> watts<00:01:16.920> which<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.270> really

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
it's rated at 600 watts which is really

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.880 
it's rated at 600 watts which is really
overrated<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.229> type<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.590> an

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
overrated for this type of an

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.770 
overrated for this type of an
application<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.090> wanted<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.570> make<00:01:21.750> sure

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
application but I wanted to make sure

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.570 
application but I wanted to make sure
that<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.290> wasn't<00:01:22.560> going<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.130> running<00:01:23.340> into

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
that I wasn't going to be running into

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.539 
that I wasn't going to be running into
any<00:01:23.700> issues<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:24.270> far<00:01:24.630> as<00:01:24.900> power<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:26.100> connects

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
any issues as far as power this connects

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.640 
any issues as far as power this connects
into<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.060> boards<00:01:27.840> through<00:01:28.110> these<00:01:28.229> molex

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
into the boards through these molex

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.910 
into the boards through these molex
power<00:01:28.890> splitters<00:01:29.720> which<00:01:30.720> I've<00:01:30.930> rewired<00:01:31.290> with

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
power splitters which I've rewired with

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.130 
power splitters which I've rewired with
higher<00:01:32.490> gauge<00:01:32.759> wired<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.299> produces<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> lot<00:01:34.110> of

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
higher gauge wired it produces a lot of

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140 
higher gauge wired it produces a lot of
heat<00:01:34.470> when<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.740> working<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.729> ended<00:01:36.030> up

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
heat when it's working and so I ended up

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.149 
heat when it's working and so I ended up
getting<00:01:36.360> six<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.020> these<00:01:37.409> really<00:01:37.650> really<00:01:37.860> high

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
getting six of these really really high

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.640 
getting six of these really really high
flow<00:01:38.490> fans<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:40.110> obviously<00:01:40.470> pretty

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
flow fans and that's obviously pretty

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.039 
flow fans and that's obviously pretty
loud<00:01:40.979> for<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.299> family<00:01:42.720> room<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.990> our

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
loud for in the the family room of our

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.109 
loud for in the the family room of our
house<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.619> also<00:01:44.070> integrated<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.790> fan

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
house and so I also integrated this fan

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.520 
house and so I also integrated this fan
controller<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:45.869> side<00:01:46.079> which<00:01:46.290> just

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
controller on this side which just

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.530 
controller on this side which just
allows<00:01:46.680> me<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.189> turn<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.790> down<00:01:47.820> during<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> day

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
allows me to turn it down during the day

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.749 
allows me to turn it down during the day
when<00:01:49.259> we're<00:01:49.439> going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.680> be<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.610> it's

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
when we're going to be in here so it's

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.280 
when we're going to be in here so it's
not<00:01:50.880> quite<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.450> loud

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.590 

that's<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.430> basically<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.970> structure<00:01:57.300> of

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that's just basically the structure of

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.320 
that's just basically the structure of
the<00:01:57.810> mining<00:01:58.110> rig
