00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.509
 anigo is restructuring 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.519
 the team there is a midfielder who 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.889
 seems more solid I think he 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.500
 could stay in 4 3 3 as it goes 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.059
 have just integrated the entrants to 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.740
 ayew and valbuena 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.029
 I need a dock comes into play for 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.310
 the last twenty minutes of real 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.869
 choice is that payet on the bench I 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.800
 think payet must be on the bench 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.650
 it's the best place 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.720
 and if you put valbuena with in front 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.340
 thauvin and gignac who seems to me to be a 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.630
 good complementary duo they get along 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.200
 well they seem to play well 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.410
 together 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.760
 that can there can be hope of a 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.739
 turnaround in the second part of 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.809
 season the om beats can play his 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.850
 maintenance and a cut like this in 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.900
 passing but since the objective is 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.879
 still to recover 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.620
 there is hope for something 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.300
 yeah I 'm told ah this is this 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.199
 defense this solidity of the year 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.640
 last I'm not sure they're 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.589
 find this year but if 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.970
 rebalances six meters from goal gets started 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.320
 two goals three goals they take 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.089
 1 2 here they can get there like this 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.190
 what why not but in any case I 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.629
 I found them interesting I was too 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.670
 interesting this afternoon money room I 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.760
 will not ignite the judgment until 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.890
 to say that it is tf1 that will mess up 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.960
 the whole offensive truth of this 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.790
 olympic team of marseille but 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.520
 in any case it's good to have a boy 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.470
 which we are talking about today for its 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.990
 qualities of footballer he is not 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.659
 because he did because he shunned 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.009
 at the beginning of the season and who he is who he 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.290
 went from one club to the other so much better 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.730
 all the better for them so much the better for 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.200
 marseille too bad for him that's the 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.820
 debate is that in any case it's a boy 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.220
 which has enormous qualities 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.330
 I just want him to become 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.430
 not somewhere a kind of ben arfa he 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.650
 do not take bad 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.170
 this but I mean by that he has 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.390
 a talent that is so much above 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.690
 others that he simply has to 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.460
 improve then he is only 20 years old he wants 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.560
 you have to give it you have to give it 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.850
 certainly certainly time and time he 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.130
 train of 2.2 deserved to win it and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.660
 for sure if there is a truth for 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.670
 an attacker an attacker starts to 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.759
 mark he did not know anymore if gignac 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.540
 stays on seven out of seven baladin bodies 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.520
 be seduced with the return of hugh the one 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.080
 of valbuena would be the best I believe 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.700
 not that all 20 would be better because 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.459
 there he plays a kind of role a little 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.760
 weird kind of 10 squarely in front 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.720
 a duo attacked him gignac and valbuena 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.820
 who will go back behind them I think that 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.670
 this midfielder can finally this trio 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.500
 offensive can have me that I like 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.630
 and downright so in the midfield 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.280
 behind you put you back ayew 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.380
 in a position in the middle of the field 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.360
 as he hopes and a thousand wishes 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.390
 with games not the other two 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:51.250
 romao in mao chi rouault romo eliminated there 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.840
 I think the om has a team that 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.880
 interest me who - who I like 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.160
 plus there so what is it a 4-3-1-2 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.950
 like that it can be a case it can be 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.190
 a 4 3 3 it may have been through 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.350
 the talk by the quartet that is to say, 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.010
 valbuena thauvin 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.500
 ayew gignac after the information to 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.820
 visitors in 4 4 2 it is clear that that 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.500
 valbuena badoit must guide the game with 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.930
 which knows what to do is take 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.540
 to take the ball sometimes accelerated 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.580
 sometimes lift your head dribble metals 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.840
 20x absolutely especially when he is 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.640
 on the forehand I would bring closer 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.110
 goals me me me I see him very much at 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.850
 comfortable when he's on the right side he 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.140
 take the balloon goes away but then from 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.480
 from time to time you have to give it a little 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.610
 of them a little freedom but have a 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.250
 player who likes to evolve rather on the 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.990
 right side another who does not want 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.700
 play completely in the focused that 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.660
 love to move left side we risk 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.820
 to have a lack of fixation point 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.140
 so you have to find the animation 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.520
 offensive but around these four 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.520
 players that may be the solution
