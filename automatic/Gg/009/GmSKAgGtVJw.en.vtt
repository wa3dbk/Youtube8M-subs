there are various message to cast on but

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.499 
there are various message to cast on but
by<00:00:13.990> far<00:00:14.410> the<00:00:14.440> easiest<00:00:14.769> is<00:00:15.369> the<00:00:15.580> e-rep<00:00:15.969> method

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:16.509 
by far the easiest is the e-rep method

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.100 
by far the easiest is the e-rep method
which<00:00:16.930> I<00:00:17.110> will<00:00:17.290> demonstrate<00:00:17.529> now<00:00:18.540> so<00:00:19.540> first<00:00:19.869> of

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
which I will demonstrate now so first of

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.030 
which I will demonstrate now so first of
all<00:00:20.320> on<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.550> loom<00:00:22.169> find<00:00:23.169> your<00:00:23.410> holding<00:00:23.770> pig

all on the loom find your holding pig
and<00:00:24.520> you<00:00:25.480> will<00:00:25.660> start<00:00:25.989> knitting<00:00:26.259> on<00:00:26.829> the<00:00:27.579> first

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
and you will start knitting on the first

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.380 
and you will start knitting on the first
peg<00:00:28.270> on<00:00:28.509> the<00:00:28.570> right<00:00:29.349> of<00:00:29.590> that<00:00:29.829> so<00:00:30.790> let's<00:00:30.820> place

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
peg on the right of that so let's place

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:39.890 
peg on the right of that so let's place
our<00:00:31.630> Slipknot<00:00:33.960> over<00:00:34.960> that<00:00:35.170> pig<00:00:37.260> tighten<00:00:38.260> it

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
our Slipknot over that pig tighten it

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.540 
our Slipknot over that pig tighten it
not<00:00:40.900> too<00:00:41.110> much<00:00:41.350> it<00:00:41.560> should<00:00:41.800> still<00:00:42.100> be<00:00:42.250> able<00:00:42.370> to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
not too much it should still be able to

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.799 
not too much it should still be able to
slide

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
slide

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.290

way<00:01:19.890> around<00:01:20.039> the<00:01:20.550> loom<00:01:22.460> now<00:01:23.460> make<00:01:23.729> sure<00:01:24.060> you

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
way around the loom now make sure you

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.400 
way around the loom now make sure you
wrap<00:01:25.470> very<00:01:25.860> loosely<00:01:26.690> or<00:01:27.690> you'll<00:01:28.020> be<00:01:28.259> in

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
wrap very loosely or you'll be in

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.310 
wrap very loosely or you'll be in
trouble<00:01:28.560> later<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.280> when<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.610> start<00:01:29.670> knitting

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
trouble later on when you start knitting

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.830 
trouble later on when you start knitting
so<00:01:31.320> don't<00:01:31.649> pull<00:01:31.920> don't<00:01:32.190> try<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:33.570> wrap

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
so don't pull don't try to just wrap

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.800 
so don't pull don't try to just wrap
loosely<00:01:35.300> until<00:01:36.300> you<00:01:36.420> finish<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.840> first<00:01:37.050> bit

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
loosely until you finish the first bit

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.430 
loosely until you finish the first bit
just<00:01:39.810> continue<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.399> every<00:01:42.149> peg<00:01:42.869> has<00:01:43.140> two

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
just continue so that every peg has two

00:01:43.440 --> 00:02:04.100 
just continue so that every peg has two
loops

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.940 

now<00:02:05.110> be<00:02:05.350> finished<00:02:05.939> wrapping<00:02:07.590> bring<00:02:08.590> your<00:02:08.770> yarn

the bottom loop pull it out a little bit

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:13.589 
the bottom loop pull it out a little bit
upwards<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:08.550> to<00:03:09.420> watch<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.810> inside

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.390 

continue

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:31.620 

until<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.450> finish<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:19.049> rope

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.360 

you<00:03:32.630> can<00:03:32.840> already<00:03:33.020> see<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.500> advantage<00:03:34.160> of

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
you can already see the advantage of

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.850 
you can already see the advantage of
wrapping<00:03:34.940> loosely<00:03:35.450> especially<00:03:36.410> with<00:03:36.590> yarn

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
wrapping loosely especially with yarn

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.540 
wrapping loosely especially with yarn
like<00:03:37.070> this

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
like this

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.400 
like this
I'm<00:03:38.270> just<00:03:38.480> thick<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.080> stubborn<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:42.200> is

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
I'm just thick and stubborn it is

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.680 
I'm just thick and stubborn it is
paramount<00:03:42.830> to<00:03:43.190> wrap<00:03:43.610> loosely<00:03:43.880> or<00:03:44.330> you<00:03:44.450> won't

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
paramount to wrap loosely or you won't

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:55.470 
paramount to wrap loosely or you won't
even<00:03:44.900> be<00:03:45.200> able<00:03:45.350> to<00:03:46.690> knit<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.900> pigs<00:03:54.340> they're

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
even be able to knit the pigs they're

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.040 
even be able to knit the pigs they're
all<00:03:56.480> done

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
all done
