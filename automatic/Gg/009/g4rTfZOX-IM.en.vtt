00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
think is critical and piece of

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.549 
think is critical and piece of
understanding<00:00:36.270> when<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.510> comes<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.899> copyright

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
understanding when it comes to copyright

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.100 
understanding when it comes to copyright
and<00:00:37.590> fair<00:00:37.920> use<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.540> law<00:00:39.690> copyright

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
and fair use is that the law copyright

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.500 
and fair use is that the law copyright
offers<00:00:40.890> us<00:00:41.040> exemptions<00:00:41.550> right<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.149> the

offers us exemptions right in and the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.209 
offers us exemptions right in and the
law<00:00:42.690> itself<00:00:43.230> says<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:44.570> Congress<00:00:45.570> grants

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
law itself says that Congress grants

order to promote science in the useful

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.970 
order to promote science in the useful
arts<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:54.600> creativity<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.320> innovation<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
arts so creativity and innovation and

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.350 
arts so creativity and innovation and
the<00:00:56.280> example<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.789> always<00:00:56.969> give<00:00:57.239> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the example that I always give to

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.240 
the example that I always give to
teachers<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:58.199> certainly<00:00:58.590> couldn't<00:00:58.980> have

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
teachers is we certainly couldn't have

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.189 
teachers is we certainly couldn't have
the<00:00:59.520> jet<00:00:59.760> plane<00:00:59.910> unless<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.750> Wright<00:01:00.899> brothers

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
the jet plane unless the Wright brothers

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.240 
the jet plane unless the Wright brothers
did<00:01:01.410> their<00:01:01.530> work<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> Wright

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
did their work but if the Wright

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.500 
did their work but if the Wright
brothers<00:01:02.579> were<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.789> only<00:01:03.059> ones<00:01:03.239> who<00:01:03.420> were

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
brothers were the only ones who were

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.329 
brothers were the only ones who were
ever<00:01:03.660> able<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.379> work<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:05.010> would<00:01:05.159> never

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
ever able to do that work we would never

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.219 
ever able to do that work we would never
have<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.580> jet<00:01:05.880> plane<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:06.930> it's

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
have the jet plane so I think it's

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.140 
have the jet plane so I think it's
important<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:07.680> teachers<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.610> understand

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
important for teachers to understand

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.520 
important for teachers to understand
that<00:01:09.330> when<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.570> comes<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.900> copyright<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.439> fair

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
that when it comes to copyright and fair

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.570 
that when it comes to copyright and fair
use<00:01:10.590> that's<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> first<00:01:11.189> thing<00:01:11.310> they<00:01:11.400> need<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
use that's the first thing they need to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.760 
use that's the first thing they need to
understand<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.299> copyright<00:01:13.229> offers<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
understand that copyright offers a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.270 
understand that copyright offers a

originally<00:01:19.950> copyrighted<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.580> work<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.060> think

on<00:01:21.840> what<00:01:22.020> teachers<00:01:22.170> need<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.500> understand

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
on what teachers need to understand

on what teachers need to understand
about<00:01:23.040> fair<00:01:23.430> use<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.180> fair<00:01:24.720> use<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
about fair use is that fair use is a
