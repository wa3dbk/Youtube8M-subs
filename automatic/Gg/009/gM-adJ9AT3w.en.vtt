00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.529
 impressions are the products that I have 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.630

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.519

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.980
 an opinion about which I want with you today 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.880

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.100
 has acquired 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.940
 it was odeon oil 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.490

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.279
 time i just hooked on japanese 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.710
 korean cosmetics and i really like 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.579
 all that i use both for face and for 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.260
 body and hair and at some point me 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.149
 urgently on caliphs to try 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.489
 hydrophilic oil but since nearby 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.710
 there were no Japanese stores the most 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.170
 more or less like what I wanted 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.090
 purchase it turned out this product from 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.670
 dior what i want to say this product 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.370
 should clean your pores it should 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.780
 remove makeup from the face and folds 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.789
 but unfortunately this product is not 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.250
 doing its job when i 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.920
 I tried to remove eye makeup, I just 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.379
 rubbed mascara on my face leave 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.199
 these are huge black circles 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.240
 the oil does not foam and the worst thing is 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.280
 I finished off and then I stopped him 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.380
 used me across the face went 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.270
 rash in general this product and 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.189
 leave a deuce and no longer want it 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.460
 never use and advise you 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.460
 the second product is also a face wash and 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.770
 This sisley face wash 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.590
 called no crime brain leader tank top 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.750
 straight this foam should be soft tender 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.810
 clean your skin it should 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.880
 remove makeup and and and gently care 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.590
 for your skin they gave me this remedy 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.110
 I did not buy it myself but it costs 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.720
 very expensive and I did not understand him 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.950
 chips let's say it seems to me that she 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.810
 absolutely not what it is so gentle 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.909
 cleans your skin that you don't even 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.619
 Feel that you have washed yourself and the following 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.210
 means that I have ended this 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.610
 legendary bioderma 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.100
 To be honest, I did not like and no 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.860
 special love yes she removes nice 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.229
 makeup but they can say she 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.630
 does it in seconds and for example 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.759
 better than mallory olev micellar 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.290
 water and was somewhere in the trip and bought 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.660
 myself just such a jar in the usual 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.819
 supermarket I like it very much 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.280
 after her I feel that we are the face 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.050
 really fresh clean as if i am 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.270
 I washed my face with water 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.770
 micellar aquatic and know that this 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.170
 the product was created specifically for 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.620
 people whose skin is prone to allergies 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.810
 for the seriously ill or children so in 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.940
 it does not contain soap that is, I do not 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.430
 contains lye which dries your 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.590
 skin like my skin is sensitive 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.480
 prone to dryness so I am very 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.370
 like this option of cleansing the face 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.860
 so maybe i will ever again 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.410
 back to the product bioderma but for now 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.420
 I'm quite satisfied with micellar 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.030
 I personally liked the water Loreal 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.739
 bigger and fourth product about which i 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.810
 I want to tell you this here 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.090
 Masochka from Loreal she is called 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.459
 absolute reper of the whole this masochka very 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.310
 it smooths hair well it 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.709
 imbues a little bit heavily to me 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.459
 like the effect i think that for any 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.440
 blondes 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.500
 it is important that the ends of the hair were 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.569
 written on me broken off and looked 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.459
 more well-groomed, in principle, I am very 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.680
 liked this mask but i don't think that 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.540
 I'll buy myself another one soon 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.940
 such because at the moment I 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.170
 chose for themselves the perfect care of 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.970
 japanese cosmetics 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.459
 the next product I will talk about 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.470
 this is a gel scrub with peppermint 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.810
 I really liked this scrub 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.060
 copes with its task at 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.220
 that he is not a thick consistency 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.230
 rather such a jelly gel he 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.680
 contains a cucumber tomato extract 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.870
 aloe vera mint oil that has 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.060
 little tightening effect on the skin and 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.530
 mint leave 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.480
 Zoom for a nice cooling effect 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.250
 in general, this cosmetics has recently appeared 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.319
 Russia does not contain sulfates and 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.599
 paraben and not tested on animals 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.730
 the next product is moisturizing 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.530
 soothing cream for rosh 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.140
 I really liked this time if you 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.540
 recently watched my video about cosmetics 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.340
 dermacol I told the right cream 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.920
 which I use in this brand and 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.930
 I said that at the moment I picked up 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.239
 cheaper analogue 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.760
 and just as effective of pharmacy 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.590
 series here I talked about this cream he 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.360
 perfectly moisturizes the face as well 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.860
 restores the balance of the skin itself 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.150
 all i need from cream to you 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.220
 neutral enough 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.470
 but keep my skin in good 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.050
 condition and if your skin is very 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.060
 sensitive prone to dryness and if 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.860
 do you have any allergies 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.150
 reactions maybe you go through some 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.460
 procedures at this moment 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.320
 then this cream is also perfect for you 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.610
 look at him last product about 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.910
 which I want to tell you today 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.010
 is it a butter oil or is it a liquid 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.710
 argan oil crystals it 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.330
 copes well with its task 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.430
 moisturize hair gives them shine 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.100
 if you, too, dry tips on your hair 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.900
 if you are beautiful and trying to pick 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.060
 a lot of hair is worth it 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.740
 nice option i have also butter 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.810
 from kerastase on i can say this 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.650
 oil is no worse and I liked it 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.600
 even more 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.030
 but in general we are all different to someone something 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.950
 suitable for someone not so if you 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.229
 stayed these products and they approached you 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.690
 please write about it if you have 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:12.910
 have questions then ask them under the video 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.910
 Thank you all for your attention so far.
