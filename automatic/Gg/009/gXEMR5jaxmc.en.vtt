00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
he's not getting up so I think he's

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.160 
he's not getting up so I think he's
holding<00:02:17.160> his<00:02:17.190> uh<00:02:17.360> ankle<00:02:18.360> for<00:02:18.540> some<00:02:18.660> reason<00:02:18.990> so

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
holding his uh ankle for some reason so

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.700 
holding his uh ankle for some reason so
yeah<00:02:19.290> our<00:02:19.800> star<00:02:20.250> player<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.910> on<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:22.590> floor

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
yeah our star player is on the floor

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.760 
yeah our star player is on the floor
injured<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:23.880> it's<00:02:24.870> quite<00:02:25.050> unfortunate<00:02:25.230> he<00:02:25.680> was

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
injured so it's quite unfortunate he was

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.130 
injured so it's quite unfortunate he was
having<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.040> good<00:02:26.160> game<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.610> far<00:02:26.640> but<00:02:27.330> we<00:02:27.420> put<00:02:27.870> on

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
having a good game so far but we put on

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.610 
having a good game so far but we put on
this<00:02:28.410> guy<00:02:28.680> wyman<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.640> he<00:02:30.150> does<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.050> really<00:02:31.170> nice

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
this guy wyman and he does a really nice

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.470 
this guy wyman and he does a really nice
goal<00:02:31.980> there<00:02:32.220> from<00:02:32.520> outside<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.910> box<00:02:33.090> into<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
goal there from outside the box into the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.650 
goal there from outside the box into the
top<00:02:33.870> left-hand<00:02:34.350> corner<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:36.030> 78th<00:02:36.630> minute

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
top left-hand corner in the 78th minute

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.380 
top left-hand corner in the 78th minute
so<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.230> know<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.650> if<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:37.950> levendusky<00:02:38.310> ever<00:02:39.150> gets

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
so I know that if I levendusky ever gets

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.910 
so I know that if I levendusky ever gets
injured<00:02:39.720> again<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.080> can<00:02:40.320> always<00:02:40.410> bring<00:02:40.680> him<00:02:40.830> on

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
injured again I can always bring him on

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.560 
injured again I can always bring him on
because<00:02:41.070> he<00:02:41.220> obviously<00:02:41.250> has<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
because he obviously has a the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.870

experience as a good strike over here in

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.440 
experience as a good strike over here in
the<00:02:44.940> 90th<00:02:45.270> minute<00:02:45.360> ever<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.440> nearly<00:02:46.740> get<00:02:47.160> a

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
the 90th minute ever to nearly get a

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.150 
the 90th minute ever to nearly get a
consolation<00:02:48.450> goal<00:02:48.660> but<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.440> wasn't<00:02:49.710> enough<00:02:49.890> I

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
consolation goal but it wasn't enough I

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.120

savella<00:02:50.910> beat<00:02:51.300> everton<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:52.230> nil<00:02:52.470> at<00:02:52.680> home<00:02:52.920> so

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
savella beat everton to nil at home so

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.500 
savella beat everton to nil at home so
that<00:02:53.160> means<00:02:53.400> it's<00:02:53.520> now<00:02:53.670> goes<00:02:53.880> we<00:02:54.060> have<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.180> six

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
that means it's now goes we have a six

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.680 
that means it's now goes we have a six
points<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.730> there<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:56.970> can<00:02:57.090> see<00:02:57.120> other<00:02:57.360> scores

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.720 
points so there you can see other scores
this<00:02:58.530> kind<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:58.860> really<00:02:59.010> reflects<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.520> real

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
this kind of really reflects a real

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.600 
this kind of really reflects a real
Premier<00:03:00.450> League<00:03:00.600> season<00:03:00.890> all<00:03:01.890> results<00:03:02.490> you'd

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
Premier League season all results you'd

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.440 
Premier League season all results you'd
probably<00:03:02.850> expect<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:04.550> so<00:03:05.550> we<00:03:05.880> now<00:03:06.090> go<00:03:06.300> on<00:03:06.420> to

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
probably expect and so we now go on to

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.020 
probably expect and so we now go on to
