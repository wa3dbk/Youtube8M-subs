 let's get down to doing 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.470
 next bug we need to call 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.450
 mechanics did you come burrows were in 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.550
 the report is only required here 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.320
 You can do this scourge in general take 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.540
 car fish it costs only 3 thousand 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.280
 dollars if anyone and no in general 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.620
 and drive up to the hangar where he 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.660
 nearest hangar on the left through melancholy where 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.219
 there is a springboard where there is a luxor 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.530
 usually and should under and you should 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.899
 drive up to this coil here stands here 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.730
 such a yellow coil with yellow 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.500
 some kind of wires or hoses i don't know 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.500
 what is that general you should somehow 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.329
 pull this coil out a bit 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.980
 places where it usually stands here as well 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.290
 tweeting where it usually stands in general 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.650
 the most important thing is what is the tank 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.970
 the fact that your friend does not see this coil and 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.250
 may even pass through it that is 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.810
 for your friend this coil is simply not 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.640
 there is no know why somehow 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.799
 prove and up this coil she have your 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.140
 friend disappears and very now you can 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.780
 the holes were accelerated so little and not 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.520
 hurrying to drive this coil and those 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.680
 the most turns up so rise top 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.770
 part of the machine and since your friend doesn't 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.420
 sees this coil then for you from a friend you 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.670
 just not all will rise 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.890
 top of the machine is high enough 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.990
 it can even crawl under your car 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.689
 overall this is a really funny bug and 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.549
 as you can see right now my friend how would 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.070
 raise it to. I have this coil 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.170
 I do not see the coil in general, here is such 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.990
 funny bug and so the next bug that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.700
 he wanted to show this texture bug in 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.320
 gta online a lot of texts 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.270
 by which you can run under 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.009
 general map to do all sorts of things there about 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.049
 all sorts of things personally day which there with 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.119
 home missions you understand and very rain 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.950
 showed you the place where this one is 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.750
 texture well this texture is unusual he 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.640
 really cool you should 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.770
 come to this place on high pretty 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.569
 same cars on big and drive up here 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.450
 only the same wall that drove up 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.760
 vividly 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.709
 summer purple doors and in general now 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.140
 you have to climb your car and 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.030
 go here to this wall and click 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.160
 squares you grew let here 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.110
 such a texture is really textures 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.849
 unusual because here you can 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.069
 calm walk quietly shoot 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.630
 go right under the road that is you 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.209
 two of them will walk it will go 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.860
 Masha ride cars general really 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.510
 very cool texture given on from 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.540
 better who ever saw and 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.489
 the most interesting thing is that as first 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.799
 I advise you somehow not to do at all 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.690
 sudden movements that is, well, how would 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.849
 to run away neatly to me sometimes 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.590
 there was a document was once this climbed 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.690
 what I'm talking about right fell into this texture 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.310
 flew to flash under the card if the other 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.980
 since I already managed to just walk 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.410
 there and just have to walk under 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.150
 every hour and so forth st also advise 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.709
 you and your friend visit this steve 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.989
 tour it is really fun and 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.780
 next last tank for today as 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.360
 usual by tradition I leave the most 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.430
 fun skill the funniest bug on 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.549
 lastly so you need to find a belt 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.739
 getting into it is simple and so 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.560
 lean against the wall push the touchpad 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.959
 passive mode turn it on and off 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.700
 its here and all you just click here 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.980
 so press the walls press r1 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.450
 so sit down to turn on the touchpad 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.850
 passive mode turn off passive 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.980
 mode and after literally 5-7 seconds you 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.810
 failed under the train and here is such 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.000
 funny bug happens you just just 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.880
 grin with how to slide and just as well 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.680
 there is like a search just a little slower and 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.329
 quite simply so here you are traveling as 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.120
 skateboard really funny bug 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.130
 one denunciation will wiser the best which 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.780
 I 've ever seen a tank on so 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.910
 use it until it is fixed 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.340
 because I am well that soon 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.019
 so roughly must fix and most 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.120
 the main thing is that you can firstly 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.010
 drive as you drive ie you just 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.049
 point in which direction you want 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.389
 how can u side look what 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.510
 the side you eat and the most important thing is that you 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.669
 you can even fly that is see on 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.290

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.180
 also those just turn off and turn on 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.459
 mode upper will fly high on 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.049
