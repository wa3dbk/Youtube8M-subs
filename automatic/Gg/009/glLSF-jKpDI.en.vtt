and they're very desi style very Indian

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.890 
and they're very desi style very Indian
and<00:01:27.070> I<00:01:27.760> don't<00:01:27.940> know<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.120> brand<00:01:28.270> but<00:01:28.690> they're

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
and I don't know the brand but they're

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.780 
and I don't know the brand but they're
very<00:01:29.080> nice<00:01:29.229> so<00:01:29.590> what<00:01:30.190> I<00:01:30.220> thought<00:01:30.490> is<00:01:30.760> that

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
very nice so what I thought is that

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.370 
very nice so what I thought is that
because<00:01:31.060> it's<00:01:31.390> black<00:01:31.570> and<00:01:31.780> gold<00:01:31.990> they<00:01:32.260> all

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
because it's black and gold they all

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.110 
because it's black and gold they all
match<00:01:32.590> but<00:01:32.920> at<00:01:33.010> the<00:01:33.100> same<00:01:33.280> time<00:01:33.549> it's<00:01:33.850> really

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
match but at the same time it's really

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.370 
match but at the same time it's really
breaking<00:01:34.330> it<00:01:34.510> up<00:01:34.630> because<00:01:34.810> we<00:01:34.990> have<00:01:35.080> something

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
breaking it up because we have something

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.380 
breaking it up because we have something
to<00:01:35.409> desi<00:01:35.860> style<00:01:36.070> something<00:01:36.940> completely

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
to desi style something completely

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.330 
to desi style something completely
