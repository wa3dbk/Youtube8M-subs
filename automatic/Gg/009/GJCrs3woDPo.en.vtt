00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
one side we've got pictures up now I

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.410 
one side we've got pictures up now I
mean<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.710> isn't<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> mess<00:00:32.940> especially

down<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.780> side<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:34.980> seems

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
down that side and it just seems

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.650 
down that side and it just seems
surprising<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.180> know<00:00:36.300> they<00:00:36.390> didn't<00:00:36.570> see

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
surprising that you know they didn't see

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.850 
surprising that you know they didn't see
these<00:00:36.840> problems<00:00:37.200> coming<00:00:37.469> because<00:00:37.590> like<00:00:37.770> you

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
these problems coming because like you

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
say they've had a bit of was a cherry

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
picker on the pitches it was bound to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.130 
picker on the pitches it was bound to
cause<00:00:41.370> some<00:00:41.579> problems<00:00:41.969> but<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.570> not<00:00:42.750> remedy

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
cause some problems but it's not remedy

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.810 
cause some problems but it's not remedy
no<00:00:43.739> when<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.950> think<00:00:44.160> they<00:00:44.219> do<00:00:44.340> sort<00:00:44.579> like<00:00:44.640> were

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
no when you think they do sort like were

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.040 
no when you think they do sort like were
like<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.360> summer<00:00:45.570> when<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.840> was<00:00:45.930> nice

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
like that in the summer when it was nice

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.180 
like that in the summer when it was nice
and<00:00:46.110> dry<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.500> obviously<00:00:46.860> they've<00:00:46.980> done<00:00:47.070> it

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
and dry but obviously they've done it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
philosophers okay so obviously about the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.369

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
problems with the Torquay fixture and

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.600 
problems with the Torquay fixture and
that's<00:00:55.559> been<00:00:55.739> moved<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.980> Macclesfield<00:00:56.460> now

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
that's been moved to Macclesfield now

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.490 
that's been moved to Macclesfield now
yeah<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.719> gonna<00:00:57.809> get<00:00:57.899> played<00:00:58.079> at<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.320> moss

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
yeah it's gonna get played at the moss

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500 
yeah it's gonna get played at the moss
on<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:59.250> Tuesday<00:00:59.670> because<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.059> been<00:01:00.180> called

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
on on Tuesday because it's been called

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.260 
on on Tuesday because it's been called
off<00:01:00.629> twice<00:01:00.840> as<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.199> park<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:02.180> think<00:01:03.180> it's

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
off twice as a park I think it's

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.460 
off twice as a park I think it's
probably<00:01:03.420> good<00:01:03.600> idea<00:01:03.899> because<00:01:04.199> they<00:01:04.260> need<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
probably good idea because they need to

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.960 
probably good idea because they need to
get<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> game<00:01:04.769> played<00:01:05.010> otherwise<00:01:05.489> they'd<00:01:05.700> be

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
middle of December that's when you think

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.310

okay<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.750> had<00:01:33.869> any<00:01:34.049> sort<00:01:34.229> of

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
okay so if you had any sort of

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.499

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
game is definitely going to be on at the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.590 
game is definitely going to be on at the
weekend<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.280> mean<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:38.490> counter<00:01:39.150> came<00:01:39.299> out<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
weekend I mean if counter came out and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.940 
weekend I mean if counter came out and
said<00:01:39.689> there's<00:01:40.200> no<00:01:40.320> problem<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> pitch

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
said there's no problem with the pitch

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.830 
said there's no problem with the pitch
no<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.790> mean<00:01:42.090> they've<00:01:42.299> said<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.600> there<00:01:42.720> hope

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
no I mean they've said that there hope

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.230 
no I mean they've said that there hope
to<00:01:42.960> get<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.670> we<00:01:44.670> keep<00:01:44.820> getting<00:01:44.939> told

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
to get it on but we keep getting told

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.789 
to get it on but we keep getting told
that<00:01:45.509> every<00:01:45.960> game<00:01:46.110> now<00:01:46.259> has<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> doubt<00:01:46.619> that

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
that every game now has a doubt that

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.990 
that every game now has a doubt that
actually<00:01:47.040> part<00:01:47.250> because<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> pictures<00:01:47.820> in

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
actually part because the pictures in

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.679 
actually part because the pictures in
such<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> state

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
such a state

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.450 
such a state
so<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.350> suppose<00:01:49.649> fans<00:01:50.040> aren't<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> know

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
so I suppose fans aren't going to know

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.219 
so I suppose fans aren't going to know
until<00:01:50.610> they<00:01:50.759> turn<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.210> Saturday<00:01:51.329> it's

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
until they turn up on a Saturday it's

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.690 
until they turn up on a Saturday it's
not<00:01:52.380> an<00:01:52.439> ideal<00:01:52.680> situation<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:53.549> been

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
not an ideal situation it's not been

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.190 
not an ideal situation it's not been
going<00:01:53.909> fantastically<00:01:54.479> well<00:01:54.689> really<00:01:54.899> follow

the next points coming from which is a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
supports chance of avoiding relegation

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.760 
supports chance of avoiding relegation
obviously<00:02:41.840> right<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.230> start<00:02:42.470> of<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.620> year

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770

obviously right the start of the year
they<00:02:42.920> were<00:02:42.980> made<00:02:43.220> one<00:02:43.820> of<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.000> favorites<00:02:44.420> to

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
they were made one of the favorites to

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.330 
they were made one of the favorites to
go<00:02:44.660> down<00:02:44.870> at<00:02:45.020> first<00:02:45.260> oh<00:02:45.500> he<00:02:45.590> looked<00:02:45.770> okay<00:02:46.130> but

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
go down at first oh he looked okay but

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.680 
go down at first oh he looked okay but
they<00:02:46.550> just<00:02:46.730> seem<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:46.910> have<00:02:47.030> slipped<00:02:47.270> into<00:02:47.510> this

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
they just seem to have slipped into this

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.210 
they just seem to have slipped into this
form<00:02:47.990> it's<00:02:48.170> very<00:02:48.230> difficult<00:02:48.740> to<00:02:48.920> get<00:02:49.010> out<00:02:49.130> of

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
form it's very difficult to get out of

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.440 
form it's very difficult to get out of
it<00:02:49.340> once<00:02:49.490> you're<00:02:49.610> in<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.820> well<00:02:50.030> is<00:02:50.150> yeah<00:02:50.300> and

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
losing the habit and all it takes just

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.100 
losing the habit and all it takes just
one<00:02:53.090> result<00:02:53.450> they'll<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.660> get<00:02:53.750> out<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.020> maybe
