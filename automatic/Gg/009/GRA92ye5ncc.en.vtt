00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.140 

now<00:03:22.480> depending<00:03:22.750> upon<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.800> weight<00:03:24.130> of<00:03:24.490> the

now depending upon the weight of the
fabric<00:03:25.600> that<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:25.990> are<00:03:26.140> hemming<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:27.310> can

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
fabric that you are hemming you can

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.870 
fabric that you are hemming you can
adjust<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.450> bite<00:03:28.840> or<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.620> zigzag<00:03:30.310> that<00:03:30.670> it

takes<00:03:31.240> into<00:03:31.570> your<00:03:32.140> fabric<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:33.640> if<00:03:33.760> I<00:03:33.850> want<00:03:34.150> it

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
takes into your fabric so if I want it

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.830 
takes into your fabric so if I want it
to<00:03:34.630> take<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:34.960> deeper<00:03:35.590> bite<00:03:35.890> I'm<00:03:36.220> going<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.180> make

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
to take a deeper bite I'm going to make

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.270 
to take a deeper bite I'm going to make
my<00:03:38.080> stitch<00:03:38.440> width<00:03:39.010> wider<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:40.680> now<00:03:41.680> it<00:03:42.070> will

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
my stitch width wider and now it will

00:03:42.280 --> 00:04:05.220 
my stitch width wider and now it will
take<00:03:42.340> more<00:03:42.880> of<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:43.210> bite<00:03:43.590> into<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:44.620> fold

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.100 

so<00:04:06.670> this<00:04:07.670> is<00:04:07.850> where<00:04:08.060> I've<00:04:08.210> just<00:04:08.240> sown<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:08.960> can

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
so this is where I've just sown you can

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.560 
so this is where I've just sown you can
see<00:04:09.350> where<00:04:09.590> my<00:04:09.770> bite<00:04:10.100> is<00:04:10.400> going<00:04:10.880> into<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.300> fold

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
see where my bite is going into the fold

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.270 
see where my bite is going into the fold
of<00:04:11.750> my<00:04:11.900> fabric<00:04:12.440> if<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:13.550> lay<00:04:13.850> it<00:04:14.000> flat<00:04:15.220> this<00:04:16.220> is

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
of my fabric if I lay it flat this is

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.610 
of my fabric if I lay it flat this is
how<00:04:16.610> the<00:04:16.670> inside<00:04:17.330> of<00:04:17.570> my<00:04:17.720> garment<00:04:18.020> would<00:04:18.380> look

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
how the inside of my garment would look

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.350 
how the inside of my garment would look
and<00:04:19.360> if<00:04:20.360> I<00:04:20.510> flip<00:04:20.840> it<00:04:20.959> over<00:04:21.260> all<00:04:22.160> we<00:04:22.880> see<00:04:23.120> right

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
and if I flip it over all we see right

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.350 
and if I flip it over all we see right
now<00:04:23.390> is<00:04:23.990> just<00:04:24.380> that<00:04:24.470> basting<00:04:25.250> stitch<00:04:25.610> we<00:04:26.210> do

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
now is just that basting stitch we do

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.910 
now is just that basting stitch we do
not<00:04:26.570> see<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.740> stitches<00:04:28.370> of<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:29.060> blind<00:04:29.360> hem<00:04:29.920> so

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
not see the stitches of the blind hem so

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:38.680 
not see the stitches of the blind hem so
