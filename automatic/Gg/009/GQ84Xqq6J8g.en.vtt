00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.600
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.540
 video channel logical path today 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.400
 let's see how in yosemite and helios 8 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.930
 we can record the screen of our 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.790
 iphone if you have to download any 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.030
 alternative program neither spending nor a 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.550
 hard 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.560
 simply with quick time player that 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.419
 comes as standard installed in our 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.339
 mac we can record the screen of 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.449
 our iphone in this case so what 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:24.269
 what you have to do is open quit and 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.399
 player once we open we click 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.710
 right over if we do not want to go to the 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:31.840
 menu bar and we're going to it again 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.230
 video recording 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.270
 we have life 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.810
 this here 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.120
 and as you can see, it is already getting worse already 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.030
 is showing my iphone screen 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.860
 because what I've done has been to give 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.530
 here to the little arrow we have here 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.030
 and choose to record from the iphone of 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.940
 tolo for it we have to have it 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.670
 connected with usb lines inc cable 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.170
 because otherwise this option does not appear 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.120
 once we have it connected and open 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.560
 quick time player if we see the 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.020
 option of our iphone the 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.940
 we select and automatically pass 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:12.180
 this looks our iphone on the screen 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.220
 without any kind of side and we can record 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.260
 what happens the audio picks up from the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.390
 computer and if we wanted to record then 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.159
 we would do it by giving the king here 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.770
 little button this here 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.470
 now it is already recording the screen of 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.320
 our iphone 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.840
 just record this the rest of the magnum 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.530
 he records it and the audio picks it up from the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.150
 computer 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.360
 we have stopped it and now we can 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.820
 visualize it 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.590
 now it is already recording the screen of 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.380
 our iphone 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.899
 just record this the rest of the magnum 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.259
 he records it and the audio picks it up from the 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.259
 computer 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.189
 As you can see, the recording was correct 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.539
 so we could give it here now xy 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.149
 would ask us if we want to save it and 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.159
 where we want to save it we would put it 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.630
 the name we would like we would give to 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.179
 what to keep on the desk or where 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.149
 we would like to give you to save and 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:09.720
 automatically saved here 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.069
 desk in the form of film point 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.840
 move without title point move 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.450
 but we have not put any kind of 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.099
 name and here we had the video now and 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.740
 is recording our screen 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.460
 iphone 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.860
 and in this simple way in yosemite 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.530
 28 you can record what happens in the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.000
 screen of our device and I hope 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.490

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.820
