00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
counts as r2 and l2 to accelerate or you

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.349 
counts as r2 and l2 to accelerate or you
can<00:03:33.100> use<00:03:33.130> their<00:03:33.690> pedals<00:03:35.670> are<00:03:36.670> those<00:03:37.030> values

it's<00:03:52.120> pretty<00:03:52.450> easy<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.810> driving<00:03:53.110> these

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
it's pretty easy to driving these

pretty<00:05:56.070> this<00:05:56.310> is<00:05:56.370> wheel<00:05:56.700> is<00:05:56.880> pretty<00:05:57.120> good<00:05:57.270> for

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
pretty this is wheel is pretty good for

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.490 
pretty this is wheel is pretty good for
like<00:05:57.450> just<00:05:57.510> races<00:05:58.200> and<00:05:58.440> you<00:05:58.620> here<00:06:00.500> because

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
like just races and you here because

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:09.140 
like just races and you here because
we've<00:06:02.130> scripts<00:06:02.580> only<00:06:07.730> the<00:06:08.730> only<00:06:08.880> thing<00:06:09.060> I

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
we've scripts only the only thing I

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.030 
we've scripts only the only thing I
would<00:06:09.270> improve<00:06:09.660> with<00:06:09.900> this<00:06:10.050> really<00:06:10.560> is<00:06:10.830> the

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040 
would improve with this really is the

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.070 
would improve with this really is the
reaction<00:06:14.040> of<00:06:14.070> the<00:06:14.340> wheel<00:06:14.750> with<00:06:15.750> the<00:06:15.780> game

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
reaction of the wheel with the game

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.530 
reaction of the wheel with the game
costs<00:06:16.950> if<00:06:17.130> you<00:06:17.220> move<00:06:17.400> it<00:06:17.550> left<00:06:17.760> about<00:06:18.090> two

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
costs if you move it left about two

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.710 
costs if you move it left about two
seconds<00:06:18.990> later<00:06:19.230> than<00:06:19.410> actually<00:06:19.740> goes<00:06:19.920> left

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.730 

I'm<00:06:24.720> getting<00:06:25.880> the<00:06:26.880> hang<00:06:27.000> of<00:06:27.150> it<00:06:27.270> now<00:06:27.560> but<00:06:28.560> I've

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
I'm getting the hang of it now but I've

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.960 
I'm getting the hang of it now but I've
another<00:06:28.980> two<00:06:29.280> days<00:06:29.460> so<00:06:33.200> that's<00:06:34.200> it<00:06:34.380> really

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
another two days so that's it really

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.360 
another two days so that's it really
it's<00:06:35.970> pretty<00:06:36.150> all<00:06:36.360> wrong<00:06:36.540> good<00:06:36.720> wheel<00:06:37.160> but<00:06:38.160> not

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
it's pretty all wrong good wheel but not

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.140 
it's pretty all wrong good wheel but not
for<00:06:38.630> and<00:06:39.630> there<00:06:39.810> with<00:06:40.290> GE<00:06:40.530> I<00:06:40.740> think<00:06:41.070> GE<00:06:41.700> is<00:06:41.910> just

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
for and there with GE I think GE is just

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.530 
for and there with GE I think GE is just
really<00:06:42.420> for<00:06:42.540> a<00:06:42.570> pad<00:06:43.700> works<00:06:44.700> with<00:06:44.940> some<00:06:45.120> racing

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
really for a pad works with some racing

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.680 
really for a pad works with some racing
