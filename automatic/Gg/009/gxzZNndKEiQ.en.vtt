00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.460
 berg is in the netherlands is possible but will be adjusted among other things 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.380
 legislation is increasingly limited and is therefore reserved for a select one 

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:21.279
 group 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.220
 nevertheless, more and more hunters come every year to follow are ah of the least 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.779
 one of the Dutch hunting courses 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.130
 they can do that once they have obtained a hunting certificate 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.470
 They can in any case the German Dortmund on which the annual hunt 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.480
 fair really everything in the field of hunting can be found 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.520
 how is this year in the netherlands 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.810
 first you have bigger strong in rising fortunately 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.500
 because it went very slowly 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.640
 the elderly worth more yes but I already have a mandab 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.100
 well i just think there are many elderly people yes 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.240
 and they needed parents and vinyl blood 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.130
 and you now see a change that is coming, but it is certainly also due 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.860
 people often look for hunters in this time for a party 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.860
 attracts more nature and space 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.659
 after that the starting signal is earlier 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.490
 the stock exchange in germany and you can hunt demand from the time that a whole 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.490
 many people it seems that more and more season, why is that? 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.480
 well the netherlands is of course not big 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.260
 m but hunting ground, we of course have nothing in that huge supply of debate 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.250
 the big countries read that yes, that's why he really goes outside 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.030
 nijkerk further search yes and that is being played in germany 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.530
 done the truck hunt 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.690
 and people go farther away to the africa cup invent it little to canada 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.520
 is also a very good hunter and the rules are also drawn up differently
