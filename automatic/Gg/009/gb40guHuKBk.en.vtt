00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.749
 Hello guys 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.220
 today at the nutrition school we go 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:26.199
 talk about growth and weight gain 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:35.110
 subjects that are in day-to-day 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:36.040
 consultations with the child's pediatrician in 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.370
 average 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.320
 I was born with three pounds on average has 50 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.410
 centimeters in length 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.020
 of course there is this new variety 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.330
 depending on the time of gestation but the 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.000
 What matters is to in practical terms is 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.990
 three times the birth weight until the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.440
 first year 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.120
 so on average the baby has to win 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.720
 six pounds the first one to end the year 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.600
 with nine and earn half of it 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.119
 had to comply and urge 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.020
 until the end of the first year 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.710
 then ends the year with nine and 75 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.369
 centimeters 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.009
 this is the average from the second year onwards 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.950
 He should gain two and a half pounds. 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:24.069
 from there it gains around 12 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.710
 half an inch and then two 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.090
 years to puberty, which varies between 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.579
 the boys and girls 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:36.119
 on average they have to gain two pounds 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.119
 and grow from 6 to 7 cm cure 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.620
 It is important to understand this to remember that 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.480
 in the first year and earns three times the 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.060
 weight that he had at birth and 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.700
 ends the year with nine kilos more 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.190
 from there he earns much less because 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.540
 their nutritional needs are 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.400
 minors 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.620
 then that fuel he 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.200
 need the first year he does not need 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.300
 more than a second, much less the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.290
 from the third until you reach the 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.870
 puberty 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.780
 then this process of least need 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.540
 of nutrients less need for 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.990
 energy is normal that the physiological 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.180
 if you circumvent this process through 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.530
 called food errors 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.170
 thickening foods by putting sugars 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.450
 putting more fat in the food 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.520
 You 're certainly making some 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.800
 mistakes that will generate 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.560
 problems for your child to one of the 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.180
 major current obesity problems 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.180
 overweight and obesity 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.810
 I'm very happy when the 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.390
 office of the family and the mother with 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.300
 that air apprehensive look at myself 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.820
 I came here for a reason of the end in which 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.350
 but I swear he does not eat anything 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.450
 same 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.209
 since yesterday morning until today he has not 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.910
 because a spoon of food in my mouth I 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.610
 eye question that gives him is two years old 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.580
 two and a half and a half years 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.860
 How good your son is normal then 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.890
 From here we can reduce 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.239
 a little anxiety from the mother and we go to 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.459
 explanations 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.709
 so you need to understand that this 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.540
 process of lesser need for 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.180
 from one year onwards 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.790
 mainly from 2 years 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.459
 It's normal and with that your son will 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.040
 receive as long as you provide it 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.430
 just good food foods 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.110
 suitable for sure when he eats 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.470
 he eats healthy food and with that 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.410
 if you do not make the inappropriate substitutions 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.600
 with the so-called junkies of life 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.890
 candy the bullets 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.050
 cookies 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.600
 certainly when he eats it he is 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.670
 eating healthy food and the 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.330
 development will be much more 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.330
 proper 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:10.880
 this is an aspect that has a lot of 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:14.180
 has a lot of heritage among us. 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.830
 Brazilians who eat is good to stay 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.280
 pretty chubby 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:22.010
 the famous the cute baby bp lanyard baby 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.230
 that it had a fold and this is an aspect that 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.050
 we are increasingly concerned about the last 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.120
 years due to the obesity indexes 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.580
 and overweight that are increasing 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.980
 frighteningly our country in the world 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.970
 whole country but in a way that 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.940
 scary 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.250
 we have today around 30 to 40 per 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.500
 overweight in our 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.070
 youth in adolescents 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.190
 independent of social class and 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.440
 This comes from childhood is that nei 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.020
 that did not follow the programming 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.330
 metabolic by several factors and one of them 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.729
 are the countries where they have 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.770
 transform this baby 's baby with 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.169
 overweight since childhood 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.990
 a child who begins to have excess of 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.390
 weight in relation to stature something 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.200
 goes wrong in feeding this child 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:14.720
 or physical activity of that child and the 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.300
 roof has an obligation to show to the 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.880
 that this needs to be corrected for 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.009
 that we do not get to that point of the 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.009
 his son from him 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:27.719
 need to be overweight good personal 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.719
 For today it's only until the next
