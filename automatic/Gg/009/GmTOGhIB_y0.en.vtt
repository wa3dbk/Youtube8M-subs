00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
clear anymore I weren't sure we were

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.569 
clear anymore I weren't sure we were
advanced<00:00:52.469> depending<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.010> how<00:00:53.100> other<00:00:53.340> teams

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
advanced depending on how other teams

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.610 
advanced depending on how other teams
would<00:00:53.760> play<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.960> was<00:00:55.079> kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.410> scary

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
would play and so it was kind of a scary

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.709 
would play and so it was kind of a scary
moment<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:56.879> probably<00:00:57.239> like<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
moment and it was probably like the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.049 
moment and it was probably like the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.540 

look<00:01:24.510> like<00:01:24.630> you're<00:01:24.780> taking<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.170> seriously<00:01:25.860> it

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
look like you're taking it seriously it

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.370 
look like you're taking it seriously it
just<00:01:26.940> is<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.300> how<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.479> just<00:01:27.720> normally<00:01:27.869> play

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
just is not how you just normally play

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.920 
just is not how you just normally play
oh<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.820> kind<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.180> how<00:01:30.300> we<00:01:30.420> normally<00:01:30.750> play

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
oh it's kind of how we normally play

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.820 
oh it's kind of how we normally play
like<00:01:31.320> um<00:01:31.590> uh<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:33.960> lot<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.259> my<00:01:34.320> team<00:01:34.500> doesn't<00:01:34.740> take

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
like um uh a lot of my team doesn't take

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.770 
like um uh a lot of my team doesn't take
it<00:01:34.950> too<00:01:34.979> seriously<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.550> I<00:01:35.880> think<00:01:36.390> that's<00:01:36.509> like

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
it too seriously and I think that's like

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.389 
it too seriously and I think that's like
it's<00:01:37.200> not<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.500> much<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.710> weakness<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.280> is

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
it's not so much a weakness as it is

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:39.770 
it's not so much a weakness as it is
like<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.610> straight<00:01:38.940> for<00:01:39.180> us<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.570> like

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
like a straight for us because like

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.440 
like a straight for us because like
being<00:01:40.409> go<00:01:40.590> get<00:01:40.950> over<00:01:41.250> like<00:01:41.430> bad<00:01:41.700> initiations

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
being go get over like bad initiations

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.730 
being go get over like bad initiations
and<00:01:42.690> bad<00:01:42.840> teeth<00:01:43.050> bites<00:01:43.290> pretty<00:01:43.530> quickly

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and bad teeth bites pretty quickly

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.100 
and bad teeth bites pretty quickly
because<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.430> how<00:01:44.610> well<00:01:44.970> well<00:01:45.300> we<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.509> take

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
in the first two fights because work has

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.940

like the first two fights that they'll

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.650 
like the first two fights that they'll
have<00:02:42.420> good<00:02:42.570> initiation<00:02:43.020> so<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:44.220> was<00:02:44.340> just<00:02:44.460> like

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
have good initiation so it was just like

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.480

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
like a lance file I clinic got crushed

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.510 
like a lance file I clinic got crushed
um<00:02:51.050> is<00:02:52.050> really<00:02:52.440> easy<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:53.040> pretty<00:02:53.280> easy

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
um is really easy this is a pretty easy

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.970

game<00:02:53.730> for<00:02:53.760> us<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.240> think<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.800> might<00:02:55.950> be

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
game for us I think it might be

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.860 
game for us I think it might be
dangerous<00:02:56.250> now<00:02:56.640> because<00:02:57.030> we've<00:02:57.480> been<00:02:57.510> hiding

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
dangerous now because we've been hiding

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.570 
dangerous now because we've been hiding
our<00:02:58.110> pigs<00:02:58.320> for<00:02:58.590> most<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.890> tournament<00:02:59.340> and

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
then tomorrow like AAA knows how we play

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.530 
then tomorrow like AAA knows how we play
to<00:03:01.770> definitely<00:03:02.130> be<00:03:02.280> asking<00:03:02.640> teams<00:03:02.850> like<00:03:03.000> how

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
to beat us and I know they're considered

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.040 
to beat us and I know they're considered
to<00:03:05.880> be<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.090> at<00:03:06.240> least<00:03:06.330> like<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.660> top<00:03:06.870> two

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
strongest teams in Europe top three so

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.450 
strongest teams in Europe top three so
we're<00:03:10.080> they<00:03:10.560> could<00:03:10.740> probably<00:03:10.920> add<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.190> pretty

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
we're they could probably add a pretty

always pretty nervous this is kind of
what<00:03:22.140> happens<00:03:22.560> when<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:22.770> play<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.310> little<00:03:23.700> bit

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
what happens when I play a little bit

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.750 
what happens when I play a little bit
nervous<00:03:24.000> about<00:03:24.180> how<00:03:24.660> things<00:03:24.840> go<00:03:25.290> up<00:03:25.470> go<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.459> I

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.360 
nervous about how things go up go on I
want<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.390> say<00:03:27.510> though<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:28.040> because<00:03:29.040> their

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
want to say though that because their

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.150 
want to say though that because their
top<00:03:29.610> laner<00:03:29.850> jungler<00:03:30.390> are<00:03:30.600> weaker<00:03:30.989> than<00:03:31.160> ours

top laner jungler are weaker than ours
at<00:03:32.940> least<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.270> feel<00:03:33.540> we<00:03:34.410> should<00:03:34.440> have<00:03:34.650> no<00:03:34.770> issue

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
at least I feel we should have no issue

at least I feel we should have no issue
being<00:03:35.220> able<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.520> take<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.730> game<00:03:35.880> even<00:03:36.120> if<00:03:36.480> like

made our father loses it just depends on

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.630 
made our father loses it just depends on
how<00:03:39.570> we<00:03:39.630> fight<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.380> feel<00:03:40.739> like<00:03:40.830> we<00:03:40.950> can<00:03:41.070> take<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.610> a

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
how we fight I feel like we can take a a

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.390 
how we fight I feel like we can take a a
pretty<00:03:42.269> easily<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:43.470> maybe<00:03:43.739> not<00:03:43.920> easily<00:03:44.190> like

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
pretty easily that maybe not easily like

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.120 
pretty easily that maybe not easily like
I<00:03:44.489> expect<00:03:44.940> like<00:03:45.030> something<00:03:45.390> like<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.540> 2-1<00:03:45.900> win

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
I expect like something like a 2-1 win

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.110 
I expect like something like a 2-1 win
but<00:03:47.130> like<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.400> two<00:03:47.550> ways<00:03:47.700> being<00:03:47.910> pretty

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
but like the two ways being pretty

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.490 
but like the two ways being pretty

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
certain things like we ended up throwing

certain things like we ended up throwing
the<00:04:31.710> gaming<00:04:31.919> it<00:04:31.980> to<00:04:32.100> that<00:04:32.250> because<00:04:32.460> we

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
the gaming it to that because we

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.480 
the gaming it to that because we
couldn't<00:04:33.060> hear<00:04:33.300> what<00:04:33.390> we<00:04:33.510> were<00:04:33.540> saying<00:04:33.630> and

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
couldn't hear what we were saying and

couldn't hear what we were saying and
even<00:04:35.490> though<00:04:35.580> we<00:04:35.700> were<00:04:35.820> ahead<00:04:36.030> by<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.720> largest

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
even though we were ahead by the largest

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.580 
even though we were ahead by the largest
amount<00:04:37.620> of<00:04:37.710> any<00:04:38.250> team<00:04:38.490> as<00:04:38.640> in<00:04:38.760> ahead<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.210> lost

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
amount of any team as in ahead and lost

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.430 
amount of any team as in ahead and lost
it<00:04:40.590> was<00:04:40.740> just<00:04:41.120> a<00:04:42.120> compilation<00:04:42.750> of<00:04:43.110> like<00:04:43.260> you

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
it was just a compilation of like you

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.409 
it was just a compilation of like you
can't<00:04:43.740> be<00:04:43.950> lacks<00:04:44.370> in<00:04:44.760> this<00:04:45.000> environment

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
can't be lacks in this environment

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.180 
can't be lacks in this environment
because<00:04:45.930> I'll<00:04:46.169> an<00:04:46.320> event<00:04:46.620> if<00:04:46.740> you<00:04:46.830> get<00:04:46.950> locks

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
because I'll an event if you get locks

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.550 
because I'll an event if you get locks
you<00:04:47.790> get<00:04:47.940> eaten<00:04:48.180> by<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.630> other<00:04:48.780> team<00:04:48.870> so

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
you get eaten by the other team so

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.000 
you get eaten by the other team so
you're<00:04:49.740> expecting<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.400> see<00:04:51.090> where<00:04:51.890> would<00:04:52.890> you

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
you're expecting to see where would you

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.839 
you're expecting to see where would you
rather<00:04:53.190> play

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
rather play

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.570 
rather play
oh<00:04:55.379> it's<00:04:56.379> a<00:04:56.499> grand<00:04:56.709> finals<00:04:57.069> actually<00:04:57.339> because

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
oh it's a grand finals actually because

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.359 
oh it's a grand finals actually because
yeah<00:04:57.999> there's<00:04:58.300> no<00:04:58.419> double<00:04:58.689> lib<00:04:58.869> so<00:04:59.289> yeah<00:04:59.469> um<00:04:59.679> I

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:00.369 
yeah there's no double lib so yeah um I

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:03.059 
yeah there's no double lib so yeah um I
think<00:05:00.969> we'd<00:05:01.330> much<00:05:01.479> rather<00:05:01.509> play<00:05:01.869> CLG<00:05:02.349> minute

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
think we'd much rather play CLG minute

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.010 
think we'd much rather play CLG minute
five<00:05:03.249> I<00:05:03.490> think<00:05:03.699> in<00:05:03.819> five<00:05:03.999> sets<00:05:04.360> a<00:05:04.479> very<00:05:04.599> scary

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
five I think in five sets a very scary

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.829 
five I think in five sets a very scary
scary<00:05:05.559> early<00:05:05.860> game<00:05:06.039> and<00:05:06.309> no<00:05:06.759> team<00:05:07.089> does<00:05:07.569> it<00:05:07.719> as

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:07.839 
scary early game and no team does it as

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:10.260 
scary early game and no team does it as
well<00:05:08.050> as<00:05:08.199> they<00:05:08.319> do<00:05:08.379> and<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:09.459> we<00:05:09.580> have<00:05:09.699> confirmed

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
well as they do and so we have confirmed

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.730 
well as they do and so we have confirmed
consistent<00:05:10.809> results<00:05:11.139> against<00:05:11.319> theology

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
consistent results against theology

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.809 
consistent results against theology
we're<00:05:11.919> probably<00:05:12.099> like<00:05:12.339> whether<00:05:12.520> the<00:05:12.639> teams

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
we're probably like whether the teams

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.480 
we're probably like whether the teams
that<00:05:12.879> beat<00:05:12.999> CLG<00:05:13.569> the<00:05:13.659> most<00:05:13.839> consistently<00:05:14.490> so

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
that beat CLG the most consistently so

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.119 
that beat CLG the most consistently so
they<00:05:15.819> make<00:05:15.969> it<00:05:16.119> through<00:05:16.330> of<00:05:16.770> we<00:05:17.770> should<00:05:17.979> be

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:18.129 
they make it through of we should be

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:19.529 
they make it through of we should be
okay<00:05:18.429> there's<00:05:18.669> still<00:05:18.789> a<00:05:18.819> very<00:05:18.999> strong<00:05:19.300> team

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
okay there's still a very strong team

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.719 
okay there's still a very strong team
but<00:05:20.349> um<00:05:22.559> we<00:05:23.559> play<00:05:23.830> patient<00:05:24.279> enough<00:05:24.399> to<00:05:24.459> be<00:05:24.580> able

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
but um we play patient enough to be able

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.179 
but um we play patient enough to be able
to<00:05:24.879> beat<00:05:24.999> them<00:05:25.209> within<00:05:25.809> five<00:05:26.229> like<00:05:26.499> a<00:05:26.709> lot<00:05:27.099> of

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:27.189 
to beat them within five like a lot of

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:28.230 
to beat them within five like a lot of
these<00:05:27.279> are<00:05:27.429> up<00:05:27.490> in<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.639> air<00:05:27.699> we've<00:05:28.059> never

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
these are up in the air we've never

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.429 
these are up in the air we've never
faced<00:05:28.509> each<00:05:28.659> other<00:05:28.779> in<00:05:28.899> the<00:05:28.990> competitive

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:29.439 
faced each other in the competitive

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:30.689 
faced each other in the competitive
environment<00:05:30.009> we've<00:05:30.099> never<00:05:30.219> faced<00:05:30.459> each<00:05:30.610> other

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
environment we've never faced each other

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.600 
environment we've never faced each other
online<00:05:31.209> when<00:05:31.599> of<00:05:31.689> different<00:05:31.929> servers<00:05:32.429> and<00:05:33.429> so

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
online when of different servers and so

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.919 
online when of different servers and so
it's<00:05:33.789> gonna<00:05:33.939> be<00:05:34.029> whichever<00:05:34.269> team<00:05:34.509> can<00:05:34.659> adapt

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:34.929 
it's gonna be whichever team can adapt

00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:39.119 
it's gonna be whichever team can adapt
the<00:05:35.080> other<00:05:35.259> one<00:05:35.409> better<00:05:35.499> and<00:05:37.469> like<00:05:38.469> when<00:05:39.099> you

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:39.129 
the other one better and like when you

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:40.649 
the other one better and like when you
have<00:05:39.309> that<00:05:39.429> big<00:05:39.580> of<00:05:39.729> a<00:05:39.789> risk<00:05:39.939> like<00:05:40.300> I'd<00:05:40.509> much

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
have that big of a risk like I'd much

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.389 
have that big of a risk like I'd much
rather<00:05:40.689> have<00:05:41.080> look<00:05:41.679> like<00:05:41.740> we're<00:05:42.009> city<00:05:42.279> I'd

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:42.399 
rather have look like we're city I'd

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:45.209 
rather have look like we're city I'd
like<00:05:42.519> the<00:05:42.639> tables<00:05:43.029> I'd<00:05:43.749> like<00:05:44.019> like<00:05:44.589> the<00:05:45.009> AAA

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:45.219 
like the tables I'd like like the AAA
