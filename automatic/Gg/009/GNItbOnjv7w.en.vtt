00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.770
 oosting 3 construction street 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.259
 with construction beams 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:07.949
 consume the image 

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:11.329
 object commander on the left 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:15.649
 that lies ahead is going through the lens in this case to indicate positive people 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.919
 and a plus 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:23.210
 constructed behind the lens in a world that you can really take care of 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.589
 the screens 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.519
 and we are going to see how that is done 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.119
 with every blade at these mills 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.170
 do you have m focal point the focal point in the bud and indicate a piece with rory 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.650
 little spot 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.650
 that domain is on the left and on the right 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.850
 and so the borremans demand, the stronger the wish 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.370
 the closer a focal point 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.290
 get stuck with that 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.950
 I'll be here 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.800
 one upper case letter 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.800
 f to set 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.870
 focal point 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.310
 the distance from 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.510
 The lens up to the focal point that we call must be a focal length 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.510
 indicate with a lowercase letter 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.740
 that is the distance 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.290
 and that is a lowercase letter f 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
 the distance from a leak caused a fire 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.830
 with an object was presented on the left 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.580
 the image 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.860
 sign for this also indicated with an arrow 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.140
 and the distance from the lens to the object destroys harry man 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.580
 that goal 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.000
 furthermore distance and no adhere to 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 lowercase letter v 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.500
 the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.160
 construction stairs rays start drawing 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.160
 draw the construction streets from the top point of the track 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.529
 suit to count 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.859
 color for 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.489
 her 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.489
 and then we will draw that 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.679
 the to come 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.299
 the ground 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.159
 6 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.399
 m 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.559
 i start the top 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.559
 and they go horizontally to the lens 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.129
 and now spring is being broken into by lens 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.119
 through the focal point 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.119
 that's a loan 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.739
 the second line starts again from the same point at the top of the object 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.739
 leno lead 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.829
 you now see an intersection 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.369
 if it's okay 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:11.639
 comes the third point because there is no need for more rain 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.979
 third point goes again from the top of the track others we go immediately 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.569
 at the focal points of the left 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.389
 up to the lens 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:23.409
 and then it goes 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:25.949
 the fens horizontally 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.949
 who sees it is not quite right 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.869
 because i might be here 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:35.279
 too little to let go in Siberia 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:39.219
 well you get here an intersection and the intersection that this 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.400
 that is actually this point that is now 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.729
 over there 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:46.729
 stabbing again 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.639
 it is now 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.349
 upside down 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.649
 the image is therefore constructed upside down 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:58.109
 Also in our eyes our eyes has positive people 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.449
 and on our retina 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.449
 they have to project everything on the pcob 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.359
 the distance 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.079
 the distance 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.539
 is 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.839
 the image up to the lens 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:14.839
 we indicate with a lowercase p 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.019
 and W 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.779
 thereby 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.360
 image ap city 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.650
 who we clarify too late who say 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.409
 so that products and is 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:30.270
 the fire 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.139
 point 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.139
 distance 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.550
 also will be focal point 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.210
 the edge 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.569
 distance 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.720
 small tip 2 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.020
 in front of 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.080
 how works 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.270
 distance 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.789
 distance as obstructing 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.199
 and the visual language position distance 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.610
 this image 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.610
 and leads 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:12.859
 but now you see the difference in the size of the spring and the image 

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:14.439
 clearly visible 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:18.989
 Calculate this budget by the size of the image that is the length 

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:20.970
 of shoe stick 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.520
 because greener delft 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.520
 the danes by the length of 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.490
 see the green image on the left side of the front 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.159
 this way you get the enlarge 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.199
 these signs of construction radiate
