00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
breaking I seem to have found the reason

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.279 
breaking I seem to have found the reason
why<00:00:16.800> they<00:00:17.039> are<00:00:17.070> breaking<00:00:17.900> someone<00:00:18.900> already

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
why they are breaking someone already

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.349 
why they are breaking someone already
posted<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.130> video<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.029> spoke<00:00:21.300> about

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
posted in a video and you spoke about

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.099 
posted in a video and you spoke about
the<00:00:22.350> fact<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.769> these<00:00:23.250> copper<00:00:23.939> washes<00:00:24.390> are

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the fact that these copper washes are

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.419 
the fact that these copper washes are
causing<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.210> starts<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.420> break<00:00:27.689> which<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.859> have

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
causing the starts to break which I have

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.420 
causing the starts to break which I have
seen<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.420> be<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> true<00:00:30.990> thing<00:00:31.189> what<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.219> have

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
seen to be a true thing what I have

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.819 
seen to be a true thing what I have
marked<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.239> truck<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.079> if<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.559> look

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
marked on this truck here is if you look

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.330 
marked on this truck here is if you look
on<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:36.059> study<00:00:36.390> here<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.010> start

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
on this study here this is the start

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.610 
on this study here this is the start
that<00:00:38.430> didn't<00:00:39.000> have<00:00:39.239> one<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.110> these<00:00:40.320> washers

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
that didn't have one of these washers

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.229 
that didn't have one of these washers
here<00:00:41.239> okay<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:43.410> what<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.489> noticed<00:00:44.820> is

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
here okay and what I have noticed is

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.229 
here okay and what I have noticed is
that<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:46.289> quotes<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.039> actually<00:00:47.940> studs

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
that the quotes that have actually studs

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.869 
that the quotes that have actually studs
that<00:00:48.390> are<00:00:48.539> actually<00:00:49.140> breaking<00:00:49.550> this<00:00:50.550> does

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
that are actually breaking this does

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.619 
that are actually breaking this does
that<00:00:51.329> dingy<00:00:51.960> heavy<00:00:52.379> copper<00:00:52.920> washes<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.760> this

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
that dingy heavy copper washes on this

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.869 
that dingy heavy copper washes on this
does<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.260> depth<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.590> copper<00:00:55.920> washes<00:00:56.280> if

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
does that in depth the copper washes if

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.450 
does that in depth the copper washes if
you<00:00:57.059> look<00:00:57.270> at<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.719> one<00:00:57.960> here<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.649> this

copper washer is not broken yet but most

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.060

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
to avoid them from breaking is look at

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.679 
to avoid them from breaking is look at
this<00:01:47.640> if<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:49.049> one<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.530> broken<00:01:50.360> that<00:01:51.360> means

this if this one is broken that means

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.940 
this if this one is broken that means
your<00:01:51.930> next<00:01:52.380> one

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
middle if this one is broken that means

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.530 
middle if this one is broken that means
the<00:01:58.860> next<00:01:59.219> start<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.969> going<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.390> your

the next start is going to have your
washer<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.680> next<00:02:02.100> start<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.880> have

do not check off the start the nuts
won't<00:02:11.340> stop

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
won't stop

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.110 
won't stop
rather<00:02:13.290> than<00:02:13.620> check<00:02:14.010> off<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.519> start<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:18.090> that

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
rather than check off the start so that

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.050 
rather than check off the start so that
when<00:02:19.079> you<00:02:19.170> take<00:02:19.349> off<00:02:19.530> not<00:02:19.950> on<00:02:20.159> the<00:02:20.310> start<00:02:20.670> you

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
when you take off not on the start you

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.750 
when you take off not on the start you
also<00:02:21.269> have<00:02:21.629> to<00:02:21.810> take<00:02:21.989> off<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.829> nut<00:02:23.069> on<00:02:23.400> this

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
also have to take off the nut on this

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.729 
also have to take off the nut on this
tab<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.890> nut<00:02:26.129> on<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.610> stop<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.870> then

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
tab and the nut on that stop and then

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.420 
tab and the nut on that stop and then
finally<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.340> take<00:02:29.579> off<00:02:29.819> these<00:02:30.680> nuts<00:02:31.680> here

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
finally you take off these nuts here

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.319 
finally you take off these nuts here
that<00:02:33.019> have<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.290> copper<00:02:34.799> washers<00:02:35.159> on<00:02:35.340> them<00:02:35.549> if

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
that have the copper washers on them if

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.690 
that have the copper washers on them if
you<00:02:36.720> do<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.379> are<00:02:37.470> going<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.769> avoid<00:02:38.129> your

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
you do that you are going to avoid your

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.720 
you do that you are going to avoid your
studs<00:02:39.209> from<00:02:39.510> breaking<00:02:40.099> but<00:02:41.099> if<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.430> are<00:02:41.549> going

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
studs from breaking but if you are going

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.170 
studs from breaking but if you are going
to<00:02:41.909> take<00:02:42.150> off<00:02:42.420> your<00:02:43.200> your<00:02:43.650> your<00:02:44.250> your<00:02:44.459> lug<00:02:44.819> nuts

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
to take off your your your your lug nuts

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.559 
to take off your your your your lug nuts
from<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.620> start<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.909> a<00:02:47.940> proper<00:02:48.389> wash

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
from this start that is a proper wash

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.619 
from this start that is a proper wash
alone<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.650> yet<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:50.819> one<00:02:51.060> will<00:02:51.239> be<00:02:51.359> still

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
alone and yet this one will be still

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.250 
alone and yet this one will be still
tied<00:02:51.930> most<00:02:52.620> likely<00:02:53.069> this<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.400> going<00:02:53.609> to<00:02:53.760> break

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
tied most likely this is going to break

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.349 
tied most likely this is going to break
and<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.470> what<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.799> need<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:55.980> do<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.549> you<00:02:57.239> need

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
and so what you need to do is you need

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:58.399 
and so what you need to do is you need
to<00:02:57.420> go<00:02:57.810> first

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
to go first

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.199 
to go first
the<00:02:58.590> middle<00:02:59.040> ones<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.430> have<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.849> copper

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
the middle ones that have a copper

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.819 
the middle ones that have a copper
washer<00:03:00.359> on<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:02.209> both<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.510> quality<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.290> about

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
one two three four that we have your

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.750 
one two three four that we have your
copper<00:03:09.359> washes<00:03:09.690> on<00:03:09.900> but<00:03:10.739> if<00:03:10.980> none<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.220> them<00:03:11.549> is

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
copper washes on but if none of them is

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.610 
copper washes on but if none of them is
broken<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.329> will<00:03:12.480> be<00:03:12.599> hard<00:03:12.870> for<00:03:13.049> you<00:03:13.199> to<00:03:13.379> tell

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
broken it will be hard for you to tell

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.069 
broken it will be hard for you to tell
which<00:03:14.400> one<00:03:14.609> is<00:03:14.790> doesn't<00:03:15.449> have<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.750> copper

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
which one is doesn't have the copper

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.559 
which one is doesn't have the copper
washer<00:03:16.199> but<00:03:16.980> if<00:03:17.190> any<00:03:17.489> one<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.760> them<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.269> broken

washer but if any one of them is broken
then<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.019> need<00:03:19.199> to<00:03:19.319> follow<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.650> pattern<00:03:19.799> that

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
then you need to follow the pattern that

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
this works and this is on a 2012 Dodge

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.909 
this works and this is on a 2012 Dodge
Ram<00:03:28.430> 2500<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:30.139> this<00:03:31.139> does<00:03:31.379> have<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.709> tendency

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
Ram 2500 and this does have a tendency

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.819 
Ram 2500 and this does have a tendency
of<00:03:32.190> breaking<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:33.329> remedy<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.810> do<00:03:34.109> that<00:03:34.319> is<00:03:34.590> to

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
of breaking the remedy to do that is to

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.740 
of breaking the remedy to do that is to
take<00:03:35.040> this<00:03:35.250> copper<00:03:35.549> washes<00:03:35.970> off<00:03:36.180> as<00:03:36.419> I<00:03:36.629> have

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
take this copper washes off as I have

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.339 
take this copper washes off as I have
done<00:03:36.959> now<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:38.400> then<00:03:39.329> your<00:03:39.810> wheel<00:03:40.049> when<00:03:40.319> it

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
done now and then your wheel when it

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.740 
done now and then your wheel when it
sheets<00:03:40.769> is<00:03:40.919> going<00:03:41.099> to<00:03:41.190> sit<00:03:41.400> flat<00:03:41.750> but

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
sheets is going to sit flat but

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.750 
sheets is going to sit flat but
according<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.650> pairing<00:03:44.069> of<00:03:44.160> breakage<00:03:44.639> on

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
according to the pairing of breakage on

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.330 
according to the pairing of breakage on
this<00:03:45.000> track<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.329> can<00:03:45.720> see<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:46.139> something<00:03:47.040> to

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
this track you can see that something to

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.220 
this track you can see that something to
do<00:03:47.549> with<00:03:47.699> those<00:03:47.910> copper<00:03:48.299> washes<00:03:48.690> and

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
do with those copper washes and

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.069 
do with those copper washes and
something<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.889> do<00:03:50.040> with<00:03:50.129> the<00:03:50.250> fact<00:03:50.489> that<00:03:50.609> these

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
something to do with the fact that these

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.899 
something to do with the fact that these
studs<00:03:52.079> are<00:03:52.319> being<00:03:52.680> stressed<00:03:53.010> out<00:03:53.280> because<00:03:53.489> of

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
studs are being stressed out because of

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.809 
studs are being stressed out because of
the<00:03:54.510> proportions<00:03:55.199> on<00:03:55.349> the<00:03:55.530> other<00:03:55.650> bones

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
the proportions on the other bones

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.449 
the proportions on the other bones
and<00:03:56.909> most<00:03:57.480> likely<00:03:57.870> this<00:03:58.019> is<00:03:58.260> this<00:03:58.890> is<00:03:59.099> due<00:03:59.310> to

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
and most likely this is this is due to

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.250 
and most likely this is this is due to
the<00:03:59.579> fact<00:03:59.760> that<00:03:59.909> the<00:04:00.209> wheel<00:04:00.420> that<00:04:00.659> is<00:04:00.870> on<00:04:01.079> this

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
the fact that the wheel that is on this

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.559 
the fact that the wheel that is on this
truck<00:04:01.590> is<00:04:02.219> an<00:04:02.459> aftermarket<00:04:02.819> wheel<00:04:03.359> and

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
truck is an aftermarket wheel and

truck is an aftermarket wheel and
doesn't<00:04:04.349> give<00:04:04.680> room<00:04:05.609> for<00:04:05.999> those<00:04:06.269> washes<00:04:07.049> at
