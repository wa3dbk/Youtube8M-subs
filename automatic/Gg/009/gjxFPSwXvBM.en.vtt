it to the to the max processors as

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.479 
it to the to the max processors as
possible<00:02:06.210> now<00:02:06.780> if<00:02:06.990> you're<00:02:07.170> at<00:02:07.380> quad<00:02:07.680> core<00:02:08.069> set

possible now if you're at quad core set

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.940 
possible now if you're at quad core set
it<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.879> max<00:02:09.179> but<00:02:09.539> i<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.869> only<00:02:10.229> dual<00:02:10.500> core

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
it to the max but i have only dual core

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.590 
it to the max but i have only dual core
so<00:02:11.610> I

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
so I

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.870 
so I
they<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.960> to<00:02:13.400> click<00:02:14.400> OK<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.680> now<00:02:16.820> go<00:02:17.820> to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
they have to click OK and now go to

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.820 
they have to click OK and now go to
services<00:02:18.240> tab<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:20.240> go<00:02:21.240> check<00:02:21.840> hide<00:02:22.440> all

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.290 
services tab and go check hide all
Microsoft<00:02:23.460> services<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:25.610> uncheck<00:02:26.610> the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
Microsoft services and uncheck the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.300 
Microsoft services and uncheck the
startup<00:02:27.810> items<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.680> do<00:02:28.920> not<00:02:28.980> need

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
startup items that you do not need

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.430 
startup items that you do not need
because<00:02:29.900> many<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.560> startup<00:02:31.950> items<00:02:32.430> have

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
because many of the startup items have

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.270 
because many of the startup items have
delays<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.940> this<00:02:35.940> will<00:02:36.800> slow<00:02:37.800> down<00:02:37.830> your

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
delays and this will slow down your

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.170 
delays and this will slow down your
computer<00:02:39.260> mostly<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:42.440> now<00:02:43.440> um<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.400> haven't

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
computer mostly so now um I haven't

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.730 
computer mostly so now um I haven't
checked<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.900> ma<00:02:46.440> new<00:02:47.340> video<00:02:48.140> but<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.470> need<00:02:49.710> to

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
check all this because now these two are

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.290 
check all this because now these two are
important<00:02:53.160> because<00:02:53.310> i<00:02:53.580> use<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.120> most
