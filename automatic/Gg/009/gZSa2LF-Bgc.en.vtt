next I put the pancake batter into a
squeeze<00:01:28.330> bottle<00:01:28.539> so<00:01:28.840> I<00:01:28.869> can<00:01:29.229> use<00:01:29.350> it<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.590> draw

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
squeeze bottle so I can use it to draw

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.469 
squeeze bottle so I can use it to draw
with<00:01:31.920> now<00:01:32.920> for<00:01:33.310> darker<00:01:33.850> colors<00:01:34.090> I<00:01:34.240> like<00:01:34.330> to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
throw in a couple scoops of cocoa into

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.609 
throw in a couple scoops of cocoa into
the<00:01:36.700> mix<00:01:36.880> to<00:01:37.569> give<00:01:37.720> it<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:37.869> different<00:01:37.990> variation

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619

cocoa<00:01:47.130> into<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> mix<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.990> use<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.530> for

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
cocoa into the mix and I use this for

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.690 
cocoa into the mix and I use this for
drawing<00:01:50.280> all<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.520> line<00:01:50.670> work<00:01:52.400> there<00:01:53.400> we<00:01:53.520> go

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.280 

so<00:01:57.270> now<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> had<00:01:57.689> three<00:01:57.930> different<00:01:58.200> values<00:02:00.290> like

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
so now I had three different values like

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.749 
so now I had three different values like
am<00:02:01.409> i<00:02:01.500> light<00:02:02.479> got<00:02:03.479> my<00:02:03.600> dark<00:02:04.430> can<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.490> got<00:02:05.640> my

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
am i light got my dark can I got my

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.029 
am i light got my dark can I got my
meteor<00:02:07.220> now<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.250> put<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.119> heat<00:02:09.360> pan<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.830> low

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
meteor now I put the heat pan on the low

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.100 
meteor now I put the heat pan on the low
setting<00:02:11.280> possible<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:13.459> lightly<00:02:14.510> grease<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.690> oil

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
setting possible I lightly grease it oil

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.300 
setting possible I lightly grease it oil
whatever<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.950> want

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
whatever you want

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.199 
whatever you want
not<00:02:17.610> sure<00:02:17.790> but<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.510> what<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.720> got

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.349 

now<00:02:23.810> it's<00:02:24.049> time<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.290> get<00:02:24.379> into<00:02:24.500> drawing<00:02:25.359> okay

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
now it's time to get into drawing okay

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.899 
now it's time to get into drawing okay
so<00:02:26.420> this<00:02:26.750> time<00:02:26.810> I<00:02:27.349> figured<00:02:27.829> I'd<00:02:28.730> do<00:02:28.879> a

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
so this time I figured I'd do a

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.640 
so this time I figured I'd do a
character<00:02:29.299> that<00:02:29.420> everybody<00:02:29.750> knows<00:02:30.109> seems<00:02:30.590> to

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
character that everybody knows seems to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.899 
character that everybody knows seems to
be<00:02:30.769> very<00:02:31.010> popular<00:02:31.159> these<00:02:31.640> days

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
be very popular these days

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:38.140 
be very popular these days

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.449 
method here but I kind of have a good
idea<00:02:44.299> I'm<00:02:44.930> actually<00:02:45.170> having<00:02:45.469> a<00:02:45.859> lot<00:02:46.400> of

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
idea I'm actually having a lot of

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.610 
idea I'm actually having a lot of
problems<00:02:46.760> with<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.329> flow<00:02:47.659> of<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.079> paint<00:02:48.409> cook

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
problems with the flow of the paint cook

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.080 
problems with the flow of the paint cook
better<00:02:48.829> but<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.459> think<00:02:49.819> it's<00:02:49.939> because<00:02:50.590> one<00:02:52.090> it's

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
better but I think it's because one it's

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.640 
better but I think it's because one it's
new<00:02:53.299> bottle<00:02:53.629> and<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.079> holes<00:02:54.260> not<00:02:54.439> big<00:02:54.500> enough

with<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:23.279> bottles<00:05:24.279> it's<00:05:24.789> kind<00:05:24.999> of<00:05:25.059> different

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:25.209 
with the bottles it's kind of different

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:28.169 
with the bottles it's kind of different
on<00:05:25.449> it<00:05:25.599> I'm<00:05:26.349> not<00:05:26.529> used<00:05:26.739> to<00:05:26.829> working<00:05:26.979> I'm<00:05:27.459> used

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:28.179 
on it I'm not used to working I'm used

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:30.959 
on it I'm not used to working I'm used
to<00:05:28.209> working<00:05:28.360> more<00:05:28.599> precise<00:05:28.899> but<00:05:29.169> hey<00:05:29.969> anyway

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:30.969 
to working more precise but hey anyway

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:32.850 
to working more precise but hey anyway
so<00:05:31.659> right<00:05:31.839> here<00:05:32.019> I<00:05:32.050> just<00:05:32.139> kind<00:05:32.439> of<00:05:32.499> spit<00:05:32.649> up<00:05:32.769> a

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
so right here I just kind of spit up a

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.559 
so right here I just kind of spit up a
little<00:05:33.009> bit<00:05:33.189> I<00:05:33.309> just<00:05:33.519> pick<00:05:33.729> Li<00:05:34.059> cover<00:05:34.360> the

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
little bit I just pick Li cover the

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:41.579 
little bit I just pick Li cover the
whole<00:05:34.869> face<00:05:35.469> with<00:05:36.219> pancake<00:05:36.669> batter<00:05:36.849> and<00:05:40.589> yeah

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:41.589 
whole face with pancake batter and yeah

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:42.689 
whole face with pancake batter and yeah
I'm<00:05:41.649> trying<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:41.919> think<00:05:42.039> of<00:05:42.129> some<00:05:42.309> sort<00:05:42.639> of

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
I'm trying to think of some sort of

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:46.379 
I'm trying to think of some sort of
advice<00:05:43.179> I<00:05:43.360> can<00:05:43.419> give<00:05:43.719> I<00:05:44.019> would<00:05:44.860> say<00:05:45.249> one<00:05:45.999> check

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
advice I can give I would say one check

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.659 
advice I can give I would say one check
the<00:05:46.659> flow<00:05:47.169> of<00:05:47.679> the<00:05:47.860> pancake<00:05:48.219> butter<00:05:48.369> I<00:05:48.459> think

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
the flow of the pancake butter I think

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.479 
the flow of the pancake butter I think
that<00:05:48.789> seems<00:05:48.999> to<00:05:49.089> be<00:05:49.149> the<00:05:49.300> key<00:05:49.569> and<00:05:50.309> whether<00:05:51.309> you

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:51.489 
that seems to be the key and whether you

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:56.279 
that seems to be the key and whether you
succeed<00:05:51.669> or<00:05:51.879> fail<00:05:51.969> at<00:05:52.929> this<00:05:53.229> end<00:05:53.649> but<00:05:55.289> I'm

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
succeed or fail at this end but I'm

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.359 
succeed or fail at this end but I'm
basically<00:05:56.559> just<00:05:56.799> showing<00:05:57.069> you<00:05:57.219> basically

00:05:57.359 --> 00:05:57.369 
basically just showing you basically

00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:00.929 
basically just showing you basically
actually<00:05:58.059> how<00:05:58.509> I<00:05:58.539> make<00:05:58.869> it<00:05:59.019> so<00:05:59.339> the<00:06:00.339> next<00:06:00.369> one's

00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:00.939 
actually how I make it so the next one's

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:02.699 
actually how I make it so the next one's
ought<00:06:01.029> to<00:06:01.179> try<00:06:01.360> to<00:06:01.419> make<00:06:01.599> the<00:06:01.779> light

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:02.709 
ought to try to make the light

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:04.290 
ought to try to make the light
draftsmanship<00:06:03.279> a<00:06:03.519> lot<00:06:03.669> better<00:06:03.909> for<00:06:04.179> these

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
draftsmanship a lot better for these

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.869 
draftsmanship a lot better for these
pancakes<00:06:04.709> but<00:06:05.709> like<00:06:05.919> I<00:06:05.949> said<00:06:06.069> this<00:06:06.339> is<00:06:06.550> for

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:06.879 
pancakes but like I said this is for

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:09.119 
pancakes but like I said this is for
educational<00:06:07.749> purposes<00:06:08.289> look<00:06:08.619> like<00:06:08.860> how<00:06:09.099> I

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:09.129 
educational purposes look like how I

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:11.100 
educational purposes look like how I
actually<00:06:09.399> make<00:06:09.789> them<00:06:09.939> so<00:06:10.119> hopefully<00:06:10.509> you'll

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
actually make them so hopefully you'll

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.839 
actually make them so hopefully you'll
all<00:06:11.349> get<00:06:11.679> a<00:06:11.739> chance<00:06:11.800> to<00:06:12.099> make<00:06:12.339> some<00:06:12.519> yourself

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
all get a chance to make some yourself

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:14.399 
all get a chance to make some yourself
and<00:06:13.149> actually<00:06:13.569> I'd<00:06:13.839> like<00:06:13.959> to<00:06:14.050> see<00:06:14.169> what<00:06:14.289> you
