I'm gonna be talking about to you guys
about<00:00:16.720> something<00:00:17.230> that<00:00:17.320> I<00:00:17.380> think<00:00:17.500> is<00:00:17.800> really

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
about something that I think is really

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.550 
about something that I think is really
under<00:00:18.280> use<00:00:18.490> which<00:00:19.090> is<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:19.560> hallucination

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
under use which is the hallucination

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.650 
under use which is the hallucination
upgrade<00:00:20.920> from<00:00:21.340> the<00:00:21.520> cybernetics<00:00:22.060> core<00:00:22.300> for

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
upgrade from the cybernetics core for

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.990 
upgrade from the cybernetics core for
the<00:00:22.779> centuries<00:00:23.529> now<00:00:24.279> the<00:00:24.340> upgrade<00:00:24.730> itself

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
the centuries now the upgrade itself

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.990 
the centuries now the upgrade itself
only<00:00:25.240> costs<00:00:25.890> one<00:00:26.890> hundred<00:00:26.920> minerals<00:00:27.760> and<00:00:27.910> one

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
only costs one hundred minerals and one

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.150 
only costs one hundred minerals and one
hundred<00:00:28.270> gas<00:00:28.420> and<00:00:28.780> it's<00:00:29.380> really<00:00:29.740> underused

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
hundred gas and it's really underused

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.830 
hundred gas and it's really underused
and<00:00:30.279> I<00:00:30.430> think<00:00:30.670> that<00:00:30.789> it<00:00:30.940> can<00:00:31.060> actually<00:00:31.270> be<00:00:31.480> very

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
and I think that it can actually be very

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.260 
and I think that it can actually be very
beneficial<00:00:32.440> for<00:00:32.860> what<00:00:33.190> you<00:00:33.280> need<00:00:33.430> to<00:00:33.520> do<00:00:33.670> so

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
beneficial for what you need to do so

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.410 
beneficial for what you need to do so
let's<00:00:34.960> get<00:00:35.140> started<00:00:35.699> alright<00:00:36.699> so<00:00:37.000> now<00:00:37.150> that<00:00:37.330> we

let's get started alright so now that we

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.729 
let's get started alright so now that we
finally<00:00:37.690> finished<00:00:37.989> research<00:00:38.500> on<00:00:38.620> our

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
finally finished research on our

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.619 
finally finished research on our
brand-new<00:00:39.160> shiny<00:00:39.520> hallucination<00:00:40.300> upgrade

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
brand-new shiny hallucination upgrade

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.270 
brand-new shiny hallucination upgrade
let's<00:00:41.050> go<00:00:41.199> over<00:00:41.350> the<00:00:41.559> first<00:00:41.860> thing<00:00:42.070> that<00:00:42.100> you

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
let's go over the first thing that you

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.590 
let's go over the first thing that you
should<00:00:42.309> be<00:00:42.610> doing<00:00:42.880> with<00:00:43.000> it<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.399> as<00:00:46.210> you<00:00:46.300> see

should be doing with it so as you see
right<00:00:46.630> here<00:00:46.930> I<00:00:46.960> just<00:00:47.079> hallucinate<00:00:47.680> it<00:00:47.770> in

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
right here I just hallucinate it in

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.740 
right here I just hallucinate it in
Phoenix<00:00:48.280> now<00:00:48.969> what<00:00:49.180> this<00:00:49.270> is<00:00:49.329> going<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.660> let

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
Phoenix now what this is going to let

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.600 
Phoenix now what this is going to let
you<00:00:49.899> do<00:00:50.079> is<00:00:50.320> get<00:00:50.440> a<00:00:50.530> really<00:00:50.890> nice<00:00:51.130> scouting

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
you do is get a really nice scouting

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.799 
you do is get a really nice scouting
information<00:00:52.090> without<00:00:52.210> having<00:00:52.360> to<00:00:52.660> sacrifice

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
information without having to sacrifice

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.290 
information without having to sacrifice
a<00:00:53.380> probe<00:00:54.160> that<00:00:54.399> will<00:00:54.489> most<00:00:54.670> likely<00:00:54.760> get<00:00:55.059> taken

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
a probe that will most likely get taken

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.720 
a probe that will most likely get taken
out<00:00:55.540> by<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.780> time<00:00:55.930> you<00:00:56.110> get<00:00:56.230> to<00:00:56.730> Lazard

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
out by the time you get to Lazard

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.940 
out by the time you get to Lazard
natural<00:00:58.360> or<00:00:58.570> Terrans<00:00:58.989> natural<00:00:59.379> Protoss

natural or Terrans natural Protoss
natural<00:01:00.340> even<00:01:00.579> but<00:01:01.270> hallucinations<00:01:01.989> are<00:01:02.140> very

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
natural even but hallucinations are very

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.049 
natural even but hallucinations are very
effective<00:01:02.649> against<00:01:02.860> Missouri<00:01:03.160> because<00:01:03.460> you

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
effective against Missouri because you

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.430 
effective against Missouri because you
really<00:01:04.390> need<00:01:04.509> to<00:01:04.629> be<00:01:04.780> knowing<00:01:05.080> what<00:01:05.110> they're

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
really need to be knowing what they're

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.050 
really need to be knowing what they're
doing<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.830> with<00:01:09.190> this<00:01:09.340> Phoenix<00:01:09.700> as<00:01:09.850> you<00:01:09.940> can

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
doing so with this Phoenix as you can

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.630 
doing so with this Phoenix as you can
see<00:01:10.300> I<00:01:10.509> sent<00:01:10.960> it<00:01:11.110> around<00:01:11.200> and<00:01:11.649> now<00:01:12.160> I<00:01:12.190> can<00:01:12.430> scout

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
see I sent it around and now I can scout

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.370 
see I sent it around and now I can scout
for<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:12.910> third<00:01:13.090> base<00:01:13.300> alright<00:01:13.899> I<00:01:13.930> know<00:01:14.080> there's

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
for a third base alright I know there's

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.290 
for a third base alright I know there's
no<00:01:14.500> third<00:01:14.740> base<00:01:14.979> so<00:01:15.729> let's<00:01:15.880> go<00:01:16.000> check<00:01:16.030> what

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
no third base so let's go check what

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.559 
no third base so let's go check what
he's<00:01:16.390> doing<00:01:16.600> his<00:01:16.750> other<00:01:16.959> bases<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:19.270> right

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
he's doing his other bases all right

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.190 
he's doing his other bases all right
he's<00:01:19.810> getting<00:01:19.929> two<00:01:20.319> more<00:01:20.500> gases<00:01:20.920> there

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
he's getting two more gases there

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.480 
he's getting two more gases there
evolution<00:01:23.200> chamber<00:01:23.440> nightís<00:01:23.920> Network<00:01:24.220> and

Roche war that's getting an upgrade so

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.680 
Roche war that's getting an upgrade so
now<00:01:27.130> with<00:01:27.310> this<00:01:27.429> knowledge<00:01:27.670> I'm<00:01:28.060> pretty<00:01:28.599> much

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
now with this knowledge I'm pretty much

prisms now zergs usually have the
watchtower<00:01:46.959> so<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.200> like<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.500> utilize<00:01:47.950> this<00:01:48.099> as

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
to deal with this war prism because they

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.699 
to deal with this war prism because they
don't<00:02:01.660> want<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:01.869> lose<00:02:02.020> anything<00:02:02.259> when<00:02:02.440> they've

don't want to lose anything when they've

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.820 
don't want to lose anything when they've
scouted<00:02:03.039> it<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.840> as<00:02:05.080> you<00:02:05.110> can<00:02:05.259> see<00:02:05.470> I'm<00:02:05.619> moving

he's looking around for the warp prism

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.679 
he's looking around for the warp prism
because<00:02:19.409> he<00:02:19.500> has<00:02:19.590> corrupters<00:02:20.129> so<00:02:20.510> mean<00:02:21.510> well

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
all right he sees the warp prism now he

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.520 
all right he sees the warp prism now he
takes<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:24.030> out<00:02:24.180> but<00:02:24.959> all<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.290> meantime

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.319 
takes it out but all in the meantime
I've<00:02:25.890> moved<00:02:26.129> up<00:02:26.250> my<00:02:26.400> army<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.760> I'm<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.239> an

which<00:02:31.379> I'm<00:02:31.560> doing<00:02:31.799> right<00:02:31.920> here<00:02:32.269> similar<00:02:33.269> to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
which I'm doing right here similar to

which I'm doing right here similar to
the<00:02:33.569> warp<00:02:33.750> prism<00:02:34.109> another<00:02:34.500> thing<00:02:34.739> you<00:02:34.829> can<00:02:34.980> do

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
the warp prism another thing you can do

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.099 
the warp prism another thing you can do
to<00:02:35.220> check<00:02:35.400> your<00:02:35.579> opponent<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.150> hallucinate<00:02:37.079> a

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
to check your opponent is hallucinate a

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.199 
to check your opponent is hallucinate a
bunch<00:02:37.439> of<00:02:37.590> probes<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.430> then<00:02:38.579> send<00:02:38.939> them<00:02:39.000> off

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
bunch of probes and then send them off

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.940 
bunch of probes and then send them off
to<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> hidden<00:02:39.780> expansion<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.739> actually

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
to a hidden expansion that you actually

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.729 
to a hidden expansion that you actually
don't<00:02:41.280> have<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.900> as<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.140> can<00:02:43.230> see<00:02:43.290> here<00:02:43.650> I've

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
don't have so as you can see here I've

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.380 
don't have so as you can see here I've
got<00:02:43.890> all<00:02:44.129> these<00:02:44.310> probes<00:02:44.700> right<00:02:44.939> here<00:02:45.239> and

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
got all these probes right here and

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.680 
got all these probes right here and
again<00:02:46.200> notice<00:02:46.769> how<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:47.340> send<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.090> right<00:02:48.389> on<00:02:48.450> the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
again notice how I send it right on the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.390 
again notice how I send it right on the
edge<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.139> Xel'Naga<00:02:49.349> Tower<00:02:49.769> because<00:02:50.010> zergs

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
edge of the Xel'Naga Tower because zergs

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.170 
edge of the Xel'Naga Tower because zergs
always<00:02:50.909> have<00:02:51.120> those<00:02:51.329> as<00:02:52.579> you<00:02:53.579> can<00:02:53.730> see<00:02:53.879> here

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
always have those as you can see here

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.240 
always have those as you can see here
let's<00:02:54.569> check<00:02:54.780> back<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:55.109> the<00:02:55.200> Zerg<00:02:55.379> he's<00:02:56.099> gonna

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
let's check back to the Zerg he's gonna

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.610 
let's check back to the Zerg he's gonna
send<00:02:56.549> about<00:02:57.060> half<00:02:57.359> of<00:02:57.510> his<00:02:57.659> roaches<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.530> all

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
send about half of his roaches and all

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.080 
send about half of his roaches and all
he's<00:02:58.799> actually<00:02:58.920> gonna<00:02:59.129> go<00:02:59.549> back<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.909> bring

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
he's actually gonna go back and bring

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.910 
he's actually gonna go back and bring
all<00:03:00.329> of<00:03:00.359> them<00:03:00.629> to<00:03:00.810> deal<00:03:01.290> with<00:03:01.470> these<00:03:01.590> probes

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
all of them to deal with these probes

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.349 
all of them to deal with these probes
because<00:03:02.099> that's<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.400> lot<00:03:02.549> of<00:03:02.609> probes<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.239> you

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
because that's a lot of probes that you

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.629 
because that's a lot of probes that you
could<00:03:03.510> get<00:03:03.629> free<00:03:03.900> kills<00:03:04.170> for<00:03:04.379> in<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.459> meantime

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
could get free kills for in the meantime

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.910 
could get free kills for in the meantime
I<00:03:06.000> take<00:03:06.359> the<00:03:06.510> middle<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.989> map<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.409> I<00:03:07.739> can

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
I take the middle of the map and I can

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.649 
I take the middle of the map and I can
make<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.069> really<00:03:08.430> great<00:03:08.639> push<00:03:08.970> on<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.329> small

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
make a really great push on the small

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.110 
make a really great push on the small
army<00:03:10.319> that<00:03:10.439> he<00:03:10.560> has<00:03:10.739> right<00:03:10.950> here<00:03:11.010> which<00:03:12.000> is

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
army that he has right here which is

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.569 
army that he has right here which is
exactly<00:03:12.569> what<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.780> do<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.709> it<00:03:13.829> puts<00:03:14.340> me<00:03:14.459> in<00:03:14.489> a

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
exactly what I do and it puts me in a

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.119 
exactly what I do and it puts me in a
great<00:03:14.819> lead<00:03:15.109> the<00:03:16.109> most<00:03:16.290> typical<00:03:16.799> things<00:03:17.040> that

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
great lead the most typical things that

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.670 
great lead the most typical things that
you<00:03:17.310> see<00:03:17.870> hallucinations<00:03:18.870> used<00:03:19.109> for<00:03:19.379> is<00:03:19.500> for

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
you see hallucinations used for is for

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.409 
you see hallucinations used for is for
hallucinating<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.370> bunch<00:03:20.609> of<00:03:20.760> units<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.239> big

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
hallucinating a bunch of units and a big

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.900 
hallucinating a bunch of units and a big
battle<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.870> soak<00:03:22.199> up<00:03:22.319> a<00:03:22.470> ton<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:22.709> damage<00:03:22.949> as<00:03:23.340> you

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
battle to soak up a ton of damage as you

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.460 
battle to soak up a ton of damage as you
can<00:03:24.060> see<00:03:24.239> here<00:03:24.419> I<00:03:24.449> loosened<00:03:24.930> they<00:03:24.989> did<00:03:25.139> a<00:03:25.169> ton

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
can see here I loosened they did a ton

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.949 
can see here I loosened they did a ton
of<00:03:25.530> Colossus<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.400> will<00:03:27.269> just<00:03:27.419> take<00:03:27.629> up<00:03:27.660> so

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
of Colossus that will just take up so

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.449 
of Colossus that will just take up so
much<00:03:28.019> damage<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.560> if<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.739> had<00:03:28.859> real<00:03:29.040> Colossus
