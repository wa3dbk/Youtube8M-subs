00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.039 
I'm gonna think I thought I could out
speed<00:01:47.009> him<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.759> could<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.359> he<00:01:48.479> Hydra<00:01:48.780> pumps

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
speed him but I could so he Hydra pumps

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.899 
speed him but I could so he Hydra pumps
me<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.469> live<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:51.020> he<00:01:52.020> must<00:01:52.350> not<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:53.219> special

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
me I live and he must not be a special

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.450 
me I live and he must not be a special
attack<00:01:54.149> v's<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.009> solar<00:01:56.219> beam
