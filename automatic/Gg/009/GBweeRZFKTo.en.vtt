00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
lot with the pliers because actually a

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.080 
lot with the pliers because actually a
thread<00:01:35.170> lock<00:01:35.409> or<00:01:35.680> a<00:01:35.710> lock<00:01:35.979> tight<00:01:36.280> has<00:01:36.640> actually

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
thread lock or a lock tight has actually

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.929 
thread lock or a lock tight has actually
been<00:01:37.240> added<00:01:37.689> onto<00:01:37.899> this<00:01:38.200> one<00:01:38.409> okay<00:01:39.250> so<00:01:39.280> once

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:43.359 
this nut comes out it's pretty simple to

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.289 
this nut comes out it's pretty simple to
actually<00:01:43.560> all<00:01:44.560> you've<00:01:44.710> got<00:01:44.829> to<00:01:44.950> do<00:01:45.100> is<00:01:45.399> simply

okay

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.940 
okay
need<00:01:51.850> to<00:01:51.969> use<00:01:52.090> some<00:01:52.299> force<00:01:52.630> okay<00:01:53.499> so<00:01:53.560> once<00:01:53.829> the

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
need to use some force okay so once the

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.940 
need to use some force okay so once the
prop<00:01:54.159> is<00:01:54.310> off<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.899> you<00:01:56.289> will<00:01:56.409> simply<00:01:56.560> take

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
prop is off then you will simply take

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.069 
prop is off then you will simply take
your<00:01:57.009> new<00:01:57.369> one<00:01:57.549> you<00:01:58.119> can<00:01:58.299> see<00:01:58.479> on<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.810> prop

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
your new one you can see on the prop

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.580 
your new one you can see on the prop
we've<00:01:59.409> got<00:01:59.590> this<00:01:59.799> kind<00:02:00.729> of<00:02:00.820> slit<00:02:01.240> here<00:02:01.600> PressTV

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
we've got this kind of slit here PressTV

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.539 
we've got this kind of slit here PressTV
this<00:02:03.009> slit<00:02:03.340> needs<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.969> go<00:02:04.179> into<00:02:05.140> this<00:02:05.679> slit

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
this slit needs to go into this slit

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.070 
this slit needs to go into this slit
parts<00:02:07.090> here<00:02:07.359> on<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.770> propeller<00:02:09.160> shaft<00:02:10.080> so

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
parts here on the propeller shaft so

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.740 
parts here on the propeller shaft so
basically<00:02:11.560> yeah<00:02:12.520> let's<00:02:12.970> imagine<00:02:13.180> we<00:02:13.450> got<00:02:13.630> our

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
basically yeah let's imagine we got our

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.780 
basically yeah let's imagine we got our
new<00:02:13.930> one<00:02:15.030> okay<00:02:16.030> take<00:02:16.780> your<00:02:16.990> new<00:02:17.350> prop<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.920> now

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
new one okay take your new prop and now

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.200 
new one okay take your new prop and now
you<00:02:18.850> need<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.150> align<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:20.620> part<00:02:20.980> here<00:02:21.310> with

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
you need to align this part here with

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.390 
you need to align this part here with
the<00:02:22.300> slit

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
the slit

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.420 
the slit
onto<00:02:23.939> this<00:02:24.599> part<00:02:24.930> here<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.709> is<00:02:25.829> shaped<00:02:26.159> and

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
onto this part here that is shaped and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.640 
onto this part here that is shaped and
so<00:02:26.579> it<00:02:26.640> will<00:02:26.760> fit<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.680> simply<00:02:28.680> slide<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.189> on

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
so it will fit on simply slide it on

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.500 
so it will fit on simply slide it on
make<00:02:31.650> sure<00:02:31.680> it's<00:02:31.950> aligned<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.610> then<00:02:33.090> push

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
make sure it's aligned and then push

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.339 
make sure it's aligned and then push
down<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.799> will<00:02:34.950> click<00:02:35.159> into<00:02:35.400> place<00:02:36.290> now<00:02:37.290> we

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
down and it will click into place now we

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.349 
down and it will click into place now we
got<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.799> do<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:39.180> replace<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.950> nut<00:02:41.329> or<00:02:42.329> the

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
got to do is just replace the nut or the

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.910 
got to do is just replace the nut or the
bolt<00:02:43.760> onto<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:45.569> shaft<00:02:45.959> make<00:02:46.650> sure<00:02:46.799> you

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
bolt onto this shaft make sure you

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.940 
bolt onto this shaft make sure you
tighten<00:02:47.189> it<00:02:47.430> up<00:02:47.549> very<00:02:48.030> very<00:02:48.150> well<00:02:48.739> right<00:02:49.739> then

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
tighten it up very very well right then

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.479 
tighten it up very very well right then
so<00:02:50.310> once<00:02:50.609> it's<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:50.879> tight<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.689> all<00:02:51.870> and

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
so once it's so tight that is all and

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.220 
so once it's so tight that is all and
all<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.579> can<00:02:53.670> do<00:02:53.790> now<00:02:53.819> is<00:02:54.359> just<00:02:54.390> go<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.049> have

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
all you can do now is just go and have

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.020 
all you can do now is just go and have
fun<00:02:55.590> I'd<00:02:56.129> actually<00:02:56.489> recommend<00:02:56.579> you<00:02:56.909> should

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
fun I'd actually recommend you should

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.000 
fun I'd actually recommend you should
get<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.150> few<00:02:57.299> spares<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.989> these<00:02:58.139> props<00:02:58.530> as<00:02:58.799> they

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
get a few spares of these props as they

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.270 
get a few spares of these props as they
can<00:02:59.280> break<00:02:59.579> sometimes<00:03:00.120> fairly<00:03:00.540> easily<00:03:01.280> when
