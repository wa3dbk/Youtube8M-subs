00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
as well and locks me out of the system

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.319 
as well and locks me out of the system
so<00:00:52.170> ruin<00:00:52.800> oh<00:00:52.949> look<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:53.850> left<00:00:54.149> with

so ruin oh look it's just left with
nothing<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.500> think<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.340> scene

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
nothing and I think that that that scene

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.369 
nothing and I think that that that scene
could<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:56.969> been<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> lot<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:57.480> impact<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
could have been a lot more impact for a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.500 
could have been a lot more impact for a
while<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.680> see<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.129> ramifications<00:00:59.969> after

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the fact and you kind of see how it's

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.560

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
moment in this with Max here's the fact

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.140 
moment in this with Max here's the fact
that<00:01:35.460> now<00:01:36.200> bearcats<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.790> impersonating<00:01:38.790> rui

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
that now bearcats is impersonating rui

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.719 
that now bearcats is impersonating rui
and<00:01:39.390> going<00:01:39.600> around<00:01:39.689> as<00:01:40.020> him<00:01:40.280> he<00:01:41.280> holds<00:01:41.610> all

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
and going around as him he holds all

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.800

power all the cards at this point and i

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.670 
power all the cards at this point and i
think<00:01:45.810> they<00:01:45.869> could<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.079> made<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.229> seem<00:01:46.590> a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
think they could have made that seem a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.920 
think they could have made that seem a
bit<00:01:46.710> more<00:01:46.890> impactful<00:01:47.159> otherwise<00:01:47.759> though<00:01:48.090> just
