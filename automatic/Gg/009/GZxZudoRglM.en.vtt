00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
damn man that number five looks like it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.140 
damn man that number five looks like it
should<00:02:15.660> be<00:02:15.690> number<00:02:15.990> one<00:02:16.820> imagine<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:17.940> just

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
should be number one imagine it just

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.990 
should be number one imagine it just
seems<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.600> right<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.050> whole<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.500> whole

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
seems so right the whole the whole

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000 
seems so right the whole the whole
physics<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.330> number<00:02:21.570> five<00:02:21.930> going<00:02:22.890> a

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
number one but then I looked at it again

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.970 
number one but then I looked at it again
I<00:02:27.450> said<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.810> don't<00:02:27.870> know<00:02:28.140> man<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.560> SAT<00:02:28.800> back
