just<00:01:52.530> sticking<00:01:52.950> out<00:01:53.070> there<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:54.540> just

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
just sticking out there like it's just

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.109 
just sticking out there like it's just
really<00:01:55.259> really<00:01:55.560> small<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.340> wouldn't<00:01:56.969> matter

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
really really small it wouldn't matter

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.179 
really really small it wouldn't matter
but<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.020> also<00:01:58.439> going<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.680> help<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.040> a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
but that is also going to help it a

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.630 
but that is also going to help it a
little<00:01:59.219> bit<00:01:59.909> not<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.149> much<00:02:00.600> low<00:02:00.920> but<00:02:01.920> also

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
little bit not that much low but also

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.550 
little bit not that much low but also
probably<00:02:03.299> easy<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.750> says<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.259> an<00:02:04.380> easy

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
probably easy it says this is an easy

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.149 
probably easy it says this is an easy
jam<00:02:04.860> your<00:02:05.579> jam<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.000> probably<00:02:06.479> look<00:02:06.659> something

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
jam your jam is probably look something

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.839 
jam your jam is probably look something
like<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:07.640> it's<00:02:08.509> probably<00:02:08.720> more<00:02:08.989> like<00:02:09.229> that

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
like this it's probably more like that

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.750 
like this it's probably more like that
and<00:02:10.849> I<00:02:11.120> know<00:02:11.209> what<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:11.660> is<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:12.620> hold<00:02:13.190> down<00:02:13.459> the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
and I know what you is you hold down the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.990 
and I know what you is you hold down the
release<00:02:14.209> button<00:02:14.510> obviously<00:02:15.430> well<00:02:16.430> I'll<00:02:16.790> go

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
release button obviously well I'll go

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.619 
release button obviously well I'll go
and<00:02:17.120> mess<00:02:17.299> up<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.540> door<00:02:17.690> right<00:02:17.930> now<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:22.599> let<00:02:23.599> me

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
and mess up a door right now so let me

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:31.630 
and mess up a door right now so let me
take<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.989> cam<00:02:28.840> so<00:02:29.840> it's<00:02:30.560> already<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.310> stuck

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
take the cam so it's already the stuck

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.960 
take the cam so it's already the stuck
midway<00:02:32.120> between<00:02:32.180> flywheel<00:02:32.870> Oh<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.530> cue<00:02:33.890> is<00:02:34.069> whip

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
midway between flywheel Oh a cue is whip

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.699 
midway between flywheel Oh a cue is whip
it<00:02:35.120> out<00:02:35.180> really<00:02:35.480> quick<00:02:35.599> and<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:36.260> can<00:02:36.410> see<00:02:36.590> the

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
it out really quick and you can see the

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.800 
it out really quick and you can see the
dart<00:02:36.920> just<00:02:37.069> flew<00:02:37.400> out<00:02:37.430> there<00:02:37.849> so<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.599> dart

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
dart just flew out there so the dart

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.900 
dart just flew out there so the dart
will<00:02:38.959> is<00:02:39.080> flag<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.530> clip<00:02:39.739> put<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.579> clip<00:02:40.760> back

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
will is flag the clip put the clip back

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.000 
will is flag the clip put the clip back
in<00:02:41.230> easiest<00:02:42.230> way<00:02:42.349> to<00:02:42.379> fix<00:02:42.650> this

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
in easiest way to fix this

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.000 
in easiest way to fix this
it<00:02:43.370> still<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:43.910> good<00:02:44.060> for<00:02:44.239> inner<00:02:44.390> floors<00:02:44.629> so<00:02:45.379> if

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
it still is good for inner floors so if

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.680 
it still is good for inner floors so if
it<00:02:46.160> still<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.519> persisting<00:02:47.120> with<00:02:47.269> your<00:02:47.390> rapid

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
it still is persisting with your rapid

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.630 
it still is persisting with your rapid
strike<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.470> most<00:02:48.620> likely<00:02:48.860> still<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.430> your

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
strike and most likely still is your

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.550 
strike and most likely still is your
dark<00:02:49.879> quality<00:02:50.390> even<00:02:50.750> if<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:51.049> think<00:02:51.200> it's<00:02:51.379> good

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
dark quality even if you think it's good

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.180 
dark quality even if you think it's good
quality<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:52.129> could<00:02:52.400> be<00:02:52.549> bad<00:02:52.910> quality<00:02:53.450> though

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
quality it could be bad quality though

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.979

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
even having your hands on a trigger

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.670 
even having your hands on a trigger
you're<00:03:13.819> going<00:03:14.030> silkies<00:03:14.599> pushing<00:03:15.170> out<00:03:15.290> darts

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
you're going silkies pushing out darts

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.099 
you're going silkies pushing out darts
out<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:16.010> barrel<00:03:16.310> like<00:03:17.000> skiing<00:03:17.389> them<00:03:17.569> like<00:03:17.780> 5

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
out the barrel like skiing them like 5

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.370 
out the barrel like skiing them like 5
or<00:03:18.500> 6<00:03:18.859> feet<00:03:18.980> or<00:03:19.340> like<00:03:20.060> maybe<00:03:20.329> 20<00:03:20.780> feet<00:03:20.810> if<00:03:21.230> you

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
or 6 feet or like maybe 20 feet if you

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.099 
or 6 feet or like maybe 20 feet if you
have<00:03:21.410> really<00:03:21.709> high<00:03:21.829> voltage<00:03:22.510> well<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.780> reason

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
have really high voltage well the reason

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.259 
have really high voltage well the reason
this<00:03:24.200> is<00:03:24.260> is<00:03:24.680> when<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.310> run<00:03:25.489> up<00:03:25.519> your<00:03:25.790> gun<00:03:26.000> and

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
this is is when you run up your gun and

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.360 
this is is when you run up your gun and
you<00:03:26.389> keep<00:03:26.630> firing<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:27.410> don't<00:03:27.680> hold<00:03:27.919> down<00:03:28.160> the

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
you keep firing you don't hold down the

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.309 
you keep firing you don't hold down the
trigger<00:03:28.780> while<00:03:29.799> your<00:03:30.799> guns<00:03:31.069> flywheel<00:03:31.760> is<00:03:31.940> off

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
trigger while your guns flywheel is off

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.080 
trigger while your guns flywheel is off
why<00:03:33.319> is<00:03:33.380> this<00:03:33.680> because<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.190> keeps<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.880> little

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
why is this because it keeps the little

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.809 
why is this because it keeps the little
spinner<00:03:35.510> there's<00:03:36.109> a<00:03:36.260> spinner<00:03:36.739> that<00:03:36.859> hits<00:03:37.519> the

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
spinner there's a spinner that hits the

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.030 
spinner there's a spinner that hits the
little<00:03:37.970> peg<00:03:38.299> that<00:03:38.540> pushes<00:03:38.900> darts<00:03:39.200> forward<00:03:39.560> so

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
little peg that pushes darts forward so

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.930 
little peg that pushes darts forward so
every<00:03:40.400> rotation<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.150> hits<00:03:41.450> it<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:42.700> will<00:03:43.700> move

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
every rotation it hits it it will move

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.789 
every rotation it hits it it will move
the<00:03:44.090> pegboard<00:03:44.299> so<00:03:44.810> you're<00:03:45.019> not<00:03:45.139> stopping<00:03:45.500> that

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
the pegboard so you're not stopping that

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.440 
the pegboard so you're not stopping that
little<00:03:46.069> spinner<00:03:46.340> so<00:03:46.639> the<00:03:46.730> spinner<00:03:47.030> is<00:03:47.269> going

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
little spinner so the spinner is going

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.180 
little spinner so the spinner is going

spinning that's inside the motor so what

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.849 
spinning that's inside the motor so what
you<00:03:52.040> have<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.190> do<00:03:52.340> is<00:03:52.519> go<00:03:52.910> clip<00:03:53.239> out<00:03:53.680> pull<00:03:54.680> this

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
be good to go if it keeps doing that let

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.930 
be good to go if it keeps doing that let
it<00:04:01.669> run<00:04:01.849> its<00:04:01.880> course<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:04.160> eventually<00:04:04.459> stop

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
it run its course and to eventually stop

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.050

you<00:04:28.570> a<00:04:28.720> good<00:04:28.930> description<00:04:29.350> of<00:04:29.740> that<00:04:29.950> but

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
you a good description of that but

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.940 
you a good description of that but
that's<00:04:30.910> just<00:04:31.090> a<00:04:31.270> basic<00:04:31.450> way<00:04:31.810> of<00:04:31.840> solving<00:04:32.410> a<00:04:32.710> jam

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
that's just a basic way of solving a jam

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.800 
that's just a basic way of solving a jam
so<00:04:33.190> it's<00:04:33.310> gone<00:04:33.460> because<00:04:33.730> they<00:04:33.850> are<00:04:34.000> relatively

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
so it's gone because they are relatively

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.140 
so it's gone because they are relatively
frequent<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:36.220> is<00:04:36.370> normal<00:04:36.820> for<00:04:36.850> this

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
frequent and that is normal for this

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.820 
frequent and that is normal for this

so many guns that are poor operating so

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.560 
so many guns that are poor operating so
