here<00:03:30.700> in<00:03:30.850> Milwaukee<00:03:31.299> yeah<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:32.019> question<00:03:32.200> is

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
here in Milwaukee yeah the question is

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.199 
here in Milwaukee yeah the question is
going<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.590> be<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:33.130> is<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.430> same<00:03:33.670> pattern<00:03:34.120> as

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
going to be this is the same pattern as

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.330 
going to be this is the same pattern as
the<00:03:34.269> US<00:03:34.600> Open<00:03:35.019> so<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.680> question<00:03:35.950> is<00:03:35.980> going<00:03:36.250> to

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
the US Open so the question is going to

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.640 
the US Open so the question is going to
be<00:03:36.549> this<00:03:36.970> is<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.150> 90<00:03:37.570> person<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.019> 100<00:03:38.320> person

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
be this is a 90 person to 100 person

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.680 
be this is a 90 person to 100 person

if these 90 to 100 can break the lanes

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.750 
if these 90 to 100 can break the lanes
down<00:03:53.140> in<00:03:53.350> a<00:03:53.410> way<00:03:53.530> they<00:03:53.680> like<00:03:53.890> there<00:03:54.459> could<00:03:54.700> be

down in a way they like there could be
some<00:03:55.120> scores<00:03:55.390> out<00:03:55.600> there<00:03:55.810> but<00:03:56.079> it<00:03:56.680> remains<00:03:56.980> to

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
some scores out there but it remains to

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.460 
some scores out there but it remains to
be<00:03:57.130> seen<00:03:57.430> if<00:03:57.670> they<00:03:58.120> don't<00:03:58.390> whether<00:03:59.140> or<00:03:59.350> not

than<00:04:17.500> we're<00:04:17.709> used<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:17.979> at<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.250> US<00:04:18.459> open<00:04:18.850> as

bowling<00:04:20.950> here<00:04:21.340> all<00:04:21.579> know<00:04:21.880> how<00:04:22.150> to<00:04:22.210> bowl<00:04:22.479> on<00:04:22.750> oil

patterns<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:24.250> no<00:04:24.760> matter<00:04:24.910> how<00:04:25.000> difficult<00:04:25.300> it

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
patterns and no matter how difficult it

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.659 
patterns and no matter how difficult it
is<00:04:25.720> like<00:04:26.530> this<00:04:26.710> one<00:04:26.890> traditionally<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.460> most

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
is like this one traditionally the most

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.219 
is like this one traditionally the most
difficult<00:04:28.150> so<00:04:28.600> I<00:04:28.630> think<00:04:28.780> we'll<00:04:28.930> see<00:04:29.050> some

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
difficult so I think we'll see some

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:30.750 
difficult so I think we'll see some
higher<00:04:29.380> scores<00:04:29.770> than<00:04:29.860> we're<00:04:30.130> typically<00:04:30.490> used

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760

this<00:05:37.930> is<00:05:37.990> hpl<00:05:38.560> so<00:05:38.950> a<00:05:38.980> little<00:05:39.370> more<00:05:39.460> friction

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
this is hpl so a little more friction
