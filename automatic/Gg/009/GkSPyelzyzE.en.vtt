00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.829
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:22.960
 episode 8 of trading for you tube 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:26.140
 century 5001 as we said 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.439
 here already and of course I want 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.329
 still have a little more now yes 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.219
 First of all, I would like to go into that 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.470
 on yesterday's video and I have to 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:39.310
 say I did not notice that 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.680
 this fucking sound quality 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.030
 I really am really sorry for that 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.170
 I then had the comments 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.730
 read that listening ok for free like that 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.760
 there's a lot of grumbling about that then I've got myself 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.700
 that belongs and oh shit that was you 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.720
 really that was really bad and I have to 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.250
 say I had my own one 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.560
 dislike given for this video 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.920
 just because of this sound quality 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.269
 today he is a short video 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.500
 of course there are sundays in the morning 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.130
 and tomorrow there will be the longer one 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.659
 episode 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.070
 I believe for nine minutes or so 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.680
 she goes tomorrow I'm not quite 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.690
 for sure 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.200
 and I think that's it 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.550
 morning 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.190
 I do not know exactly which ones too 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:24.250
 this new zone new trading method 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.690
 Practically apply because then there is 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.680
 make connection with this small profit 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.020
 we are a bit bigger and 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.070
 actually always constant 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.610
 At least 1000 profit per player 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.040
 What I wanted to say is with these 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.270
 trade couple there are 40 places 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.510
 but I can not do that 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.430
 use because I'm only level 8 unfortunately 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.040
 So that's just stupid I hope 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.750
 completely level 8 soon level 9 though 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.479
 anyway that a little shit because 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.560
 then I just can not do this this 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:59.320
 take additional space there 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.950
 Last time I looked up how much 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.110
 because such a blue marcelo costs so in 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.400
 approximately 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.280
 and I have to say so I was 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.470
 surprised 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.160
 he does not even cost that much 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.020
 a lot for that one 89 he in shape 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.400
 Of course, players are also part of the team 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.650
 here because I really was thinking that he 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.060
 actually much more expensive then 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.180
 Of course it also offers a league 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.310
 brasilia and then also at real 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.150
 Of course that's madrid 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.290
 best requirement for a correct 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.800
 great player to be but it is 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.560
 not necessarily 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.810
 it costs 590,000 coins, I have nothing 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.100
 seen and there was not a long time 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:45.010
 So , he could do something with that 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.930
 much no longer concentrated many years and 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.580
 trading on youtube is really right 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.500
 really cool, I find this very me 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.760
 still love her 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.980
 and it just makes the most fun 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.180
 at the gameplay moderately I currently have 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.330
 not too crazy 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:03.250
 I hardly play anymore, he has to say 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:07.930
 trade and that is my thing yes and 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:12.329
 something else and my pc came to me 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.470
 today and I turned it on 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.150
 I actually thought I thought so 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.370
 I thought of everything I have in the 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.560
 districts to self-assembled and 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.540
 I did everything myself and then it is mine 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.400
 I remembered one and remembered 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.239
 that was such a fucking mistake and 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.410
 That's why I'll do it again 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.500
 send back and falls to me new 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.519
 So, especially buy the exchange 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.510
 is yes and indeed has the windows 8 and 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.220
 i forgot i really have 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.930
 forget only window was this 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.180
 to specify operating system is really 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.790
 quite cool but the operating system 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.440
 Never that's really true 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.239
 So I want if windows 7 then here 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.540
 have again and then I already have 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.650
 soon my pc and one more thing 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.970
 that went pretty stupid namely 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.799
 I have to continue in this old way 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.829
 namely make the players here buy 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.440
 Show you then which I bought for 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.570
 the four set because my choice pc 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.579
 So you thought my top well 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.540
 actually do not mind it all 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:12.180
 to tailor and it is the whole 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.920
 the whole episode basically the next 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.840
 I'm going to try it that way 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.109
 crop it that way at least that way 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.870
 this method until this one 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.669
 style looks like this with buy and it 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.740
 do not buy but only be sold 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.479
 simply explained morning 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.810
 Thank you for watching 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.810
 nice day
