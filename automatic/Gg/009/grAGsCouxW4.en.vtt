hey<00:00:02.070> everyone<00:00:02.399> sitting<00:00:03.389> around<00:00:03.540> thinking

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hey everyone sitting around thinking

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.900 
hey everyone sitting around thinking
about<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.110> MZ<00:00:04.440> 24<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.220> what<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.430> receivers

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
about the MZ 24 and what the receivers

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.790 
about the MZ 24 and what the receivers
could<00:00:06.150> do<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:09.170> realize<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.530> there's<00:00:10.679> no

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
could do and realize that there's no

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.060 
could do and realize that there's no
reason<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.460> can't<00:00:11.759> fly<00:00:12.240> spectrum<00:00:13.070> using

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
reason that you can't fly spectrum using

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.090 
reason that you can't fly spectrum using
a<00:00:14.280> grappler<00:00:14.730> MZ<00:00:15.089> 24<00:00:16.430> so<00:00:17.430> what<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.580> did<00:00:17.670> was<00:00:18.119> I

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
a grappler MZ 24 so what I did was I

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.269 
a grappler MZ 24 so what I did was I
grabbed<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.279> gr<00:00:21.029> 16<00:00:21.539> L<00:00:21.750> Lou<00:00:23.090> about<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.650> gr<00:00:25.650> 16<00:00:26.070> L

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
grabbed a gr 16 L Lou about that gr 16 L

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.050 
grabbed a gr 16 L Lou about that gr 16 L
which<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.240> like<00:00:27.300> $60<00:00:27.960> receiver

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
which is the it's like $60 receiver

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.310 
which is the it's like $60 receiver
plenty<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.150> other<00:00:30.269> receivers<00:00:30.810> too<00:00:30.990> they<00:00:31.199> all

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
plenty of other receivers too they all

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.340 
plenty of other receivers too they all
have<00:00:31.470> PP<00:00:31.830> n<00:00:31.949> output<00:00:32.369> as<00:00:32.910> far<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.780> know<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.200> far

header out of a servo servo extension

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.279 
header out of a servo servo extension
it's<00:00:52.800> out<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.160> case<00:00:53.370> because<00:00:53.960> well<00:00:54.960> my

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
it's out of the case because well my

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.350 
it's out of the case because well my
ghetto<00:00:55.590> servo<00:00:56.039> extension<00:00:56.610> doesn't<00:00:57.239> go

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
ghetto servo extension doesn't go

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.639 
ghetto servo extension doesn't go
through<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> case<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.170> into<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> pins

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
through the case and into the pins

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.160 
through the case and into the pins
properly<00:00:59.390> bound<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.539> up<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:02.059> it<00:01:03.059> works<00:01:03.239> there

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
properly bound it up and it works there

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.600 
properly bound it up and it works there
it<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:06.470> forgive<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.500> servo<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.250> jittering

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
it is forgive that servo for jittering

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.260 
it is forgive that servo for jittering
it<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:10.490> that's<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.729> was<00:01:11.820> taken<00:01:12.119> out<00:01:12.210> of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it so that's one that was taken out of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.600 
it so that's one that was taken out of
service<00:01:12.390> because<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:13.170> was<00:01:13.350> all<00:01:13.890> jittery<00:01:14.280> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
service because it was all jittery and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.090 
service because it was all jittery and
it's<00:01:14.760> also<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:16.100> normal<00:01:18.200> normal<00:01:19.200> voltage<00:01:19.530> servo

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
it's also a normal normal voltage servo

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.539 
it's also a normal normal voltage servo
being<00:01:20.340> run<00:01:20.549> off<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.119> 2s<00:01:21.630> lipo<00:01:21.659> because

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
being run off of a 2s lipo because

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.320 
being run off of a 2s lipo because
frankly<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.580> don't<00:01:23.729> care<00:01:25.820> it's<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.150> just

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
frankly I don't care it's just I just

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.160 
frankly I don't care it's just I just
use<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.630> testing<00:01:28.110> anyways<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.869> hooking

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
use it for testing anyways so in hooking

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.499 
use it for testing anyways so in hooking
this<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.350> made<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> servo<00:01:32.490> header<00:01:32.729> coming<00:01:33.360> up

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
this up made the servo header coming up

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.859 
this up made the servo header coming up
you<00:01:33.780> got<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.079> careful<00:01:34.259> with<00:01:34.890> voltage<00:01:35.869> this

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
you got to be careful with voltage this

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.980 
you got to be careful with voltage this
is<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> junior<00:01:37.590> module<00:01:38.509> junior<00:01:39.509> modules<00:01:39.869> look

transmitter so we're going to go to the
next<00:02:38.670> page<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:41.430> one<00:02:41.550> we're<00:02:41.700> looking<00:02:41.730> for<00:02:42.180> is

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
next page the one we're looking for is

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.750 
next page the one we're looking for is
this<00:02:42.420> one<00:02:42.480> down<00:02:42.780> here

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
this one down here

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.240 
this one down here
tsumo<00:02:44.760> oh<00:02:44.790> wait<00:02:45.560> it's<00:02:46.560> probably<00:02:47.130> not

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
tsumo oh wait it's probably not

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.880 
tsumo oh wait it's probably not
pronounced<00:02:47.580> sumo<00:02:47.970> but<00:02:48.210> I<00:02:48.530> like<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.620> think<00:02:49.770> as<00:02:49.860> a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
pronounced sumo but I like to think as a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.910 
pronounced sumo but I like to think as a
fat<00:02:50.130> guy<00:02:50.330> fighting<00:02:51.330> in<00:02:51.540> my<00:02:51.660> radio

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
fat guy fighting in my radio

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.580 
fat guy fighting in my radio
so<00:02:53.700> as<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:55.620> comes<00:02:56.100> out<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.490> factory<00:02:57.000> it's

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.990 

it's<00:03:01.590> not<00:03:01.770> configured<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.370> do<00:03:02.490> single<00:03:02.820> line

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
it's not configured to do single line

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.760 
it's not configured to do single line
output<00:03:03.420> on<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.690> receivers<00:03:04.110> they<00:03:04.230> all<00:03:04.350> have<00:03:04.590> it

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
output on the receivers they all have it

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.960 
output on the receivers they all have it
but<00:03:05.490> you<00:03:05.760> need<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.120> go<00:03:06.570> in<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:07.860> here<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.520> change

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
but you need to go in to here and change

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.050 
but you need to go in to here and change
this<00:03:09.210> setting<00:03:10.340> ordinarily<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.520> says<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:11.730> think

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
this setting ordinarily it says I think

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.380 
this setting ordinarily it says I think
same<00:03:13.010> which<00:03:14.010> just<00:03:14.220> means<00:03:14.430> channel<00:03:15.060> 1<00:03:15.180> through

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
same which just means channel 1 through

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.030 
same which just means channel 1 through
8<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.600> going<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.780> put<00:03:16.020> channel<00:03:16.590> 1<00:03:16.710> through<00:03:16.920> 8

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
8 is going to put channel 1 through 8

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.980 
8 is going to put channel 1 through 8
out<00:03:17.250> but<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:18.270> could<00:03:18.390> change<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.780> this

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
out but you could change it to this

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.620 
out but you could change it to this
there's<00:03:19.290> also<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.560> digital<00:03:19.940> high<00:03:20.940> speed<00:03:21.420> one

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
there's also a digital high speed one

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.660 
there's also a digital high speed one
kind<00:03:22.080> of<00:03:22.110> like<00:03:22.230> s<00:03:22.440> bus<00:03:22.740> that<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.130> use<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.520> hook

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
kind of like s bus that you use to hook

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.500 
kind of like s bus that you use to hook
up<00:03:23.850> with<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:24.390> V<00:03:24.930> bar<00:03:25.140> or<00:03:25.880> I've<00:03:26.880> got<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.210> on<00:03:27.300> an

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
up with a V bar or I've got it on an

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.780 
up with a V bar or I've got it on an
icon<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.740> way<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:28.890> change<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:29.340> setting

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
icon so the way you change this setting

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.510 
icon so the way you change this setting
is<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.120> go<00:03:30.240> down<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.870> it's<00:03:31.680> set<00:03:32.720> it's<00:03:33.720> there

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
is you go down to it it's set it's there

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.990 
is you go down to it it's set it's there
you<00:03:35.520> increase<00:03:36.770> decrease<00:03:37.770> to<00:03:38.490> get<00:03:38.670> what<00:03:38.850> you

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
you increase decrease to get what you

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.320 
you increase decrease to get what you
want<00:03:43.430> these<00:03:44.430> are<00:03:44.490> kind<00:03:44.730> of<00:03:44.760> neat<00:03:44.880> receivers

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
want these are kind of neat receivers

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.180 
want these are kind of neat receivers
because<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:45.750> can<00:03:45.900> chain<00:03:46.140> them<00:03:46.290> together<00:03:46.440> you

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
because you can chain them together you

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.830 
because you can chain them together you
can<00:03:47.220> use<00:03:48.170> if<00:03:49.170> you<00:03:49.350> use<00:03:49.380> this<00:03:49.800> setting

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
can use if you use this setting

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.650 
can use if you use this setting
let's<00:03:51.840> see<00:03:53.720> some<00:03:54.720> e<00:03:55.040> some<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.340> that's<00:03:57.030> an<00:03:57.180> input

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
let's see some e some I that's an input

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.750 
let's see some e some I that's an input
so<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:58.380> can<00:03:58.500> take<00:03:58.740> two<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:58.950> these<00:03:59.190> receivers

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
so you can take two of these receivers

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.220 
so you can take two of these receivers
have<00:03:59.910> one<00:04:00.090> on<00:04:00.240> some<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:01.850> one<00:04:02.850> on<00:04:03.000> some<00:04:03.330> oh<00:04:03.570> that

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
have one on some I one on some oh that

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.440 
have one on some I one on some oh that
stands<00:04:04.440> for<00:04:04.560> input<00:04:04.710> and<00:04:05.070> output<00:04:05.490> and<00:04:05.640> hook

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
stands for input and output and hook

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.110 
stands for input and output and hook
them<00:04:06.630> together<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.260> it<00:04:08.070> gives<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.460> signal

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
them together and it gives you signal

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.930 
them together and it gives you signal
redundancy<00:04:09.900> so<00:04:10.740> you<00:04:10.800> can<00:04:11.160> have<00:04:11.280> two<00:04:11.459> receivers

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
redundancy so you can have two receivers

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.180 
redundancy so you can have two receivers
receiving<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.480> signal<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.050> then<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.950> can

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
receiving the signal and then you can

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.150 
receiving the signal and then you can
specify<00:04:15.260> one<00:04:16.260> receiver<00:04:16.709> this<00:04:16.799> is<00:04:16.920> an<00:04:17.040> 8

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
specify one receiver this is an 8

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.539 
specify one receiver this is an 8
channel<00:04:17.190> but<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.390> could<00:04:18.600> throw<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.080> 6<00:04:20.040> channel<00:04:20.400> on

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
channel but I could throw a 6 channel on

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.240 
channel but I could throw a 6 channel on
or<00:04:20.760> 12<00:04:21.000> channel<00:04:21.299> on<00:04:21.420> or<00:04:21.660> whatever<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:23.100> can

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
or 12 channel on or whatever and you can

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.980 
or 12 channel on or whatever and you can
specify<00:04:23.430> alright<00:04:23.820> I<00:04:23.850> want<00:04:24.090> one<00:04:24.479> receiver<00:04:24.870> to

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
specify alright I want one receiver to

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.030 
specify alright I want one receiver to
put<00:04:25.169> out<00:04:25.290> channels<00:04:25.680> 1<00:04:25.830> through<00:04:26.010> 8<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.729> other

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
put out channels 1 through 8 the other

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.170 
put out channels 1 through 8 the other
but<00:04:27.550> out<00:04:27.700> 9<00:04:28.000> through<00:04:28.360> whatever<00:04:29.910> so<00:04:30.910> it's<00:04:31.060> just

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
but out 9 through whatever so it's just

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.150 
but out 9 through whatever so it's just
kind<00:04:31.390> of<00:04:31.450> a<00:04:31.540> cool<00:04:31.750> feature<00:04:31.960> this<00:04:32.200> radio<00:04:32.530> but<00:04:33.040> we

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
kind of a cool feature this radio but we

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.180 
kind of a cool feature this radio but we
want<00:04:33.310> on<00:04:33.430> some<00:04:33.760> 0:08<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:35.350> could<00:04:35.740> probably<00:04:35.950> tell

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
want on some 0:08 I could probably tell

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.970 
want on some 0:08 I could probably tell
it<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.400> do<00:04:36.550> Oh<00:04:36.820> 9<00:04:37.090> or<00:04:37.870> some<00:04:38.140> other<00:04:38.320> number<00:04:38.710> but

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
it to do Oh 9 or some other number but

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.550 
it to do Oh 9 or some other number but
whatever<00:04:39.640> I<00:04:39.910> chose<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.450> way<00:04:40.630> because<00:04:40.900> I

think<00:04:41.710> it's<00:04:42.190> an<00:04:42.310> 8<00:04:42.430> channel<00:04:42.460> module<00:04:43.210> not<00:04:43.570> sure

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
think it's an 8 channel module not sure

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:51.720 
think it's an 8 channel module not sure
so<00:04:45.100> we're<00:04:45.190> going<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.340> escape<00:04:45.700> out<00:04:46.090> of<00:04:46.120> this<00:04:50.730> now

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
so we're going to escape out of this now

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.160 
so we're going to escape out of this now
it's<00:04:51.910> back<00:04:53.610> and<00:04:54.610> go<00:04:54.880> again<00:04:55.150> so<00:04:55.480> you<00:04:55.810> can<00:04:55.960> see

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
it's back and go again so you can see

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.540 
it's back and go again so you can see
I'm<00:04:56.530> going<00:04:56.680> to<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:56.890> stake<00:04:57.130> here<00:04:59.220> the<00:05:00.220> servo

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
I'm going to the stake here the servo

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.420 
I'm going to the stake here the servo
moves<00:05:01.500> and<00:05:02.500> just<00:05:02.530> to<00:05:02.800> show<00:05:02.950> you<00:05:03.010> there's<00:05:03.310> no

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
moves and just to show you there's no

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.670 
moves and just to show you there's no
snow<00:05:04.390> trick<00:05:04.690> here<00:05:04.930> I'm<00:05:05.140> not<00:05:05.260> entirely<00:05:05.530> sure

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
snow trick here I'm not entirely sure

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.000 
snow trick here I'm not entirely sure
why<00:05:05.950> I<00:05:05.980> would<00:05:06.280> trick<00:05:06.490> you<00:05:06.640> on<00:05:06.790> this<00:05:07.000> but<00:05:08.010> I'll

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
why I would trick you on this but I'll

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.430 
why I would trick you on this but I'll
turn<00:05:09.190> off<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.370> power<00:05:09.640> to<00:05:09.850> the<00:05:10.320> Groton<00:05:11.320> air

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
turn off the power to the Groton air

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.740 
turn off the power to the Groton air
receiver<00:05:11.800> you'll<00:05:12.730> see<00:05:12.910> the<00:05:13.030> module<00:05:13.450> will<00:05:13.600> go

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
receiver you'll see the module will go

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.250 
receiver you'll see the module will go
out<00:05:13.990> and<00:05:14.430> let<00:05:15.430> me<00:05:15.490> move<00:05:15.670> this<00:05:15.880> so<00:05:16.840> you<00:05:16.870> can<00:05:17.110> see

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
out and let me move this so you can see

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:25.320 
out and let me move this so you can see
the<00:05:17.380> light<00:05:17.560> a<00:05:17.590> little<00:05:17.920> better<00:05:23.910> yeah<00:05:24.910> you<00:05:25.150> see<00:05:25.300> a

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
the light a little better yeah you see a

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.240 
the light a little better yeah you see a
little<00:05:25.450> mutt<00:05:25.720> light<00:05:25.900> on<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.260> satellite<00:05:27.070> well

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
little mutt light on the satellite well

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.000 
little mutt light on the satellite well
so<00:05:27.820> I'll<00:05:28.090> turn<00:05:28.240> off<00:05:28.330> the<00:05:28.360> power<00:05:28.630> to<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:29.010> Groton

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
so I'll turn off the power to the Groton

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.810 
so I'll turn off the power to the Groton
ER<00:05:30.100> and<00:05:30.280> you'll<00:05:31.120> see<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:33.130> spectrum<00:05:33.550> will<00:05:33.670> lose

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
ER and you'll see the spectrum will lose

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.350 
ER and you'll see the spectrum will lose
bind<00:05:37.530> see<00:05:38.530> the<00:05:38.770> spectrum<00:05:39.100> lost<00:05:39.340> bind<00:05:39.670> because

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
bind see the spectrum lost bind because

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.560 
bind see the spectrum lost bind because
it's<00:05:40.570> no<00:05:40.660> longer<00:05:40.690> a<00:05:41.050> signal<00:05:42.270> grapplers<00:05:43.270> giving

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
me an error because it's no longer

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.700 
me an error because it's no longer

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
getting that telemetry signal kick that

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.860

thing<00:05:47.740> back<00:05:48.130> on<00:05:50.040> specials<00:05:51.040> back<00:05:51.250> on<00:05:51.870> spectrums

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
thing back on specials back on spectrums

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.200 
thing back on specials back on spectrums
back<00:05:53.080> on<00:05:53.320> this<00:05:54.160> is<00:05:54.310> reporting<00:05:54.700> good<00:05:54.850> signal

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
back on this is reporting good signal

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:01.710 
back on this is reporting good signal
strength<00:05:55.570> and<00:05:58.500> the<00:05:59.500> servo<00:05:59.800> moves<00:05:59.950> again<00:06:00.720> this

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
strength and the servo moves again this

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.830 
strength and the servo moves again this
could<00:06:01.870> be<00:06:01.960> used<00:06:02.140> with<00:06:03.480> there's<00:06:04.480> really<00:06:04.600> not<00:06:04.780> a

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
could be used with there's really not a

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.150 
could be used with there's really not a
whole<00:06:04.990> lot<00:06:05.170> of<00:06:05.290> reason<00:06:05.560> to<00:06:05.620> do<00:06:05.740> it<00:06:05.860> like<00:06:05.980> this

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
whole lot of reason to do it like this

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.620 
whole lot of reason to do it like this
on<00:06:06.370> the<00:06:06.460> grappler<00:06:06.850> because<00:06:07.120> this<00:06:07.270> does<00:06:07.420> have<00:06:07.570> a

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
on the grappler because this does have a

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.990 
on the grappler because this does have a
trainer<00:06:08.500> port<00:06:08.830> so<00:06:08.950> you<00:06:09.010> can<00:06:09.160> use<00:06:09.250> the<00:06:09.340> ppm<00:06:09.790> out

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
trainer port so you can use the ppm out

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.270 
trainer port so you can use the ppm out
instead<00:06:10.810> of<00:06:10.870> going<00:06:11.110> through<00:06:11.170> a<00:06:11.290> receiver<00:06:11.740> this

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
instead of going through a receiver this

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.590 
instead of going through a receiver this
is<00:06:12.430> more<00:06:12.610> just<00:06:12.760> kind<00:06:12.850> of<00:06:12.940> a<00:06:13.000> science<00:06:13.480> fair

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
is more just kind of a science fair

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.990 
is more just kind of a science fair
project<00:06:14.220> this<00:06:15.220> would<00:06:15.340> be<00:06:15.400> an<00:06:15.460> awesome<00:06:15.580> way<00:06:15.790> to

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
project this would be an awesome way to

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.750 
project this would be an awesome way to
do<00:06:16.120> it<00:06:16.300> with<00:06:16.420> a<00:06:16.450> jetty<00:06:16.780> or<00:06:17.190> where<00:06:18.190> it<00:06:18.520> doesn't

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
do it with a jetty or where it doesn't

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.210 
do it with a jetty or where it doesn't
have<00:06:19.090> a<00:06:19.120> trainer<00:06:20.020> port<00:06:20.350> out<00:06:20.530> but<00:06:21.070> the

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
have a trainer port out but the

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.700 
have a trainer port out but the
receivers<00:06:21.730> can<00:06:21.970> do<00:06:22.180> single<00:06:22.540> line<00:06:22.750> ppm<00:06:23.440> output

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
receivers can do single line ppm output

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.010 
receivers can do single line ppm output
also<00:06:26.710> would<00:06:27.100> work<00:06:27.280> with<00:06:27.540> multiplex<00:06:28.540> I<00:06:28.780> think

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
also would work with multiplex I think

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.720 
also would work with multiplex I think
does<00:06:29.170> the<00:06:29.320> same<00:06:29.530> thing<00:06:29.830> and<00:06:30.150> I<00:06:31.150> don't<00:06:31.240> know

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 
does the same thing and I don't know

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.010 
does the same thing and I don't know
pretty<00:06:33.730> much<00:06:33.790> anything<00:06:34.000> that<00:06:34.240> will<00:06:34.420> put<00:06:34.540> ppm

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
pretty much anything that will put ppm

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.439 
pretty much anything that will put ppm
out

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:36.449 
out

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:39.140 
out
you<00:06:37.020> could<00:06:37.169> get<00:06:37.349> rid<00:06:37.559> of<00:06:37.590> the<00:06:37.740> receiver<00:06:38.159> by

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
you could get rid of the receiver by

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.209 
you could get rid of the receiver by
hooking<00:06:39.509> and<00:06:39.749> hook<00:06:40.020> this<00:06:40.169> all<00:06:40.379> up<00:06:40.590> to<00:06:41.189> a

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:41.219 
hooking and hook this all up to a

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:46.339 
hooking and hook this all up to a
trainer<00:06:41.610> port<00:06:44.569> it's<00:06:45.569> just<00:06:45.749> kind<00:06:45.930> of<00:06:45.960> a<00:06:46.050> pain<00:06:46.289> to

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349 
trainer port it's just kind of a pain to

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:48.290 
trainer port it's just kind of a pain to
make<00:06:46.650> the<00:06:46.770> cable<00:06:47.159> this<00:06:47.729> was<00:06:47.939> something<00:06:48.120> I

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
make the cable this was something I

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.489 
make the cable this was something I
could<00:06:48.449> throw<00:06:48.629> together<00:06:48.900> in<00:06:49.080> about<00:06:49.199> two

00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:49.499 
could throw together in about two

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:52.189 
could throw together in about two
minutes<00:06:50.449> Thanks<00:06:51.479> hope<00:06:51.839> you<00:06:51.930> found<00:06:52.050> it

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 
minutes Thanks hope you found it

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:54.409 
minutes Thanks hope you found it
interesting
