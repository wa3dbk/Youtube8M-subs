00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830
 after we fry bacon a 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.600
 picanha with that layer of fat 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.110
 so the pan cools you've already seen 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.750
 that white fat stays for 80 and 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.000
 if you throw the fat still melted 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.529
 in the sink it can cool and even clog the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.210
 drain with ellen gracie 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.260
 This is the same thing with the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.820
 our blood vessels today unborn the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.279
 Goal keep bringing you back. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.869
 baby book review that does this brings 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.150
 da nina takai hawks 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.120
 Do you already see our previous episode that 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.710
 the saturated fat is for example that 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.860
 that we find in the meats 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.570
 coconut oil the eggs milk and derivatives 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.890
 of milk and also we explain 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.559
 any difference between fat 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.840
 saturated and unsaturated if you have not seen 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.649
 go to our site youtube.com makes a 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.750
 register 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.730
 from there you receive all the materials to 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.379
 understand why they say that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.960
 saturated fat makes bad 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.620
 We're going to make a trip here in time. 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.370
 let's go to the state of lens at the beginning 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.369
 of the 1950s and the fourth in the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.710
 Scientist, what do you think this is? 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.049
 wanted to stop heart disease that 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.360
 were popcorn caught a big 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.460
 epidemic in the united states 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.939
 In previous episodes we talked about 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.790
 respect of the researcher george mec was 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.700
 for africa search how the tribes 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.950
 out of the sea ​​were able to live without 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.080
 diseases of modernity disease which 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.820
 right now you're thinking so 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.259
 very similar to jorge neto 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.590
 he believes that there is something 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.680
 Special lifestyle that may or 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.479
 cause or prevent heart disease 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.790
 similarly ends here because more 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.850
 late we'll see that he eats what dilma 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.640
 got way are quite different 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.340
 disease, which is the way to reduce 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.369
 deaths from heart attacks 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.040
 cholesterol levels in the blood of 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.290
 people the cholesterol sarico he was 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.229
 so confident with this hypothesis 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.509
 that in 1957 it reached the point of 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.790
 present a formula a formula for 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.270
 to lower blood cholesterol through 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.569
 the reduction of fat consumption in 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.650
 especially the saturated fat then is 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.629
 that's why there is 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.280
 all the saturated fat yes but let's 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.909
 keep calm let's explain a little 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.680
 better this story in 1952 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.750
 the researchers were investigating 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.939
 how does fat substitution 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.120
 food of animal origin by 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.739
 vegetable fats 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.439
 could lower the total level of 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.250
 blood cholesterol and was the researcher 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:40.709
 and Amems thought he had discovered that 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.040
 saturated butter and oil fats 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.260
 increased the level of 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.519
 cholesterol levels compared to 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.319
 other types of fat 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:54.060
 It's good that he was researching a 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:56.879
 thorough meticulous cautious it does not 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.099
 He left his mouth there when he 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.870
 has used more 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.109
 he realized that cholesterol 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.560
 is not in an up and down depending on the 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:10.590
 that the person eating there was something heterogeneous 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.590
 between heterogeneous human responses 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.359
 that depends depends on who was the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.430
 person and this has a lot to do with what 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:20.099
 You learn here in the woods, gold is always 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.500
 fundamental to know and respect the 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.299
 individuality so please do not see 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.769
 an information out there only implementing 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.269
 alone everything you do with yours 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.250
 health has to be monitored 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.739
 quality professional 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.959
 the big problem was that in this environment 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.720
 time the other researchers were already 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.000
 convinced that the food reaction in the 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.590
 cholesterol was uniform and not 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.329
 heterogeneous, everyone was already 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.340
 surveys in progress 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.440
 to understand how the fats 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.690
 saturated increased levels 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.449
 cholesterol and despite the retraction of the pib 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.889
 hawks say he taught him that he was 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.739
 a very strong personality 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.120
 the man who spoke with conviction and 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.579
 when he began to give opinions 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.310
 public to the media within the community 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.620
 he was the one who had the floor. 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.180
 end is the methodology problem 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.310
 scientific that we have a book 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.979
 playing peace because I wanted to present 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.979
 national network on the assumption that 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:15.780
 Saturated fat do badly and it required 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:18.329
 anyone who disagreed with 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.519
 to provide concrete evidence that 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.019
 His hypothesis was a fairy 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.180
 This is as absurd as I get. 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.760
 talk look people who built the 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.690
 pyramids of Egypt were aliens of 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.150
 another dimension 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.250
 They are and who disagree with me have to 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.550
 prove that there are no 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.040
 aliens from another dimension is not well 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.850
 so logic works in science 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.310
 the hypothesis is who has the 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.900
 UNOCI to prove the quality and even 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.550
 bring proof with proof is 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.680
 presented is still a little bit 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.610
 doubt because science has always been 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.470
 evolving 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.600
 we still have a lot to learn is 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.580
 It is important to know that we do not 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.590
 recognize with humility 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.060
 what we do not know as always 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.270
 Thank you so much for following the 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.970
 work our unborn gold learning 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.250
 science rationality some bases of 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.590
 I kill where our work in the face 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.790
 anyway this was the channel youtube.com bar 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.440
 his wingman 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.150
 we published a video which explains 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.680
 goal committee that has a question 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.630
 provocative 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.860
 do people exist that are so good that 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.270
 can not even understand the 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.940
 own stupid 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.430
 This is a metacognition chat that you 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.920
 you can use the link that appeared in some 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.000
 fight place there I asked the 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.460
 friends 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.350
 what kind of contribution is our 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.600
 Work because to you it's our friend. 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.570
 gabriela luciana left a comment 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.610
 that cheered me decoration she says 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.620
 I think the biggest contribution of the channel 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.690
 in my life was the change in form 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.330
 How do I understand the legal things? 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.710
 gabriela, this idea is just right 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.830
 of people use YouTube for us to 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.890
 connect exchange ideas and always 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.900
 improve our rationality and good 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.510
 for you and everyone is watching here 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.840
 thank you very much for being a part of 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.840
 communities
