00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.270

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.510
 hi babys how are i 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.190
 Welcome to cook who a la carte 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.930
 this time I'm going to teach you 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.490
 prepare something that you asked me 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.439
 that I was checking the comments that 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.480
 they left me around and they told me that 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.130
 they wanted to make something of the ninja turtles 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.750
 which I thought was excellent because 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.730
 right now is the movie and well father and 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.800
 I loved the ninja turtles when I was 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.079
 Little girl saw the caricature was super 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.480
 happy then this time I'm going to 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.820
 teach how to prepare delicious and more 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.010
 turtle cake pops 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.500
 I love the ninja turtles with all my soul 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.450
 and then nothing seemed super nice 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.809
 and they are super simple to do everything 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:57.200
 what we need is a bread that big or 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:00.340
 sweet bread dry a cream cheese bar 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.799
 to sugar glass more or less a cup 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.260
 pallets for pallet 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:10.620
 chocolate in sparks of green color 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.600
 fondant white red blue orange and 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.870
 purple if you do not find these colors 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.700
 you can buy white and dye it yourself 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.440
 First take a medium bowl and go to 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.330
 undo the bread that bit by bit 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.730
 until it is done crumbs 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.920
 since you have this you are going to add the 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.830
 half of the cream cheese bar and you're going to 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.729
 Mix 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.370
 later add a 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.260
 sprinkled small sugar icing yes 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.000
 the mixture is getting very doughy 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.470
 add a little more icing sugar 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.050
 until I have more or less the 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.500
 consistency that you're seeing does not owe you 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.180
 get sticky but not too dry 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.950
 now you are going to take small balls of 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.229
 this mixture roughly the size of 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.550
 a nut and knead it to form a 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.680
 sphere 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.660
 with your fingers press the middle 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.630
 to give it the shape of the head of the 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.640
 turtle that should be narrower than 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.530
 the part of the forehead and thicker of the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.060
 part of the mouth the forehead goes more 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.280
 narrow so we can put the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.440
 mask when you've done this with all 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.720
 the dough melts the green chocolate 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.760
 dip a chocolate popsicle stick 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.740
 and nail it below the heads more 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.810
 or less until the middle this is going to act 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.490
 as glue so that the cake pops do not 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.350
 get out by covering them with chocolate 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.810
 when you finish with all of them 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.400
 Refri for 5 minutes no more than this 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.050
 because if not the temperature change 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.700
 when you cover them with chocolate, 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.770
 make the chocolate break and it does not go 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.300
 to be so father now take out the cake 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.940
 Refresh pops and since you have the 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.310
 chocolate with the ideal consistency of 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.140
 submerging it one by one inside the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.870
 chocolate and help you with a spoon 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.580
 to cover them well on all sides already 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.380
 that is ready, take them out with a lot 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.390
 Take care and remove the excess 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.670
 chocolate by gently tapping on the 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.070
 bowl edge was rotating the cake pop 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.570
 until removing the excess this is a 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.400
 bit slow but take your time 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.290
 because if you do not have to drain all the 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.300
 chocolate by the pallette stick and goes to 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.730
 to be a disaster 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.800
 when it's ready, stick the stick in a 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.940
 Thick unicel to dry and do what 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.220
 same with all the rest 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.080
 now let's make the masks you 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.970
 I recommend that you sprinkle this area of 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.620
 I work with a little icing sugar and 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.319
 if you want you can also do it on 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.390
 a waxed paper so that it does not stick 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.769
 first take some fondant from 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.109
 color of the mask you are going to make 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.290
 first in my purple case and do what 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.829
 rollito since it is ready to flatten it with 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.829
 a roller 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.500
 now take a knife preferably a 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.630
 chive like this you're seeing and 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.030
 now you're going to cut the bottom along 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.430
 in a straight way you should stay more or 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.350
 less than 1 centimeter thick depends 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.270
 the size of your cake pop for mine 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.370
 this works very well 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.170
 now raise it up you were going to accommodate it 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.400
 around the narrow part of your 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.439
 turtle 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.269
 do not forget to stick it with a little bit of 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:55.939
 chocolate that will act as glue 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.799
 so that you do not slip, do this with 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.950
 patience and a lot of care so that you 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.830
 be perfect now only cut the 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.020
 leftovers from the fonden 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.360
 let's leave this part for a moment 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.490
 a little way to make eyes and 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.520
 the mouth flattens the white fondant and with 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.770
 a knife cut scalene triangle 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.260
 calculates that they fit inside the mask and 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.700
 He also cut a little mouth I made it 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.250
 this way and it 's kind of weird for that 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.470
 have battle expression now with a 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.660
 chocolate stick the eyes in the 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.700
 old and the mouth places the side 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.190
 that you like, let it dry 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.670
 approximately two or three minutes and already 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.670
 You finished 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:48.659
 and that was all I hope there was 

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:50.489
 really liked the truth I had fun 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.469
 very much making them are super 

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:54.599
 simple you already know that if 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:56.369
 they want to give away the something here more father 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.589
 then just put them a little bag of 

00:04:56.369 --> 00:05:00.389
 cellophane with a piece of string of zeal 

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:02.519
 silk or whatever you find 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.039
 and you're ready these cake pops are 

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:06.899
 they keep for about a week 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:09.329
 out of the refrigerator so they have 

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:11.429
 enough time to give it away 

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:13.110
 make a themed party or what more 

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:14.999
