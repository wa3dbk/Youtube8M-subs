cheesing<00:01:46.680> himself<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.210> it's<00:01:48.210> not<00:01:48.479> that

have<00:01:48.840> been<00:01:48.960> taking<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.710> many<00:01:49.950> threes

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
have been taking that many threes

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.060 
have been taking that many threes
honestly<00:01:50.939> um<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:52.049> think<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.500> biggest<00:01:52.799> thing

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
honestly um I think the biggest thing

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.760 
honestly um I think the biggest thing
right<00:01:53.399> now<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:54.030> I've<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.570> been<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.649> my

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
right now is that I've just been for my

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.459 
right now is that I've just been for my
highlights<00:01:56.340> using<00:01:56.729> law<00:01:56.880> threes<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.689> i<00:01:57.899> guess

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
highlights using law threes and i guess

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.719 
highlights using law threes and i guess
i<00:01:58.500> shouldn't<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.520> future

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
i shouldn't do that in the future

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.630 
i shouldn't do that in the future
because<00:02:00.060> if<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.780> mean<00:02:01.049> fairly<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.340> leads

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
because if I I mean fairly so it leads

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.070 
because if I I mean fairly so it leads
you<00:02:02.850> guys<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.390> believe

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
you guys to believe

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.980
