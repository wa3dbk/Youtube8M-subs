00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
we are born with inherited differences

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.420 
we are born with inherited differences
our<00:00:06.240> genes<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.870> few<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.439> blueprints<00:00:08.100> for<00:00:08.220> all

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
the components of the cells and tissues

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.780 
the components of the cells and tissues
in<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.500> body<00:00:10.589> and<00:00:10.920> then<00:00:11.280> we<00:00:11.400> have<00:00:11.519> different

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
in the body and then we have different

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.829 
in the body and then we have different
experiences<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:12.420> are<00:00:12.480> unique<00:00:12.809> to

individuals these conspire to create
diseases<00:00:16.530> and<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.920> think<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.310> many<00:00:17.430> ways<00:00:17.580> it's

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
diseases and I think in many ways it's

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.150 
diseases and I think in many ways it's
not<00:00:18.120> surprising<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.990> they'll<00:00:19.830> make<00:00:20.130> us

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
not surprising that they'll make us

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.490 
not surprising that they'll make us
different<00:00:20.760> when<00:00:21.300> we<00:00:21.480> undergo<00:00:21.990> treatment<00:00:22.230> and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
different when we undergo treatment and

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.920 
different when we undergo treatment and
that's<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.830> idea<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.130> personalized<00:00:23.550> medicine

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
that's the idea of personalized medicine

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.510 
that's the idea of personalized medicine
the<00:00:24.930> right<00:00:25.140> treatment<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:25.860> the<00:00:25.890> right<00:00:26.190> time

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
the right treatment at the right time

the right treatment at the right time

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
individualized medicine is changing the

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.860 
individualized medicine is changing the
whole<00:00:31.770> way<00:00:31.920> we<00:00:32.070> practice<00:00:32.669> all<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.359> healthcare

whole way we practice all of healthcare
across<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:34.649> diseases<00:00:35.870> but<00:00:36.870> technology<00:00:37.170> is

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
across all diseases but technology is

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.049 
across all diseases but technology is
going<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.589> be<00:00:37.710> introduced<00:00:38.160> much<00:00:38.550> more<00:00:38.820> quickly

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
going to be introduced much more quickly

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.360 
going to be introduced much more quickly
in<00:00:39.329> cancer<00:00:39.719> because<00:00:40.109> cancers<00:00:40.649> are<00:00:40.859> diseases

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
in cancer because cancers are diseases

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.119 
in cancer because cancers are diseases
of<00:00:41.609> defective<00:00:42.539> genes<00:00:42.780> acquired<00:00:43.350> defects<00:00:43.949> of

of defective genes acquired defects of

of defective genes acquired defects of

genetic changes 500 or more epi genome
changes<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.289> I<00:00:52.289> think<00:00:52.949> what<00:00:53.100> we're<00:00:53.249> going<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
changes and I think what we're going to

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.610 
changes and I think what we're going to
see<00:00:53.640> happen<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.359> ability<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.929> look<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.319> all

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
see happen is the ability to look at all

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.250 
see happen is the ability to look at all
the<00:00:56.010> gene<00:00:56.219> sequences<00:00:56.909> have<00:00:57.269> all<00:00:57.839> the<00:00:58.050> gene

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
the gene sequences have all the gene

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.950 
the gene sequences have all the gene
changes<00:00:58.530> at<00:00:59.100> our<00:00:59.670> disposal<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.479> make<00:01:00.600> clinical

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
changes at our disposal to make clinical

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.500 
changes at our disposal to make clinical
decisions<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:02.010> think<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.120> will<00:01:03.300> come

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
decisions I think that will come

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.740 
decisions I think that will come
probably<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.440> four<00:01:05.130> to<00:01:05.280> five<00:01:05.489> year<00:01:05.910> time

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
probably in the four to five year time

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.310 
probably in the four to five year time
frame<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.980> think<00:01:08.370> there<00:01:08.520> will<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:08.730> a

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
frame and I think there will be a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.440 
frame and I think there will be a
different<00:01:10.320> style<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.860> interaction<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.700> suspect

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
different style of interaction I suspect

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.570 
different style of interaction I suspect
between<00:01:12.990> physician<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.550> patient

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
between physician and the patient

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.820 
between physician and the patient
probably<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:15.780> patient<00:01:15.960> will<00:01:16.230> have<00:01:16.260> at

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
probably be the patient will have at

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.370 
probably be the patient will have at
their<00:01:17.100> disposal<00:01:17.510> all<00:01:18.510> of<00:01:19.020> their<00:01:19.200> health
