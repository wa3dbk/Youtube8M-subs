00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 put 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.290
 Hello guys 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.700
 today we are going to make a delicious 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:32.000
 More 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:36.610
 Look let's speed up the child bids. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.150
 your eating offer tudibom visit 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.910
 healthy 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.910
 the allergy an excellent outlet 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:18.920
 China sees 34- year-old woman 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:31.399
 fake sugar and tea salt 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.490
 op is a cup and a half 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:17.140
 then you put castán as a family or with 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.660
 talk about me 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.470
 the Flemish has a man not only put 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.770
 wesley plus again put a 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.770
 substitute 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.400
 in the case of ISL 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:11.990
 now we will put the right water 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:15.360
 just as our Brazil is 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.770
 very large then each case of the 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.440
 a temperature is not 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.910
 this will also influence this point 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.790
 so the water is depends on the 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.710
 margarine you are using and depends on 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.930
 temperature is making the night is 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.270
 talking days everything influences but I go 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.100
 show how much is what matters right 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:40.170
 I thought I was little or more. 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:43.520
 but she was not full so I guess 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.520
 I 'll put you a little more than a year. 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.090
 already the water candidate 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.430
 depends largely on the temperature of the 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.220
 city of the day 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.580
 if you're making the biscuit 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.860
 night today, morning, old, everything interferes 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.410
 So move me and the box will be with 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.370
 I put more or less 1 cup 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:18.150
 of water used in the old neighborhood 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.150
 miner 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:34.220
 Oh, people, look how much this is the point. 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:38.390
 he's going I'm going to take that class that 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:43.910
 It's all dirty in that fifth then he 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:48.710
 You're ready to roll a hatchet ball. 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:52.460
 and rolling so our aim is not to 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:56.780
 breed caring otherwise sequels the whole mass 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:59.170
 It's very nice to end your favor to 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.170
 day 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:28.220
 the balls and the boring and there's a 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.630
 little finger more or less tall in this 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:36.260
 person does not need to talk too much 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.670
 because it will not grow without yeast 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.850
 or anything 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:51.230
 it just so people will go 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:58.340
 ask why understanding was 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:06:03.010
 that I went with a complement and found 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:06.220
 very much all this close to getting started 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.220
 so for example 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:26.969
 it folks zeroes 32 rolê know and today 

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:33.139
 craft that looks good format that you 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:33.139
 can be part of the botafogo universe 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:56.330
 in 32 games here goes 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:19.289
 Good people left and did not come back. 

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:24.869
 I need to show you the result. 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:27.319
 is that this timber peanut disk 

00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:28.860
 it got very yummy very smelly 

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:32.149
 there goes 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:34.619
 In this case I put the fire out but he 

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:36.509
 ended up not taking it if that's the case 

00:07:34.619 --> 00:07:37.469
 There are people who like cookies well. 

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:39.779
 crunchy 

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:41.729
 I like him but I was born so I should 

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:45.059
 have turned off fire before a little bit 

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:49.709
 It's been five minutes since then. 

00:07:45.059 --> 00:07:57.089
 he stayed that it is better to put the fish 

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:59.849
