00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello today I bring you a tartar recipe 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.240
 Salmon is a little different 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.040
 of a couscous base with salmon and some 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.809
 roe is a very simple recipe and that 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.210
 the truth is that it looks very good so 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.689
 Take note of the ingredients 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.730
 ingredients are 150 grams of couscous and 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.609
 what is done in a fast way would be 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.689
 buy couscous or wheat semolina 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.789
 Microwave for one minute 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.820
 and a half and it only swells and will be 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.710
 Perfect to eat if you can not have it 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.830
 one hour or so in water to be 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.670
 go hydrating soy sauce pepper 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.140
 a tomato shredded lumpo roe in 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.170
 this case you have chosen black but 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.019
 they could be red 200 grams of salmon 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.170
 smoked and a small cut onion 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.269
 at first where we have the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.930
 grated tomato let's add the 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.930
 Pepper 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.350
 the chive and the salmon that we have 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.820
 crushed you can crush or cut 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.210
 but as you want 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.299
 and once we have done this 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.159
 let's move it until a mass 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.499
 homogeneous 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.259
 once we have the mass ready only 

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:25.490
 we have to add a good sauce 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.439
 to that and we move again 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.909
 once we have all the 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.680
 made ingredients comes the moment of the 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.689
 assembly can be mounted as a 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.950
 normal salad but we are going to 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.619
 give it a slightly different touch 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.970
 using a cylinder the cylinders 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.579
 in contraction any store so 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.860
 it's something very easy to look for first 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:47.430
 let's put a layer of 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.940
 couscous the wheat and we're going to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.940
 smash 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.150
 Then you should see that the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.280
 layer is well crushed because if not 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.100
 you will never be stable when you 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.110
 let's remove the habit is worth then 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.830
 a little bit of the mix we have made 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:16.660
 with tomato salmon chive 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.660
 and we repeat the project 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.460
 is to crush a little bit 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.990
 after that again 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.990
 a little couscous or 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.710
 This type of cylinders is fine 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.380
 to calculate more or less what would be 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.360
 the reaction of a person we return to 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.470
 put the salmon 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.470
 and now 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.870
 we crush everything well 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.470
 and we are going to put a little bit of eggs 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.470
 above 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.379
 and again we are going to crush them 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.290
 once you have this it is very easy 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.060
 play I want to say first always put 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.250
 first we do the pair just base 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.260
 but we can put it we make the roe 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.090
 and then salmon 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.090
 that and a little bit your imagination 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.370
 and we have finished the plate advice yo 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.860
 I would keep it that way and just before 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.570
 to serve it would remove it since if not to 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.520
 final finishes missing a little liquid 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.950
 and it spreads a little inoperable 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.400
 here we have our tartar ready 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.980
 salmon and couscous remember that you can see 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.980
