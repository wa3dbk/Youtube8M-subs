lights I have on just really romantic so
yeah<00:00:52.309> these<00:00:53.309> are<00:00:53.370> not<00:00:53.730> exactly<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.390> safest

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
yeah these are not exactly the safest

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.460 
yeah these are not exactly the safest
the<00:00:55.890> forehead<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.400> your<00:00:56.580> kind<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.910> slippery

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and getting things up here is not easy

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.229 
and getting things up here is not easy
believe<00:01:01.350> me<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.949> pretty<00:01:02.699> much<00:01:02.820> all<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.150> up

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
believe me so pretty much all it's up

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.700 
believe me so pretty much all it's up
there<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.540> bed<00:01:03.780> which<00:01:04.290> i'm<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.589> show

whole furniture that you can really

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.450 
whole furniture that you can really
bring<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.690> there<00:01:09.930> safely<00:01:10.440> so<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.400> to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
bring up there safely so it's going to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.700 
bring up there safely so it's going to
be<00:01:11.550> a<00:01:11.640> minimal<00:01:12.090> little<00:01:12.750> makeover<00:01:13.050> just<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
be a minimal little makeover just to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.219 
be a minimal little makeover just to
show<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.540> how<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.630> can<00:01:15.720> just<00:01:15.900> add<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.050> little

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
show you how you can just add a little

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.190 
show you how you can just add a little
color<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.920> warmth<00:01:17.280> into<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.610> small<00:01:18.060> space<00:01:18.210> so

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
color and warmth into a small space so

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.170 
color and warmth into a small space so
let's<00:01:19.560> climb<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:23.340> i'm<00:01:23.400> stepping<00:01:23.760> up<00:01:23.850> from<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
let's climb so i'm stepping up from the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.830 
let's climb so i'm stepping up from the
final<00:01:24.750> step<00:01:25.740> right<00:01:25.920> here<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:27.420> ceilings

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
final step right here the ceilings

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.840 
final step right here the ceilings
aren't<00:01:28.020> very<00:01:28.290> high<00:01:28.530> they're<00:01:29.219> probably<00:01:29.430> I'd

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
aren't very high they're probably I'd

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.209 
aren't very high they're probably I'd
say<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.210> seven<00:01:30.420> feet<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.619> left<00:01:31.710> here<00:01:32.040> is

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
say like seven feet to the left here is

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.800 
say like seven feet to the left here is
like<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.369> little<00:01:32.579> storage<00:01:32.880> closet<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:35.810> there's

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
like a little storage closet and there's

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.410 
like a little storage closet and there's
a<00:01:36.930> few<00:01:37.110> things<00:01:37.289> storing<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.890> there<00:01:38.420> random

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
a few things storing in there random

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.969 
a few things storing in there random
things<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.020> little<00:01:40.170> thing<00:01:40.439> hung<00:01:40.680> up<00:01:40.829> on

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
things have this little thing hung up on

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.639 
things have this little thing hung up on
the<00:01:41.070> door<00:01:41.659> but<00:01:42.659> probably<00:01:43.229> put<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> rack<00:01:43.619> in

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the door but probably put a rack in

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.410 
the door but probably put a rack in
there<00:01:43.950> some<00:01:44.130> things<00:01:44.310> people<00:01:44.789> wanted<00:01:44.969> to<00:01:45.060> hang

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
there some things people wanted to hang

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.510 
there some things people wanted to hang
up<00:01:45.539> their<00:01:45.810> clothes<00:01:46.079> although<00:01:46.619> getting

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
up their clothes although getting

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.279 
up their clothes although getting
dressed<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:47.880> here<00:01:48.060> isn't<00:01:48.299> really<00:01:48.509> ideal<00:01:48.930> as

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
dressed up here isn't really ideal as

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:50.569 
dressed up here isn't really ideal as
far<00:01:49.500> as<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:50.039> guests<00:01:50.430> because

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
far as if you have guests because

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.929 
far as if you have guests because
bringing<00:01:51.359> up<00:01:51.479> their<00:01:51.689> bags<00:01:51.869> alone<00:01:52.469> of<00:01:52.740> this

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
bringing up their bags alone of this

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.179 
bringing up their bags alone of this
ladder<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.060> pretty<00:01:54.719> treacherous<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.530> most<00:01:56.039> of

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
ladder is pretty treacherous so most of

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.740 
ladder is pretty treacherous so most of
the<00:01:56.250> getting<00:01:57.000> ready<00:01:57.030> would<00:01:57.359> probably<00:01:57.630> go<00:01:57.719> out

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
the getting ready would probably go out

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.050 
the getting ready would probably go out
on<00:01:58.170> downstairs<00:01:58.740> well<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.700> would<00:01:59.850> just<00:01:59.939> be

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
on downstairs well this would just be

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270 
on downstairs well this would just be
strictly<00:02:00.539> for<00:02:00.810> sleeping<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.039> the<00:02:02.159> other

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
strictly for sleeping this is the other

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.679 
strictly for sleeping this is the other
side<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.609> don't<00:02:02.880> know<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.149> tell<00:02:03.329> this

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
side I don't know if you can tell this

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.209 
side I don't know if you can tell this
wall<00:02:04.049> right<00:02:04.079> here<00:02:04.289> is<00:02:04.679> like<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.979> diagonal

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
wall right here is like on a diagonal

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.139 
wall right here is like on a diagonal
and<00:02:06.030> then<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.869> kind<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.109> goes<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.859> dense<00:02:08.850> there

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
and then it kind of goes in dense there

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.029 
and then it kind of goes in dense there
too<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.259> nice<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.590> bright<00:02:10.710> because<00:02:10.920> it

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
too but it's nice and bright because it

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.430 
too but it's nice and bright because it
has<00:02:11.130> those<00:02:11.280> two<00:02:11.520> windows<00:02:12.110> which<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.260> will<00:02:13.410> be

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
has those two windows which I will be

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.650 
has those two windows which I will be
putting<00:02:13.710> up<00:02:13.980> some<00:02:14.400> kind<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.000> sheer<00:02:15.330> ish

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
putting up some kind of sheer ish

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.050 
putting up some kind of sheer ish
curtains<00:02:16.230> just<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.220> block<00:02:17.370> out<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.610> little<00:02:17.820> bit

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
curtains just to block out a little bit

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.180
