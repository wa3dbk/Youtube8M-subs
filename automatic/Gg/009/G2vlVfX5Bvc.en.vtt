it's gonna have I'm just gonna put dots
on<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.170> I'm<00:01:31.290> imagining<00:01:31.560> these<00:01:31.890> are<00:01:32.070> kind<00:01:32.220> of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
on it I'm imagining these are kind of

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.740 
on it I'm imagining these are kind of
little<00:01:32.490> holes<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.119> punctured<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.630> it

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
little holes that have punctured in it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.969 
little holes that have punctured in it
so<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.290> kind<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.530> burn<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
so that you can kind of burn the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.550 
so that you can kind of burn the
frankincense<00:01:35.490> inside<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.960> smoke<00:01:37.290> will

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
frankincense inside and the smoke will

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.090 
frankincense inside and the smoke will
come<00:01:37.829> out<00:01:38.360> that's<00:01:39.360> my<00:01:39.509> idea<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.619> whether

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
come out that's my idea but whether

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.590 
come out that's my idea but whether
that's<00:01:41.220> correct<00:01:41.430> or<00:01:41.790> not<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.210> something<00:01:42.420> I

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
that's correct or not is something I

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.690 
that's correct or not is something I
have<00:01:42.720> saket<00:01:43.079> know<00:01:43.890> what<00:01:44.040> we<00:01:44.189> gonna<00:01:44.340> want<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.579> do

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.370 
I'm gonna press it'll call it in there
I'm<00:02:28.000> thinking<00:02:28.060> if<00:02:28.599> it<00:02:28.720> was<00:02:28.840> being<00:02:29.080> more<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.319> a

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
I'm thinking if it was being more of a

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.640 
I'm thinking if it was being more of a
wise<00:02:29.590> man<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.280> he's<00:02:30.489> kind<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:31.470> with<00:02:32.470> his

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
wise man and he's kind of with his

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.790 
wise man and he's kind of with his
kingly<00:02:32.980> pals<00:02:33.900> but<00:02:34.900> he<00:02:34.989> doesn't<00:02:35.260> feel<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.620> need

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
kingly pals but he doesn't feel the need

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.070 
kingly pals but he doesn't feel the need
to<00:02:35.830> show<00:02:36.220> off<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.760> dress<00:02:37.030> too<00:02:37.860> cleverly<00:02:38.860> maybe

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
to show off and dress too cleverly maybe

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.509 
to show off and dress too cleverly maybe
richly<00:02:41.080> but<00:02:41.410> not<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:43.230> over<00:02:44.230> showy<00:02:45.040> that's

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
richly but not to over showy that's

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.180 
richly but not to over showy that's
probably<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:45.910> way<00:02:46.030> they're<00:02:46.209> looking<00:02:46.330> for<00:02:47.190> so

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
probably the way they're looking for so

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.370 
probably the way they're looking for so
he's<00:02:48.610> now<00:02:49.769> very<00:02:50.769> very<00:02:50.860> simple<00:02:52.110> down<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.290> the

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.290 
could probably warm up that collar there
as<00:04:41.720> well<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:43.100> we<00:04:43.310> can<00:04:43.460> use<00:04:43.610> some<00:04:43.760> dark<00:04:44.120> brown
