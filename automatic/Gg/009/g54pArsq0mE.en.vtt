Hello and welcome to the Xperia website and our youtube chanel.

00:00:13.768 --> 00:00:17.268
We have the smartphone Sony Xperia T here

00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:23.868
which is still the the best phone of Sony Mobile available on the market so far...

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.800
This phone should get an official update of Android 4.1
Jelly bean within next two months.

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:35.422
Unofficial version of 4.1 is already available..

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:42.919
and besides the 4.1, it brings also a lot of other features

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:49.665
and that is the reason of making this video - to show you what we get included.

00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:57.331
Cyanogen Mod has been introduced by me already several times ... also for Xperia T.

00:00:57.346 --> 00:01:02.846
But this time I dediced to spice our overview up with some really nice theme

00:01:02.914 --> 00:01:06.214
so this is not going to be only about the features and functions,

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:13.566
which are by the way quite comprehensive
and the phone works absolutelly without any problems

00:01:13.652 --> 00:01:20.252
But my aim is to show you also how the Cyanogen looks like.

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:24.647
It begins with the quite nice switching feature

00:01:24.692 --> 00:01:28.792
and I am going to show you much more.

00:01:28.843 --> 00:01:33.443
Then It will be only up to you, to decide
whether you like this ROM

00:01:33.444 --> 00:01:39.244
and whether you'd decide to install it on your device or not.

00:01:39.328 --> 00:01:42.428
I have the ROM in my device already for a while

00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:52.589
and basically I found nothing what would disallow me
to use the phone as a main device on daily base.

00:01:52.616 --> 00:01:57.316
The design of the whole ROM and theme is really great

00:01:57.378 --> 00:02:05.178
especially with consideration of full functionality including Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth, GPS,

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:10.724
including ability to install the market apps without any problem...

00:02:10.813 --> 00:02:14.613
I have to say, the outcome is from my point of view really perfect.

00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:17.556
I've alredy said that a time ago, but I must repeat,

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.070
that in this moment there is no need for me to stay
with original (Sony) ROM

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:28.267
...moreover I can not wait the upgrade of this unofficial ROM

00:02:28.311 --> 00:02:36.211
because from design as well as the function point of view it brings
a better experience

00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:39.116
than the official one

00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:43.281
As you can see, not only the icons of system apps have changed

00:02:43.317 --> 00:02:46.217
but also some icons of additionally installed apps have changed as well.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.270
Of course, with increasing amount of apps will increase also
amount of icons

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:55.812
that will not be alligned with the whole theme.

00:02:55.926 --> 00:03:00.626
So, the more apps you'll install the less icons will be alligned

00:03:00.872 --> 00:03:05.972
but the colored base of the theme will stay unchanged and

00:03:05.988 --> 00:03:09.188
from my point of view really beautiful.

00:03:09.406 --> 00:03:14.806
One of the new features coming with Androind 4.1 Jelly bean
provided by Sony

00:03:14.818 --> 00:03:18.518
is a new and distinctly modified launcher

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:26.533
finally allowing to adjust an amount of screens as you wish

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.449
This feature has not been supported by original ROMs until now.

00:03:31.696 --> 00:03:37.796
It has not been an issue for modified ROMs

00:03:37.873 --> 00:03:45.273
Cyanogen Mod itself allows this feature for a quite long time

00:03:45.322 --> 00:03:48.422
same as e.g. lay out of the grid (matrix) etc.

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.919
Nevertheless, original Xperia launcher could be the favourite one for
some of us irrespective of CyanogenMod's one.

00:03:53.928 --> 00:03:57.718
That's the reason why I have created an istalation package for recovery menu

00:03:57.797 --> 00:04:03.697
allowing you to choose the launcher you'd like to have

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:13.620
as you can see here, by clickling the "use" button is easy to
switch to the new Xperia launcher.

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:18.969
where we can easily add or delete the screens

00:04:18.986 --> 00:04:27.086
but the look of the content remains unchanged as provided by Sony.

00:04:27.821 --> 00:04:33.921
Basically there is no difference. Both launchers work great

00:04:33.957 --> 00:04:41.057
I just would like to show you, that there is no problem to install the
oficial launcher also into the unofficial ROM

00:04:41.545 --> 00:04:48.645
only the recovery menu is needed and the rest is easy

00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:53.665
What I would like to get improved, is the transparency of the 
background here...

00:04:53.718 --> 00:05:00.118
as you can see by switching to the original (Cyanogen) launcher

00:05:00.772 --> 00:05:04.872
the black backgroung looks much better from my point of view...

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.179
colours of icons can stand out much better

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:15.379
When I switch back to the Xperia launcher, the background is neither
dark nor transparent

00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:21.536
and the complete image caused by graphical effects is a bit lost

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.690
and the overall impression is not so flawless.

00:05:25.703 --> 00:05:29.703
In anyway there is no doubt, that this unofficial Android 4.1.2

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:33.962
for Xperia T has been developped to the great ROM

00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:39.996
and I would say, that it is very suitable for daily intensive use

00:05:40.066 --> 00:05:44.466
and if you don't like the adroid installed in your device, provided
by Sony

00:05:44.564 --> 00:05:47.964
...that means the offical one...

00:05:48.003 --> 00:05:54.303
then I would definitelly recommend this modified ROM and
also this theme you can see on my device

00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:58.987
becuase, honestly speaking, I haven't found any nicer theme.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.630
It just fits to the phone

00:06:01.637 --> 00:06:07.137
it pushes the usability of the phone significatntly forward

00:06:07.364 --> 00:06:10.764
I mean the ROM of course, not the theme itself..

00:06:10.894 --> 00:06:17.394
...and I enjoy the using of the phone, in terms of functions
and in terms of the new graphic.

00:06:17.416 --> 00:06:21.416
So, I definitelly rate this ROM by 10 points of 10...

00:06:21.717 --> 00:06:25.917
.. and if I could rate it by 100 I would do so...

00:06:26.036 --> 00:06:30.336
Not everything is perfect and tiny mistakes time to time appear

00:06:30.803 --> 00:06:33.903
e.g. wi-fi works in my case after 4 or 5 restarts

00:06:34.044 --> 00:06:39.844
it works so, since I have installed this ROM. But because I know 
about this tiny issue and I know how to solve that

00:06:39.934 --> 00:06:45.534
it is not a big problem for me... wi-fi sooner or later finds the signal and gets conected

00:06:45.631 --> 00:06:50.531
and those few restarts I can accept

00:06:50.556 --> 00:06:54.656
The camera works also as fine as the othe functionalities
I already mentioned

00:06:54.687 --> 00:06:57.287
instalation of apps works smooth as well.

00:06:57.526 --> 00:07:03.626
And, from my point of view, the graphic combined with the version of Android

00:07:03.694 --> 00:07:06.694
that's the main blockbuster... So, I can only

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.860
recommend this ROM and there is not so much more to say..

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:12.849
Thank you very much for watching this video

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:14.433
...stay tuned...

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:17.999
...and see you next time.
