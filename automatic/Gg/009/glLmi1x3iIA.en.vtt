00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980 

hello<00:00:00.630> guys<00:00:00.900> I'm<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.500> Meccans<00:00:02.040> from<00:00:02.780> my<00:00:03.780> crib

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
hello guys I'm the Meccans from my crib

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.869 
hello guys I'm the Meccans from my crib
for<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.290> win<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:05.130> will<00:00:05.310> show<00:00:05.339> you<00:00:05.609> how<00:00:05.700> to

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
for the win and I will show you how to

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.799 
for the win and I will show you how to
make<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.390> clean<00:00:07.230> stone<00:00:07.560> generator<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.809> why

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
make a clean stone generator and why

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.570 
make a clean stone generator and why
would<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.080> build<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:10.620> clean<00:00:11.280> stone

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
would you build that clean stone

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.289 
would you build that clean stone
generator<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.509> must<00:00:12.719> ask<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:14.460> clean<00:00:15.059> stone

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
generator you must ask and a clean stone

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.630 
generator you must ask and a clean stone
generator<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:16.199> just<00:00:17.160> like<00:00:17.310> cobblestone

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
generator is just like cobblestone

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.170 
generator is just like cobblestone
generator<00:00:18.140> except<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.770> makes<00:00:20.250> clean<00:00:20.850> stone

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
generator except it makes clean stone

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.679 
generator except it makes clean stone
which<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.140> obvious<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.519> why<00:00:23.850> why<00:00:24.300> not<00:00:24.510> come

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
which is obvious but why why not come

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.700 
which is obvious but why why not come
soon<00:00:25.400> cuz<00:00:26.400> calm<00:00:26.670> stone<00:00:27.029> takes<00:00:27.660> longer<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.410> mine

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
soon cuz calm stone takes longer to mine

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.580 
soon cuz calm stone takes longer to mine
then<00:00:29.929> clean<00:00:30.929> stone<00:00:31.230> does<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:33.260> if<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.410> got

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
then clean stone does and if you got

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.330 
then clean stone does and if you got
something<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:35.219> equivalent<00:00:36.090> exchange<00:00:36.510> or

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
something like equivalent exchange or

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.560 
something like equivalent exchange or
something<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:39.300> might<00:00:39.510> be<00:00:39.540> useful<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:41.570> so

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
something this might be useful and so

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.729 
something this might be useful and so
this<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.230> how<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.440> works<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:45.690> lava<00:00:45.930> falls<00:00:46.379> down

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
this is how it works the lava falls down

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.290 
this is how it works the lava falls down
on<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:48.110> underwater<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.879> this<00:00:50.879> happens

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
on the underwater and this happens

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.380 
on the underwater and this happens
normally<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.980> need<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.219> fix<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:56.210> but<00:00:57.210> if

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
normally so just need to fix this but if

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.420 
normally so just need to fix this but if
you<00:00:57.480> got<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> hut<00:00:58.590> or<00:00:58.829> something

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
you got like it like a hut or something

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.520 
you got like it like a hut or something
and<00:01:01.460> damage<00:01:02.870> I'm<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> build<00:01:04.439> it

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
and damage I'm just going to build it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.539 
and damage I'm just going to build it
over<00:01:04.799> here<00:01:06.229> but<00:01:07.229> that's<00:01:07.650> how<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.920> works<00:01:08.159> it

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
over here but that's how it works it

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.270 
over here but that's how it works it
falls<00:01:08.909> down<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.420> water<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.159> makes<00:01:11.159> it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
falls down on the water and makes it

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.429 
falls down on the water and makes it
into<00:01:11.369> clean<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> glitch<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.200> will

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
into clean so this is a glitch and will

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.080 
into clean so this is a glitch and will
give<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.740> fixed<00:01:14.130> I'm<00:01:14.310> sure<00:01:14.810> but<00:01:16.220> yeah<00:01:17.220> anyways

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
give you fixed I'm sure but yeah anyways

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.649 
give you fixed I'm sure but yeah anyways
you<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.689> use<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.759> nothing<00:01:20.759> wrong<00:01:20.970> wrong<00:01:21.420> about

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
you can use it nothing wrong wrong about

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.179 
you can use it nothing wrong wrong about
that<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:24.439> accept<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:26.280> not<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.790> think<00:01:27.030> um

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
that and accept but not what I think um

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.520 
that and accept but not what I think um
so<00:01:29.189> what<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.140> build<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.350> like

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
so what you do you just build it up like

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.660 
so what you do you just build it up like
this<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:33.200> it's<00:01:34.200> fixed<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.340> if<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.670> got<00:01:35.790> like<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
this and it's fixed so if you got like a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.450 
this and it's fixed so if you got like a
what<00:01:38.670> should<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:38.939> call<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.689> house<00:01:40.560> around

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
what should we call it the house around

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.090 
what should we call it the house around
here<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:44.780> wait<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> minute<00:01:45.950> if<00:01:46.950> we

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
here you can just wait a minute if we

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
sorry guys and my game just broke and

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.359 
sorry guys and my game just broke and
you<00:02:03.140> can<00:02:03.259> close<00:02:03.710> this<00:02:03.890> off<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:05.710> do<00:02:06.710> remember

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
you can close this off and do remember

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.339 
you can close this off and do remember
to<00:02:07.729> cover<00:02:08.000> closed<00:02:08.360> up<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:09.519> cuss<00:02:10.519> all<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:12.110> lava

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
to cover closed up and cuss all the lava

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.400 
to cover closed up and cuss all the lava
will<00:02:12.709> flow<00:02:13.010> out<00:02:13.220> on<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.930> that's<00:02:14.930> not<00:02:15.110> fun
