I<00:03:56.760> mean<00:03:57.090> these<00:03:57.239> engines<00:03:57.690> are<00:03:57.959> pretty<00:03:58.410> much

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
I mean these engines are pretty much

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.780 
I mean these engines are pretty much
about<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.799> solid<00:03:59.220> as<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.340> gets

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
about a solid as it gets

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.879

these have a timing chain not a timing

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.080 
these have a timing chain not a timing
belt<00:04:01.919> so<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.280> don't<00:04:02.400> worry<00:04:02.519> about<00:04:02.579> that<00:04:02.880> a

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
belt so I don't worry about that a

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.089 
belt so I don't worry about that a
really<00:04:03.569> low<00:04:03.750> maintenance<00:04:03.959> engine<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.919> runs
