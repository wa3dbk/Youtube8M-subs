 analyze technological pots and for 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.750
 because it always known william 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.359
 thank you very much for coming to see us a 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.179
 pleasure we spent a tablet a tablet 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:24.189
 of eight with three inches as his own 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.189
 name indicates why it is called the ipad 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.259
 the products help very well because they do not 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.899
 I have no idea what I 'm talking about and 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.239
 kaka, how good they can have 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.310
 this new tablet 8 with 3 inches a 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.580
 small or comfortable size to be by 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.560
 house is far from the 10.1 that 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.210
 they have many puppies from the market what 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.370
 which gets from the ipad but web is 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.370
 pretty good because it's very practical is 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.650
 quite light is voluminous but as 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.230
 It is not very big either, it is light and 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.340
 pretty thin and good, very, very, very 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.290
 practice that to be at home 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.990
 Quietly it is a curious size 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.260
 because good is between us 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.180
 7 inch market that is good 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.770
 a little more much smaller and 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.149
 10 o'clock that's a bit the standard right 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.009
 10 or one that is one of the tablets 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.479
 big but an 8 with 3 put is that is 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.100
 a very large screen but it is very 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.390
 exact comfortable if I 'm too heavy 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.670
 can be at home because it is not 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.469
 to really work any tablet 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.179
 is to work but this one in particular 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.130
 much less but good is very good 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.490
 because it has a very good screen 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.079
 then to watch multimedia content or 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.450
 to play has always been very good 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.219
 to browse the internet and so on 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.950
 then the performance is also pretty 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:35.509
 good has a 600 snapdragon processor 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.889
 it is not the 800 that is quite common but 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.229
 is pretty good with his four 

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:41.119
 cores two gigas of ram 16 gigas of 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.280
 storage is not much but good 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.310
 It has a slot for microsd cards 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.250
 although sense is quite well 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.350
 autonomy also surprised quite 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.270
 or sad if it reaches 78 hours without 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.900
 problems of continued use if you have it 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.820
 what to use 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.160
 we already know that they hold these 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.440
 pots and then from here you have the 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.380
 speakers that aside from having a 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.370
 somewhat curious disposition normal 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.220
 they are usually at the bottom 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.530
 then we cover the disk to hold are 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.570
 very well placed and I quite like 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.450
 that's a pretty detail 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.520
 nice interesting detail the screen 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.380
 you commented to me also unlocks 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.690
 hitting a ride that is good yeah yeah 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.130
 has an android 4.2 but by a layer 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.780
 of the example is one of the 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.940
 characteristics that it has is that which is 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.350
 pretty striking because it's very simple 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.030
 you do not have to be looking for the 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.100
 button the unlock button apart 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.959
 well the shaft does something that I like 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.069
 much that is quite respect the layer 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.010
 from android for that 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.849
 and applications their functions but they leave 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.769
 pretty much what google thought about his 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.139
 moment has other functions by 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.480
 example to pair with the phone 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:51.750
 but it's not that they are very heavy 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.180
 like other companies that fill us 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.150
 tablet of your apps does not work 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.189
 quite pretty fast and very fluid 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.280
 we have been playing at home 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.439
 of course Spain origin was going quite 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.549
 well I liked it a lot besides 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:10.650
 price is pretty good how much it will cost 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:13.280
 299 this model in white and another in 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.550
 black and it's not a price too much 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.980
 expensive 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.350
 neither is it the product of styles and 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.120
 especially because if we have a lot where 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.560
 choose in the 7 inches a lot in choosing 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.010
 later on but in this size 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.210
 intermediate intermediate there is less and is 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.490
 pretty good three hundred euros are 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.950
 quite affordable 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:36.490
 Well, the shaft and pad are very good 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.410
 803 very good looking quite powerful what 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.830
 that surprises me that they are very powerful and 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.330
 jolin one one size and one model very very 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.330
 comfortable as you say very well be for 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.580
 the leisure especially of the exact chevron one 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.810
 lotion at home 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.530
 Well, thank you very much for bringing us
