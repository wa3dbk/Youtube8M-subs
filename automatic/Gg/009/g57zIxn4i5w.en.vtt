00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.400
 consider leaving 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.090
 on the same training conditions 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.610
 our citizens patent value from January 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.890
 increased from 2 to 4 thousand rubles per month 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.680
 while everyone working in Russia 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.210
 Migrant must pass 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.030
 additional paid procedures they 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.410
 include a design service 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.600
 transmissions to authorized agencies and 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.240
 issuing a patent of three and a half thousand 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.100
 rubles fixed advance payment on 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.650
 1 month 4 thousand rubles

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.700
 Nurbek Sarbayev of Russia works a little 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.740
 more than a year he says that the rise in price 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.600
 patent is not a problem the problem is that 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.880
 it's almost impossible to get 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.690
 exactly three whiskey migrants now 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.600
 give here itself have not yet decided to be a 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.160
 other migrants here that is tajiks 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.710
 Uzbek they live in the village precisely 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.920
 the crisis has not yet been decided so now 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.210
 don't give don't know yet don't yourself yet 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.070
 decided therefore I can not answer now 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.290
 according to experts to facilitate 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.870
 side migration problems at the very 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.320
 high level before coming in with must 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.659
 to accept 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:09.220
 interim measures to clarify some 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.360
 questions turned appeal 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.230
 relevant body of the Russian 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:20.590
 federation we like a clear answer 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:24.670
 have not yet received say for example if 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:28.750
 the answer is you do say let's say sakhalin 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.110
 1 atm and therefore the central part 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.070
 migration services 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.390
 another it says it means it is necessary 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.500
 align the mechanism 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.210
 mechanisms mean order behavior 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.220
 immigration laws here we are 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.230
 talked with colleagues ministry 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.210
 foreign affairs need now first 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.880
 turn to get an official response with 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.960
 Russian side on this note and there 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.090
 I already think it is necessary to discuss and 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.340
 put forward a unified position and 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.860
 already negotiate among problems 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.020
 migrants besides new toughened hmi 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.180
 graceful rules and there are old so 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.400
 called blacklists for entry into 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.280
 Russia for three years ban on 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.020
 crossing the border of the Russian Federation 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.600
 get those who violated the migration 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.510
 rules and other offenders but 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.130
 main reason for exceeding the deadline 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.840
 legal stay by official 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.900
 data to date entry to 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:29.780
 The territory of the r-f is closed for more than 500 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:32.030
 thousands of people among them and Sufi wasp 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.980
 last year for reasons she didn’t understand 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.420
 she was on the list of citizens who 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.270
 denied entry to Russia 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.670
 deciding to go roundabout way she got caught 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.620
 into the hands of the swindlers the sufi paid thousands 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.780
 dollars for transporting her 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.580
 the border as a result the woman was thrown out 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.610
 the trains were kept in prison and 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.610
 deported interest guarantee 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.170
 type you Aktobe watch and there you 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.980
 meet people will take you by car with 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.540
 I do not know how on some paths of the machine 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.350
 it was not 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.810
 start the world and guides kazakhstan 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.030
 they called us 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.069
 April us dice also belt was celebrated 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.819
 great speed and I opened the doors for us and 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.019
 told you to claim it 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.150
 jump out we play how you arrived 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.850
 for example already did not even realize that they themselves 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.490
 about 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.040
 evening I woke up it can be said 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.260
 is given 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.590
 I'm choking on my blood flew out 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.560
 shoulder off your hands this moment at me 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.480
 hand no longer works so-called 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.640
 blacklist about 60 thousand 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.010
 Kyrgyz but there is good news 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.050
 last year, according to Mida, thanks to 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.150
 joint work related 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.320
 structures from the list out more than two 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.300
 Thousands of Kyrgyz 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.240
 but as I noted here are three categories 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:53.920
 citizens are students studying at 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:56.440
 the territory of Russia members of joint families 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.780
 and also highly collective labor 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:04.009
 it is agreed on them 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:06.289
 to these citizens with 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.490
 special decision of the Russian authorities 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.499
 removed from the blacklist 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.059
 how was black composed 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:13.369
 list according to members of parliament 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:14.930
 still unclear, many people from 

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:17.479
 Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.210
 from there comes the main flow of migrants 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.550
 find out that they are denied entry 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.129
 Russia then when on hand tickets or 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.589
 already crowned in a foreign country 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.719
 of course russia wanted to protect its 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:31.369
 integrity and laws by imposing such 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:33.559
 conditions however i think they still 

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:35.629
 too hard to much appeal 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:38.389
 citizens they say that during deportation 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.830
 migrants are treated extremely hard i 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.830
 and my colleagues talked about it 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.689
 repeatedly when entering with I hope 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.349
 there will be loosening and we must put 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:49.999
 before our colleagues such a requirement 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:52.129
 besides in the Russian media appeared 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:53.740
 information on possible tightening measures 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:56.300
 for violating the conditions of stay 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.979
 It is proposed to extend the ban on 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.199
 weight 3 to 10 years 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.209
 domestic officials hope it is 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.159
 It will not apply to hag Sgiach 

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:06.229
 citizens there is hope and the fact that 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:08.930
 many problems of our migrants 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.430
 be resolved after entering into with 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.719
 after joining the association 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.719
 Kyrgyz workers rossi
