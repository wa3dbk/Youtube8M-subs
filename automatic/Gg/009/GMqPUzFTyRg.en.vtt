semi handgun but this I believe is a

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.070 
semi handgun but this I believe is a
good<00:02:09.440> backup<00:02:09.940> it's<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.030> very<00:02:11.360> intimidating

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
good backup it's a very intimidating

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:21.850 
good backup it's a very intimidating
looking<00:02:12.620> knife<00:02:15.100> it<00:02:16.100> looks<00:02:16.370> well<00:02:16.640> made<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:20.860> love

looking knife it looks well made I love

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.160 
looking knife it looks well made I love
it<00:02:21.980> actually<00:02:24.220> I'm<00:02:25.220> not<00:02:25.489> a<00:02:25.550> knife<00:02:26.270> expert<00:02:26.989> by

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
it actually I'm not a knife expert by

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.350 
it actually I'm not a knife expert by
any<00:02:27.200> means<00:02:28.660> but<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.810> blade<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.410> um<00:02:31.180> looks<00:02:32.180> like

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
any means but the blade is um looks like

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.800 
any means but the blade is um looks like
it<00:02:32.480> has<00:02:32.600> a<00:02:32.630> very<00:02:32.989> good<00:02:33.050> geometry<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:33.950> a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
it has a very good geometry to it a

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.790 
it has a very good geometry to it a
contemporary<00:02:35.810> Bowie<00:02:36.110> style<00:02:36.830> I<00:02:41.709> think<00:02:42.709> the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
contemporary Bowie style I think the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.740 
contemporary Bowie style I think the
wood<00:02:42.980> handles<00:02:43.310> really<00:02:43.519> pretty<00:02:43.730> as<00:02:43.880> well<00:02:44.150> but

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
wood handles really pretty as well but

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.880 
wood handles really pretty as well but
what<00:02:44.989> I<00:02:45.019> really<00:02:45.440> like<00:02:45.680> is<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:47.230> hand<00:02:48.230> grips<00:02:48.560> on

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
what I really like is the hand grips on

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.380 
what I really like is the hand grips on
the<00:02:49.370> handle<00:02:50.380> your<00:02:51.380> fingers<00:02:51.800> can<00:02:51.980> really<00:02:52.370> get<00:02:53.360> a

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
the handle your fingers can really get a

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:02.430 
the handle your fingers can really get a
good<00:02:53.630> strong<00:02:53.930> hold<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:59.650> since<00:03:00.650> it's

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
good strong hold to it and since it's

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.620 
good strong hold to it and since it's
complete<00:03:03.820> stainless<00:03:04.820> steel<00:03:05.060> throughout<00:03:05.390> the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
complete stainless steel throughout the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.910 
complete stainless steel throughout the
handle<00:03:06.579> if<00:03:07.579> I<00:03:07.730> could<00:03:07.910> make<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.150> really<00:03:08.540> nice<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
handle if I could make a really nice the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.680 
handle if I could make a really nice the
butt<00:03:13.160> end<00:03:13.400> here<00:03:13.670> can<00:03:13.880> you<00:03:14.090> know<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.360> can<00:03:14.450> hit

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
butt end here can you know you can hit

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.229 
butt end here can you know you can hit
somebody<00:03:15.140> with<00:03:15.230> or<00:03:15.680> use<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.459> as<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.760> makeshift

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
somebody with or use it as a makeshift

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.940 
somebody with or use it as a makeshift
hammer<00:03:17.570> how<00:03:17.870> though<00:03:18.049> it<00:03:18.110> wouldn't<00:03:18.320> be<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.500> great

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
hammer how though it wouldn't be a great

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.729 
hammer how though it wouldn't be a great
hammer<00:03:19.160> since<00:03:19.519> it<00:03:19.670> is<00:03:19.790> curved<00:03:22.630> but<00:03:23.630> overall<00:03:24.590> I

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
hammer since it is curved but overall I

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.670 
hammer since it is curved but overall I
think<00:03:24.920> it's<00:03:25.100> a<00:03:25.190> very<00:03:25.370> intimidating<00:03:26.090> weapon<00:03:26.239> I

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
think it's a very intimidating weapon I

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.569 
think it's a very intimidating weapon I
think<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.769> could<00:03:27.860> be<00:03:28.040> very<00:03:28.070> useful<00:03:30.280> out<00:03:31.280> in<00:03:31.489> the

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
think it could be very useful out in the

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.140 
think it could be very useful out in the
field<00:03:31.850> as<00:03:32.060> well<00:03:32.239> I'm<00:03:32.600> not<00:03:32.930> going<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.940> show
