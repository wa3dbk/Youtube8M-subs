what happens with the S patent roll over

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.619 
what happens with the S patent roll over
is<00:02:43.079> that<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.590> driver<00:02:43.860> loses<00:02:44.189> concentration

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
is that the driver loses concentration

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.259 
is that the driver loses concentration
for<00:02:45.629> various<00:02:46.349> reasons<00:02:46.610> he<00:02:47.610> then<00:02:47.819> leaves<00:02:48.120> the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
the vehicle back into the road so he

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.869 
the vehicle back into the road so he

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
turns the steering wheel to the left it

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.339 
turns the steering wheel to the left it
invariably<00:03:00.359> then<00:03:00.569> throws<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> steering<00:03:01.319> wheel

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
invariably then throws a steering wheel

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.740 
invariably then throws a steering wheel
over<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.890> right<00:03:02.040> at<00:03:02.310> this<00:03:02.670> point<00:03:03.000> now<00:03:03.269> what

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
over to the right at this point now what

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.240 
over to the right at this point now what
actually<00:03:04.079> happens<00:03:04.409> is<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.829> rear<00:03:05.010> wheel

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
actually happens is that the rear wheel

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.670 
actually happens is that the rear wheel
station<00:03:05.790> leaves<00:03:06.689> the<00:03:06.870> ground<00:03:07.079> and<00:03:07.379> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
station leaves the ground and the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.920 
station leaves the ground and the
momentum<00:03:08.129> is<00:03:08.250> pushing<00:03:08.639> from<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:08.940> side<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.389> of

momentum is pushing from the side and of

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.509 
momentum is pushing from the side and of
course<00:03:10.170> it's<00:03:10.440> at<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.769> point<00:03:10.829> that<00:03:11.190> he<00:03:11.370> goes

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
course it's at that point that he goes

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.729 
course it's at that point that he goes
past<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:12.030> basic<00:03:12.389> stability<00:03:12.900> level<00:03:13.139> and<00:03:13.290> then

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
past the basic stability level and then

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.250 
past the basic stability level and then
the<00:03:13.829> vehicle<00:03:14.190> rolls<00:03:14.400> over<00:03:14.579> it<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.629> possible<00:03:16.200> to

the vehicle rolls over it is possible to

the car but then I stop and think and

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.820 
the car but then I stop and think and
