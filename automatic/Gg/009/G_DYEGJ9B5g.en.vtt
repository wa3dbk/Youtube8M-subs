00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.580
 butter without salt 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.210
 two twins two tablespoons of 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.420

 put everything in the processor 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.969

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.399
 mixing the solids and then adding 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.719
 the liquids gradually but here the order 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.070
 not much reason why the processor

 cheese because the biscuit is cheese 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.060
 if your child is too tiny 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.729

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.920

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.780
 freezer for 15 minutes and from there they will 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:05.110
 straight to the bottom that goes preheated 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:06.400

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.320
 cheese targets 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.140
