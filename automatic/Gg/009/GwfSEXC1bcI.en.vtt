00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
left and even though I still have some

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.060 
left and even though I still have some
hyperpigmentation<00:00:36.480> guess<00:00:37.200> what<00:00:37.410> my<00:00:37.620> skin<00:00:37.890> is

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
hyperpigmentation guess what my skin is

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.799 
hyperpigmentation guess what my skin is
still<00:00:38.190> peeling<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.120> I'm<00:00:39.270> really<00:00:39.450> excited

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
still peeling so I'm really excited

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.400 
still peeling so I'm really excited
about<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.320> because<00:00:40.469> these<00:00:40.829> were<00:00:41.040> darker

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
about that because these were darker

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.229 
about that because these were darker
just<00:00:43.410> yesterday<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.040> was<00:00:44.129> darker<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.000> still

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
just yesterday it was darker so I still

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.940 
just yesterday it was darker so I still
have<00:00:45.420> some<00:00:45.450> peeling<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.230> right<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.620> here

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
have some peeling to do right in here

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.119 
have some peeling to do right in here
and<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.760> moisturized<00:00:48.600> my<00:00:48.780> face<00:00:49.110> because<00:00:50.010> I

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
and I just moisturized my face because I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.400 
and I just moisturized my face because I
was<00:00:50.280> peeling<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.910> these<00:00:51.539> hyper<00:00:52.170> pigmentation

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
was peeling and these hyper pigmentation

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.860 
was peeling and these hyper pigmentation
marks<00:00:53.160> were<00:00:53.399> darker<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:53.940> well<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.690> they

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
marks were darker as well and so they

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.660 
marks were darker as well and so they
have<00:00:55.079> lightened<00:00:55.469> up<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.250> I've<00:00:56.370> decided

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
have lightened up but what I've decided

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.720 
have lightened up but what I've decided
to<00:00:56.879> do<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.480> about<00:00:57.750> two<00:00:58.649> weeks<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:59.460> going<00:00:59.670> to

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
to do is in about two weeks I'm going to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.639 
to do is in about two weeks I'm going to
do<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.180> totally<00:01:00.660> different<00:01:01.079> chemical<00:01:01.469> peel

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
do a totally different chemical peel

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.240 
do a totally different chemical peel
it's<00:01:01.920> called<00:01:02.190> an<00:01:02.340> alpha<00:01:02.760> beta<00:01:03.660> peel<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:05.100> can

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
it's called an alpha beta peel you can

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.429 
it's called an alpha beta peel you can
look<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.150> think<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.140> yield

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
look that up I think it's going to yield

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.440 
look that up I think it's going to yield
better<00:01:08.010> results<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.670> me<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> hyper

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
better results for me and the hyper

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.760 
better results for me and the hyper
pigmentation<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:12.170> overall<00:01:13.170> though<00:01:13.530> I

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
pigmentation and so overall though I

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.740 
pigmentation and so overall though I
will<00:01:14.100> say<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.610> I'm<00:01:14.729> happy<00:01:15.090> with<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.330> results

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
will say that I'm happy with the results

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.109 
will say that I'm happy with the results
because<00:01:16.080> all<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.860> was<00:01:17.100> darker<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.670> it

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
because all of this was darker and it

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.660 
because all of this was darker and it
had<00:01:18.299> individual<00:01:18.960> spots<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.799> now<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.400> is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
had individual spots in it and now it is

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.550 
had individual spots in it and now it is
it's<00:01:21.210> still<00:01:21.479> dark<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.110> still<00:01:22.229> peeling

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
it's still dark but it's still peeling

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.330 
it's still dark but it's still peeling
as<00:01:22.860> well<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.570> on<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.840> side<00:01:25.140> these<00:01:25.890> spots

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
as well and on this side these spots

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.460 
as well and on this side these spots
remember<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.060> said<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.540> my<00:01:27.720> previous<00:01:27.960> videos

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
remember I said in my previous videos

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.710 
remember I said in my previous videos
that<00:01:28.500> some<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> spots<00:01:29.970> were<00:01:30.150> too<00:01:30.360> fresh

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
that some of the spots were too fresh

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.569 
that some of the spots were too fresh
for<00:01:30.750> me<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> chemical<00:01:31.860> peel<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.340> soon

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
for me to do the chemical peel so soon

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.050 
for me to do the chemical peel so soon
so<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.240> believe<00:01:33.509> that's<00:01:33.720> why<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.110> didn't<00:01:35.060> be

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
so I believe that's why they didn't be

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.819 
so I believe that's why they didn't be
they<00:01:36.509> weren't<00:01:36.810> removed<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.380> chemical

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
they weren't removed with the chemical

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.390 
they weren't removed with the chemical
peel<00:01:38.070> but<00:01:38.759> again<00:01:39.270> overall<00:01:39.810> I'm<00:01:40.140> very<00:01:40.500> pleased

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
peel but again overall I'm very pleased

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.310 
peel but again overall I'm very pleased
with<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.729> results<00:01:42.180> because<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.990> hyper

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
with the results because the hyper

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.609 
with the results because the hyper
pigmentation<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:44.100> had<00:01:44.250> up<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.520> here<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.939> gone

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
pigmentation I had up in here is gone

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.380 
pigmentation I had up in here is gone
and<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.799> I'm<00:01:46.920> pleased<00:01:47.189> with<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.790> again

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
and so I'm pleased with that and again

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.389 
and so I'm pleased with that and again
I'm<00:01:48.810> still<00:01:49.079> peeling<00:01:49.409> around<00:01:49.979> here<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.310> just

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
I'm still peeling around here I just

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.010 
I'm still peeling around here I just
moisturized<00:01:51.799> once<00:01:52.799> again<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.700> I'm<00:01:54.689> happy

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
moisturized once again and so I'm happy

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.560

learned<00:02:45.959> that<00:02:46.260> when<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.650> do<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.920> seller

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
learned that when you do the seller

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.050 
learned that when you do the seller
salicylic<00:02:48.269> acid<00:02:48.750> peel<00:02:48.959> after<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:50.099> peel<00:02:50.370> you
