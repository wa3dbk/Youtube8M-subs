00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.610 
than what you can what you feel
contacting<00:05:22.910> your<00:05:23.000> eye<00:05:23.030> this<00:05:24.020> one<00:05:24.260> I<00:05:24.410> feel<00:05:24.560> a

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
contacting your eye this one I feel a

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.390 
contacting your eye this one I feel a
little<00:05:24.950> bit<00:05:25.250> more<00:05:25.310> than<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:26.150> other<00:05:26.300> one<00:05:26.540> I

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
little bit more than the other one I

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.710 
little bit more than the other one I
haven't<00:05:28.400> worn<00:05:28.610> them<00:05:28.760> for<00:05:28.820> a<00:05:28.970> long<00:05:29.150> time<00:05:29.390> so<00:05:29.690> I

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
haven't worn them for a long time so I

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.350 
haven't worn them for a long time so I
can't<00:05:29.990> really<00:05:30.110> say<00:05:30.380> anything<00:05:30.410> about<00:05:31.100> how<00:05:31.430> they

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
can't really say anything about how they

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.240 
can't really say anything about how they
feel<00:05:32.720> after<00:05:33.020> a<00:05:33.200> long<00:05:33.440> wear<00:05:35.530> but<00:05:36.530> I<00:05:36.650> do<00:05:36.770> like<00:05:37.070> the

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
feel after a long wear but I do like the

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.150 
feel after a long wear but I do like the
color<00:05:37.490> they're<00:05:37.790> they're<00:05:38.150> very<00:05:38.390> pretty

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
color they're they're very pretty

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.430 
color they're they're very pretty
I'm<00:05:40.520> wondering<00:05:40.850> why<00:05:41.090> one's<00:05:41.390> brighter<00:05:42.200> than

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
I'm wondering why one's brighter than

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.250 
I'm wondering why one's brighter than
the<00:05:42.560> other<00:05:42.590> but<00:05:43.070> that<00:05:43.870> technical<00:05:44.870> difference

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
the other but that technical difference

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.960 
the other but that technical difference
is<00:05:45.440> maybe<00:05:45.770> it's<00:05:45.980> just<00:05:46.190> the<00:05:46.370> way<00:05:46.490> I'm<00:05:46.580> standing

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
is maybe it's just the way I'm standing

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.040 
is maybe it's just the way I'm standing
in<00:05:47.090> the<00:05:47.210> light<00:05:47.390> right<00:05:47.630> here<00:05:49.780> okay<00:05:50.780> so<00:05:50.840> I<00:05:50.990> just

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
in the light right here okay so I just

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.430 
in the light right here okay so I just
wanted<00:05:51.410> to<00:05:51.500> come<00:05:51.710> back<00:05:51.890> and<00:05:52.690> say<00:05:53.690> that<00:05:54.050> the

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
wanted to come back and say that the

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.680 
wanted to come back and say that the
reason<00:05:54.830> I<00:05:55.070> could<00:05:55.250> feel<00:05:55.460> that<00:05:55.640> one<00:05:55.820> a<00:05:55.850> lot<00:05:56.240> was

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
reason I could feel that one a lot was

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.600 
reason I could feel that one a lot was
because<00:05:57.050> that<00:05:57.470> time<00:05:58.040> I<00:05:58.070> was<00:05:58.310> having<00:05:58.520> trouble

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
because that time I was having trouble

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.350 
because that time I was having trouble
putting<00:05:58.910> into<00:05:59.090> my<00:05:59.180> eye

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
putting into my eye

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.630 
putting into my eye
I<00:05:59.600> flipped<00:05:59.930> inside<00:06:00.320> out<00:06:00.380> so<00:06:01.190> it<00:06:01.310> was<00:06:01.430> in<00:06:01.550> the

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
I flipped inside out so it was in the

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.160 
I flipped inside out so it was in the
wrong<00:06:01.760> way<00:06:02.000> so<00:06:02.060> that's<00:06:02.480> why<00:06:02.600> the<00:06:02.660> color<00:06:02.900> looked

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.170 
wrong way so that's why the color looked

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.810 
wrong way so that's why the color looked
a<00:06:03.260> little<00:06:03.350> bit<00:06:03.560> different<00:06:03.950> than<00:06:04.580> the<00:06:04.700> other

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
a little bit different than the other

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.790 
a little bit different than the other
side<00:06:05.800> so<00:06:06.800> I<00:06:06.830> just<00:06:07.130> now<00:06:07.310> took<00:06:07.640> it<00:06:07.820> out<00:06:08.000> and<00:06:08.800> put

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
side so I just now took it out and put

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.370 
side so I just now took it out and put
it<00:06:09.890> back<00:06:10.010> in<00:06:10.190> my<00:06:10.310> solution<00:06:10.870> swish<00:06:11.870> it<00:06:12.020> around<00:06:12.050> a

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
it back in my solution swish it around a

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.750 
it back in my solution swish it around a
little<00:06:12.500> bit

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
little bit

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.130 
little bit
flipped<00:06:14.720> it<00:06:14.840> the<00:06:14.960> right<00:06:15.140> way<00:06:15.320> of<00:06:15.680> course<00:06:16.040> and

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
flipped it the right way of course and

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.550 
flipped it the right way of course and
put<00:06:18.140> it<00:06:18.260> back<00:06:18.410> in<00:06:18.590> so<00:06:19.040> now<00:06:19.190> my<00:06:19.340> eyes<00:06:19.520> watering

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
put it back in so now my eyes watering

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.640 
put it back in so now my eyes watering
because<00:06:21.560> of<00:06:21.650> all<00:06:21.770> the<00:06:21.860> fuss<00:06:23.140> but<00:06:24.140> now<00:06:24.290> you<00:06:24.350> can

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
because of all the fuss but now you can

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.080 
because of all the fuss but now you can
tell<00:06:24.860> that<00:06:25.070> they're<00:06:25.370> the<00:06:26.030> same<00:06:26.060> color<00:06:26.450> and<00:06:28.090> I'm

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
tell that they're the same color and I'm

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.440 
tell that they're the same color and I'm
sure<00:06:29.560> after<00:06:30.560> about<00:06:30.770> a<00:06:30.830> minute<00:06:31.070> it<00:06:31.940> will<00:06:32.150> stop

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
sure after about a minute it will stop

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.900 
sure after about a minute it will stop
feeling<00:06:32.840> weird<00:06:33.290> oh<00:06:33.620> there<00:06:34.100> you<00:06:34.190> go<00:06:34.310> that's<00:06:34.790> a
