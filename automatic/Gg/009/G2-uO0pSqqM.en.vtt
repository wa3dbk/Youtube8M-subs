00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.200
 something like that is going to make people welcome 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.110
 to a new gameplay commentary 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.639
 grapples with everything channel and yes me 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.540
 have told me last time that her 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.740
 Comments 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.140
 that your team in the comments 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.539
 you are welcome to write 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.310
 he and germany would already have a few 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.070
 cool theme I picked out about 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.500
 any case , terry will come and do 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.210
 a theme I'm coming now 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.430
 Talking about it that's it 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.290
 theme clip alarm clock and yes I say 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.020
 To wake up clubs it is more likely to find it 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.760
 Embarrassing when you are clear in the bigger one 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.579
 So you should form a larger team 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.500
 it does not try clips rain and man 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.110
 cheating with clubs actually arouses 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.789
 just myself because i like when, for example 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.920
 I have clubs I am there if I am 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.620
 now somehow frosty cold with 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.570
 I'm not proud of that and I still remember 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.550
 not where then the fun should be 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.899
 in people the clips capable because the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.520
 do not really care what they are for 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.020
 looking can be proud of it 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.460
 and that just does not make sense 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.520
 and what I can say is that we do that 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.960
 actually never the best myself 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.960
 should do because sooner or later 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.890
 with one always export or so then has 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.299
 one had bad luck 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.479
 about which I speak in any case 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.630
 wanted to be on the subject that is yes people 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.159
 is it then rumheulen yes it is a 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.299
 video game 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.880
 yes, why are you talking about clip? 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.460
 sale's a game so the find 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.350
 So that's me, that's fine 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.700
 the people say so it is not 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.039
 wrong because it really is 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.840
 only video game but you should also 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.520
 people think the clips are faking it 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.159
 already poor if you think so then 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.020
 introduce in the video game such as fame 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.609
 or so clips happy that I think 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.119
 even poorer than worrying about it 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:56.609
 that you get excited that people clips 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.840
 capable case is still such a thing 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.819
 loud I think play a view to 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.060
 two and if they do not know what 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:05.610
 works lobbying zloty i believe that 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.780
 my boys and I do not know if that 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.250
 Everyone has to do that in any case 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.220
 make him like six to eight 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.530
 people and then if you stop newton 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.000
 Deleting one does not come with you 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.840
 other people in the lobby and then 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.390
 make the lobby or something alack lobbies 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.160
 also his thing because I too 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.109
 itself unfair because there are people 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.489
 strict in and clips to a 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:31.560
 setup and then there are the lobby players 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.319
 he just has a lot of kill cam 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.239
 because I just have 24 7 setup 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.239
 and that is really easy 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.690
 yes oh my god three hours for one 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.060
 damn clip i know it was now 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.069
 but does not want after all, the kill 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.990
 cam and I definitely have enough 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.730
 I hope you liked it when it was 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.459
 you liked the team of leica 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.459
