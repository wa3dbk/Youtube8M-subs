located under the cargo bay

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.740 
located under the cargo bay
this<00:01:02.309> can<00:01:02.489> both<00:01:02.640> supplement<00:01:03.180> engine<00:01:03.510> output

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
this can both supplement engine output

this can both supplement engine output
and<00:01:04.229> restart<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> engine<00:01:05.220> when<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.549> switches

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
and restart the engine when it switches

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.270

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
so how does it drive well if you want to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.500 
so how does it drive well if you want to
keep<00:01:13.860> an<00:01:14.010> Eevee<00:01:14.340> mode<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.880> need<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> very<00:01:15.390> very
