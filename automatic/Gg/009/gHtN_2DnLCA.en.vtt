00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.070
 hallÃ¶chen hall in hall 5 today 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.840
 again a new video of me and 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.119
 This time I thought I like hers 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.240
 my nails and that has to protect you 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.980
 uploaded a picture at instagram and 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.480
 that can be relatively good 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.310
 I just thought I'd do it 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.350
 a video on this nail art and here is 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.770
 Now it's the video and I wish you 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.059
 now just have fun and 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.600
 I would just say air 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:43.329
 That's the first thing I started with it 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.329
 my nails with a white paint animals 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.520
 next , I take something 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.460
 fresh foil and makes it 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.650
 piece off so I can change my colors 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.680
 used for the new design on it 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:07.540
 drops can be made for the nail design 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.540
 I use three colors a bit black 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:17.579
 pink neon pink and something else 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.679
 next I'll shape myself 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.649
 with a piece of fresh foil one 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.450
 small ball and crumple the well and 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.969
 pots then with this ball in the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.619
 colors into it and go with it to mine 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.990
 Nails I'm really not there 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.299
 Carefully I pot for pot for pot 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.159
 all colors are criss-crossed 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.060
 and that's what makes this cool one 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.060
 effect 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.230
 because he then but something wrong 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.330
 I've used one 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.780
 nail polish remover along with his 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.330
 grandpa or cotton swabs and remove 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:00.990
 simply the errors or the 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:04.880
 Last but not least, I sealed mine 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.880
 nail design with a top coach 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.040
 and then I retire 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.320
 few things to you on mine 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.890

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.990
 h &amp; m and woman primark now you see too 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.090
 again the nail design of the name I 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.620
 find it really really great, it is 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.320
 definitely a looker 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.390
 when I wore it really spoke to me 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.190
 many on how I did it 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.770
 In any case, I like this 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.840
 cling film design properly 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.680
 Great and maybe it makes me feel so 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.840
 sometimes after I have finished the nails 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.780

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.820
