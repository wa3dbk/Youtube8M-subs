spot<00:00:38.170> light<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.559> ELISA<00:00:38.800> is<00:00:38.980> two<00:00:39.309> and<00:00:39.429> a<00:00:39.460> half

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
spot light the ELISA is two and a half

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:41.790 
spot light the ELISA is two and a half
pounds<00:00:40.120> but<00:00:40.359> it<00:00:40.570> sure<00:00:40.809> doesn't<00:00:40.839> feel<00:00:41.170> like<00:00:41.410> it

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
pounds but it sure doesn't feel like it

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.130 
pounds but it sure doesn't feel like it
when<00:00:41.949> you're<00:00:42.070> picking<00:00:42.249> it<00:00:42.550> up<00:00:42.670> the<00:00:43.510> Zeon<00:00:43.899> light

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
when you're picking it up the Zeon light

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.069 
when you're picking it up the Zeon light
inside<00:00:44.620> is<00:00:44.920> non-replaceable<00:00:45.640> so<00:00:46.420> if<00:00:46.690> it<00:00:46.870> does

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
inside is non-replaceable so if it does

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.910 
inside is non-replaceable so if it does

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
when they're cold they take a few

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.270 
when they're cold they take a few
seconds<00:01:37.719> to<00:01:37.750> turn<00:01:37.990> on<00:01:38.200> and<00:01:38.380> go<00:01:38.500> but<00:01:39.039> it<00:01:39.130> does

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.389 
have a lock that you can turn this on
set<00:01:42.609> it<00:01:42.729> down<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:43.350> work<00:01:44.350> on<00:01:44.500> something<00:01:44.829> now

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399

this<00:01:45.579> is<00:01:45.759> a<00:01:45.789> high<00:01:46.060> beam<00:01:46.299> light<00:01:46.509> so<00:01:46.780> it's<00:01:46.930> very

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
this is a high beam light so it's very

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.740 
this is a high beam light so it's very
directed<00:01:47.799> but<00:01:48.460> it<00:01:48.640> does<00:01:48.909> work<00:01:49.179> well<00:01:49.420> for

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
directed but it does work well for

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.330 
directed but it does work well for
lighting<00:01:50.049> up<00:01:50.320> large<00:01:51.310> spots<00:01:51.820> of<00:01:52.590> or<00:01:53.590> large<00:01:53.890> area

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
lighting up large spots of or large area

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.149 
lighting up large spots of or large area
I<00:01:54.399> guess<00:01:54.700> per<00:01:54.909> say<00:01:55.119> sorry<00:01:55.750> about<00:01:55.899> that<00:01:56.020> but<00:01:56.890> the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
I guess per say sorry about that but the

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.599 
I guess per say sorry about that but the
lens<00:01:57.429> on<00:01:57.729> these<00:01:57.939> do<00:01:58.509> get<00:01:58.750> hot<00:01:58.929> unlike<00:01:59.590> an<00:02:00.189> LED

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
lens on these do get hot unlike an LED

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.539 
lens on these do get hot unlike an LED
light<00:02:00.850> LEDs<00:02:01.479> do<00:02:01.719> create<00:02:02.289> Heat<00:02:02.590> also<00:02:03.039> but<00:02:03.280> these

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
light LEDs do create Heat also but these

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.450 
light LEDs do create Heat also but these
are<00:02:03.880> more<00:02:04.119> like<00:02:04.420> standard<00:02:05.409> light<00:02:05.590> they<00:02:06.189> will

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
are more like standard light they will

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.419 
are more like standard light they will
get<00:02:06.609> hot<00:02:06.850> do<00:02:07.479> not<00:02:07.689> touch<00:02:07.899> it<00:02:07.960> it<00:02:08.590> is<00:02:08.800> thermally

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
get hot do not touch it it is thermally

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.700 
get hot do not touch it it is thermally
protected<00:02:09.670> so<00:02:10.509> if<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.750> light<00:02:10.929> does<00:02:10.960> get<00:02:11.500> hot

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
protected so if the light does get hot

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.470 
protected so if the light does get hot
from<00:02:11.980> being<00:02:12.250> on<00:02:12.400> too<00:02:12.640> long<00:02:12.850> it<00:02:13.090> will<00:02:13.240> turn

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
from being on too long it will turn

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.570 
from being on too long it will turn
itself<00:02:13.660> off<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.349> not<00:02:14.620> allow<00:02:14.890> itself<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.310> turn

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
itself off and not allow itself to turn

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.509 
itself off and not allow itself to turn
back<00:02:15.790> on<00:02:16.000> until<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.629> temperatures<00:02:17.110> come<00:02:17.319> down

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
back on until the temperatures come down

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.770 
back on until the temperatures come down
with<00:02:18.519> that<00:02:18.760> said<00:02:19.060> run

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
with that said run

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.980 
with that said run
time<00:02:19.959> on<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:21.010> large<00:02:21.550> high-capacity<00:02:22.209> battery

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
time on a large high-capacity battery

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.830 
time on a large high-capacity battery
there<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:25.120> approximately<00:02:26.050> sixty<00:02:26.770> minutes<00:02:27.069> now

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
there is approximately sixty minutes now

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.760 
there is approximately sixty minutes now
trying<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.870> get<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.140> lock<00:02:29.319> off<00:02:29.560> here<00:02:31.680> there<00:02:32.680> we

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
trying to get the lock off here there we

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.090 
trying to get the lock off here there we
go

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
go

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.979 
go
so<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.209> lock<00:02:34.420> does<00:02:35.230> go<00:02:35.530> on<00:02:35.709> pretty<00:02:36.130> easy<00:02:36.370> and

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
so the lock does go on pretty easy and

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.630 
so the lock does go on pretty easy and
in<00:02:37.989> order<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.290> pull<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.560> off<00:02:38.739> you<00:02:39.160> have<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.489> pull

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
in order to pull it off you have to pull

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.610 
in order to pull it off you have to pull
the<00:02:39.730> trigger<00:02:40.000> but<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.930> might<00:02:41.110> take<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.319> couple

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
the trigger but it might take a couple

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.110 
the trigger but it might take a couple
of<00:02:41.770> times<00:02:41.920> for<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.550> come<00:02:42.730> out

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
of times for it to come out

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.870 
of times for it to come out
this<00:02:43.900> unit<00:02:44.350> is<00:02:44.470> again<00:02:44.890> new<00:02:45.100> I've<00:02:45.400> used<00:02:45.700> it

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
this unit is again new I've used it

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.550 
this unit is again new I've used it
outside<00:02:46.270> they<00:02:46.480> used<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:46.870> out<00:02:46.989> walking<00:02:47.260> around

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
outside they used it out walking around

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.380 
outside they used it out walking around
last<00:02:47.920> night<00:02:48.069> I<00:02:48.430> didn't<00:02:48.760> have<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:48.970> camera<00:02:49.209> with

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
last night I didn't have the camera with

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.150 
last night I didn't have the camera with
me<00:02:49.690> but<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:49.930> wanted<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.230> kind<00:02:50.380> of<00:02:50.470> see<00:02:50.680> in<00:02:50.980> the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
me but I wanted to kind of see in the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.430 
me but I wanted to kind of see in the
woods<00:02:51.370> what<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.820> would<00:02:51.970> do<00:02:52.120> and<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.750> lit<00:02:53.019> up<00:02:53.050> for

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
woods what it would do and it lit up for

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.770 
woods what it would do and it lit up for
a<00:02:53.500> good<00:02:53.800> two<00:02:54.190> three<00:02:54.459> hundred<00:02:54.760> yards<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:55.300> was

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
a good two three hundred yards I was

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.750 
a good two three hundred yards I was
actually<00:02:55.959> very<00:02:56.470> surprised<00:02:57.040> when<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.400> turn<00:02:57.610> this

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
actually very surprised when I turn this

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.000 
actually very surprised when I turn this
on<00:02:57.970> because<00:02:58.239> I've<00:02:58.480> been<00:02:58.930> really<00:02:59.320> set<00:02:59.680> on<00:02:59.860> the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
on because I've been really set on the

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.759 
on because I've been really set on the
LED<00:03:00.550> spotlights<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.300> are<00:03:01.420> out<00:03:01.540> but<00:03:02.350> when<00:03:02.680> you

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
LED spotlights that are out but when you

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.040 
LED spotlights that are out but when you
turn<00:03:02.980> this<00:03:03.160> on<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.670> have<00:03:03.850> very<00:03:04.390> very<00:03:04.600> similar

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
turn this on you have very very similar

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.140 
turn this on you have very very similar
performance<00:03:05.260> maybe<00:03:06.010> not<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.430> same<00:03:06.580> run<00:03:06.880> time

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
performance maybe not the same run time

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.440 
performance maybe not the same run time
but<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:07.989> have<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.230> very<00:03:08.709> bright<00:03:09.160> light<00:03:09.459> that<00:03:10.090> in

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
but you have a very bright light that in

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.680 
but you have a very bright light that in
fact<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:11.370> excellent<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.489> use<00:03:12.519> outside<00:03:12.880> light

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
fact is excellent to use outside light

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.870 
fact is excellent to use outside light
weight<00:03:14.280> cost<00:03:15.280> factor<00:03:15.880> is<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:17.560> just<00:03:17.950> in<00:03:18.190> very

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
weight cost factor is is just in very

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.790 
weight cost factor is is just in very
small<00:03:19.030> percent<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:19.840> what<00:03:20.019> it<00:03:20.050> costs<00:03:20.410> for<00:03:20.620> some

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
small percent of what it costs for some

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.520 
small percent of what it costs for some
of<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:20.950> big<00:03:21.130> LED<00:03:21.610> lights<00:03:21.880> so<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.569> like<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.200> idea

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
of the big LED lights so I like the idea

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.560 
of the big LED lights so I like the idea
of<00:03:23.590> having<00:03:23.799> this<00:03:24.010> out<00:03:24.190> out<00:03:24.489> there<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:25.000> like<00:03:25.329> the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
of having this out out there I like the

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.569 
of having this out out there I like the
way<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:25.959> it<00:03:26.110> can<00:03:26.230> be<00:03:26.350> set<00:03:26.620> down<00:03:26.799> in<00:03:27.190> multiple

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
way that it can be set down in multiple

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.030 
way that it can be set down in multiple
places<00:03:27.790> without<00:03:28.090> hurting<00:03:28.750> anything<00:03:29.040> every

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
places without hurting anything every

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.680 
places without hurting anything every
time<00:03:30.250> you<00:03:30.370> set<00:03:30.579> it<00:03:30.700> down<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:31.030> seems<00:03:31.269> to<00:03:31.450> be<00:03:31.570> on

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
time you set it down it seems to be on

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.890 
time you set it down it seems to be on
rubber<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.950> it<00:03:33.280> can<00:03:33.430> be<00:03:33.549> used<00:03:33.790> with<00:03:34.090> any<00:03:34.390> of

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
rubber and it can be used with any of

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.680 
rubber and it can be used with any of
the<00:03:35.170> other<00:03:35.440> Ryobi<00:03:36.310> one-plus<00:03:36.880> batteries<00:03:37.510> that

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
the other Ryobi one-plus batteries that

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.680 
the other Ryobi one-plus batteries that
are<00:03:37.810> out<00:03:37.959> there<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.799> make<00:03:39.070> it<00:03:39.100> work<00:03:39.790> for<00:03:40.180> your

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
are out there to make it work for your

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.300 
are out there to make it work for your
weight<00:03:40.930> however<00:03:41.320> long<00:03:41.709> you're<00:03:41.950> going<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.130> use

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
weight however long you're going to use

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.900 
weight however long you're going to use
it<00:03:42.489> in<00:03:42.610> different<00:03:43.360> items<00:03:43.989> like<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.910> think

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
it in different items like that I think

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.050 
it in different items like that I think
if<00:03:46.060> you're<00:03:46.209> in<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.930> ryobi<00:03:47.290> line<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:48.519> you're

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
if you're in the ryobi line and you're

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.620 
if you're in the ryobi line and you're
looking<00:03:49.420> for<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.720> spotlight<00:03:50.410> check<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.370> out<00:03:51.630> you
