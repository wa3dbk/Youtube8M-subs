exact same benefits as chlorine from a
chemical<00:02:37.349> factory<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:38.040> it's<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.400> same<00:02:38.700> level

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
of sanitization as the chlorine you

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.589 
of sanitization as the chlorine you
dumped<00:02:41.280> into<00:02:41.430> your<00:02:41.610> pool<00:02:41.849> yes<00:02:42.330> and

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
dumped into your pool yes and

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.539 
dumped into your pool yes and
technically<00:02:43.110> speaking<00:02:43.590> chlorine<00:02:43.980> used<00:02:44.010> in

technically speaking chlorine used in
this<00:02:44.670> manner<00:02:44.730> prevents<00:02:45.420> algae<00:02:45.780> from<00:02:45.900> forming

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
this manner prevents algae from forming

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.400 
this manner prevents algae from forming
kills<00:02:46.590> harmful<00:02:47.099> bacteria<00:02:47.250> etc<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.959> know<00:02:49.110> how

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
kills harmful bacteria etc so know how

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.979 
kills harmful bacteria etc so know how
much<00:02:49.590> salt<00:02:49.980> do<00:02:50.220> we<00:02:50.310> need<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.489> add<00:02:50.780> well<00:02:51.780> when

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
much salt do we need to add well when

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.410 
much salt do we need to add well when
you<00:02:52.110> add<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.739> aqua<00:02:53.310> right<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.790> your<00:02:53.940> pool<00:02:54.239> or

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
you add the aqua right to your pool or

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.839 
you add the aqua right to your pool or
spa<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.810> only<00:02:54.989> need<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.200> add<00:02:55.440> one<00:02:55.739> teaspoon<00:02:56.130> of

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
spa you only need to add one teaspoon of

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.910 
spa you only need to add one teaspoon of
salt<00:02:57.450> for<00:02:57.540> every<00:02:57.900> gallon<00:02:58.049> of<00:02:58.260> water<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.709> the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
salt for every gallon of water and the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.740 
salt for every gallon of water and the
salt<00:02:59.069> stays<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.760> water<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.269> you'll<00:03:00.450> rarely

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
salt stays in the water so you'll rarely

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.020 
salt stays in the water so you'll rarely
have<00:03:01.079> to<00:03:01.230> add<00:03:01.349> more<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.860> because<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.430> salt

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
have to add more and because it is salt

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.250 
have to add more and because it is salt
you<00:03:03.120> don't<00:03:03.239> have<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:03.480> worry<00:03:03.690> about<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.019> things

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
you don't have to worry about the things

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.479 
you don't have to worry about the things
that<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.440> don't<00:03:04.530> like<00:03:04.799> with<00:03:05.010> chemical

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
that you don't like with chemical

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.610

Chris yeah yeah wait yeah I get it it

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.160 
Chris yeah yeah wait yeah I get it it
really<00:03:20.639> is<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.819> far<00:03:21.150> superior<00:03:21.569> alternative

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
really is a far superior alternative

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.309 
really is a far superior alternative
both<00:03:23.040> scientifically<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.120> on<00:03:24.359> a<00:03:24.569> level<00:03:25.079> of

Chris<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:29.819> water<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.239> actually<00:03:30.829> softer

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
Chris the water is actually softer

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.099 
Chris the water is actually softer
feeling<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.609> more<00:03:32.970> silky<00:03:33.389> if<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.660> will<00:03:33.840> and

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
feeling and more silky if you will and

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.190

your<00:03:34.290> skin<00:03:34.560> won't<00:03:34.769> dry<00:03:35.100> out<00:03:35.130> oh<00:03:35.840> love<00:03:36.840> this

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
your skin won't dry out oh love this

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.229 
your skin won't dry out oh love this
aqua<00:03:37.590> vite<00:03:37.769> water<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.730> for<00:03:38.970> those<00:03:39.120> reasons
