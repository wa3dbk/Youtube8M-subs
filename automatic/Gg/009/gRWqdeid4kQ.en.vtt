00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.120 
these $80 controllers you're getting
yourself<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.840> nice<00:00:12.960> little<00:00:13.170> case<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.799> it's

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
yourself a nice little case and it's

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.379 
yourself a nice little case and it's
actually<00:00:14.370> pretty<00:00:14.460> cool<00:00:14.700> i<00:00:14.759> mean<00:00:14.969> just<00:00:15.120> it's

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389

actually pretty cool i mean just it's
got<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> nice<00:00:15.719> handle<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> cool<00:00:17.190> thing<00:00:17.220> is

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
got a nice handle and the cool thing is

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.970 
got a nice handle and the cool thing is
it<00:00:17.820> zips<00:00:18.330> up<00:00:18.539> it's<00:00:18.750> pretty<00:00:18.960> resilient<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.740> mean

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
it zips up it's pretty resilient I mean

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.480 
it zips up it's pretty resilient I mean
it's<00:00:20.160> not<00:00:20.250> like<00:00:20.640> smash<00:00:21.570> proof<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.890> not<00:00:23.100> smash

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
it's not like smash proof it's not smash

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.300 
it's not like smash proof it's not smash
proof<00:00:23.880> like<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.420> razor<00:00:24.869> sabertooth<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.039> is

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
proof like a razor sabertooth but it is

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.300 
proof like a razor sabertooth but it is
a<00:00:26.340> very<00:00:26.490> nice<00:00:27.180> clean<00:00:28.140> beautiful<00:00:28.529> looking<00:00:29.070> case

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
so um pretty much on the inside I took

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.459 
so um pretty much on the inside I took
the<00:00:32.640> controller<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.630> show<00:00:33.809> off<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
the controller out just to show off the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.370 
the controller out just to show off the
lights<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.829> stuff<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.020> nice

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.190 
lights and stuff but this this is nice
because<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:38.010> perfectly<00:00:38.520> cradles<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:40.079> on

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
button so this controller does not have

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.069 
button so this controller does not have
any<00:04:18.950> really<00:04:19.250> crazy<00:04:20.000> big<00:04:20.419> functions<00:04:20.989> like

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
that later in the into when I do

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.719 
that later in the into when I do
comparisons<00:05:02.750> so<00:05:03.020> since<00:05:03.800> there<00:05:04.009> is<00:05:04.189> no<00:05:04.219> crazy

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
what you can do with this controller so

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.330

was because of a good night or just the
magic<00:05:27.770> of<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:27.979> controller<00:05:28.400> but<00:05:29.180> once<00:05:29.419> i<00:05:29.539> found

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:29.719 
magic of the controller but once i found

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:32.860 
magic of the controller but once i found
the<00:05:29.960> sensitivity<00:05:30.589> sweet<00:05:30.860> spot<00:05:31.159> I<00:05:31.870> just
