for<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.630> Diagnostics<00:01:40.230> session<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.920> end<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.820> as

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
for the Diagnostics session to end so as

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.240 
for the Diagnostics session to end so as
soon<00:01:42.120> as<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.300> flashing<00:01:42.870> LED<00:01:43.320> remains<00:01:44.010> solid

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
soon as that flashing LED remains solid

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.180

we can disconnect the tool as you can
see<00:01:50.370> the<00:01:50.550> LED<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:51.030> stopped<00:01:51.240> flashing<00:01:51.510> and<00:01:51.990> it's

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
see the LED is stopped flashing and it's

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.560 
see the LED is stopped flashing and it's
now<00:01:52.260> remaining<00:01:52.680> solid<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.970> that's<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.330> end<00:01:54.480> of

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
now remaining solid so that's the end of

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.600 
now remaining solid so that's the end of
the<00:01:54.720> diagnostic<00:01:55.320> session<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.430> now

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the diagnostic session and you can now

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.360 
the diagnostic session and you can now
disconnect<00:01:57.000> from<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.450> diagnostic<00:01:57.840> socket<00:02:01.370> we

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
disconnect from the diagnostic socket we

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.950 
disconnect from the diagnostic socket we
now<00:02:02.520> need<00:02:02.730> to<00:02:02.760> carry<00:02:03.060> out<00:02:03.240> our<00:02:03.420> mechanical

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
now need to carry out our mechanical

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.620 
now need to carry out our mechanical
work<00:02:04.140> by<00:02:04.350> disassembling<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.190> caliper

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
work by disassembling the caliper

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.600 
work by disassembling the caliper
removing<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.750> brake<00:02:06.960> pads<00:02:07.260> and<00:02:07.610> manually

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
removing the brake pads and manually

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.550 
removing the brake pads and manually
winding<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.390> Pistons<00:02:09.810> back<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.320> there<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.530> a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
winding the Pistons back and there is a

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.290 
winding the Pistons back and there is a
misconception<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.610> diagnostic<00:02:12.150> tool

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
misconception that the diagnostic tool

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.050 
misconception that the diagnostic tool
does<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:13.140> doesn't<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:14.160> just<00:02:14.310> relaxes<00:02:14.910> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
does this it doesn't it just relaxes the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.570 
does this it doesn't it just relaxes the
caliper<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.810> can<00:02:16.260> wind<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.100> piston<00:02:17.460> back

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
caliper so you can wind the piston back

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.100 
caliper so you can wind the piston back
without<00:02:17.790> breaking<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.660> hand<00:02:18.930> brake

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
without breaking the hand brake

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.890 
without breaking the hand brake
mechanism<00:02:19.730> once<00:02:20.730> you've<00:02:20.880> replaced<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.690> brake

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
mechanism once you've replaced the brake

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.030 
mechanism once you've replaced the brake
pads<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:23.250> then<00:02:23.960> pump<00:02:24.960> up<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> brake<00:02:25.470> pedal<00:02:25.860> to

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
pads you then pump up the brake pedal to

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.890 
pads you then pump up the brake pedal to
push<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.400> Pistons<00:02:26.790> out<00:02:26.970> like<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.510> would<00:02:27.690> with

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
push the Pistons out like you would with

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.750 
push the Pistons out like you would with
a<00:02:27.930> conventional<00:02:27.990> caliper<00:02:28.980> okay<00:02:29.459> we're<00:02:29.640> now
