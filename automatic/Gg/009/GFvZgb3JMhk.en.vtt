00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.150
 so for this custom you will need a 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.290
 palette then mine and all rooms 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.970
 all used because I use 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.740
 often 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.910
 then it will take red paint 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:39.230
 where there is a little pink but responsa 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.330
 white hawks and from the left on behalf of 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.860
 any mark a brush to his 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:48.110
 end of the month it's a brush with a 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.950
 tip like those of the sponge so that 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.020
 you can find it 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.250
 either it's the makeup projects 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.050
 you can find in boxes to 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.339
 jewels for example you recover what 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.420
 in the background and then it's a bit like 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.890
 to plunge them here's a horse more 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.320
 mobile to customize so me it's a 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.180
 custom that I had missed the fight 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.440
 I removed everything I had done and 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.720
 I will do it again and a big plant 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.450
 of a big work plan so pretty 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.470
 big about like these are going 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.570
 So here we go right away as years 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.130
 you will come soak your sponge 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.130
 in white paint 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:28.280
 So who is giving back to the poor 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:30.619
 like these sabotage painting on 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:36.079
 your horse so here are different 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:40.850
 places but pat the paint so 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:44.530
 especially the horse to prosecution for 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.399
 even holding this so here you are 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.549
 normally if you have been loaned by 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.500
 all you have to get this so if he 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:56.960
 remain small black holes for example 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.909
 here again balah over there on the 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.859
 head is not too serious 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.530
 ah it's the same you do not have to push a 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.369
 little black so it does not matter you will 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:11.630
 plotted you just have to take 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:15.530
 a fine brush to soak it in 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.660
 white paint and come fill 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:24.319
 balaou or painting did not check 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.879
 so here we go 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:31.010
 you come to do this everywhere where is it 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.450
 that it remains black in fact where is also 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.239
 where bridges I can not reach 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.939
 for example between the legs there between 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.749
 the previous interests and that's 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.599
 so here I find you we have 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:43.670
 do so that's what it should you 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.109
 give then if he stays a few small 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.209
 black spots as if it's not too much 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:51.439
 serious 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:53.359
 that's it then so then you go 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.370
 take your black marker and you have 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:58.579
 come make some small spots a little 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.250
 everywhere so for example at the fmi if that 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.069
 can be big kids 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.530
 here are everywhere - on the members 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.099
 and then more on the head to do more 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.469
 realistic 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.359
 so that's what it should give you 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:14.060
 so I took the opportunity to do the 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:17.030
 clogs at the marker so it's the same years 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.459
 and you paint the hooves a crazy you 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.010
 I would not say it's the hoofs 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.199
 anwar and then I was also the eyes in 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.599
 black who I put a little bit of 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:30.650
 white done in the middle we distinguish it a 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:34.400
 little remains of the rest of the tasks so 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.599
 here on one side and then on the other 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.639
 but as you will see I put 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.699
 many more tasks on the head for 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:44.629
 to do more realistic so that's after 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:48.229
 you will come to take the painting 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:51.049
 white and a little bit of paint 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:53.209
 red like that to get a pale pink 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.069
 as we see but as there 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.290
 see but here it's all dry so it's 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.790
 for that I have to redo and you 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.359
 go paint the little end of the muzzle 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.129
 so here it is you paint pretty much 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:07.040
 not so far 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:09.769
 as often so that's what so that's 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.519
 party so that's what it should you 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:16.070
 give when you do not have the muzzle 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.590
 so here is more than below then I 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.820
 did not specify either but it does not 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.210
 do not make small black spots 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.560
 in the box here is either you 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.240
 let white be you do them in 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.800
 black so I think I was leaving 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.909
 white I do not know yet but I 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.400
 think I was leaving blank so that's it 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:37.860
 up and then you wait 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.520
 so it's dry when that's it 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.250
 come and take some nail polish 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.680
 actually varnish your other custom for 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.870
 avoid painting without my halo and 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.270
 a brush that goes with the varnish so 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.780
 me it's fimo varnish so it goes very 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.790
 well it would take a polish rather maths 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.620
 in fact what is wantzenau six months ago 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.900
 a little bit bright but like that be 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.370
 not too much I say anyway and so you 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.160
 are going to come actually soak your 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.960
 brush in the varnish and then varnish 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.510
 everywhere your creation 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.770
 when your custom earlier so that's 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.770
 I can find you when I do them
