00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.080
 Y 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.080
 plus 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.220
 do not 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.830
 ah 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.830
 Y 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:19.849
 I am nelson garrido I am a doer 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.610
 of cultural agitator images that I 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:26.240
 I believe that art precedes situations 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.939
 that are going to happen and it's not that you have a 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.849
 pitoniso character but are symptoms 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.420
 that in society they give that after 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:37.550
 sharpen or I think the situation 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.440
 of violence that is seeing the country was 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.290
 predictable and the symptoms will be 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.790
 they presented much earlier 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.530
 in a work that I did that is called 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.600
 caracas bleeding that tells you more than 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.040
 all product of anguish plus the 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.420
 anguish that the collective is experiencing 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.400
 Venezuelan or because that level of 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.350
 anguish of violence we have it and has 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.890
 arrived right now then in the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.620
 2013 have 25 thousand dead in a single year 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.520
 those symptoms I believe that art should 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.440
 to be in function of capturing is that's it 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.090
 that feels the collective or for me the 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.180
 artist is like an escape valve 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.890
 that simply synthesizes what is 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.380
 feeling everyone but through 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.440
 the position of a citizen here in the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.030
 sense that you give a visual form to 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.540
 a collective anguish 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:27.580
 then I do believe that the one should 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.470
 denounce and put detonating this 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.060
 make a call to society reflects 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.890
 about what is happening 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.080
 or elements such as violence that 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.130
 obviously splashes us every day 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.190
 is there but you have to rethink it to 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.540
 symbolic level and suggest that it is a 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.590
 thing that is an alert 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.430
 the great problem of the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.500
 dictatorships 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.480
 who do not understand that the counterpart is 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.210
 just be alert so you do not 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.600
 things happen and that is not fought by killing 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.830
 to people because ideas do not kill 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.410
 can not kill people but ideas 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.050
 that I think that's exactly where 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.060
 the works can be like the receiver of 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.119
 those ideas that the collective wants to say 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.570
 the problem that we asked about a 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.010
 with a number of layers of frustration 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.680
 it's more frustrations than suddenly 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.240
 they explode like a pressure cooker what 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.060
 is happening now is simply a 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.849
 historical matter 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.580
 or where simply neither the government 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.040
 nor the opposition as such or that is 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.410
 capitalizing on that if it's not for the first 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.849
 time is civil society the population in 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.620
 general simply that is 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.080
 exploiting in a way like passion in 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.280
 caracas or equality with an instance 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.050
 of massive social discontent that is 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.640
 give him some very interesting expressions 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.160
 first about the right to 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.840
 independence of expression and not having 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.410
 intermediaries look I do not think the 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.580
 art gets the art simply 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.540
 expresses the disease that is living 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.010
 the society 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.799
 only 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.540
 points or to review the 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.299
 situations that are being lived that 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.730
 They have a specific time value 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.010
 who is living the country and then if 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.840
 they have a value in 6 remain in time 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.329
 but that is defined by history but there 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.579
 an imperative need that those 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.019
 works have a social function of 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.450
 moment that you are looking at historical 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.700
 as I 'm worth it for the serious thing from goya 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.780
 disasters is up they expressed the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.379
 situation that society is experiencing 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.379
 Spanish 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.830
 do not 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.830
 Y 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.420
 I think that speaks of reconciliation and 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.370
 peace with a rolo of the hand and the shrapnel 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.870
 on the other hand it's absurd is not the 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.270
 imposition of one group on the other group 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.890
 but respect for people who think 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.390
 different from you it can not be that 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.250
 Anyone who thinks differently than 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.980
 you have to annihilate him or 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.990
 eliminate him physically or politically 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.650
 talk about peace with a unique thought 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:59.440
 with a line drawn with emotion that is 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.720
 it seems symptomatic or simple and 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.090
 plainly that Chavez is already defined 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.010
 as eternal supreme commander is a 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.630
 thing of such a fascist character 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.750
 I do not take care of any supreme 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.420
 internal but at no level and then 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.880
 also the symbolic instances of 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:20.030
 power are managing that at the level already 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.629
 almost religious eternal supreme commander 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.629
 it's crazy 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.550
 i 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.550
 do not
