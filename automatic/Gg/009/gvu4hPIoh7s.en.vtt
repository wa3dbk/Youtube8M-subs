00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello guys and girls here the truth 

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:06.390
 commenting and they bring the mission in 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.520
 friendship request gold that has 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.080
 two points come the first time 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.240
 it ends in less than eight minutes 30 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.860
 seconds and the second out spam closes 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.609
 all pop-ups unless 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.679
 32 seconds come on let's do it things 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.199
 two things that I always tell you first 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.640
 you do not have to complete everything in a 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.859
 pull is to say we can do in a 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.570
 occasion a point and on the second occasion 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.369
 another point although in the end it is not check 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.869
 that everything is completed but when 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.250
 you go back to the main menu yes it is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.039
 brand that is completing everything and what 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.570
 second they can kill us during the 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.519
 mission to make the neurosis kill 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.579
 you have to finish it and start over 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.969
 in order to get it we are not going 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.969
 to it 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.520
 something 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.390
 que 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.390
 is 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.620
 Y 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.120
 how 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.950
 but to the confusion 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.950
 karim and software 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.819
 create chaos 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.120
 let's go for god 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.350
 mainz 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.930
 an institute kit safe for work 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.170
 they sounded 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.730
 not only do not know if I have not done 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.730
 come on let's go that time 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.490
 i 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.450
 wow 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.659
 and so much 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.560
 I am back 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.530
 we go 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.560
 Well, here is a clear summary of 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.410
 to get it out the first one ends in less 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.690
 eight minutes against 8 in 741 good 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.250
 if they go fast in a normal car there 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.660
 you have problems if you were staying 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.880
 you break the pop-up windows at least 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.730
 32 seconds is not easy, it has cost me 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.620
 a couple of times it's not worth with the crosshead 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.210
 as if we take out the mobile and we are going to 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.670
 internet that with the crosshead we go to the 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.380
 points to close window whatever it is not 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.510
 ok that's what you have to go with the analog 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.930
 but good patting and 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.370
 quickly x we got it good 26 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.860
 seconds six seconds to spare is not 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.660
 easy but good you can do so 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.220
 this has been this mission in now if it 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.170
