and I did not end up buying a motorcycle
right<00:03:20.360> after<00:03:20.800> finishing<00:03:21.800> that<00:03:22.100> training

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
right after finishing that training

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.730 
right after finishing that training
course<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.360> in<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:23.720> training<00:03:23.960> course<00:03:24.230> we<00:03:24.560> used

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
course and in a training course we used

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.780 
course and in a training course we used
cbr125r<00:03:27.740> s<00:03:29.110> ours<00:03:30.110> like<00:03:30.560> an<00:03:30.710> acid<00:03:30.890> but<00:03:31.400> yeah<00:03:31.550> it

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
cbr125r s ours like an acid but yeah it

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.380 
sometimes is a good thing to have
it's<00:05:45.990> I<00:05:46.440> can't<00:05:46.770> tell<00:05:47.070> what<00:05:47.250> what<00:05:47.970> is<00:05:48.060> this<00:05:48.180> bike

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
it's I can't tell what what is this bike

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.050 
it's I can't tell what what is this bike
it's<00:05:48.600> I<00:05:48.810> think<00:05:48.900> it's<00:05:49.080> a<00:05:49.170> gixxer<00:05:49.410> 750<00:05:50.160> he

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
it's I think it's a gixxer 750 he

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.180 
it's I think it's a gixxer 750 he
tricked<00:05:51.660> it<00:05:51.810> out<00:05:51.930> there's<00:05:52.470> nothing<00:05:52.620> that<00:05:53.010> on<00:05:53.160> a

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
tricked it out there's nothing that on a

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.610 
tricked it out there's nothing that on a
fairing<00:05:53.670> that<00:05:53.700> says<00:05:54.030> what<00:05:54.180> it<00:05:54.300> is<00:05:54.450> but<00:05:55.170> I<00:05:55.230> think

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
fairing that says what it is but I think

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.910 
fairing that says what it is but I think
it's<00:05:55.800> a<00:05:55.890> 750

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
it's a 750

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.920 
it's a 750
anyways

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
anyways

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.080 
anyways
so<00:06:00.470> I<00:06:00.530> had<00:06:00.740> this<00:06:01.009> 125r<00:06:01.820> for<00:06:02.210> three<00:06:02.449> months

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
so I had this 125r for three months

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.770 
so I had this 125r for three months
and<00:06:04.389> I<00:06:04.690> sold<00:06:04.930> it<00:06:05.110> after<00:06:05.800> three<00:06:06.100> months<00:06:06.780> I've

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
and I sold it after three months I've

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.570 
and I sold it after three months I've
used<00:06:08.020> it<00:06:08.199> on<00:06:08.260> a<00:06:08.320> highway<00:06:08.800> extensively<00:06:09.400> because

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
used it on a highway extensively because

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.370 
used it on a highway extensively because
that<00:06:09.880> was<00:06:10.000> my<00:06:10.030> daily<00:06:10.449> commuter<00:06:10.870> to<00:06:10.990> work<00:06:11.199> as

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
that was my daily commuter to work as

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.009 
that was my daily commuter to work as
every<00:06:12.370> bike<00:06:12.550> I<00:06:12.580> have<00:06:12.970> and

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:17.019 

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:20.169 

after<00:06:18.019> a<00:06:18.049> while<00:06:18.259> you<00:06:18.739> realize<00:06:19.699> you're<00:06:19.849> killing

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:20.179 
after a while you realize you're killing

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:22.329 
after a while you realize you're killing
the<00:06:20.269> bike<00:06:20.449> because<00:06:20.689> he<00:06:20.989> rev<00:06:21.439> it<00:06:21.589> up<00:06:21.679> to<00:06:22.009> the<00:06:22.189> red

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:22.339 
the bike because he rev it up to the red

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:25.529 
the bike because he rev it up to the red
line<00:06:22.369> every<00:06:22.879> single<00:06:23.239> time<00:06:23.709> just<00:06:24.709> to<00:06:24.829> go<00:06:25.009> about

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
line every single time just to go about

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.739 
line every single time just to go about
buck<00:06:26.539> 10<00:06:26.809> on<00:06:27.049> the<00:06:27.110> highway<00:06:27.739> I'm<00:06:28.099> talking<00:06:28.429> about

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:28.749 
buck 10 on the highway I'm talking about

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:33.609 
buck 10 on the highway I'm talking about
110<00:06:29.749> km/h<00:06:31.119> not<00:06:32.119> miles<00:06:32.389> I<00:06:32.749> think<00:06:33.199> that<00:06:33.289> equates

00:06:33.609 --> 00:06:33.619 
110 km/h not miles I think that equates

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:37.180 
110 km/h not miles I think that equates
to<00:06:33.739> baby<00:06:34.009> out<00:06:34.369> of<00:06:34.489> 60<00:06:35.089> miles

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
to baby out of 60 miles

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.450 
to baby out of 60 miles
so<00:06:37.820> yeah<00:06:38.030> it's<00:06:38.240> not<00:06:38.800> the<00:06:39.800> best<00:06:39.950> bike<00:06:40.220> on<00:06:40.430> a

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
so yeah it's not the best bike on a

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.040 
so yeah it's not the best bike on a
highway<00:06:40.790> but<00:06:41.000> it<00:06:41.090> actually<00:06:41.270> gets<00:06:41.570> you<00:06:41.810> up

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050
