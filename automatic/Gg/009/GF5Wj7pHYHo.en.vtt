00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.510
 universal nutrition 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.269
 probably everyone knows that the company 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.030
 universal nutrition is one of 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.680
 oldest sports manufacturers 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.380

 won the trust of buyers around 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.180
 world means concrete and monohydrate 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.250
 creatine is a pure form 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.830
 creatine 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.809
 which is most well digested 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.380
 human body 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.270
 athlete and as part of us here only and 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.640
 imagine that creatine monohydrate in 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.610
 5 gram per serving 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.649
 the portion is 5 grams 100 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.140
 portions is in this in this jar 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.170
 or in this container means 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.840
 recommendations for the use of monohydrate 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.690
 creatine are individual we recommend 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.190
 take it from the boot phase that is 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.770
 when we are for seven days 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.100
 takes this creatine four times a 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.379
 day 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.540
 this is the so-called boot phase that is 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.780
 20 grams of creatine you about 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.260
 turns out per day means after this 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.090
 a week 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.180
 go to the normal phase receptions 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.880
 take it for 4 5 weeks 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.310
 in the usual way, that is 5 grams 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.500
 can be taken an hour and a half before 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.810
 workouts and 5 grams can be taken 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.240
 immediately after training means after that 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.479
 how did you take these 4 5 weeks 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.500
 normally take a break at 3-4 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.420
 of the week 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.970
 this is necessary in order for your 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.119
 the body did not get used to creatine and its 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.950
 properties 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.320
 let's say not decreasing that is not 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.590
 diminished its effects on your body 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.149
 so creative is an additive 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.119
 characterized by the fact that it allows us to 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.610
 gain muscle mass rather quickly 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.180
 rather than taking protein or 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.040
 gainer 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.409
 This is due to the fact that creatine 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.540
 retains water in more detail you 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.399
 will be able to meet on the Internet 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.619
 from personal experience I can say that 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.850
 Creatine works well with growth 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.310
 muscle mass allows 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.520
 C gain of about 4-5 pounds per 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.069
 month means improves power performance 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.880
 athlete that is, in basic exercises 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.130
 for example in benches or deadlift by 4 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.500
 at least he works very well in a squat 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.209
 noticeable result is already somewhere after 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.319
 three to four weeks of admission 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.819
 does this package mean 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.280

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.310
