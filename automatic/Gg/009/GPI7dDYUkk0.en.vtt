00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
favorite champion a balanced solution so

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.770 
favorite champion a balanced solution so
they're<00:00:07.830> at<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.099> again<00:00:08.189> with<00:00:08.490> them<00:00:08.639> these<00:00:09.389> are

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
they're at it again with them these are

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.870 
they're at it again with them these are
not<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.260> biggest<00:00:10.830> changes<00:00:11.219> ever<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.519> suppose

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
not the biggest changes ever I suppose

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.669 
not the biggest changes ever I suppose
but<00:00:12.150> they<00:00:12.660> probably<00:00:12.929> have<00:00:13.110> some<00:00:13.290> effect<00:00:13.410> on

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
but they probably have some effect on

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.950 
but they probably have some effect on
gameplay<00:00:14.000> as<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.120> can<00:00:15.210> see<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.420> put<00:00:15.719> as<00:00:15.839> I

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
gameplay as you can see I put as I

gameplay as you can see I put as I

usually do up in notepad right above my

usually do up in notepad right above my
head<00:00:17.699> here<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.090> can<00:00:18.180> read<00:00:18.330> them

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449

yourselves<00:00:18.810> but<00:00:19.140> ardent<00:00:19.920> blaze<00:00:20.130> that's<00:00:20.490> been

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
yourselves but ardent blaze that's been

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.700 
yourselves but ardent blaze that's been
changed<00:00:20.939> around<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.180> bit<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.990> movement<00:00:22.289> speed

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
changed around a bit the movement speed

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.220 
changed around a bit the movement speed
buff<00:00:22.920> has<00:00:23.400> now<00:00:23.820> basically<00:00:24.090> scales<00:00:24.510> with<00:00:24.840> level

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
buff has now basically scales with level

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.830 
buff has now basically scales with level
however<00:00:25.680> they<00:00:25.890> remove<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.400> bonus<00:00:27.000> ad<00:00:27.240> ratio

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
however they remove the bonus ad ratio

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.259 
however they remove the bonus ad ratio
of<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.650> or<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.279> plays<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.640> believe<00:00:29.880> they<00:00:30.060> nerf

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
of it so or in plays I believe they nerf

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.209 
of it so or in plays I believe they nerf
the<00:00:30.420> damage<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.720> little<00:00:30.960> while<00:00:31.080> back<00:00:31.320> now<00:00:32.040> we'll

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
the damage a little while back now we'll

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.459 
the damage a little while back now we'll
do<00:00:32.460> even<00:00:32.700> less<00:00:32.730> damage<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.110> guess<00:00:34.200> they're

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
do even less damage so I guess they're

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.690 
do even less damage so I guess they're
just<00:00:34.500> ripping<00:00:35.100> off<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.309> little<00:00:35.460> bit<00:00:35.579> of

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
just ripping off a little bit of

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.580 
just ripping off a little bit of
incidental<00:00:36.300> damage<00:00:36.570> evolution<00:00:36.809> or<00:00:37.230> remaining

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
incidental damage evolution or remaining

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.530 
incidental damage evolution or remaining
as<00:00:37.680> core<00:00:37.890> damage<00:00:38.070> relatively<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.670> same<00:00:38.730> but

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
as core damage relatively the same but

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.119 
as core damage relatively the same but
it<00:00:39.660> gets<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.840> bit<00:00:39.870> more<00:00:40.050> utility<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.590> compensate

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
it gets a bit more utility to compensate

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.360 
it gets a bit more utility to compensate
I<00:00:41.160> suppose<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.899> now<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.410> culling<00:00:44.010> has<00:00:44.040> been

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
I suppose and now the culling has been

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.310 
I suppose and now the culling has been
changed<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.300> cooldown<00:00:45.780> has<00:00:46.079> been

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
changed so that the cooldown has been

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.250 
changed so that the cooldown has been
increased<00:00:46.739> quite<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.160> bit<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.550> max<00:00:47.879> rank<00:00:48.260> max

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
increased quite a bit of max rank max

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.200 
increased quite a bit of max rank max
rank<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:49.649> nearly<00:00:49.920> double<00:00:50.610> what<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.760> used<00:00:51.059> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
rank it's nearly double what it used to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.150 
rank it's nearly double what it used to
be<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:51.930> they've<00:00:52.170> dumped<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> damage<00:00:52.890> per

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
be but they've dumped the damage per

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.119 
be but they've dumped the damage per
shot<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.350> kind<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.620> see<00:00:55.800> where<00:00:55.980> this

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
shot so I can kind of see where this

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.750 
shot so I can kind of see where this
change<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.760> coming<00:00:57.059> from<00:00:57.530> early<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.760> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
change is coming from early on the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.979 
change is coming from early on the
culling<00:01:00.120> doesn't<00:01:00.390> really<00:01:00.510> feel<00:01:00.750> all<00:01:00.960> that

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
culling doesn't really feel all that

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.170 
culling doesn't really feel all that
strong<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.800> then<00:01:02.010> later<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.489> people<00:01:02.910> just

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
strong and then later on people just

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.759 
strong and then later on people just
spamming<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.780> culling<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> clear<00:01:04.500> waves

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
spamming the culling to clear waves

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.320 
spamming the culling to clear waves
faster<00:01:05.339> most<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.760> time<00:01:05.909> from<00:01:06.090> what<00:01:06.240> I've

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
faster most of the time from what I've

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.690 
faster most of the time from what I've
seen<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.680> all<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:07.920> feel<00:01:08.130> always<00:01:08.549> feels

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
seen and it's all we feel always feels

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.460 
seen and it's all we feel always feels
really<00:01:08.970> laying<00:01:09.210> when<00:01:09.420> people<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.780> use<00:01:09.869> an

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
really laying when people just use an

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.740 
really laying when people just use an
old<00:01:10.830> spell<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.430> wave<00:01:11.640> clear<00:01:12.000> tool<00:01:12.210> they<00:01:12.510> just

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
old spell as a wave clear tool they just

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.090 
old spell as a wave clear tool they just
really<00:01:12.960> annoys<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.320> want<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:13.619> people<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
really annoys we want to see people you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.370 
really annoys we want to see people you
know<00:01:14.189> use<00:01:14.340> Asriel's<00:01:14.760> old<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.479> you

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
know use Asriel's old like that and you

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.560 
know use Asriel's old like that and you
know<00:01:16.470> things<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:18.060> by<00:01:18.240> upping

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
know things like that and so by upping

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.240 
know things like that and so by upping
the<00:01:18.720> damage<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.409> lowering<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> cooldown

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the damage and lowering the cooldown

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.070 
the damage and lowering the cooldown
you're<00:01:20.369> probably<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:20.909> yet<00:01:21.119> less<00:01:21.299> uses<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
you're probably see yet less uses of the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.609 
you're probably see yet less uses of the
culling<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:23.299> now<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.360> changes<00:01:25.320> per

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
culling like that now the changes per

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.770 
culling like that now the changes per
shot<00:01:26.009> are<00:01:26.280> actually<00:01:26.759> deceptively<00:01:27.479> high

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
shot are actually deceptively high

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.440 
shot are actually deceptively high
because<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.259> five<00:01:28.500> per<00:01:28.890> shot<00:01:29.310> meaning<00:01:30.240> that

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
because it's five per shot meaning that

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.719 
because it's five per shot meaning that
currently<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.470> know<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.740> no<00:01:32.159> stats<00:01:32.520> on

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729

that's 50 that's a 60 extra damage on
the<00:01:38.610> old<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:38.939> usually<00:01:39.360> when<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.570> know<00:01:39.659> you'd

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
the old but usually when you know you'd

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.050 
the old but usually when you know you'd
put<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.860> much<00:01:41.040> damage<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> single<00:01:41.909> thing

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
put that much damage on a single thing

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.190 
put that much damage on a single thing
that's<00:01:42.150> quite<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> bit<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.810> it's<00:01:42.930> not<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
that's quite a bit like it's not the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.219 
that's quite a bit like it's not the
biggest<00:01:43.799> thing<00:01:44.040> early<00:01:44.430> or<00:01:44.640> late<00:01:45.570> although<00:01:45.869> you

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
biggest thing early or late although you

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.859 
biggest thing early or late although you
do<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> lot<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.070> shots<00:01:47.369> off<00:01:47.700> late<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.720> if<00:01:48.750> you

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
do get a lot of shots off late so if you

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.420 
do get a lot of shots off late so if you
manage<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.320> pepper<00:01:49.649> some<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.009> all<00:01:50.159> shots

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
manage to like pepper some of all shots

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.030 
manage to like pepper some of all shots
a<00:01:50.610> pretty<00:01:50.820> big<00:01:50.970> damage<00:01:51.390> boost<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.950> know

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
a pretty big damage boost and you know

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.520 
a pretty big damage boost and you know
with<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.220> lower<00:01:53.460> levels<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.509> know<00:01:54.630> 60<00:01:55.320> extra

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
with the lower levels you know 60 extra

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.539 
with the lower levels you know 60 extra
damage<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:56.009> respectable<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.329> yeah<00:01:58.340> that's<00:01:59.340> it

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
damage is respectable so yeah that's it

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.249 
damage is respectable so yeah that's it
for<00:01:59.700> Lucien<00:02:00.000> changes<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.750> looks<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.020> gather

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
for Lucien changes it looks like gather

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.499 
for Lucien changes it looks like gather
continuing<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.399> move<00:02:02.579> Lucien<00:02:02.969> more<00:02:03.149> towards

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
continuing to move Lucien more towards

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.270 
continuing to move Lucien more towards
this<00:02:03.600> kind<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.869> speedy<00:02:04.200> skirmisher<00:02:04.890> type<00:02:05.070> they

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
this kind of speedy skirmisher type they

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.999 
this kind of speedy skirmisher type they
want<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.549> be<00:02:05.670> less<00:02:05.880> about<00:02:06.439> Road<00:02:07.439> force<00:02:07.829> I

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
want to be less about Road force I

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.249 
want to be less about Road force I
suppose<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.970> all<00:02:09.209> these<00:02:09.330> changes<00:02:09.750> they<00:02:10.050> make

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
suppose so all these changes they make

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.050 
suppose so all these changes they make
sense<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.739> terms<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.039> where<00:02:11.250> riot<00:02:11.520> has<00:02:11.879> been

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
sense in terms of where riot has been

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.190 
sense in terms of where riot has been
taking<00:02:12.420> them<00:02:12.510> compare

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
taking them compare

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.199 
taking them compare
to<00:02:13.470> wear<00:02:13.800> when<00:02:14.040> taken<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.550> context<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.090> his

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
to wear when taken in the context of his

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.000 
to wear when taken in the context of his
previous<00:02:15.450> changes<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.680> know<00:02:16.800> when<00:02:16.920> they

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
previous changes you know when they

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.410 
previous changes you know when they
shuffled<00:02:17.340> around<00:02:17.430> how<00:02:17.640> relentless<00:02:17.910> pursuit

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
shuffled around how relentless pursuit

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.030 
shuffled around how relentless pursuit
work<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:18.870> lower<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.410> damage<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:19.890> stuff

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
work and lower this damage and stuff

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.699 
work and lower this damage and stuff
like<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.810> in<00:02:21.810> any<00:02:21.900> case<00:02:22.110> that's<00:02:22.349> it<00:02:22.500> for<00:02:22.620> now

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
like that in any case that's it for now

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.619 
like that in any case that's it for now
