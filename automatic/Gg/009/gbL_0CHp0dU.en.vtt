00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.430
 to make this game where to be 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.960
 willing to face the risk of 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:25.340

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.290

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.280
 as an extravagance or you can use the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.590

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.450
 it burns as the wallet is loaded 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.390

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.740
 absolutely 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.539
 sicania of calculation zippo the autonomy 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.649
 year in huge because as you can 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.020

 the amount of gas you use is 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.369
 extremely high then instantly
