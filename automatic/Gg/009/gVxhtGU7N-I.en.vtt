fender and it comes on down here and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.179 
fender and it comes on down here and
this<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.240> where<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.689> leak<00:01:36.900> occurs<00:01:37.380> then<00:01:38.070> of

course the water comes down here runs

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.200 
course the water comes down here runs
across<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> dash<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.100> drops<00:01:41.369> right<00:01:41.700> onto

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
across the dash and drops right onto

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
simple to take care of that's how you

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.460 
simple to take care of that's how you
seal<00:03:45.870> an<00:03:46.170> MGB<00:03:46.920> windscreen<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:48.470> sometimes

even<00:03:50.070> when<00:03:50.220> we<00:03:50.459> put<00:03:50.670> them<00:03:50.820> on<00:03:51.000> we<00:03:51.750> forget<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.530> do

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
even when we put them on we forget to do

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.590 
even when we put them on we forget to do
the<00:03:52.859> ceiling<00:03:53.160> so<00:03:53.730> if<00:03:53.880> you're<00:03:54.060> at<00:03:54.150> home<00:03:54.299> and

the ceiling so if you're at home and

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.890 
the ceiling so if you're at home and
we've<00:03:55.260> done<00:03:55.440> your<00:03:55.650> windscreen<00:03:56.359> you<00:03:57.359> can<00:03:57.570> you

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
we've done your windscreen you can you

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.500 
we've done your windscreen you can you
can<00:03:58.079> seal<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:58.410> up<00:03:58.620> as<00:03:58.920> easily<00:03:59.370> as<00:03:59.670> that<00:03:59.700> so

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
can seal it up as easily as that so

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.820 
can seal it up as easily as that so
until<00:04:00.900> later<00:04:01.549> safety<00:04:02.549> fast
