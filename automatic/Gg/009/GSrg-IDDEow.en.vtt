00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hello everyone, today we have a total of 10 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.589
 gauge games that won back 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.570
 and as we all know the rating of these games 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.849
 considered directly proportional to your 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.549
 skill is an accurate rating calculation formula 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.039
 known only to the creators of the game if its 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.289
 publish something on account calibration and 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.270
 will complete chaos well and what we 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.779
 We know that our rating depends on 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.609
 of our code and decode at home for the fight I 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.830
 spent 10 say you say they were 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.109
 terrible I did not even share what 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.820
 wanted to make about what a high rating 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.239
 can we talk if in the second game we 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.850
 once again karos mage was 317 9 I merged 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.280
 as a full bottom after which I did not 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.020
 sweated heavily and started to play on 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.230
 veil without much mood 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.539
 Now I will give an example and screenshots of mine 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.660
 calibration bills will be possible by him 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.600
 judge here I presented 11 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.480
 screenshots why 11 because in 3 or 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.300
 4 games all played game turned out 6 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.440
 minutes and and not even counted well and 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.960
 continuation of the topic 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.000
 I'll tell you what's on the screen immediately visible 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.790
 that calibration obviously did not work for me 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.470
 gave only 3000 m and I thought they would give 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.200
 less judging by my games or vice versa 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.450
 more who knows him anyway spam 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.640
 Damage I like many cultures of Zeus 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.409
 Apparently comedy can be changed 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.479
 calculation formula for on another account 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.909
 calibration took place a very long time and not 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.280
 I can remember in which patches have withdrawn but 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.159
 there I also played 3,000 rankings even by 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.750
 my inside 200 but the thing is that in 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.490
 this time I played more or less 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.829
 tried and last time I just 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.750
 poured on different characters in general can 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.439
 us on support because for kerry 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.610
 probably can not play me like no 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.830
 I have no reasonable explanation besides 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.170
 horns bottom and all that how can someone 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.350
 say honestly i am not upset 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.660
 even but only ranked you know 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.970
 how many earned time two days now 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.080
 I play solo rating quietly starting 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.850
 escalate mostly wines go here with me 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.770
 most of all surprised that of people 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.720
 one and a half thousand rating I just don't 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.180
 I understand how you can play at all 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.520
 one and a half thousand rating although it will be necessary 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.760
 maybe try to make one 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.200
 account 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.310
 a bit of letting people down in a team 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.410
 of course to merge 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.940
 maybe they have quite fun there 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.739
 this rating will need to be sure 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.000
 try in general summed up 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.739
 add up all prime games on 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.989
 imagine how much spam was ult 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.000
 Zeus 's something like this to play on 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.060
 3000 my mayor is not very big 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.920
 achievement but oh well a lot of videos 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.250
 lies on yu tuba and all tambourine one and the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.550
 everybody says this formula Kills and Plus 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:47.650
 assist and divided by death plus hero 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.870
 Damage rather hero damage and say 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.510
 how to spam at home how not to die like they 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.799
 gaining a5000 mm but i'm fine so far 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.390
 video did not see that after 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.790
 gauge games and gave somebody 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:03.790
 five mowers mr although I'm sure if 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:07.230
 such people just might be so 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.780
 yes yes I have a leg to judge went to the site 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.140
 different services for pumping accounts and 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.599
 even there I do not think that there are such people 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.280
 how do i sit who play poorly but 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:24.810
 it still gives an approximate range 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.140
 they were obtained from 3 to 5 thousand MMP not 4905 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.090
 100 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.760
 let's say such a small developed from three 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.709
 thousand to five and that is probably possible 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.849
 to judge that it is necessary only calibration 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.620
 play normally but oh well another 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.510
 important note like to say everything 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.120
 understand that the game as a whole may depend 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.040
 not from you from the team this zest which 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.400
 will run under the base of the memory of the house 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.560
 cultures do assist and and keels 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.190
 not so 10 games not so much through 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.440
 ten games 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.230
 this rachila will sit at the main menu 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.810
 and masturbate on your say 4 4s 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.609
 almera halves and the best option 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.200
 and if he tells his classmate 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.299
 what is his rating and play more 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.799
 do not be so as not to drain and 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.750
 if you start playing 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:11.010
 what about letting the team who wants to 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:16.109
 playing 4 by 5 is not easy 4 by 5 by 4 by 5 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:18.000
 plus feeder and then it will merge ranking 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.500
 will calibrate again still call 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.329
 friends and they all start later 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.190
 calibrate and in the end we get in battle 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.610
 by useless zeus who nothing 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.710
 do this personally my opinion in brief 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.460
 described his thoughts but also told about 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.520
 Thank you all for your calibration. 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.520
 goodbye
