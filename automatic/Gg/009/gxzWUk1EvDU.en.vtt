00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.630
 let's add a touch of glamor to 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.330
 this this shot by itself already 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.160
 glamor watch out for comments because 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.190
 you could read them too we have 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.840
 this girl with generous curves and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.680
 let's see how to emphasize 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.510
 further things window of the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.230
 open levels therefore less window 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.230
 levels 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.510
 we activate a new empty level but at 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.329
 upstairs 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.610
 second icons at the bottom right 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.530
 activate the level below 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.420
 check the rectangular selection e 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.230
 we begin to describe a series of 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.329
 narrow and wide rectangles we speak from 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.660
 more or less center is not important that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.059
 are all identical one thing 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.300
 I recommend maybe that the distance between 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.910
 one selection and the other is minimal 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.829
 there is little the little detachment then one 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.790
 first a first track a first one 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.780
 rectangle we hold the key 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.390
 capitalization this allows us to 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.360
 add a selection to what 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.750
 we have already done normally if not 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.050
 press the shift key is canceled 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.350
 the previous selection and yes 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.230
 to repeat itself a new selection is generated 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.760
 always holding in capital letters we continue 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.230
 to add rectangles I make one 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.960
 kind of pyramid both going up and down 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.000
 down I repeat it is not important that they are 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.180
 identical also in height if we want 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.480
 we can play with other dimensions 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.750
 we can play a little bit and see 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.110
 to create this sort of pyramid for us 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.150
 is not perfectly equal in every in 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.090
 then height for each rectangle 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:02:00.000
 always hold the shift key 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:04.430
 let's go to the top this series is over 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.320
 we will do the same thing going down 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.810
 when we have finished generating all of them 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.930
 our selections a click with the button 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.690
 right inside reminding us of not 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.670
 modify the tools the tool 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.960
 keeping the tool beautiful of 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.580
 then select a click with the button 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.180
 right we have the possibility of 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:29.250
 transform as you do with the various 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.840
 levels with editing tools 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.450
 transforms etc. 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.430
 so let's check transform selection 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.610
 we click once again 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.930
 inside and let's go look for that 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.130
 which therefore interests us all 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.920
 tools that we are used to 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.220
 use on the levels we can 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.890
 also apply to a selection and choose 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.450
 rotate and go to rotate this series here 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.650
 so just for 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.340
 give another dynamic to the thing after the 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.590
 first drawing of the selections mi 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.319
 I change the orientation I click again 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.470
 with the right button you can tick scale 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.319
 if I want to embrace more and therefore 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.720
 change the starting size the 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.060
 size of the selection I had 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.670
 originated initially and I go 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.830
 circus naturally to embrace that 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.590
 that the content inside 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.170
 the most interesting part of the in 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.530
 photography with the background level 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.989
 activated change torque or control c e 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:37.390
 checks to paste after doing 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.640
 double click this to activate the 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:46.120
 transformation then change copy 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.450
 edit paste we can delete 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.209
 this here because I didn't need it in 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.079
 mind another thing but it also works 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.069
 with the system I'm explaining to you 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.500
 activate background level e 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.720
 we apply a regulation level of 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.480
 concentrate the pellet as usual 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.840
 black and white we find tonal values 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.549
 cs6 is now called so it is levels 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.970
 in previous versions and therefore 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:15.250
 tonal values ​​this level of 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.430
 adjustment will be applied to the level 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.639
 below we go to play with the 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.310
 brightness therefore with a simple 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.979
 central cursor movement we succeed 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.870
 to make less visible what the 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:33.310
 rest of the image and make it more 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.310
 concentrated observation of the series 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.210
 of rectangular selections that have been 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.529
 performed here will naturally be clipped 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.069
 for 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:47.199
 based on the images bring out in 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.129
 more like what is evident 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.599
 under 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:54.249
 or we can do the opposite then 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:56.679
 go high and highlight in 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:59.949
 differently with light instead of with 

00:04:56.679 --> 00:05:00.639
 darkness and have another one second 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.259
 effect 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:07.809
 I stay up on this setting and 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:10.929
 I confirm that I confirm I close for not 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:14.649
 having a window between the feet is 

00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:18.659
 already finished is a small intervention that 

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:21.429
 it can serve to give an extra tone to a 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:23.199
 image already pleasant in itself 

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:25.329
 if we wish we can activate the level 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:28.329
 top and evaluate a black and white 

00:05:25.329 --> 00:05:31.329
 as can therefore be the central icon 

00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:33.249
 check white and black and adjust 

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:36.549
 naturally the puppies based on the 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:38.379
 our image to get better 

00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:39.839
 so these cursors we see 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:42.789
 colored 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:44.739
 intervene on the colors present in the 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:48.669
 images having no greens we see that 

00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:50.110
 there are no changes without having them 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.629
 very little 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.629
 these are also those 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:58.029
 adjustments that allow us to 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:59.649
 influence in a personalized way on a 

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:03.789
 black and white if we want to stay on one 

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:07.809
 his low or high key also went with 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:09.879
 contrasts very pronounced or not 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:11.709
 we will intervene on the reds I intervene on 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:12.939
 red always based on the photograph that 

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:15.549
 I have available 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:17.109
 instead of tint we have the 

00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:20.699
 possibility to choose a color change 

00:06:17.109 --> 00:06:23.469
 then with the default settings 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.929
 normally we have a vaguely tinted color 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:30.659
 sepia by clicking on this 

00:06:25.929 --> 00:06:30.659
 square and moving on the cursor 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:38.410
 in the color bar we can evaluate 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:40.990
 directly as it can present itself with 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:44.350
 other shades and maybe find something 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:48.100
 that satisfies us more or makes us of 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:50.560
 more particularly suited to 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.050
 the one that was one at the start 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.170
 color photography in the whole world 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:07:00.130
 how and returned to the version without 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:02.680
 black and white which is what I had 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.640
 thought to offer you the variant of the 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:09.190
 black and white was naturally one 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.320
 chance this to remember that not 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.660
 we must always stop only the 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.330
 color but take into account the 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.980
 black and white that has its details 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.980
 effects especially on certain images
