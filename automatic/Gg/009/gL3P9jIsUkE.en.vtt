00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
know they could hardly even give them

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.560 
know they could hardly even give them
away<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.250> hundred<00:01:20.430> dollars<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.030> stuff<00:01:21.299> so

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
away for a hundred dollars and stuff so

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.910 
away for a hundred dollars and stuff so
they<00:01:21.780> had<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> big<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.560> know<00:01:22.650> price

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
they had to have a big you know price

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.679 
they had to have a big you know price
reduction<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.119> all<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.270> kind<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.630> stuff

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.340 
it can compete with the Apple iPad you
know<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> ipad<00:01:33.240> could<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.540> do<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.140> much<00:01:34.290> more

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.810 
it at home or you know anywhere where
there's<00:01:42.360> Wi-Fi<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.110> an<00:01:43.200> office<00:01:43.560> or<00:01:43.820> cafe

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
there's Wi-Fi like in an office or cafe

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.819 
there's Wi-Fi like in an office or cafe
but<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.090> can't<00:01:45.329> really<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.689> as<00:01:45.840> mobile<00:01:46.320> with

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
but you can't really be as mobile with

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.770 
but you can't really be as mobile with
it<00:01:47.040> as<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.320> know

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
it as you can with the you know

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.780 
it as you can with the you know
that's<00:01:50.409> unfortunate<00:01:50.710> because<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.430> size<00:01:51.640> of

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
that's unfortunate because the size of

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.700 
that's unfortunate because the size of
it<00:01:51.880> is<00:01:52.000> you<00:01:52.510> know<00:01:52.600> nice<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:52.990> small<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.440> stuff

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
it is you know nice and small and stuff

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.770 
it is you know nice and small and stuff
so<00:01:53.979> anyway<00:01:54.940> those<00:01:55.060> are<00:01:55.119> just<00:01:55.270> minus<00:01:55.600> lace

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
so anyway those are just minus lace

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.180 
so anyway those are just minus lace
thoughts<00:01:56.140> you<00:01:56.650> know<00:01:56.710> I'm<00:01:56.799> certainly<00:01:57.100> not

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
does so much more and I've already got

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.600 
does so much more and I've already got
that<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:02.290> just<00:02:02.710> don't<00:02:02.950> see<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.130> need<00:02:03.310> where

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
that and I just don't see a need where

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.999 
that and I just don't see a need where
for<00:02:04.210> me<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.450> Kindle<00:02:04.780> Fire<00:02:04.990> really<00:02:05.590> fits<00:02:05.800> in

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
for me the Kindle Fire really fits in

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.729 
for me the Kindle Fire really fits in
what<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:06.729> will<00:02:06.940> be<00:02:07.090> buying<00:02:07.300> however<00:02:07.750> is<00:02:08.020> one<00:02:08.649> of

what I will be buying however is one of

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.529 
what I will be buying however is one of
the<00:02:08.830> new<00:02:08.920> Amazon<00:02:09.340> Kindles<00:02:09.789> I<00:02:09.910> like<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.330> ones

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
the new Amazon Kindles I like the ones

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.070 
the new Amazon Kindles I like the ones
that<00:02:10.869> do<00:02:11.020> not<00:02:11.140> have<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.410> built-in<00:02:12.280> hardware

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
that do not have a built-in hardware

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.479 
that do not have a built-in hardware
keyboard<00:02:14.080> because<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:14.830> just<00:02:14.890> figured<00:02:15.280> what<00:02:15.400> I'm

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
keyboard because I just figured what I'm

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.830 
keyboard because I just figured what I'm
reading<00:02:15.640> books<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.239> don't<00:02:16.420> need<00:02:16.569> to<00:02:16.630> have<00:02:16.810> a

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
reading books I don't need to have a

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.180 
reading books I don't need to have a
keyboard<00:02:17.080> there<00:02:17.410> all<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.650> time<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.069> i'll

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
keyboard there all the time so i'll

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.030 
keyboard there all the time so i'll
probably<00:02:18.459> be<00:02:18.880> picking<00:02:19.239> up<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.830> amazon<00:02:20.830> kindle

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
probably be picking up the amazon kindle

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.850 
probably be picking up the amazon kindle
touch<00:02:21.459> 3g<00:02:22.090> version<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:23.440> think<00:02:23.590> that'll

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
touch 3g version and I think that'll

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.530 
touch 3g version and I think that'll
work<00:02:23.980> pretty<00:02:24.250> well<00:02:24.340> for<00:02:24.489> me<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.790> think<00:02:25.180> that's<00:02:25.480> a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
work pretty well for me I think that's a

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.479 
work pretty well for me I think that's a
good<00:02:25.630> idea<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.590> I'll<00:02:27.100> probably<00:02:27.220> be<00:02:27.430> getting

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
good idea and I'll probably be getting

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.570 
good idea and I'll probably be getting
the<00:02:27.700> one<00:02:27.820> with<00:02:28.019> that<00:02:29.019> has<00:02:29.200> ads<00:02:29.500> on<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.550> know

the one with that has ads on it you know

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.220 
the one with that has ads on it you know
ad-supported<00:02:31.090> because<00:02:31.570> that<00:02:31.660> was<00:02:31.810> cheaper

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
ad-supported because that was cheaper

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.220 
ad-supported because that was cheaper
