favorite<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.630> actually<00:00:30.779> think<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.890> worst

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
favorite I actually think it's the worst

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.220 
favorite I actually think it's the worst
assault<00:00:32.940> rifle<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.570> game<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.110> it's

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
assault rifle in this game and it's

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.319 
assault rifle in this game and it's
probably<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:35.460> probably<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.850> there<00:00:36.059> as<00:00:36.300> one

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
probably it's probably up there as one

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.540 
probably it's probably up there as one
of<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.930> worst<00:00:37.230> guns<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> game<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.399> my

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
of the worst guns in the game in my

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.040 
of the worst guns in the game in my
personal<00:00:38.820> opinion<00:00:39.090> they<00:00:39.540> might<00:00:39.750> be<00:00:39.899> your

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
personal opinion they might be your

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.470 
personal opinion they might be your
favor<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.590> my<00:00:40.739> beast<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:42.059> I

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
favor and you my beast with it but I

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.540 
favor and you my beast with it but I
just<00:00:43.290> didn't<00:00:43.649> need<00:00:43.739> something<00:00:44.040> about<00:00:44.129> this

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
just didn't need something about this

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.250 
just didn't need something about this
gun<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.969> doesn't<00:00:45.390> make<00:00:45.539> an<00:00:45.719> assault<00:00:46.110> rifle

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
gun that doesn't make an assault rifle

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.130 
gun that doesn't make an assault rifle
and<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.770> feels<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.309> lot<00:00:47.579> more<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:48.090> an<00:00:48.239> SMG<00:00:48.719> to

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
and it feels a lot more like an SMG to

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.869 
and it feels a lot more like an SMG to
me<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:49.500> when<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.800> try<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.129> pair<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.640> up<00:00:50.820> with

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
me but when you try and pair it up with

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.720 
me but when you try and pair it up with
SMG<00:00:51.420> type<00:00:51.809> catchments<00:00:52.559> such<00:00:53.250> as<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> laser

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
SMG type catchments such as the laser

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.930 
SMG type catchments such as the laser
sight<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.180> silencer<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.680> doesn't<00:00:55.949> feel

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
sight and silencer it just doesn't feel

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.540 
sight and silencer it just doesn't feel
right<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.449> know<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.039> I've<00:00:59.039> tried<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.370> make<00:00:59.520> it

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
right you know so I've tried to make it

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.490 
right you know so I've tried to make it
as<00:00:59.699> much<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.000> an<00:01:00.270> assault<00:01:00.570> rifle<00:01:00.629> as<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.320> by

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
as much as an assault rifle as I can by

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.290 
as much as an assault rifle as I can by
increasing<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.010> accuracy<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.640> stuff<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.120> it

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
increasing the accuracy and stuff of it

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.780 
increasing the accuracy and stuff of it
and<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.199> yeah<00:01:04.409> let's<00:01:04.619> get<00:01:04.769> into<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.129> skin<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.560 
got the m47 and the attachments we are
using<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.840> are<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.430> eotech<00:01:11.430> site<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:12.450> is

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
using on it are the eotech site this is

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.940 
using on it are the eotech site this is
like<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> holographic<00:01:13.229> sight<00:01:13.560> from<00:01:13.710> past

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
like the holographic sight from past

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.950 
like the holographic sight from past
games<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.790> felt<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.600> site

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
games and I just felt like this site

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.020 
games and I just felt like this site
just<00:01:16.439> made<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> most<00:01:17.220> accurate<00:01:17.460> could<00:01:17.909> be

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
just made it the most accurate could be

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.170 
just made it the most accurate could be
out<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> sites<00:01:18.810> out<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.700> mms<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
out of all the sites out of the mms the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.050 
out of all the sites out of the mms the
target<00:01:22.140> finder<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.619> red<00:01:22.920> door<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.909> those

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
target finder the red door all of those

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.960 
target finder the red door all of those
I<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.570> thought<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.200> attachment<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.580> itself

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
I just thought this attachment in itself

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.480 
I just thought this attachment in itself
made<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> gun<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:28.170> accurate<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.310> could

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
made the gun more accurate and I could

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.359 
made the gun more accurate and I could
get<00:01:29.700> them<00:01:29.790> talk<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.950> course<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
get them talk with it and of course the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.819 
get them talk with it and of course the
grip<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:33.180> gun<00:01:33.420> without<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.900> grip<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.560> I

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
grip this gun without the grip I just I

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.850 
grip this gun without the grip I just I
don't<00:01:35.060> find<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.270> usable<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.530> think<00:01:37.680> this

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
don't find it usable I really think this

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.560 
don't find it usable I really think this
gun<00:01:38.100> needs<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.549> grip<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:38.970> otherwise<00:01:39.270> it's

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
gun needs the grip or otherwise it's

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.590 
gun needs the grip or otherwise it's
bouncing<00:01:40.049> all<00:01:40.170> over<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> place<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:42.090> you

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
bouncing all over the place and you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.450 
bouncing all over the place and you
really<00:01:43.259> need<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.560> pair<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> grip<00:01:44.040> up<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
really need to pair the grip up with the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.880 
really need to pair the grip up with the
site<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:45.149> i<00:01:45.360> think<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> iron<00:01:46.470> sights<00:01:46.740> on

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
site because i think the iron sights on

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.090 
site because i think the iron sights on
this<00:01:47.040> are<00:01:47.250> really<00:01:47.520> really<00:01:48.119> bad<00:01:48.420> they<00:01:48.750> got<00:01:49.100> it's

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
this are really really bad they got it's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.280 
this are really really bad they got it's
not<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.520> worst<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.149> game<00:01:51.360> but<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.170> is

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
not the worst in the game but it is

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.929 
not the worst in the game but it is
certainly<00:01:52.710> not<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.979> best<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.579> game<00:01:53.729> so

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
certainly not the best in the game so

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.819 
certainly not the best in the game so

again of course engineers probably the

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.009 
again of course engineers probably the
best<00:03:05.099> part<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.579> use<00:03:05.760> with<00:03:06.000> assault<00:03:06.359> rifles<00:03:06.450> I

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
best part to use with assault rifles I

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.720 
best part to use with assault rifles I
don't<00:03:07.260> see<00:03:07.560> anything<00:03:07.950> else<00:03:08.250> being<00:03:08.459> very
