basic way of presenting constructions
around<00:02:26.210> gender<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.660> think<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:27.350> students

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
around gender and think that students

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.860 
around gender and think that students
older<00:02:28.220> than<00:02:28.400> grade<00:02:28.760> five<00:02:29.030> or<00:02:29.240> six<00:02:29.480> could

older than grade five or six could

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.180 
older than grade five or six could
handle<00:02:30.110> something<00:02:30.320> more<00:02:30.620> complex<00:02:30.950> or

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
handle something more complex or

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
male chauvinist is a bit of an old idea

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.720 
male chauvinist is a bit of an old idea
and<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.590> look<00:02:36.740> forward<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.160> reading<00:02:37.400> more<00:02:37.550> books
