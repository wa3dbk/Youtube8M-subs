00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.029 
of that with Zanna yes only I leave it
can<00:06:46.419> counter<00:06:46.750> it<00:06:46.780> by<00:06:46.900> deactivating<00:06:47.289> the<00:06:47.830> tower

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 
can counter it by deactivating the tower

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:49.649 
can counter it by deactivating the tower
that<00:06:48.280> it<00:06:48.400> uses<00:06:48.639> for<00:06:48.909> attacks<00:06:49.210> in<00:06:49.419> the<00:06:49.509> real

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:49.659 
that it uses for attacks in the real

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.020 
that it uses for attacks in the real
world<00:06:49.930> that's<00:06:50.919> great<00:06:51.280> what<00:06:51.909> about

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
world that's great what about

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.659 
world that's great what about
materializing<00:06:52.840> I<00:06:52.930> leader<00:06:53.169> I<00:06:53.439> could<00:06:54.099> do<00:06:54.219> it<00:06:54.250> but

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669 
materializing I leader I could do it but

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:57.209 
materializing I leader I could do it but
I<00:06:54.699> need<00:06:54.819> some<00:06:55.150> time<00:06:55.180> it's<00:06:55.810> dangerous<00:06:56.139> Vanek<00:06:57.099> an

00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:57.219 
I need some time it's dangerous Vanek an

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:58.950 
I need some time it's dangerous Vanek an
attack<00:06:57.490> at<00:06:57.669> any<00:06:57.819> moment<00:06:58.000> be<00:06:58.629> reasonable

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
attack at any moment be reasonable

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.140 
attack at any moment be reasonable
Jeremy<00:06:59.710> we<00:07:00.280> better<00:07:00.520> just<00:07:00.729> shut<00:07:00.819> this<00:07:01.090> thing

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
Jeremy we better just shut this thing

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.680 
Jeremy we better just shut this thing
down<00:07:03.000> listen<00:07:04.000> now<00:07:04.150> that<00:07:04.180> we<00:07:04.389> know<00:07:04.419> how<00:07:04.659> to

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:04.690 
down listen now that we know how to

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.540 
down listen now that we know how to
neutralize<00:07:04.930> them<00:07:05.530> we<00:07:06.009> just<00:07:06.219> have<00:07:06.310> to<00:07:06.400> get<00:07:06.490> I

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
neutralize them we just have to get I

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.610 
neutralize them we just have to get I
leave<00:07:06.759> it<00:07:06.849> to<00:07:06.940> the<00:07:07.030> activated<00:07:07.509> tower<00:07:07.690> hmm<00:07:08.139> we

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
leave it to the activated tower hmm we

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.990 
leave it to the activated tower hmm we
can<00:07:08.830> find<00:07:09.009> a<00:07:09.069> way<00:07:09.190> to<00:07:09.250> counter<00:07:09.610> the<00:07:09.729> attacks

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
can find a way to counter the attacks

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.309 
can find a way to counter the attacks
while<00:07:10.180> Einstein<00:07:10.419> figures<00:07:10.930> out<00:07:11.050> how<00:07:11.110> to<00:07:11.139> bring

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:11.319 
while Einstein figures out how to bring

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:15.959 
while Einstein figures out how to bring
Eileen<00:07:11.620> it<00:07:11.740> back<00:07:11.860> to<00:07:12.009> earth<00:07:12.129> right<00:07:14.460> it's<00:07:15.460> risky

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:15.969 
Eileen it back to earth right it's risky

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:18.029 
Eileen it back to earth right it's risky
but<00:07:16.150> I<00:07:16.719> think<00:07:16.900> we<00:07:16.990> should<00:07:17.229> after<00:07:17.680> all<00:07:17.800> we<00:07:18.009> are

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039 
but I think we should after all we are

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:21.809 
but I think we should after all we are
lyoko<00:07:18.580> warriors<00:07:18.969> aren't<00:07:19.180> we<00:07:19.300> yeah<00:07:20.580> you<00:07:21.580> really

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:21.819 
lyoko warriors aren't we yeah you really

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:23.640 
lyoko warriors aren't we yeah you really
think<00:07:22.180> you<00:07:22.270> can<00:07:22.419> do<00:07:22.599> it<00:07:22.629> they<00:07:23.139> don't<00:07:23.349> call<00:07:23.500> me

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:23.650 
think you can do it they don't call me

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.249 
think you can do it they don't call me
Einstein<00:07:23.830> for<00:07:24.279> nothing<00:07:24.550> in<00:07:25.210> a<00:07:25.360> few<00:07:25.539> weeks<00:07:25.569> I'll

00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:26.259 
Einstein for nothing in a few weeks I'll

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:27.899 
Einstein for nothing in a few weeks I'll
have<00:07:26.440> it<00:07:26.500> figured<00:07:26.650> out<00:07:26.830> meanwhile<00:07:27.370> let's<00:07:27.729> not

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:27.909 
have it figured out meanwhile let's not

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:30.209 
have it figured out meanwhile let's not
