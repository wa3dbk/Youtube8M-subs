 hello how are friends of advice 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.160
 imagen and humberto gutiérrez dotcom da 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.990
 nice to meet you guys 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.270
 I am humberto gutiérrez consultant in 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.699
 strategic public image and reputation 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.539
 online and today's video advice is 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:25.960
 about how to make the knot type 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.050
 of windsor tie we saw some ago 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.779
 days ago a few videos like we did the 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.940
 double tie knot and told them that 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.010
 I was going to be recommending how to do 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.590
 the different tie knots for 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.600
 different times today is the turn of the 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.460
 windsor knot that will start them 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.010
 advancing that is a much more knot 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.960
 complicated to do in fact I'm going 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.670
 advancing that do not wait for them to come out 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.710
 At first they do not expect that seeing the 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.420
 video they would do was the first as 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.990
 probably with some it happened to them with 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.510
 the double knot but it's going to be a video that 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.510
 they are going to have to stop constantly and 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.190
 it's going to have to be a lot of practice if 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.009
 you practice it, we will be able to do 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.150
 easy and fast but you have to be 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.560
 practicing 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.510
 It will consist of five steps 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.760
 specific that can be explained 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.860
 so you can carry it out but 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.140
 you need to stop stopping the video and 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.630
 practice and practice not 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.310
 wait until the first time and 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.800
 when you are going to use it, it is a knot 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.410
 which is considered very formal and very 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.450
 traditional some say that I no longer 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.670
 is using the windsor knot I would say 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.130
 that to me not personal is not the one that most 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.950
 like but of course you are using yes 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.850
 you go a government instance 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.280
 you will surely find that most 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.650
 of the knots are winston nothing but 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.140
 they lack some little details and touches 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.690
 so that this knot looks very good 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.430
 last one is going to help you fill the 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.130
 shirt collar when this is very 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.100
 open will help you fill it then 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.619
 let's see the steps to achieve it 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.000
 the first step will be to place the shovel 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:05.420
 narrower from the left side to exact 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.780
 on the left side just so that 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.540
 the narrowest blade or the smallest 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.340
 strip narrowest four button accounts 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.770
 more or less a little more of the room 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.000
 button and there you will place the most 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.760
 narrow step number two you're going to pass the 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.959
 thicker strip on the strip more 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.090
 narrowly giving it a small spin and the 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.630
 you are going to place in the hole that is 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.700
 between the tie and your face this hole 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.970
 that we are seeing there we are going to 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.069
 place the let's put in that little 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.500
 hollow and we will throw it until it is 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:47.100
 well placed precisely 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.010
 step number 3 let's move on from the other 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.980
 side the thick part to make 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.380
 exactly the same procedure as 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.420
 we just made the we're going to put in 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.730
 that gap that we are seeing that we 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.280
 it is being between the tie and the face 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.190
 and we're going to put it exactly the same as 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.070
 as we did with the previous shovel 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.110
 we place it and we are adjusting the 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.750
 so that the 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.520
 triangulito that will shape the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.730
 body tie knot 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:24.590
 step number 4 will turn it around 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.660
 in front of what we have of the knot and 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.500
 of having it and very well we are going to place 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.620
 a finger to give a second round 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.450
 on that finger that we have placed over 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.800
 what goes of the knot 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.710
 it's the second round 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.560
 leaving as last step go through 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.470
 under the gap that we had left 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.930
 he the space between the tie and the face 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.890
 what we have completely of the 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.890
 tie leaving it in the central part and 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.230
 adjusting the right where we left the finger 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.840
 put right where you have placed that 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.310
 finger you're going to start adjusting have a lot 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.320
 Beware of when you go down that 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.720
 go down right so that the knot 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.480
 go having the correct body and that 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.280
 have a lot of presence and finally nothing 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.290
 more we give the final touches to him 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.660
 we add this spoon that is a touch 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.630
 that gives a lot of elegance and we're going 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.390
 going up as you go up pulling the 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.700
 base of the knot and back of 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.460
 the tie of the narrowest part 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.710
 We are pulling until it is as we are 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.240
 like me I have a little more just to 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.930
 I like to make it tighter 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.580
 knot correctly placing the 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.110
 spoon look how with the touches 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.300
 final our knot is ready 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.860
 and well then there was the knot of 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.190
 tie look like when we put him 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.740
 He took out his handkerchief and so on, because he looked very 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.980
 well it 's a knot that helps us look 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.920
 extremely formal and communicate something very 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.780
