00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
how the heck do you create something

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.359 
how the heck do you create something
like<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.109> instead<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.859> know<00:00:31.920> answer

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
like this so instead of you know answer

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.940 
like this so instead of you know answer
everyone's<00:00:32.850> post<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:34.350> know<00:00:34.469> going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.829> a

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
everyone's post and you know going to a

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.590 
everyone's post and you know going to a
long<00:00:35.130> explanation<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.940> figured<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.480> would<00:00:36.570> be

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
long explanation I figured it would be

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.229 
long explanation I figured it would be
easier<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.350> better<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.579> make<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.090> know

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
easier and better just to make you know

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.780 
easier and better just to make you know
a<00:00:39.270> tutorial<00:00:39.719> series<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.350> then<00:00:40.500> everyone<00:00:40.950> can

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
a tutorial series so then everyone can

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.130 
a tutorial series so then everyone can
learn<00:00:42.059> how<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.300> make<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.809> second<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.079> all

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
learn how to make it and second of all

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.450 
learn how to make it and second of all
like<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.440> said<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:43.739> going<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.890> be<00:00:43.980> open<00:00:44.309> source

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
like I said it's going to be open source

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.670 
like I said it's going to be open source
eventually<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.329> then<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> little<00:00:46.530> bit

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
eventually so then you have a little bit

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.500 
eventually so then you have a little bit
better<00:00:46.980> understanding<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> code<00:00:48.270> so

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
better understanding of the code so

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.479 
better understanding of the code so
let's<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.379> ahead<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.680> take<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> tour<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.340> it

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
let's go ahead and take the tour of it

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.240 
let's go ahead and take the tour of it
right<00:00:50.700> now<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.719> what<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.039> it's

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
right now so what this is is it's

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.810 
right now so what this is is it's
basically<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:54.260> toolbar<00:00:55.370> similar<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.610> Windows

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
basically a toolbar similar to Windows

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.670

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
course we're not on working in here we

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.200 
course we're not on working in here we
need<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:24.020> add<00:05:24.110> all<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:24.560> HTML<00:05:25.010> elements<00:05:25.610> for

need to add all the HTML elements for
the<00:05:26.330> footer<00:05:26.600> but<00:05:27.320> before<00:05:27.800> I<00:05:27.830> do<00:05:28.040> that<00:05:28.220> I<00:05:28.670> think

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
the footer but before I do that I think

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.640 
the footer but before I do that I think
it's<00:05:29.450> going<00:05:29.600> to<00:05:29.630> be<00:05:29.750> easier<00:05:30.110> if<00:05:30.170> I<00:05:30.440> actually

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
it's going to be easier if I actually

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.390 
it's going to be easier if I actually
show<00:05:31.460> you<00:05:31.520> guys<00:05:31.670> exactly<00:05:32.480> how<00:05:32.960> to<00:05:33.350> style<00:05:33.890> this

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
footer first because if I don't do that
