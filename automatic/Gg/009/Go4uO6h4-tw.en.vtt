00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.420
 our common project performance here seven times 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.540
 at the time 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.540
 name at the moment 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.130
 or you will do 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.870
 4 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.120
 the hollow 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.200
 ae 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.450
 ef 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.440
 so now I'll show you 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.140
 because I wanted to impose second work any sheet of paper more than seven 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.740
 times 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.740
 the first time you do not approve the stage 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.370
 first time 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.560
 going up 2 to 1 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.560
 arrived at 2 two sheets of paper 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.090
 the second time 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.090
 these two raised to 2 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.640
 four sheets of paper 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.640
 the third time 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.320
 the s2 raised to 3 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.000
 eight sheets of paper 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.150
 fourth time 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
 but if two high 4 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.660
 I have 16 sheets of paper 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
 who also 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.490
 two high 5 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.490
 thirty-two sheets of paper 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.230
 it's strange 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.149
 in 2000 is one of the six 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:16.149
 sixty-four sheets of paper 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.389
 it was not clear 3 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.919
 the two right lifts 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.669
 128 sheets of paper 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.569
 this means that when you try to double the eighth time 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.609
 or else you're trying to reach between 28 because paper is impossible 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.929
 someone has to be very strong to get double 128 was special 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:45.429
 a chance like this that you even the monologue 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.459
 diego 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:58.399
 benign 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.269
 delivered in June 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.809
 like this
