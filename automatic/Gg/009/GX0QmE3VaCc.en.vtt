years<00:00:33.879> ago<00:00:34.210> and<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.980> decided<00:00:36.640> to<00:00:37.150> start<00:00:37.480> using

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
years ago and I decided to start using

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.850 
years ago and I decided to start using
it<00:00:37.989> again<00:00:38.580> but<00:00:39.580> I<00:00:39.790> wanted<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:40.840> bigger<00:00:41.199> coil<00:00:41.590> this

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
is the standard normal coil I think it's

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.670

the<00:01:20.200> right<00:01:20.440> washers<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:22.770> need<00:01:23.770> some<00:01:24.009> washers

00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:24.459 
the right washers I need some washers

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:28.499 
the right washers I need some washers
with<00:01:26.039> holes<00:01:27.039> in<00:01:27.310> them<00:01:27.520> because<00:01:27.940> you<00:01:28.090> can<00:01:28.270> see

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
with holes in them because you can see

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.029 
with holes in them because you can see
in<00:01:28.720> you<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.950> lower<00:01:30.190> stem<00:01:30.929> has<00:01:31.929> free<00:01:32.440> little

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
in you the lower stem has free little

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
down so I realized that I didn't have to

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.699 
down so I realized that I didn't have to
write<00:01:44.020> washer<00:01:44.950> so<00:01:45.539> as<00:01:46.539> soon<00:01:46.840> as<00:01:47.080> I<00:01:47.229> have<00:01:47.440> those

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:53.570 
write washer so as soon as I have those
washers<00:01:48.160> I<00:01:48.429> can<00:01:49.200> try<00:01:50.200> out<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:51.160> new<00:01:51.369> big<00:01:51.910> coil

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
washers I can try out the new big coil

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.490 
washers I can try out the new big coil
okay<00:01:54.580> until<00:01:56.160> my<00:01:57.160> next<00:01:57.220> video<00:01:58.060> bye<00:01:59.020> from<00:01:59.380> the
