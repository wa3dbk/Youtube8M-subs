00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.370
 the 87 colima and he wants his people I 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.650
 I value a lot to 8 in his way of working 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.539
 to the pending of the people who 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.970
 they work with him is a very person 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.619
 cheerful that is humble who is responsible 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.900
 and what I liked all my life is 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.670
 trade we consolidate a store 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.050
 the oldest in colima we have a 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.610
 important number people who work for 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.860
 us the business that originally 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.930
 we left my dad became several 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.369
 companies a friend of mine who was president 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.899
 from the Hill Chamber of Commerce and 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.180
 He invited me to be a counselor and that's where I started 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.609
 get involved in in the sector part 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.350
 already formal business to try to 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.820
 contribute from that way something for the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.980
 small and medium- sized merchants 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.440
 colima and being there a friend me a 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.480
 invites to be mayor candidate of colima 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.999
 and I started like this when everything was in 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.100
 against when it seemed that impossible 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:55.050
 that I won the mayoralty of colima in 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.749
 that moment I arrived at the town hall 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.710
 colima to try to rescue the best of 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:00.989
 the people who were in the town hall 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.239
 of workers give them the value that 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.799
 had I paid attention in the parts where 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.020
 could see the important leaks of 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.270
 resources and at the end of the road I go back to 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.070
 that formula that allowed us to leave a 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.200
 administration sinde 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.729
 so that whoever came after 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.530
 had to face the problems that 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.090
 we faced and could follow him 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.979
 responding to ciudanos regardless 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.800
 the color that was the one that came back 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.600
 because on that political issue for 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.610
 I was always interested in people 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.340
 well in his career as president 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.710
 municipal played very well his position 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.900
 He never had to City Hall debt 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.259
 It was always a person who was 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.330
 so much 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.460
 that is to say that it is necessary that it should be 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.229
 pay that he was an excellent person who 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.030
 is a citizen more is always going to 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.759

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.630
 The main strength is love for 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.640
 colima for the family the strength of the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.649

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.670

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.140
