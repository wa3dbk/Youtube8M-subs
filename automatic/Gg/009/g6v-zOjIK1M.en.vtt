I'm Tracy Franklin and I just completed
fix<00:02:08.789> sewing<00:02:09.119> machines<00:02:09.450> Institute<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.800> we

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
fix sewing machines Institute and we

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.720 
fix sewing machines Institute and we
learned<00:02:11.610> about<00:02:12.350> mechanical<00:02:13.350> machines<00:02:13.730> and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
learned about mechanical machines and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.500 
learned about mechanical machines and
their<00:02:14.910> properties<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.690> how<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.670> diagnose<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
their properties and how to diagnose the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.020 
their properties and how to diagnose the
different<00:02:19.140> issues<00:02:19.380> on<00:02:19.560> those<00:02:19.769> then<00:02:20.700> we<00:02:20.819> moved

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
different issues on those then we moved

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.860 
different issues on those then we moved
on<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.599> computerized<00:02:22.500> machines<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.870> having

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
on to computerized machines and having

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.590 
on to computerized machines and having
the<00:02:24.959> hands-on<00:02:25.530> rather<00:02:26.340> than<00:02:26.730> just<00:02:27.120> seeing

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
the hands-on rather than just seeing

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.830 
the hands-on rather than just seeing
that<00:02:27.810> as<00:02:28.019> an<00:02:28.200> online<00:02:28.590> course<00:02:28.799> is<00:02:29.340> invaluable

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
that as an online course is invaluable

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.300 
that as an online course is invaluable
it<00:02:30.840> really<00:02:31.110> made<00:02:31.500> all<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.830> difference<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
it really made all the difference in the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.850 
it really made all the difference in the
world<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:32.940> then<00:02:33.569> we<00:02:33.690> moved<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.260> sergers

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
world and then we moved on to sergers

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.370 
world and then we moved on to sergers
and<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:35.880> feel<00:02:36.090> like<00:02:36.330> after<00:02:36.780> taking<00:02:37.019> this<00:02:37.319> course

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
and I feel like after taking this course

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.350 
and I feel like after taking this course
that<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.010> can<00:02:38.370> do<00:02:38.459> all<00:02:38.610> three<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.910> those<00:02:39.030> with

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
that I can do all three of those with

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.870 
that I can do all three of those with
complete<00:02:39.750> confidence<00:02:40.200> by<00:02:41.130> just<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.549> timing

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
complete confidence by just the timing

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.120 
complete confidence by just the timing
belt<00:02:42.000> what<00:02:42.209> do<00:02:42.269> I<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:43.730> feed<00:02:44.730> on<00:02:44.910> timing<00:02:45.239> and

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
belt what do I just feed on timing and

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.979 
belt what do I just feed on timing and
anything<00:02:47.130> else<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:48.180> secret<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:48.780> this

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
anything else so the secret on this

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.140 
anything else so the secret on this
machine<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:50.010> if<00:02:50.340> we're<00:02:50.519> looking<00:02:50.549> at<00:02:50.970> the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
machine is that if we're looking at the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.600 
machine is that if we're looking at the
hook<00:02:51.330> assembly<00:02:51.900> there<00:02:52.709> should<00:02:53.040> be<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> dot

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
hook assembly there should be a dot

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.289 
hook assembly there should be a dot
right<00:02:54.030> here<00:02:55.130> this<00:02:56.130> dot<00:02:56.519> right<00:02:56.850> here<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:57.180> the

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
right here this dot right here in the

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.289 
right here this dot right here in the
hook<00:02:57.560> as<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.650> ties<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.190> timing<00:02:59.700> mark<00:02:59.850> right<00:03:00.090> there

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
hook as a ties a timing mark right there

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.720 
hook as a ties a timing mark right there
the<00:03:00.840> dot<00:03:01.049> should<00:03:01.320> face<00:03:01.500> forward<00:03:02.040> towards<00:03:02.519> you

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
the dot should face forward towards you

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.360 
the dot should face forward towards you
then<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.870> stroke<00:03:04.140> crank<00:03:04.500> at<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.709> top<00:03:05.010> has<00:03:05.340> a

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
then the stroke crank at the top has a

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.400 
then the stroke crank at the top has a
large<00:03:05.640> screwed<00:03:06.030> right<00:03:06.060> here<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:07.079> should

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
large screwed right here that should

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.949 
large screwed right here that should
face<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.859> all<00:03:08.070> so<00:03:08.370> once<00:03:09.269> you<00:03:09.359> put<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.660> in<00:03:09.780> they

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
face you all so once you put it in they

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.680 
face you all so once you put it in they
should<00:03:10.140> line<00:03:10.320> up<00:03:10.350> perfect<00:03:10.950> but<00:03:11.640> what<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.450> deal

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
should line up perfect but what the deal

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.830 
should line up perfect but what the deal
is<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:13.459> v-dog<00:03:14.459> timing<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.450> need<00:03:15.600> more<00:03:15.780> time

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
is is v-dog timing to need more time

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.310 
is is v-dog timing to need more time
okay<00:03:17.000> that's<00:03:18.000> where<00:03:18.299> we<00:03:18.420> reference<00:03:18.810> first<00:03:19.049> if

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
okay that's where we reference first if
