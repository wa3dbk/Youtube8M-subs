dangerous<00:02:07.400> way<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.610> doing<00:02:07.820> about<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.030> lot<00:02:08.149> of

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
dangerous way of doing about a lot of

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.369 
dangerous way of doing about a lot of
people<00:02:08.330> say<00:02:08.629> actually<00:02:08.810> gets<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.170> best

people say actually gets the best
performance<00:02:09.679> increase<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:10.340> I'm<00:02:10.519> going<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.700> go

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
performance increase so I'm going to go

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.979 
performance increase so I'm going to go
through<00:02:10.939> it<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.180> interest<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.569> fairness<00:02:11.750> and

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
through it and interest of fairness and

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.460 
through it and interest of fairness and
that's<00:02:12.830> basically<00:02:13.099> to<00:02:13.670> stop<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.260> plist<00:02:15.260> file

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
of much more can be done on the device

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.290 
of much more can be done on the device
eventually<00:03:10.250> got<00:03:10.520> no<00:03:10.700> jailbreak<00:03:11.090> even

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300

checked on but on a 3g particular if you

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.920 
checked on but on a 3g particular if you
don't<00:03:27.470> use<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.770> these<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:28.630> do<00:03:29.630> something

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
don't use the these and do something

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.620 
don't use the these and do something
called<00:03:30.080> indexing<00:03:30.650> which<00:03:31.280> creates<00:03:31.610> a<00:03:31.880> space

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
called indexing which creates a space

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
and B requires memory so what you can do

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.860 
and B requires memory so what you can do
on<00:03:36.830> your<00:03:36.890> 3g<00:03:37.250> simply<00:03:37.940> click<00:03:38.120> them<00:03:38.330> turn<00:03:38.780> them

at 620 now you may think why is this and

the answer is twofold it's a battery
life<00:05:40.580> and<00:05:40.699> B<00:05:40.969> and<00:05:41.240> heat<00:05:41.750> if<00:05:42.680> you<00:05:42.889> run<00:05:43.070> the

life and B and heat if you run the

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.730 
life and B and heat if you run the
processor<00:05:43.340> at<00:05:43.669> full<00:05:43.820> speed<00:05:44.060> you<00:05:44.810> will<00:05:45.169> use

expectancy<00:06:13.849> because<00:06:14.060> phones<00:06:14.300> don't<00:06:14.479> last

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
expectancy because phones don't last

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.399 
expectancy because phones don't last

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:20.770 
forever and if you lash our full power
you'll<00:06:18.919> kill<00:06:19.069> it<00:06:19.130> quicker<00:06:19.490> so<00:06:20.419> the<00:06:20.479> probably<00:06:20.750> a

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
you'll kill it quicker so the probably a

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.680 
you'll kill it quicker so the probably a
fair<00:06:20.900> thing<00:06:21.020> to<00:06:21.080> say<00:06:21.229> about<00:06:21.289> that<00:06:21.409> and<00:06:22.690> once

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
fair thing to say about that and once

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.240 
fair thing to say about that and once
again<00:06:23.780> these<00:06:23.930> things<00:06:24.139> are<00:06:24.289> any<00:06:24.469> last<00:06:24.919> resorts

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250
