00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:12.830
 then today we talk about how to use the 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:24.090
 digital optical output but cupro la 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:27.920
 version 10.8 we are now sounding now 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.920
 enough with the internal speakers 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:50.719
 what do we need an optical cable 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:57.270
 of a system that can be connected and then 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:01.350
 this one is dated by three kings jacks and 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:06.680
 half in front there is the protection or a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.680
 sack protects me 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:25.079
 collect this must be inserted so and goes 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:53.409
 it should be placed on the headphone inputs and the 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:57.240
 cube your system automatically 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.369
 this is the sound panel in 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.750
 preferences that if we go outside out 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:16.780
 the thesis sound output to hesitate 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:22.840
 turn on the receiver I do 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:26.380
 see use both heaven and not play 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.930
 almost because otherwise don play stops us 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.930
 on Youtube 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:44.680
 output goes to maximum because if I touch 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.680
 if I tokyo 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:56.150
 if I shortly after his keyboards turn up 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:09.620
 passing volume tells me that it aroused to the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:15.800
 very practical maximum with the plant is 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:22.880
 working the storm that is working in 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:28.880
 digital I confirm that we are 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:32.240
 working in digital the output is only 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:37.210
 that if you want, I turn it off and on 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.210
 we turn on minimum volume 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.530
 now it must be done by digital change 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.500
 this is who he wanted 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:24.000
 v de baile on 10 221k that's all 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:32.310
 if you have another system just go 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:37.820
 on preferences preferences and audio output 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:42.570
 digital magician system here 10.8 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:50.400
 automatically when it came out it didn't 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:52.760
 can modify input groff it is if 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.760
 all
