00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 to 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.340
 Nokia released the 4g version of its 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.219
 economic lumia 630 and now available 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.110
 in the USA with the same name but number 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.000
 different hello how are you I'm vanessa 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.770
 hand orellana for thinner in Spanish and 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.609
 Today I have the first look at the Nokia 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.640
 Lumia 635 already watched my video of Lumia 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.339
 630 this will seem like a replica of almost 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.300
 exact unlike the umÃ­a 630 that 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:36.070
 only comes with data service 13 this one 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.100
 635 comes with the service capacity 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.380
 4g lte and that's why you'll have to pay a 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.720
 little else is a major improvement if you 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.760
 what you are looking for is faster service but 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.860
 the change negatively affects the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.960
 duration of the battery that I hold less 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.970
 in our tests now I show you 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.800
 the characteristics that you share with 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.050
 his twin brother does not have a very 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.180
 premium but the design is fun and 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.100
 As with the 630 you can change the 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.800
 plastic cover in white like 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.780
 come here to more vivid colors and to be 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.640
 of plastic feels quite light and 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.060
 compact in my hands has a screen 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.870
 4.5 inches with mediocre resolution 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.240
 of 854 x 480 pixels 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.640
 good contrast and brightness but you can not see 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.710
 very clear the image and when turning it 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.460
 I show you the 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.840
 without flash that also records video in 720p 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.730
 in my tests the photos appeared 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.860
 quite sharp with good contrast and 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.800
 color but it took to focus between 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.420
 shots like the 630 plus that 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.250
 does not come with front camera that I 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.710
 it seems a great disadvantage if you want 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.480
 make video calls comes inside 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.820
 with a quad-core processor and 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.220
 1.2 gigahertz that is not the fastest 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.830
 but powerful enough to 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.210
 perform basic tasks an advantage 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.800
 is that it comes with the most recent version 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.220
 of the microsoft operating system 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.050
 windows phones 8.1 will notice the shortcut of 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.240
 functions when swiping down on the 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.890
 screen and other details like the photo 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.960
 background that can be changed to 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.390
 customize in your start tray 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.550
 Another function added by Nokia is that of 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.350
 mix video that allows you to stream 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.020
 free of your playlists 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.970
 without ads but the disadvantage is that 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.340
 windows still does not offer the variety of 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.830
 ios or android applications and many 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.620
 sometimes it takes to offer the apps this 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.540
 Nokia Lumia 635 comes with 8 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.129
 bytes of internal storage and the 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.400
 option to add more with a card 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.230
 microsd like you too 630 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.060
 I recommend taking a look at the engine and 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.580
 of Motorola with similar processor and 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.620
 price but with better screen and system 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.590
 operative android can read the review
