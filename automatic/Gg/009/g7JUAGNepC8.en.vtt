00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.639 
something I really like about this light
that<00:01:45.030> not<00:01:45.390> too<00:01:45.689> many<00:01:45.869> old<00:01:46.049> lights<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.470> don't

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
that not too many old lights I don't

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.280 
that not too many old lights I don't
think<00:01:46.860> are<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.820> has<00:01:48.090> an<00:01:48.299> IP<00:01:48.570> x8

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
think are is that it has an IP x8

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.580 
think are is that it has an IP x8

mean<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.560> light<00:01:55.799> like<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.460> were<00:01:56.549> to

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
mean a light like this if I were to

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.670 
mean a light like this if I were to
shine<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.939> under<00:01:57.090> water<00:01:57.299> holy<00:01:57.869> cow<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.320> would<00:01:58.530> be

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
shine it under water holy cow I would be

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.580 
shine it under water holy cow I would be

in here this is the pre xml2 LED and

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.660 
in here this is the pre xml2 LED and
they've<00:02:16.990> done<00:02:17.200> something<00:02:17.640> different<00:02:18.640> with

they've done something different with

they've done something different with
this<00:02:18.970> they've<00:02:19.180> actually<00:02:19.450> D<00:02:20.110> domed<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.010> a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
this they've actually D domed it and a

lot of flashlight modifications people

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.150 
lot of flashlight modifications people
go<00:02:24.760> out<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:24.940> de<00:02:25.450> dôme<00:02:25.690> their<00:02:26.050> light<00:02:26.350> so<00:02:27.040> they

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
go out and de dôme their light so they

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.480 
go out and de dôme their light so they
can<00:02:27.340> get<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:27.750> throw<00:02:28.750> distance<00:02:29.290> that's<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.920> lot

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
can get a throw distance that's a lot

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.280 
can get a throw distance that's a lot
further<00:02:30.850> than<00:02:31.570> if<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.840> were<00:02:31.960> to<00:02:32.080> have<00:02:32.230> that

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
further than if you were to have that

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.410 
further than if you were to have that
dome<00:02:32.710> on<00:02:32.950> there<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.550> what<00:02:33.700> old<00:02:33.940> light<00:02:34.210> has

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
dome on there so what old light has

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.790 
dome on there so what old light has
actually<00:02:34.810> done<00:02:34.990> they've<00:02:35.170> taken<00:02:35.380> into<00:02:35.680> their

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
actually done they've taken into their

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.050 
actually done they've taken into their
own<00:02:35.920> hands<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.340> they<00:02:36.400> said<00:02:36.640> hey<00:02:36.760> we're<00:02:36.940> gonna

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
own hands and they said hey we're gonna

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.910 
own hands and they said hey we're gonna
remove<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.450> for<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.320> give<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:38.860> just

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
remove that for you and give you just

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.250 
remove that for you and give you just
this<00:02:39.310> killer<00:02:39.610> throw<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:40.540> if<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.780> look<00:02:40.960> real

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
this killer throw so if you look real

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260 
this killer throw so if you look real
closely<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.890> there<00:02:42.070> you<00:02:42.190> can<00:02:42.430> there's<00:02:42.790> no<00:02:42.970> dome

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
closely in there you can there's no dome

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.870 
closely in there you can there's no dome
on<00:02:43.540> there<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:43.930> with<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.560> dome<00:02:44.860> not<00:02:45.580> having

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
on there and with that dome not having

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.480 
on there and with that dome not having
that<00:02:46.000> dome<00:02:46.300> you<00:02:46.510> can<00:02:46.660> see<00:02:46.900> when<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.770> are<00:02:48.010> close

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
that dome you can see when you are close

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.610 
that dome you can see when you are close
up<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:49.030> maybe<00:02:49.180> like<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.390> wall<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:50.260> can<00:02:50.410> see<00:02:50.590> a

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
up to maybe like a wall you can see a

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.230 
up to maybe like a wall you can see a
little<00:02:50.800> circle<00:02:51.280> in<00:02:51.430> there<00:02:51.580> right<00:02:51.970> there<00:02:52.150> in

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
little circle in there right there in

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.090 
little circle in there right there in
the<00:02:52.330> middle<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.690> hot<00:02:52.870> spot<00:02:53.200> but<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.860> goes

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
the middle of a hot spot but that goes

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.820 
the middle of a hot spot but that goes
away<00:02:54.280> when<00:02:54.790> you're<00:02:54.910> probably<00:02:55.330> about<00:02:55.570> two<00:02:56.500> feet

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
away when you're probably about two feet

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.490 
away when you're probably about two feet
away<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.880> that<00:02:57.910> will<00:02:58.420> disappear<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.350> like<00:02:59.470> I

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
away so that will disappear and like I

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.740 
away so that will disappear and like I
said<00:02:59.650> this<00:02:59.980> thing<00:03:00.040> just<00:03:00.520> throws<00:03:01.300> it's

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
said this thing just throws it's

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.520 
said this thing just throws it's
ridiculous<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.940> know<00:03:03.970> just<00:03:04.330> how<00:03:04.480> far<00:03:04.930> this

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
ridiculous you know just how far this

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.640 
ridiculous you know just how far this
reaches<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:07.660> has<00:03:07.810> three<00:03:08.080> different<00:03:08.440> modes

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
reaches this has three different modes

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.970 
reaches this has three different modes
mode<00:03:09.010> one<00:03:09.310> being<00:03:09.870> 1020<00:03:10.870> lumens<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.710> that<00:03:11.860> will

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
mode one being 1020 lumens and that will

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.330 
mode one being 1020 lumens and that will
last<00:03:12.130> about<00:03:12.400> 60<00:03:12.880> minutes<00:03:13.090> mode<00:03:13.600> 2<00:03:13.870> is<00:03:14.340> 250

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
last about 60 minutes mode 2 is 250

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.880 
last about 60 minutes mode 2 is 250
lumens<00:03:15.550> and<00:03:15.970> that's<00:03:16.420> at<00:03:16.600> 180<00:03:17.290> minutes<00:03:17.709> and

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
lumens and that's at 180 minutes and

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.190 
lumens and that's at 180 minutes and
then<00:03:18.400> we<00:03:18.520> have<00:03:18.700> mode<00:03:18.970> 3<00:03:19.360> which<00:03:19.630> is<00:03:19.780> only<00:03:19.930> 20

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
then we have mode 3 which is only 20

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.860 
then we have mode 3 which is only 20
lumens<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:21.250> that's<00:03:21.400> about<00:03:21.580> a<00:03:21.640> runtime<00:03:22.209> of<00:03:22.420> 30

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
lumens and that's about a runtime of 30

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.970 
lumens and that's about a runtime of 30
hours<00:03:23.500> so<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.459> also<00:03:24.610> has<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:25.000> strobe<00:03:25.660> for<00:03:26.170> safety

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
hours so it also has a strobe for safety

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.220 
hours so it also has a strobe for safety
or<00:03:27.220> just<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.790> blind<00:03:28.120> someone<00:03:28.450> so<00:03:28.959> real<00:03:29.110> quick

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
or just to blind someone so real quick

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.690 
or just to blind someone so real quick
let's<00:03:29.260> go<00:03:29.470> through<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.830> interface<00:03:30.490> of<00:03:30.520> the

let's go through the interface of the

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.150 
let's go through the interface of the
light<00:03:30.940> we<00:03:31.180> have<00:03:31.209> detail<00:03:31.900> cap<00:03:32.170> here<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.830> we<00:03:32.950> can

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
light we have detail cap here and we can

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.150 
light we have detail cap here and we can
either<00:03:33.370> momentary<00:03:34.060> press<00:03:34.590> or<00:03:35.590> we<00:03:35.770> can<00:03:35.920> full

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
either momentary press or we can full

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.550 
either momentary press or we can full
click<00:03:36.459> those<00:03:37.360> are<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:37.660> options<00:03:37.840> basically

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
click those are the options basically

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.920 
click those are the options basically
now<00:03:39.010> if<00:03:39.160> we<00:03:39.310> do<00:03:39.490> a<00:03:39.520> double<00:03:40.920> like<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:42.840> it'll<00:03:43.840> go

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
now if we do a double like that it'll go

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.949 
now if we do a double like that it'll go
straight<00:03:44.320> to<00:03:44.470> high<00:03:44.850> or<00:03:45.850> will<00:03:46.150> just<00:03:46.360> go<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.510> low

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
straight to high or will just go to low

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.199 
straight to high or will just go to low
and<00:03:47.440> this<00:03:47.560> does<00:03:47.770> have<00:03:47.980> memory<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:48.730> let's<00:03:48.910> say

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
and this does have memory so let's say

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.850 
and this does have memory so let's say
I'm<00:03:49.780> on<00:03:50.110> high<00:03:50.560> here<00:03:52.170> it'll<00:03:53.170> go<00:03:53.350> back<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.650> high

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
I'm on high here it'll go back to high

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.400 
I'm on high here it'll go back to high
now<00:03:54.459> once<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:55.060> light<00:03:55.239> is<00:03:55.390> actually<00:03:55.600> on<00:03:56.110> it

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
now once the light is actually on it

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.590 
now once the light is actually on it
integrated<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.370> right<00:03:57.640> in<00:03:57.760> here<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.330> front

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
integrated it right in here to the front

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.880 
integrated it right in here to the front
you<00:03:59.200> turn<00:03:59.530> it<00:03:59.770> and<00:04:00.630> go<00:04:01.630> through<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.500> different

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
you turn it and go through the different

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.940 
you turn it and go through the different
modes<00:04:03.130> it's<00:04:03.880> just<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.360> real<00:04:04.870> fine<00:04:05.170> movement<00:04:05.739> and

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
modes it's just a real fine movement and

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.520 
modes it's just a real fine movement and
you<00:04:06.370> twist<00:04:06.790> left<00:04:07.060> and<00:04:07.300> then<00:04:07.420> right<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:07.959> what

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
you twist left and then right and what

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.410 
you twist left and then right and what
I'm<00:04:08.620> actually<00:04:08.800> twisting<00:04:09.459> here<00:04:09.700> it's<00:04:09.880> twisting

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
I'm actually twisting here it's twisting

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.979 
I'm actually twisting here it's twisting
right<00:04:10.780> at<00:04:11.080> where<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.820> unscrews<00:04:12.820> to<00:04:13.630> take<00:04:13.810> out

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
right at where it unscrews to take out

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.500 
right at where it unscrews to take out
the<00:04:14.140> battery

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
the battery

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.360 
the battery
okay<00:04:15.900> I<00:04:16.049> pulled<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.530> out<00:04:16.769> just<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.130> show<00:04:17.310> you

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
okay I pulled that out just to show you

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.229 
okay I pulled that out just to show you
real<00:04:17.669> quick<00:04:18.380> okay<00:04:19.579> so<00:04:20.579> that's<00:04:20.790> where<00:04:21.090> it's

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
real quick okay so that's where it's

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.580 
real quick okay so that's where it's
actually<00:04:21.600> gonna<00:04:21.720> screw<00:04:21.989> when<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.169> first<00:04:22.440> got

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
actually gonna screw when I first got

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.040 
actually gonna screw when I first got
this<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:23.070> was<00:04:23.550> like<00:04:23.699> hmm<00:04:24.060> am<00:04:24.479> I<00:04:24.570> gonna<00:04:24.690> move<00:04:24.870> it

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
this I was like hmm am I gonna move it

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.840 
this I was like hmm am I gonna move it
up<00:04:25.169> here<00:04:25.199> down<00:04:25.650> there<00:04:25.889> but<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:26.639> actually

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
up here down there but it's actually

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.700 
up here down there but it's actually
just<00:04:27.330> this<00:04:27.540> part<00:04:27.840> right<00:04:27.960> here<00:04:28.020> so<00:04:28.320> I'll<00:04:28.440> screw

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
just this part right here so I'll screw

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.760 
just this part right here so I'll screw
it<00:04:28.740> all<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:28.949> way<00:04:29.040> down<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:30.020> then<00:04:31.020> you<00:04:31.320> can<00:04:31.530> see

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
it all the way down and then you can see

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.460 
it all the way down and then you can see
I<00:04:32.040> can<00:04:32.340> go<00:04:32.370> through<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:33.900> three<00:04:34.169> different

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
I can go through the three different

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.820 
I can go through the three different
settings<00:04:34.760> now<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:35.820> get<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.210> strobe<00:04:36.660> you<00:04:37.560> want

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
settings now to get the strobe you want

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.810 
settings now to get the strobe you want
to<00:04:38.070> triple<00:04:38.729> tap<00:04:39.590> like<00:04:40.590> that<00:04:42.110> okay<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.699> you<00:04:44.699> got

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
to triple tap like that okay and you got

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.529 
to triple tap like that okay and you got
the<00:04:45.000> strobe<00:04:45.650> so<00:04:47.000> those<00:04:48.000> are<00:04:48.150> basically<00:04:48.270> the

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
the strobe so those are basically the

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.689 
the strobe so those are basically the
lights<00:04:49.380> like<00:04:49.710> I<00:04:49.830> said<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.220> can<00:04:50.520> just

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
lights like I said you can just

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.540 
lights like I said you can just
momentary<00:04:51.389> or<00:04:51.900> you<00:04:52.110> can<00:04:52.320> DoubleTap<00:04:52.800> momentary

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
momentary or you can DoubleTap momentary

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.790 
momentary or you can DoubleTap momentary
for<00:04:53.940> bright<00:04:54.240> or<00:04:54.750> you<00:04:54.960> can<00:04:55.139> triple<00:04:55.470> tap

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
for bright or you can triple tap

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.180 
for bright or you can triple tap
momentary<00:04:56.430> for<00:04:56.669> strobe<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.410> like<00:04:58.410> I<00:04:58.500> said<00:04:58.560> no

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
momentary for strobe and like I said no

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.469 
momentary for strobe and like I said no
matter<00:04:59.430> what<00:05:00.500> setting<00:05:01.500> it's<00:05:01.770> in<00:05:01.979> so<00:05:02.970> say<00:05:03.150> I<00:05:03.180> had

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
matter what setting it's in so say I had

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.659 
matter what setting it's in so say I had
it<00:05:03.510> in<00:05:04.639> low<00:05:05.639> here<00:05:06.000> when<00:05:06.300> I<00:05:06.330> turned<00:05:06.630> it<00:05:06.720> off<00:05:07.669> back

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
it in low here when I turned it off back

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.300 
it in low here when I turned it off back
on<00:05:08.850> it<00:05:09.600> will<00:05:09.690> be<00:05:09.840> in<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.080> low<00:05:10.260> not<00:05:11.100> a<00:05:11.130> nice

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
on it will be in the low not a nice

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.980 
on it will be in the low not a nice
feature<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.760> light<00:05:11.910> is<00:05:12.060> it<00:05:12.210> has<00:05:12.330> a<00:05:12.360> lockout

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
feature the light is it has a lockout

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.500 
feature the light is it has a lockout
say<00:05:13.289> if<00:05:13.470> you<00:05:13.650> have<00:05:14.010> it<00:05:14.160> on<00:05:14.280> here<00:05:14.580> if<00:05:14.729> you<00:05:14.970> twist

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
say if you have it on here if you twist

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.279 
say if you have it on here if you twist
the<00:05:16.350> tail<00:05:16.560> cap<00:05:16.830> slightly<00:05:17.840> it<00:05:18.840> will<00:05:18.870> lock<00:05:19.110> it

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
the tail cap slightly it will lock it

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:20.900 
the tail cap slightly it will lock it
out<00:05:19.380> so<00:05:19.710> if<00:05:19.889> you're<00:05:20.010> worried<00:05:20.250> about<00:05:20.310> that<00:05:20.610> you

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
out so if you're worried about that you

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.469 
out so if you're worried about that you
do<00:05:21.030> have<00:05:21.210> that<00:05:21.240> option<00:05:22.970> so<00:05:23.970> not<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.150> whole<00:05:24.330> lot

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
do have that option so not a whole lot

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.240 
do have that option so not a whole lot
more<00:05:24.630> to<00:05:24.780> say<00:05:24.960> about<00:05:24.990> this<00:05:25.440> I<00:05:25.620> really<00:05:26.039> love
