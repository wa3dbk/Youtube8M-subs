is<00:03:43.510> because<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:44.290> will<00:03:44.680> be<00:03:44.889> able<00:03:45.069> to<00:03:45.250> cover<00:03:45.579> up

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
is because you will be able to cover up

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.849 
is because you will be able to cover up
where<00:03:46.209> that<00:03:46.239> braid<00:03:46.630> is<00:03:46.840> coming<00:03:47.290> from<00:03:47.440> with<00:03:47.709> the

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
where that braid is coming from with the

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.870 
where that braid is coming from with the
rest<00:03:48.040> of<00:03:48.280> your<00:03:48.489> hair<00:03:50.310> that'll<00:03:51.310> have<00:03:51.459> that<00:03:51.700> much

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
rest of your hair that'll have that much

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.710 
rest of your hair that'll have that much
hair<00:03:52.180> we're<00:03:52.720> gonna<00:03:52.870> have<00:03:53.079> to<00:03:53.230> do<00:03:53.410> it<00:03:53.590> extension

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
hair we're gonna have to do it extension

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.319 
hair we're gonna have to do it extension
we're<00:03:55.720> using<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.470> three<00:03:57.099> weft<00:03:57.609> and<00:03:58.000> you're

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
we're using the three weft and you're

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.020 
we're using the three weft and you're
gonna<00:03:58.419> want<00:03:58.780> two<00:03:59.380> pieces<00:03:59.769> of<00:04:00.160> them<00:04:00.370> so<00:04:00.910> we're

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
gonna want two pieces of them so we're

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.120 
gonna want two pieces of them so we're
going<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.180> attach<00:04:01.569> these<00:04:01.900> two<00:04:02.290> together<00:04:02.530> so

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
going to attach these two together so

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.729 
going to attach these two together so
what<00:04:03.760> I'm<00:04:03.849> going<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.030> do<00:04:04.180> is<00:04:04.450> this<00:04:04.900> bottom<00:04:05.500> West

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
what I'm going to do is this bottom West

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.140 
what I'm going to do is this bottom West
here<00:04:06.099> all<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.489> clips<00:04:06.730> are<00:04:06.880> going<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.060> be

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
here all the clips are going to be

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.170 
here all the clips are going to be
closed<00:04:07.590> then<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.769> West<00:04:09.099> I<00:04:09.340> have<00:04:09.489> on<00:04:09.669> top<00:04:09.940> we're

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
closed then the West I have on top we're

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.570 
closed then the West I have on top we're
going<00:04:10.269> to<00:04:10.329> open<00:04:10.690> up<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.930> clips

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.900 

then<00:04:13.970> we<00:04:14.480> are<00:04:14.630> going<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:14.990> take<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:16.100> open<00:04:16.519> clip

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
then we are going to take the open clip

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.810 
then we are going to take the open clip
and<00:04:17.150> just<00:04:17.180> underneath<00:04:18.110> the<00:04:18.410> other<00:04:18.590> clip<00:04:19.070> we're

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
and just underneath the other clip we're

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.610 
and just underneath the other clip we're
going<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.000> put<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.239> into<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.660> hair<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.140> then

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
going to put it into the hair and then

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.090 
going to put it into the hair and then
close<00:04:21.890> that<00:04:21.920> clip<00:04:23.230> what<00:04:24.230> this<00:04:24.410> will<00:04:24.620> do<00:04:24.770> is

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
close that clip what this will do is

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.180 
close that clip what this will do is
marry<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:25.970> two<00:04:26.000> pieces<00:04:26.540> together<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.620> keep

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
marry the two pieces together and keep

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.030 
marry the two pieces together and keep
them<00:04:28.430> nice<00:04:28.730> and<00:04:28.840> stable<00:04:29.840> because<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.830> one

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
them nice and stable because the one

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.130 
them nice and stable because the one
West<00:04:31.580> by<00:04:31.850> itself<00:04:32.210> isn't<00:04:32.510> going<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:32.900> have

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
West by itself isn't going to have

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.710 
West by itself isn't going to have
enough<00:04:33.500> hair<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:34.460> have<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:34.790> very<00:04:35.060> nice<00:04:35.330> thick

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
enough hair to have a very nice thick

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.690 
enough hair to have a very nice thick
looking<00:04:36.110> braid<00:04:36.380> then<00:04:37.100> what<00:04:37.250> we're<00:04:37.370> gonna<00:04:37.430> do

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
looking braid then what we're gonna do

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.970 
looking braid then what we're gonna do
is<00:04:37.970> we're<00:04:38.210> just<00:04:38.240> going<00:04:38.450> to<00:04:38.840> take<00:04:39.170> the<00:04:39.470> hair<00:04:39.710> and

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
is we're just going to take the hair and

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.280 
is we're just going to take the hair and
we're<00:04:40.790> just<00:04:40.940> going<00:04:41.150> to<00:04:41.240> start<00:04:41.480> rolling<00:04:41.720> it<00:04:42.080> up

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
we're just going to start rolling it up

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.980 
we're just going to start rolling it up
now<00:04:43.130> for<00:04:43.490> this<00:04:43.640> last<00:04:43.940> bit<00:04:44.180> here<00:04:44.330> I<00:04:44.750> actually

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
now for this last bit here I actually

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.670 
now for this last bit here I actually
opened<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.650> top<00:04:45.860> left<00:04:46.220> here<00:04:46.580> and<00:04:47.320> I<00:04:48.320> bring<00:04:48.530> it

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
opened the top left here and I bring it

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.520 
opened the top left here and I bring it
into<00:04:48.890> the<00:04:49.130> hair<00:04:49.370> and<00:04:49.700> closed<00:04:50.480> it<00:04:50.690> up<00:04:50.810> so<00:04:51.500> that

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
into the hair and closed it up so that

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.160 
into the hair and closed it up so that
keeps<00:04:51.830> it<00:04:52.070> all<00:04:52.250> locked<00:04:52.580> up<00:04:52.820> nice<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.210> tight<00:04:53.810> so

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
keeps it all locked up nice and tight so

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.590 
keeps it all locked up nice and tight so
then<00:04:54.500> you're<00:04:54.890> just<00:04:54.920> going<00:04:55.400> to<00:04:55.520> take<00:04:55.940> in<00:04:56.270> a

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
then you're just going to take in a

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.320 
then you're just going to take in a
brush<00:04:57.050> through<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:57.440> extension<00:04:58.190> and<00:04:58.670> then

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
brush through the extension and then

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.480 
brush through the extension and then
just<00:04:59.600> separate<00:05:00.080> that<00:05:00.440> into<00:05:00.980> three<00:05:01.160> sections

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
just separate that into three sections

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.880 
just separate that into three sections
and<00:05:02.120> just<00:05:03.080> start<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.620> three<00:05:04.010> strand<00:05:04.340> braid<00:05:05.890> you

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
and just start a three strand braid you

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.620 
and just start a three strand braid you
can<00:05:07.010> take<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:07.280> outside<00:05:07.400> section<00:05:07.910> into<00:05:08.540> the

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
can take the outside section into the

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.980 
can take the outside section into the
middle<00:05:09.760> opposite<00:05:10.760> side<00:05:10.940> outside<00:05:11.510> section

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
middle opposite side outside section

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.680 
middle opposite side outside section
into<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.410> middle<00:05:13.210> opposite<00:05:14.210> side<00:05:14.390> outside

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
into the middle opposite side outside

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.720 
into the middle opposite side outside
section<00:05:15.410> and<00:05:15.650> in<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:15.860> middle<00:05:16.100> you're<00:05:16.580> going

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
section and in the middle you're going

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.970 
section and in the middle you're going
to<00:05:16.790> do<00:05:16.880> this<00:05:17.030> until<00:05:17.540> the<00:05:17.780> braid<00:05:18.080> is<00:05:18.320> operated

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
to do this until the braid is operated

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.770 
to do this until the braid is operated
down<00:05:19.250> to<00:05:19.430> the<00:05:19.550> end<00:05:19.669> weight<00:05:20.300> and<00:05:20.480> then<00:05:20.570> when<00:05:20.690> you

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
down to the end weight and then when you

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.120 
down to the end weight and then when you
get<00:05:20.930> to<00:05:21.050> the<00:05:21.169> end<00:05:21.320> you're<00:05:21.590> just<00:05:21.740> gonna<00:05:21.950> go

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
get to the end you're just gonna go

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.850 
get to the end you're just gonna go
ahead<00:05:22.220> and<00:05:22.370> just<00:05:22.790> use<00:05:23.030> a<00:05:23.320> hair<00:05:24.320> tie<00:05:24.530> and<00:05:24.560> tie

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.890 
ahead and just use a hair tie and tie
that<00:05:25.040> off<00:05:25.250> I<00:05:25.550> like<00:05:25.669> to<00:05:25.730> use<00:05:25.940> these<00:05:26.180> small<00:05:26.570> clear

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
that off I like to use these small clear

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.250 
that off I like to use these small clear
ones<00:05:28.210> then<00:05:29.210> just<00:05:29.450> like<00:05:29.600> you<00:05:29.750> would<00:05:29.900> with<00:05:30.230> your

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
ones then just like you would with your

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.140 
ones then just like you would with your
normal<00:05:30.530> hair<00:05:30.890> go<00:05:31.040> ahead<00:05:31.250> and<00:05:31.490> just<00:05:31.790> move<00:05:31.940> that

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
normal hair go ahead and just move that

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.070 
normal hair go ahead and just move that
down<00:05:32.450> a<00:05:32.480> little<00:05:32.750> bit<00:05:33.110> and<00:05:34.030> then<00:05:35.030> fluff<00:05:35.690> up<00:05:36.020> the

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
down a little bit and then fluff up the

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.240 
down a little bit and then fluff up the
braid<00:05:38.080> will<00:05:39.080> make<00:05:39.200> the<00:05:39.350> braid<00:05:39.560> look<00:05:39.830> a<00:05:39.860> little

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
braid will make the braid look a little

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.550
