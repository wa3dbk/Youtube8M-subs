00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
I think wood was outdated on the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.940 
I think wood was outdated on the
elevator<00:03:34.610> pardon<00:03:35.000> I'm<00:03:35.270> gonna<00:03:35.390> say<00:03:35.570> in<00:03:35.630> like

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
elevator pardon I'm gonna say in like

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.280 
elevator pardon I'm gonna say in like
2728<00:03:36.970> okay<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.210> yeah<00:03:38.360> again<00:03:38.660> it<00:03:38.840> looks<00:03:39.020> like

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
2728 okay so yeah again it looks like

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.970 
2728 okay so yeah again it looks like
that's<00:03:39.500> probably<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.340> original<00:03:41.770> is<00:03:42.770> this

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
that's probably the original is this

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.770 
that's probably the original is this
locked<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:43.970> it's<00:03:44.300> gotta<00:03:44.480> pick<00:03:44.630> in<00:03:44.750> your
