00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.690 

I<00:00:00.410> had<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.439> jack<00:00:01.979> shaft<00:00:02.340> and<00:00:03.560> a<00:00:04.560> 6-10<00:00:05.400> pulley

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
I had a jack shaft and a 6-10 pulley

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.080 
I had a jack shaft and a 6-10 pulley
here<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.180> try<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:06.600> improve<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:06.960> RPM<00:00:07.760> on<00:00:08.760> this

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
here to try and improve the RPM on this

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.000 
here to try and improve the RPM on this
thing<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.480> see<00:00:09.660> if<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:09.840> can<00:00:09.990> get<00:00:10.170> up<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.500> got<00:00:10.889> the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
thing to see if I can get up the got the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.879 
thing to see if I can get up the got the
voltage<00:00:11.340> up<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.610> couple<00:00:11.820> more<00:00:12.030> volts<00:00:12.530> so<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.559> is

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
voltage up a couple more volts so it is

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.589 
voltage up a couple more volts so it is
spinning<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.340> little<00:00:14.490> bit<00:00:14.730> faster<00:00:15.210> what<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.420> was

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
spinning a little bit faster what I was

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.680 
spinning a little bit faster what I was
afraid<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:16.080> was<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.580> didn't<00:00:18.330> have<00:00:18.480> enough

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
afraid of was the I didn't have enough

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.179 
afraid of was the I didn't have enough
water<00:00:18.720> they<00:00:19.289> actually<00:00:19.320> turned<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.010> whole

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
water they actually turned this whole

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.029 
water they actually turned this whole
thing<00:00:20.720> what<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.750> did<00:00:21.960> was<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.260> made<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.650> Jack

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
thing what I did was I made that Jack

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.870 
thing what I did was I made that Jack
shaft<00:00:23.400> right<00:00:23.760> there<00:00:23.970> out<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:25.039> strut<00:00:26.039> they

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
shaft right there out of a strut they

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.970 
shaft right there out of a strut they
came<00:00:27.119> out<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.510> car<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:28.019> my<00:00:28.170> son<00:00:28.500> Todd<00:00:28.769> had

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
came out of a car that my son Todd had

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.529 
came out of a car that my son Todd had
brought<00:00:29.189> here<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:29.760> replace<00:00:30.150> all<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
brought here that we replace all the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.500 
brought here that we replace all the
frets<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.160> took<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.640> shaft<00:00:33.210> and

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
frets on and I took the shaft and

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.319 
frets on and I took the shaft and
permits<00:00:33.930> turn<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.040> down<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> three-quarter

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
permits turn it down to a three-quarter

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.270 
permits turn it down to a three-quarter
inch<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.750> pistol<00:00:37.110> bearings<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.860> pulley

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
inch for pistol bearings in the pulley

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.889 
inch for pistol bearings in the pulley
there<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.790> second<00:00:39.270> pulley<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.750> see

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
there that second pulley so you can see

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.490 
there that second pulley so you can see
that<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.260> has<00:00:43.640> slowed<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.820> down<00:00:44.850> quite<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.329> bit

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
that it has slowed it down quite a bit

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.189 
that it has slowed it down quite a bit
on<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.800> wheel<00:00:47.570> but<00:00:50.390> it<00:00:51.390> seems<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.870> working

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
on the wheel but it seems to be working

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.389 
on the wheel but it seems to be working
okay<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.980> going<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:53.340> some<00:00:53.550> more

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
okay I'm going to do some more

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.760 
okay I'm going to do some more
sniggering<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> ohmmeter<00:00:57.770> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
sniggering on the with the ohmmeter to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.209 
sniggering on the with the ohmmeter to
see<00:00:58.949> how<00:00:59.039> many<00:00:59.100> volts<00:01:00.170> it's<00:01:01.170> up<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.530> 22<00:01:02.010> volts

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
see how many volts it's up to 22 volts

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.130 
see how many volts it's up to 22 volts
now<00:01:03.500> coming<00:01:04.500> from<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.949> alternator<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
now coming from the alternator up to the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.560 
now coming from the alternator up to the
director<00:01:07.140> fire<00:01:07.710> which<00:01:08.280> changes<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.420> be

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
director fire which changes that to be

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.000 
director fire which changes that to be
free<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.850> going<00:01:11.850> all<00:01:12.060> right<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.830> see

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
free so just going all right you can see

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.649 
free so just going all right you can see
I've<00:01:14.220> been<00:01:14.250> pulled<00:01:14.670> aside<00:01:14.939> here<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:17.420> I've<00:01:18.420> got

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
I've been pulled aside here and I've got

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.730 
I've been pulled aside here and I've got
this<00:01:18.900> fall

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
this fall

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.220 
this fall
the<00:01:21.550> final<00:01:22.060> carp<00:01:22.540> that<00:01:22.780> I'm<00:01:22.840> going<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.020> pull

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
the final carp that I'm going to pull

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.930 
the final carp that I'm going to pull
right<00:01:23.380> over<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.830> top<00:01:24.040> of<00:01:24.070> it<00:01:24.340> here<00:01:24.520> see<00:01:24.760> them

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
right over the top of it here see them

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.340 
right over the top of it here see them
closer<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.510> the<00:01:25.630> winter<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:28.050> just<00:01:29.050> thought<00:01:29.200> I'd

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
closer to the winter so just thought I'd

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.450 
closer to the winter so just thought I'd
give<00:01:29.530> you<00:01:29.560> guys<00:01:29.680> an<00:01:30.130> update<00:01:30.220> on<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:33.340> I've

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
give you guys an update on what I've

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:49.609 
give you guys an update on what I've
done<00:01:33.640> here

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.200 

we've<00:01:50.619> had<00:01:50.859> a<00:01:50.890> little<00:01:51.130> bit<00:01:51.340> more<00:01:51.549> water<00:01:51.789> coming

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
we've had a little bit more water coming

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.609 
we've had a little bit more water coming
through<00:01:52.240> this<00:01:52.509> thing<00:01:52.810> it's<00:01:52.960> spinning<00:01:53.530> a

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
through this thing it's spinning a

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.069 
through this thing it's spinning a
little<00:01:53.740> faster<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:55.329> I<00:01:55.420> think<00:01:55.630> I'm<00:01:55.810> probably

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
little faster but I think I'm probably

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.010 
little faster but I think I'm probably
getting<00:01:56.530> as<00:01:56.829> much<00:01:57.039> a<00:01:57.700> lot<00:01:58.240> of<00:01:58.390> that<00:01:58.509> alternator

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
getting as much a lot of that alternator

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.859 
getting as much a lot of that alternator
as<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.380> probably<00:01:59.649> can<00:02:00.100> with<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.479> only<00:02:01.719> other

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
as I probably can with the only other

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.410 
as I probably can with the only other
alternative<00:02:02.649> would<00:02:02.829> be<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:03.280> move<00:02:03.969> the<00:02:04.179> water

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
alternative would be to move the water

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.479 
alternative would be to move the water
wheel<00:02:06.630> down<00:02:07.630> there<00:02:08.019> and<00:02:08.530> then<00:02:08.890> run<00:02:09.069> a<00:02:09.129> drop

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
wheel down there and then run a drop

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.970 
wheel down there and then run a drop
down<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.149> it's<00:02:11.049> probably<00:02:11.290> about<00:02:11.799> a<00:02:11.860> foot

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
down to it it's probably about a foot

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.539 
down to it it's probably about a foot
and<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:12.489> half<00:02:13.140> or<00:02:14.140> two<00:02:14.200> foot<00:02:14.739> difference<00:02:15.099> and

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
and a half or two foot difference and

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.449 
and a half or two foot difference and
drop<00:02:15.819> so<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.209> could<00:02:16.390> pick<00:02:16.540> up<00:02:16.629> some<00:02:16.690> speed<00:02:17.459> and

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
drop so I could pick up some speed and

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.289 
drop so I could pick up some speed and
some<00:02:18.910> momentum

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
some momentum

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.940 
some momentum
maybe<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.450> turn<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.870> will<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.140> little<00:02:23.319> faster

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
maybe the turn that will a little faster

00:02:23.950 --> 00:03:20.510 
maybe the turn that will a little faster
but<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.340> that

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:39.920 

I<00:03:37.610> change<00:03:38.610> anything<00:03:38.880> else<00:03:39.150> on<00:03:39.390> here<00:03:39.570> I'll<00:03:39.720> try

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
I change anything else on here I'll try

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.360 
I change anything else on here I'll try
and<00:03:40.080> update<00:03:40.350> everybody<00:03:41.360> bye-bye
