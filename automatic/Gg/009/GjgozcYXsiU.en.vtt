00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
floating by a little floating area right

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.640 
floating by a little floating area right
there<00:01:03.470> a<00:01:05.450> lot<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.479> craters<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.439> I've<00:01:07.619> mentioned

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
there a lot of craters as I've mentioned

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.600 
there a lot of craters as I've mentioned
earlier<00:01:08.460> oars<00:01:09.470> like<00:01:10.470> visible<00:01:11.130> or<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.460> not

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
earlier oars like visible or is not

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.670 
earlier oars like visible or is not
underground<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.360> visible<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.159> a<00:01:14.659> little

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
underground but visible and a little

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.450 
underground but visible and a little
under<00:01:17.299> under<00:01:18.299> what<00:01:18.869> are<00:01:18.990> they<00:01:19.080> called<00:01:19.320> /<00:01:20.009> gang

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
under under what are they called / gang

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.700 
under under what are they called / gang
or<00:01:20.729> overhangs<00:01:21.360> overhangs<00:01:21.990> yeah<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.439> don't

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
or overhangs overhangs yeah I don't

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.149 
or overhangs overhangs yeah I don't
overhangs<00:01:23.310> as<00:01:23.490> well<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.890> pretty<00:01:29.040> much

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
overhangs as well so this is pretty much

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.460 
overhangs as well so this is pretty much
the<00:01:29.280> sea<00:01:29.549> tight<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.509> lot<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.869> cars<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.380> lot

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the sea tight as it a lot of cars a lot

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.399 
the sea tight as it a lot of cars a lot
of<00:01:33.650> parts<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.799> map<00:01:35.570> do<00:01:36.570> go<00:01:36.869> up<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.170> cloud

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
of parts of the map do go up to cloud

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.039 
of parts of the map do go up to cloud
level<00:01:37.939> that<00:01:38.939> thing<00:01:39.299> I've<00:01:39.479> been<00:01:39.659> pretty<00:01:39.840> sure

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
level that thing I've been pretty sure

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.810 
level that thing I've been pretty sure
this<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.670> tallest<00:01:41.670> tree<00:01:41.990> 1<00:01:42.990> 2<00:01:43.740> 3<00:01:44.100> 4<00:01:46.340> 33<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.610> yeah

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
this is tallest tree 1 2 3 4 33 so yeah

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.310 
this is tallest tree 1 2 3 4 33 so yeah
you're<00:01:48.090> pretty<00:01:48.509> much<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.960> build<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.200> house

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
you're pretty much if you build a house

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.080 
you're pretty much if you build a house
here<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:50.130> can<00:01:50.280> only<00:01:50.399> build<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.970> that

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
here you can only build it up to that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.700 
here you can only build it up to that
height<00:01:51.329> other<00:01:51.930> than<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.590> pretty

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
height other than that this is pretty

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.410 
height other than that this is pretty
much<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.920> whole<00:01:53.040> seed<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.759> really<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.240> a

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
much the whole seed it is really it's a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.510 
much the whole seed it is really it's a
really<00:01:54.630> an<00:01:54.720> awesome<00:01:54.869> seed<00:01:55.380> really<00:01:56.219> good<00:01:56.369> for

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
really an awesome seed really good for

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.550 
really an awesome seed really good for
survival<00:01:57.030> as<00:01:57.119> I've<00:01:57.299> mentioned<00:01:57.659> about<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.380> lot

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
survival as I've mentioned about a lot

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.990 
survival as I've mentioned about a lot
of<00:01:58.590> seeds<00:01:58.920> but<00:01:59.159> other<00:01:59.399> than<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.969> a

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
of seeds but other than that this is a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.230 
of seeds but other than that this is a
really<00:02:00.240> nice<00:02:00.360> seed<00:02:01.790> if<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.909> did<00:02:03.030> enjoy<00:02:03.210> the
