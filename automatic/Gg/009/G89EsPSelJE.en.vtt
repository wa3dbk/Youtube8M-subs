00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.089
 and we are going with you we are going to do this 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.640
 beautiful flower that I have here really a 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.259
 very beautiful version we have this for 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.570
 a little box and let's make one for a 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.290
 necklace this the curling techniques that 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.240
 good 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.340
 marisa giménez with a lot of affection we 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.500
 I work today to learn a little more 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.300
 I would also like this to serve you in 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.880
 an opportunity also here there is a 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.460
 very cute look at all the utility that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.230
 we can give the pieces with this 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.179
 material that sometimes people say good 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.400
 It is not a piece of paper you can give 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.530
 different uses and a more special one that 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.020
 the yellow line serves them as is the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.370
 thanks very well for account then with the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.899
 pair then that different one that is 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.629
 doing the mister we're going to work 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.629
 great to then explain a little how 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.860
 the same technical ink is made 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.360
 in the very special technique for 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.820
 different events 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.810
 These pieces can decorate boxes bags 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.670
 they can make a surface they want 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.070
 circular distinct from anything 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.700
 wire and also place there is list of 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.030
 materials and we start ok we're going to 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.550
 use for the rose for money to 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.470
 wii I worked with perforators let's go 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.050
 to use materials for it 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.260
 would be the ribbon of huila and paper of paper 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.620
 of course 9.5 millimeters cherry color 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.600
 Needle quilling groove or roma said the 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.000
 pizzas circles template 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.910
 17 millimeter perforators 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.800
 and a circle driller 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.070
 we will also use color bond paper 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.770
 cherry white sticks quick drying 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.100
 solvent resin brush gold pendant 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.500
 wire and choker when we're going to 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.510
 give the use of costume jewelry truth the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.780
 Right 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.730
 then we have here the big rice 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.610
 that one is a rose let's work 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.510
 same goes to work but in minor 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.610
 scale the flower of the day ok then 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.500
 we begin by explaining in this case the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.590
 rice is bigger than we do not have in a 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.990
 perforador like the one that I have here 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.410
 we have a tape that we cut 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.750
 3 centimeters wide and then we go 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.550
 making square which means making a 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.800
 square of 3 x 3 clear because it is a 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.440
 square of almería true then a 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.200
 Once you are cut this we go 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.300
 to get this kind of squares of that 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.060
 area of ​​them we are also going to 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.400
 need a circle that is where you are going to 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.440
 support all the squares petals that 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.200
 in the balance though how much are we going to 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.819
 do 15 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.800
 both for the big one and for the 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:40.190
 tenebra 15 squares of 344 of 3 x 3 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.410
 this case I have 3 that would be 3 x 3 in 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.489
 squares and in terms of the diameter of the 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:49.440
 base circle of 35 according to the template 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.510
 that we have by the list 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.130
 then these petals are going to work 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.010
 the following way they all have 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.460
 here first you double it to get 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.320
 the center and we will work with do 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.590
 a small cut but let's tear the 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.540
 once they can grab a 4-4 with a 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.980
 rival area is now so complicated that 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.560
 be faster everything becomes a small 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.270
 cut of approximately 5 or 6 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.380
 millimeters where we double that is the 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.100
 center 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.680
 ok once that step was made we are going to 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.220
 through a slot so that it was cut 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.170
 let's put one a piece of paper on top 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.760
 of the other or that this to look for that the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.490
 petal does not want straight but it 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.680
 feel and create what you see so that you 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.240
 you see it bulky be it total flat or be 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.180
 flat and this is going to allow just 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.310
 work better with each petal with the 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.800
 we have placing over the sky and so 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.350
 come on, let's put 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.920
 over 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:50.890
 and it is clearly seen how he is going to 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:54.280
 sitting back of the petal refers 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.200
 a rolled curve that can be made 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.209
 with the slot uah or it can be done 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.510
 also with the blunt needle 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:05.319
 I like this in the case of the square 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:09.790
 larger to press the needle u 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.440
 others and that also at home with more 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.060
 time with which you feel bands that 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.500
 You sit here in this always roll 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.350
 that there is no easier to be with the Roma but 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.940
 quick book was achieved 'the clear then 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.700
 that we have it, all the 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.800
 and this whole awkward way is valued 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.980
 they happen to be stressed petal they will be able 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.340
 go to 70 then we have them like that 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:34.419
 front from behind then we're leaving now 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.800
 to stick them on the circle 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.730
 this was the circle and I was hitting the 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.010
 zetas 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.460
 the first round on the shore of 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.490
 circle will consist of six petals 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.240
 so if you hit it or take the paste 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.880
 direct and finish paper and placed me at 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.800
 previous side 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.990
 so we have to do sometimes 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.930
 evidence that they really fit 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.669
 in the circle and that we do not go so 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.190
 inside the circle they begin to see the 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:08.069
 failures of agreement then it is important 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.500
 mention that the more you stick 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.270
 now we see let's take the best one for 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.849
 maneuver when moving any 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.860
 in this case if not a little bit but 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.169
 grab enough glue so they can 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:23.220
 handle better so we go and we arrive 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:25.410
 here to the six petals quickly the 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.060
 television machine we already made exact 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.870
 of alice because it has several steps but 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.210
 it's not hard I do not want to be here 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.190
 so we conclude the next layer that 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.810
 we are going to intersperse the petals that 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.810
 come that in this case there are going to be five 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:46.699
 just maneuver move 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.139
 it's missing space even though you 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.040
 five technicians are created that 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.889
 train 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.770
 Our course 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:58.360
 here we have to intercalate first that 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.360
 inter channels between two petals 

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:05.080
 in the middle of that is what we call 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.899
 interspersed and so we go with the other 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.539
 we are going to do without this turn 

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:14.009
 the second round of our return is 5 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:17.009
 p such five petals so I'm coming the 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:17.009
 we passed 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.240
 what do you think about the magic of the minutes of 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:26.290
 excellent television then it comes 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.780
 the third round that will consist of 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.660
 ages 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.639
 but that total is fine with four 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:38.830
 petals to get to how many laps 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:41.290
 would total three laps and change 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.139
 the color of the flowers can 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:47.710
 use is clay in rings and 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:49.670
 necklaces in a box in a bag each 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:53.530
 the commentators 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.530
 and so we go again with this 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.430
 intercalating 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:02.370
 pressed so that he hits 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:05.930
 although even though he does them but 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.930
 the same you have to continue placing 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.970
 putting together what would be the center of the 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.220
 flower what is interesting this technique that 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.930
 well we had a paper and it does not give 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.240
 as a lot of value for once the 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:20.060
 Armed pieces is something else 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.790
 precious and good tour with man is 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.010
 talk attention to delude those that 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.560
 have as I was with your scribe 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:31.130
 teachers can also recycle and that 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.750
 we could make a tomita is we have 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:36.170
 first communion we still have it 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:38.060
 true as event if 7 reviewed by that 

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.370
 box the bird that is also from 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.560
 mark books as well many 

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.630
 alternatives not only jewelery 

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.220
 card but a little bit of everything 

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.380
 we are going to a little break and we are coming 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:52.870
 with much closer the idea to do this 

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.870
 beautiful project for you the diary
