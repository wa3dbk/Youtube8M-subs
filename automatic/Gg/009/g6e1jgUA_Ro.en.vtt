pretty good mask I would I wouldn't
really<00:02:28.549> recommend<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.750> much<00:02:30.019> it<00:02:30.320> it<00:02:30.680> said

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
really recommend it that much it it said

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.240 
really recommend it that much it it said
it's<00:02:31.100> anti<00:02:31.430> fog<00:02:31.640> it's<00:02:32.209> pretty<00:02:32.870> expensive<00:02:33.250> for

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
it's anti fog it's pretty expensive for

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.280 
it's anti fog it's pretty expensive for
to<00:02:35.120> be<00:02:35.209> like<00:02:35.360> an<00:02:35.480> anti-fog<00:02:35.959> like<00:02:36.470> anti<00:02:36.890> fog<00:02:37.070> is

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
to be like an anti-fog like anti fog is

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.990 
to be like an anti-fog like anti fog is
really<00:02:39.290> really<00:02:39.560> useful<00:02:39.799> but<00:02:40.519> this<00:02:40.730> doesn't

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
really really useful but this doesn't

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.180 
really really useful but this doesn't
have<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.329> it's<00:02:41.780> not<00:02:41.930> really<00:02:42.079> reliable<00:02:42.560> this

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
have it it's not really reliable this

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.280 
have it it's not really reliable this
mask<00:02:43.489> we<00:02:44.329> try<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.570> put<00:02:44.840> some<00:02:45.320> spray<00:02:45.620> on<00:02:45.799> it<00:02:45.829> and

mask we try to put some spray on it and

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.190 
mask we try to put some spray on it and
didn't<00:02:47.469> work<00:02:47.560> at<00:02:47.769> all<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:49.360> would<00:02:49.810> rate<00:02:50.019> this

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
didn't work at all I would rate this

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.770 
didn't work at all I would rate this
mask<00:02:50.760> probably<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:53.230> 5<00:02:53.920> out<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.310> 10<00:02:54.670> because<00:02:55.390> of

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
mask probably a 5 out of 10 because of

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.979 
mask probably a 5 out of 10 because of
those<00:02:55.930> reasons<00:02:56.109> it's<00:02:57.599> really<00:02:58.599> comfortable

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
those reasons it's really comfortable

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.869 
those reasons it's really comfortable
actually<00:02:59.260> surprisingly<00:03:00.189> comfortable<00:03:00.519> the

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
actually surprisingly comfortable the

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.839 
actually surprisingly comfortable the
years<00:03:01.090> actually<00:03:01.299> don't<00:03:01.629> go<00:03:01.750> on<00:03:01.870> foam<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.530> just

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
years actually don't go on foam it just

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.759 
years actually don't go on foam it just
goes<00:03:03.849> like<00:03:04.420> Ray<00:03:04.900> at<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:05.200> bottom<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.620> this
