 capitalized is well know hilarious in more 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.170
 relaxed than most games 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.970

 new cars you have multiple enemies 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.379
 several goals then that is 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.299
 fulfilling and it's a game that is not much 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.980

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.909
 windows phone will show you is 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.189
 now the only thing we have 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.510
 what to do is starting at the right time 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.549
 and after changing the march for those who do not 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.139

 Voting for one minute that understands 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.540
 little car already knows what it's all about 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.940

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.169
 warm up the engine does not suffer any 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.150
 wear and tear 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.470
 You have to get first of your 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.419
 opponents in the end here I have a 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.680
 running alone only a fifth player 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.379
 but then you can play in 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.049
