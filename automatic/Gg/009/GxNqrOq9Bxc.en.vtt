00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 a lot of time ago many more is 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.000
 criticized that I say that the gameplays are 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.160
 garbage that in some way by much 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.349
 indicate I'm not really giving a 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.420
 exit nor a constructive criticism for 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.030
 people to make it worth content 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.550
 sorry today I decided to give us the reason 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.320
 try to explain how to be more creative 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.760
 in the world of video games with a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.800
 little bit of imagination 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.400
 anyone can imagine that this one 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.039
 you command and your soma and this is a 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.830
 normal employment a normal gameplay is based 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.899
 in playing something and recording it 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.790
 as we can see this does not require great 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.040
 imagination is not a job 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.710
 especially entertaining to watch is not 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.420
 edited or cut nor comments 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.730
 they are especially funny and you 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.879
 you will say but dallas is that I do not know how to do 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.730
 nothing more good friend of mine if you really 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.680
 the audiovisual world interests in spite of 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.690
 I'm not an expert, I'll try 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.579
 teach how he tried to make a 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.980
 creative content in the world of 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.440
 videogames for this you will need a 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.480
 computer a head to think a 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.640
 capture and editing program 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.070
 video and some will say 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.320
 because you use a captor if you play 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.270
 in the computer you will see you have never 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.760
 Having installed some program 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.550
 to record something and the computer and everything 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.409
 this even though my computer is 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.479
 pretty good this happens almost always 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.700
 The grabber allows you to record with 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.890
 all quality without slowing anything your 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.960
 video the first thing we should have will be 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.970
 an idea the inspiration can come from 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.009
 many sides is like writing a story 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.290
 but in pictures to give an example 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.369
 let's imagine that we have this file 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.130
 video with a little imagination 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.700
 we can combine it with this music by 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.100
 example 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.289
 and create a completely new story 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.030
 At the beginning our creations can 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.740
 be quite poor but everything is 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.119
 issue of progressing little by little if you 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.829
 interesting to improve you can search 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.869
 tutorials about the editing program 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.850
 see some examples on youtube 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.159
 combining in the music some 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.840
 images and voices we can create a 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.090
 video game content a thousand times 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.860
 superior to any gameplay even you 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.869
 You can also create something similar to a 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.630
 gameplay but with a script showing 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.700
 better parts trimming what by editing what 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.830
 and doing the enjoyable thing to finally see 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.599
 I would like to include in this video that I have 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.980

 video I pretend in some way to give a 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.050
 I urge people to make content more 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.750
 creative on YouTube since the channels 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.430
 of gameplays are many and there are not 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.590
 too many channels that make content 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.720
 more or less creative in Spanish my 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.000
 intention is to inspire you and give you a 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.370
 opportunity teaching you the basics 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.810
 I know maybe I'll make more videos of this 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.550
 style explaining things more 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.360
 concrete to develop your 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.040
 creations 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.560
 I hope it has helped you and 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.760
 always remember that the good if brief 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.760
 twice good
