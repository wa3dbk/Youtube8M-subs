 we started by applying a corrector in this 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.550

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.490
 sponges of the real techniques what 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.100
 I apply then for the area of ​​the eyecup but 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.450
 also by all marks or redness 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.450
 who wants to disguise 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.480
 step now to show you the total powders 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.270
 cinebos of the brand canebo is actually 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.240
 a powder foundation and I the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.490
 I apply with this type of cutting brushes 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.340
 quite dense flat in this case is the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.720
 of which apart I love because it is 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.720
 very economical and it gives me 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.509
 the same use of the same use as others that 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.270
 They are the same but more expensive as can 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.950
 be the tenth and good this base of 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.049
 makeup in which using a lot 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.140
 now in summer because honestly in 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.960
 the fluid bases 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.600
 they do not call me attention now 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.490
 It's too hot and I go better with a 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.490
 powder base that with a fluid 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.740
 I use as always my paintball 20 and 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 the rest is a shadow in cream in color 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.230
 beige as you can see the application 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.900
 with your fingers directly on the 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.540
 eyelids and as I'm going to 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.010
 applying it I'm blurring this is going to 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.110
 make the shadows that we put 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.220
 after we last a lot longer 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.220
 without creases 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.150
 happened now to the bronzer I'm going to 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.049
 use them chocolyne soleil of your face 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.879
 I love them, I'm going to apply them with 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.879
 a brush also from the f in this case 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:57.099
 it's the brass complexion that I use it 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.900
 so to tan and also to 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.230
 I like a lot of rouge is Luis 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.900
 soft and very economical and as for the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.879
 bronzer, I'm taking it out on 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.430
 many latest videos of products 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.650
 favorites I like a lot so much for 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.450
 do outline as to tan as 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.690
 is the case of this look that I'm 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.209
 tanning a little bit the face all for 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.489
 so that I can see myself a little more 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.290
 brunette now in summer I'm usually 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.140
 the face is whiter than the rest 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.209
 of the body and well then tried 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.209
 counteract that effect 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.250
 I will use the same powders 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.370
 bronzers in this case for the eyes 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.670
 as a shadow I use it with a 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.590
 brush to blur normal and current and 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.870
 as I am applying the product 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.120
 I blur it on the eyelid 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.120
 making circular movements 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.319
 now I move to the mascara 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:09.099
 I'm using the maxi volume a lot 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.889
 deliplus I like it a lot but still 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.920
 I still have it a little liquid and I 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:17.199
 too much lashes not 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.120
 However, as you can see in the video, 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.120
 leave incredible features 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.590
 this mascara you have to 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.860
 work it very well so that you do not know 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:41.820
 are the eyelashes are bad eyes 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.639
 because it tends to weigh the step now 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.340
 to the blusher part and the illuminator 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.370
 I'm going to use this palette of to face 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.900
 what is leopard love and specifically the 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:57.840
 Rouge tone is the candy leopard and 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.570
 the illuminator's tone is pink 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.639
 leopard this palette I have it made 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.620
 enough time and I do not give it all the use 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.599
 that he deserves so the return to 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.949
 rescue and I'm using it a lot 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.949
 lately to make up 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.660
 right now I am applying what is the 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.440
 blusher in the area of ​​the manzanitas and 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.840
 then with the same brush the and splintered 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.570
 I'm going to apply a little bit of the illuminator 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.190
 in the upper area of ​​the cheekbone just above 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.970
 from where we have put blusher 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.970
 previously 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.940
 as always I brushed my 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.610
 eyebrows product Katrin Cellay 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.370

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:57.210
 that is already being spent and to finish 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:59.580
 I use tone 03 of the l'oréal paris de 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.500
 these labials are very lipsticks 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.200
 creamy yes it is true that it is not 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.170
 that last a lot on the lip but are very 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.470
 comfortable to wear this tone is a 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:14.430
 pink gum tone that the truth is that I 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:18.620
 I like it a lot and it gives you a very good touch 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.620

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.830

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.350
 easy does not have much complication like 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.910
 I told you at the beginning of the video like this 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.460
 What if you liked to give your finger 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.990
