00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:09.030
 [Music] 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.340
 in this video we will learn about the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.880
 factorial decomposition or 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.520
 prime factorization 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.660
 decompose a number into factors is 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.619
 express this same amount 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.619
 as a product 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.859
 of two numbers 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.110
 or several numbers that result 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.490
 the same number for example 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.950
 If I'm 36, I can say that 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:43.990
 break it down into factors would be to write 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:48.960
 12 by 32 by 36 36 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:53.080
 it could also be 18 by all 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.829
 36 for 1 and so on infinite 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.859
 combinations 6 by 6 and so on 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.630
 the prime factorization is 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:09.080
 difference since as its name says 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:12.110
 you work specifically with factors 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.350
 cousins ​​that is to say with prime numbers 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.350
 to do this the amount is placed 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.950
 that this case is 36 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.049
 [Music] 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.930
 and applying my criteria of 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.550
 divisibility I proceed to simplify this 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.909
 number in prime factors 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.280
 [Music] 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.549
 as the number is finished in a number 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.670
 couple that would be 6 I know it's divisible 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:40.620
 between two so divided by 236 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.970
 divide or two is 18 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.979
 again I have a number for the end 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:51.640
 so I go back to take out half 18 divided 2 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.940
 is 99 is no longer an even number and so 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.340
 I can no longer divide between 2 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.520
 I proceed to divide by 3 which is our 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.740
 next prime number 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.380
 9/33 and since 3 is a prime number 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.289
 it can only be divisible between itself 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.909
 3 divided 3 1 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:21.020
 therefore I get that 36 equals the 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:23.030
 product of 2 by 2 by 3 x 3 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.380
 and this is decompose the numbers 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.320
 prime factors by ownership of 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.860
 powers can express 36 as a 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.620
 product of power in 2 squared 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.440
 x 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.310
 3 squared 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.350
 in another example 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.680
 I have the number 6000 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.030
 and I proceed to do the same 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.520
 factor decomposition taking in 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.320
 count my rules of divisibility the 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.290
 number is finished at zero and so 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.580
 so much I can divide between 26 thousand 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.330
 divided is 3000 that ends again 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.390
 in zero I get back half 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.590
 1500 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.450
 [Music] 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.730
 again there is a zero in the end 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.680
 re-split between two would be 750 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:21.680
 still finishing at 0 so I go back to 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:24.319
 divide between 2 I get 375 as now 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.260
 the number is a 5 it can no longer be 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.590
 divisible by two the next number 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.930
 cousin would be 3 to know if it is divisible 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:39.590
 between 3 sumo each of the terms 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:43.670
 that would be 3 + 7 10 515 since 15 if it is 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.490
 a multiple of 3 375 if it is divisible 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.780
 between 3 and divide 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.000
 I have 125 left 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.660
 125 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.300
 [Music] 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:02.880
 let's see if it is divisible by 3 sumo 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.620
 all figures 1 2 3 588 is not a 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.800
 multiple of 3 and therefore it is not 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.710
 divisible by 3 my next number 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:15.140
 cousin would be 5 so I divide by 5 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:20.780
 because it is divisible by 35 because the 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:24.590
 number is finished at 5 125/5 is 25 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:31.100
 since the last number is 5 it becomes 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:34.210
 divide between 525/5 is 5 since 5 is 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:38.070
 cousin single indivisible between himself 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:43.350
 fifth part sack I have 1 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:48.710
 therefore 6000 is equal to say 2 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:54.740
 raised at 12 34 times to the fourth 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.740
 by 3 that is only once 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:02.069
 5 elevated 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:04.319
 one two three times cubed six thousand 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:07.670
 then it is equal to two to the fourth by 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:10.190
 three by five cubed 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.180
 and this is factor decomposition 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:19.450
 cousins 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:22.450
 [Music] 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.450
