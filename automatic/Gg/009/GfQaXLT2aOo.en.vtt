there's<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.510> code<00:00:54.899> thing<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.500> scan

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
there's that code thing you can scan

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.729 
there's that code thing you can scan
with<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:57.059> scanner<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.660> will<00:00:58.199> try<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.469> at

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
with that a scanner I will try that at

Mega Bloks review and before I go we
should<00:04:59.840> try<00:05:00.020> that

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
should try that

alright I'm back now we're gonna try the

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.660 
alright I'm back now we're gonna try the
code<00:05:02.480> scanning<00:05:02.840> I'm<00:05:03.680> not<00:05:04.010> exactly<00:05:04.340> sure<00:05:04.640> what

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
code scanning I'm not exactly sure what

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.290 
code scanning I'm not exactly sure what
they're<00:05:04.910> called

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
they're called

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.850 
they're called
I'm<00:05:05.480> pretty<00:05:05.720> sure<00:05:05.870> they're<00:05:06.050> called<00:05:06.200> AR<00:05:06.560> codes

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
I'm pretty sure they're called AR codes

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.460 
I'm pretty sure they're called AR codes
or<00:05:07.040> something<00:05:07.070> from<00:05:07.850> what<00:05:08.000> I've<00:05:08.120> heard<00:05:08.470> so

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
retake let me get in a better standing

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.450 
retake let me get in a better standing
position<00:05:58.490> here<00:05:59.740> see<00:06:00.740> if<00:06:00.800> I<00:06:00.919> turn<00:06:01.130> the<00:06:01.250> flash

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
back on okay no it didn't all right so

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:14.040 
back on okay no it didn't all right so
let's<00:06:06.770> test<00:06:07.100> this<00:06:07.310> out<00:06:08.950> get<00:06:09.950> focused<00:06:10.550> in

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.740 

that<00:06:14.800> seems<00:06:15.069> pretty<00:06:15.129> good<00:06:15.460> to<00:06:15.580> me<00:06:15.909> and

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
that seems pretty good to me and

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.659 
that seems pretty good to me and
actually<00:06:16.930> it's<00:06:17.259> kind<00:06:17.590> of<00:06:17.650> weird<00:06:17.710> all<00:06:18.610> right

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
actually it's kind of weird all right

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:25.110 
actually it's kind of weird all right
let's<00:06:18.909> see<00:06:19.090> if<00:06:19.180> they<00:06:19.300> can<00:06:19.360> scan<00:06:19.900> it<00:06:22.889> okay<00:06:24.120> so

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
let's see if they can scan it okay so

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.350 
let's see if they can scan it okay so
that<00:06:25.300> it's<00:06:25.539> being<00:06:25.720> difficult<00:06:25.900> enough<00:06:27.180> so<00:06:28.180> it

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
that it's being difficult enough so it

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.020 
that it's being difficult enough so it
looks<00:06:28.569> so<00:06:29.020> I<00:06:29.050> guess<00:06:29.379> we<00:06:29.560> can<00:06:29.800> try<00:06:30.220> and<00:06:30.280> scan<00:06:31.000> it

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
looks so I guess we can try and scan it

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.420 
looks so I guess we can try and scan it
I<00:06:31.620> don't<00:06:32.620> know<00:06:32.680> how<00:06:32.860> to<00:06:32.919> do<00:06:33.069> without<00:06:33.280> getting

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
I don't know how to do without getting
