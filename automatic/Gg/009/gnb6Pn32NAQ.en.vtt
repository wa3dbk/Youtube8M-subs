are<00:00:22.270> a<00:00:22.300> whole<00:00:22.570> bunch<00:00:22.599> of<00:00:22.840> different

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:23.169 
are a whole bunch of different

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.410 
are a whole bunch of different
variations<00:00:23.560> in<00:00:24.160> every<00:00:24.490> plastic<00:00:24.699> surgeon<00:00:24.880> has

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
variations in every plastic surgeon has

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.019 
variations in every plastic surgeon has
their<00:00:26.050> own<00:00:26.320> particular<00:00:26.740> technique<00:00:27.490> but

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
their own particular technique but

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.490 
their own particular technique but
there's<00:00:28.180> a<00:00:28.240> few<00:00:28.449> basic<00:00:28.630> principles<00:00:28.990> that

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
there's a few basic principles that

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.070 
there's a few basic principles that
everyone<00:00:29.949> follows<00:00:30.400> the<00:00:31.119> first<00:00:31.359> one<00:00:31.660> is<00:00:31.900> the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
everyone follows the first one is the

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.570 
everyone follows the first one is the
incision<00:00:32.619> now<00:00:32.830> I'm<00:00:33.010> going<00:00:33.129> to<00:00:33.190> have<00:00:33.309> you<00:00:33.400> turn

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
incision now I'm going to have you turn

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.400 
incision now I'm going to have you turn
your<00:00:33.820> head<00:00:34.030> so<00:00:35.019> the<00:00:35.350> incision<00:00:36.480> starts<00:00:37.480> at<00:00:38.170> the

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
your head so the incision starts at the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.010 
your head so the incision starts at the
root<00:00:38.800> of<00:00:38.949> the<00:00:39.100> ear<00:00:39.280> and<00:00:39.640> basically<00:00:40.600> the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
root of the ear and basically the

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.950 
root of the ear and basically the
incision<00:00:41.530> itself<00:00:41.980> is<00:00:42.250> well<00:00:42.940> hidden<00:00:43.390> in<00:00:43.780> the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.470 
natural creases of the face and for a
woman<00:00:47.770> we<00:00:48.190> generally<00:00:48.700> tend<00:00:48.879> to<00:00:49.000> hide<00:00:49.300> it

backward or extended along the hairline

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.339 
backward or extended along the hairline
sometimes<00:01:13.240> this<00:01:13.479> incision<00:01:13.990> has<00:01:14.110> also

00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:14.349 
sometimes this incision has also

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:16.770 
sometimes this incision has also
extended<00:01:14.740> into<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.429> hairline<00:01:15.729> or<00:01:16.240> it

extended into the hairline or it

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.350 
extended into the hairline or it
oftentimes<00:01:17.709> can<00:01:17.979> hug<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.459> hairline<00:01:18.849> itself

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
oftentimes can hug the hairline itself

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.190 
oftentimes can hug the hairline itself
after<00:01:20.319> the<00:01:20.560> incision<00:01:21.099> is<00:01:21.220> made<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:22.479> skin<00:01:22.929> is

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
after the incision is made the skin is

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.680 
after the incision is made the skin is
elevated<00:01:24.099> off<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.310> entire<00:01:24.970> cheek<00:01:25.450> and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
elevated off the entire cheek and

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.800 
elevated off the entire cheek and
usually<00:01:26.380> off<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.770> entire<00:01:27.069> neck<00:01:27.490> this<00:01:28.300> exposes

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
usually off the entire neck this exposes

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.050 
usually off the entire neck this exposes
the<00:01:29.140> deeper<00:01:29.470> structure<00:01:29.920> which<00:01:30.099> is<00:01:30.250> called<00:01:30.580> the

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
the deeper structure which is called the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.690 
the deeper structure which is called the
smash<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.810> what<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.170> smash<00:01:32.470> is<00:01:32.740> is<00:01:33.220> sort<00:01:33.490> of<00:01:33.580> a

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
smash and what the smash is is sort of a

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.359 
smash and what the smash is is sort of a
thick<00:01:34.030> tissue<00:01:34.420> with<00:01:35.319> a<00:01:35.349> little<00:01:35.709> bit<00:01:35.890> of<00:01:35.920> fat

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
thick tissue with a little bit of fat

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.150 
thick tissue with a little bit of fat
thus<00:01:37.300> mass<00:01:37.630> itself<00:01:38.259> is<00:01:38.560> usually<00:01:39.039> then

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
thus mass itself is usually then

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.699 
thus mass itself is usually then
tightened<00:01:39.759> or<00:01:40.030> some<00:01:40.509> of<00:01:40.630> it<00:01:40.750> is<00:01:40.869> excised<00:01:41.349> and

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
tightened or some of it is excised and

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.309 
tightened or some of it is excised and
then<00:01:41.860> pulled<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:43.149> direction<00:01:43.509> of<00:01:43.840> the

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
then pulled and the direction of the

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.650 
then pulled and the direction of the
pull<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:44.800> generally<00:01:45.459> upward<00:01:46.000> over<00:01:46.149> the<00:01:46.300> cheek

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
pull is generally upward over the cheek

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.900 
pull is generally upward over the cheek
and<00:01:46.899> backwards<00:01:47.739> behind<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.250> ear<00:01:48.459> and<00:01:48.489> this

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
and backwards behind the ear and this

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.449 
and backwards behind the ear and this
allows<00:01:49.330> for<00:01:49.989> the<00:01:50.259> structures<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.429> face

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
allows for the structures of the face

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.790 
allows for the structures of the face
that<00:01:52.090> have<00:01:52.270> descended<00:01:52.810> over<00:01:52.989> gravity<00:01:53.619> and

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
that have descended over gravity and

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.150 
that have descended over gravity and
time<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.970> be<00:01:55.090> elevated<00:01:55.690> back<00:01:55.959> into<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.770> more

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
time to be elevated back into a more

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.150 
time to be elevated back into a more
youthful<00:01:57.399> position<00:01:58.149> after<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:59.319> smash<00:01:59.860> is

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
youthful position after the smash is

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.949 
youthful position after the smash is
either<00:02:00.340> tightened<00:02:01.000> which<00:02:01.599> is<00:02:01.750> called

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
either tightened which is called

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.330 
either tightened which is called
placated<00:02:02.679> or<00:02:03.009> excised<00:02:03.759> and<00:02:04.090> lifted<00:02:05.340> sometimes

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
placated or excised and lifted sometimes

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.969 
placated or excised and lifted sometimes
the<00:02:06.879> face<00:02:07.179> is<00:02:07.420> augmented<00:02:08.050> with<00:02:08.289> fat<00:02:08.560> grafting

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
the face is augmented with fat grafting

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.250 
the face is augmented with fat grafting
so<00:02:09.280> we'll<00:02:09.459> take<00:02:09.780> liposuction<00:02:10.780> fat<00:02:11.020> from

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
so we'll take liposuction fat from

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.380 
so we'll take liposuction fat from
another<00:02:11.560> part<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.010> body<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.520> put<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.270> in

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
another part of the body and put it in

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.600 
another part of the body and put it in
the<00:02:13.510> cheeks<00:02:13.870> or<00:02:14.140> any<00:02:14.680> other<00:02:15.010> areas<00:02:15.459> that<00:02:15.550> have
