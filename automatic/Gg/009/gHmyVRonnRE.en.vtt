 solid 5 the phantom paint this was already a 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.660
 official announcement by the people of konami 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.280
 but there are even pictures of him with hero 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.340
 kojima and others that I hope to have put 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.950
 there the picture but make the voice and everything 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.930
 but what happened what is the drama now the 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.750
 drama is that the person doing the 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.410
 snake voice to those who already know david 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.960

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.059
 tares not this not in your personal account 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.420

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.190
 obviously the game which had a 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.869
 failed attempt to change formula and 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.180
 obviously people are used to 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.950
 the old formula of coca until now and 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.720
