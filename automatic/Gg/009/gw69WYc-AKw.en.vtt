 Hi, now I want to talk to you a bit about 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.870
 what is the straightening for hair of 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.389
 colored and dyed this good mark that 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.640
 we have seen previously in the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.410
 videos and well let's continue reviewing 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.090
 is the solution so that to sing or 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.070
 could be a filmmaker a hair of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.500
 colorado because we run the risk of 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.660
 cut the hair or the same in a 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.300
 I had hair that stayed dry 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.750
 the hair is the solution since I 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.030
 the less shiny hair is repaired what 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.440
 fundamental in this is the advantage that 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.030
 we have that it's easy when it comes to 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.819
 we risk not apply to us 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.739
 go to cut the hair what is 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:47.969
 fundamental that when we are going to apply 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.190
 the product has to be behind 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.829
 that super clean with a neutral shampoo or 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.280
 also a way to make a mordant 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.350
 is to apply liquid in a vial 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.989
 permanent for strong hair and 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.850
 put detergent to wash well with water 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.900
 hot since that will open me well 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.390
 the cuticle 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.850
 at 12 am pure left approximately between 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.000
 5 and 10 minutes with the product after 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.040
 Rinse dry your hair well and 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.650
 then the product is applied to a 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.890
 centimeter of the root and there are no problems 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.620
 but for effective epo then it dries with 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.260
 dryer is very dry and the fundamental 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.570
 this is the passes of plates are passed 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.610
 20 passed by wicks with the temperature 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.650
 maximum or more with a little less 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.920
 depending on whether it's a fine hair or it 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.600
 he tried to be careful 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.280
 and then if I recommend using a 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.200
 chinstrap agar the client to one for 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.180
 us and it's just an airy place 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.509
 because since it is a strong product but 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.890
 it is not a carcinogenic product has something 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.130
 Formalin but this product is 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.450
 Brazilian and it is a product that is 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.880
 allowed by the Ministry of Brazil 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.280
 but I would not recommend it and neither 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.710
 I already use in my living room so it's good 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.180
