really the way that it's called

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.590 
really the way that it's called
some<00:00:14.940> people<00:00:15.210> suggest<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:15.990> can<00:00:16.139> use<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> a

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
some people suggest that you can use a a

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.500 
some people suggest that you can use a a
paintbrush<00:00:18.710> but<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:20.039> found<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.119> these<00:00:21.300> are

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
paintbrush but I found that these are

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.290 
paintbrush but I found that these are
also<00:00:21.689> just<00:00:21.869> as<00:00:22.230> effective<00:00:22.850> what<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.180> do

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
also just as effective what you can do

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.480 
also just as effective what you can do
is<00:00:24.539> uh<00:00:24.570> these<00:00:25.170> are<00:00:25.470> some<00:00:25.769> things<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.099> are<00:00:26.369> you

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
is uh these are some things that are you

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.189 
is uh these are some things that are you
use<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:26.880> elementary<00:00:27.390> school<00:00:27.630> kindergarten

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
use in elementary school kindergarten

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.660 
use in elementary school kindergarten
these<00:00:28.769> little<00:00:29.039> things<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.490> make

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
these little things that you make

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.720 
these little things that you make
animals<00:00:30.150> out<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:31.500> reason<00:00:31.830> why<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.309> found

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
animals out of the reason why I found

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.910 
animals out of the reason why I found
this<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.180> effective<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:34.320> because<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.770> can

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
this to be effective is because you can

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.190 
this to be effective is because you can
find<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.280> anywhere<00:00:35.540> if<00:00:36.540> you're<00:00:36.750> not<00:00:36.930> close<00:00:37.140> to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
find it anywhere if you're not close to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.400 
find it anywhere if you're not close to
a<00:00:37.440> A's<00:00:37.829> art<00:00:38.489> supply<00:00:38.969> store<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.629> won't<00:00:40.170> be<00:00:40.290> able

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
a A's art supply store you won't be able

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.160 
a A's art supply store you won't be able
to<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:41.000> with<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> paintbrush<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.020> can

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
to do this with a paintbrush but you can

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.690 
to do this with a paintbrush but you can
use<00:00:43.379> these<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.680> forgot<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.250> they're<00:00:44.370> called

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
use these I forgot what they're called

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.310 
use these I forgot what they're called
but<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.480> know<00:00:45.600> what<00:00:45.750> these<00:00:45.840> are<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.140> play

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
but but you know what these are you play

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.540 
but but you know what these are you play
with<00:00:46.469> them<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.710> elementary<00:00:47.219> school<00:00:47.430> or

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
with them in elementary school or

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.240 
with them in elementary school or
whatnot<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.390> best<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:48.989> use<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.920> black

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
whatnot the best one to use is a black

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.610 
whatnot the best one to use is a black
one<00:00:50.520> because<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.570> see<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> pollen<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.469> it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
one because you can see the pollen on it

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.740 
one because you can see the pollen on it
that<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:52.890> white<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:53.910> good<00:00:54.149> contrast

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
that it's white so it's good contrast

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.290 
that it's white so it's good contrast
you<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:54.960> where<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.879> what<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.910> did<00:00:57.030> is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
you know where it is so what I did is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.240 
you know where it is so what I did is
just<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.600> bent<00:00:57.930> one<00:00:58.170> tip<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:58.920> easier<00:00:59.219> to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
just I bent one tip so it's easier to

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.580 
just I bent one tip so it's easier to
control<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.940> another<00:01:00.570> thing<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> black

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
control and another thing is get a black

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.440 
control and another thing is get a black
cup<00:01:01.980> any<00:01:02.910> any<00:01:03.359> cup<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.899> tea<00:01:04.110> cup<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.920> coffee<00:01:05.670> cup

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
cup any any cup a tea cup a coffee cup

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.320 
cup any any cup a tea cup a coffee cup
anything<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.350> they<00:01:07.590> get<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.189> dark<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.180> that

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
anything that they get is dark so that

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.910 
anything that they get is dark so that
the<00:01:09.479> pollen<00:01:09.990> when<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.260> collect<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.770> you're

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the pollen when you collect it you're

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.830 
the pollen when you collect it you're
able<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.310> see<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.670> okay<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.330> we're<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:12.780> to

way that you take the pollen out is that

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.370 
way that you take the pollen out is that
you<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.640> hit<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.909> gently<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:01.170> don't<00:02:01.229> know

you just hit it gently and I don't know

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.660 
you just hit it gently and I don't know
if<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.530> could<00:02:01.680> see<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.040> camera<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:02.640> you

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
can kind of

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.620 
can kind of
you<00:02:05.250> hit<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.460> like<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.000> get<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.240> pollen

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
been there okay so a good example of one

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.250 
been there okay so a good example of one
of<00:03:29.130> these<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:30.060> has<00:03:30.269> been<00:03:30.480> pollinated<00:03:30.840> it's

of these that has been pollinated it's

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.430 
of these that has been pollinated it's
right<00:03:31.500> here<00:03:31.910> you<00:03:32.910> can<00:03:33.090> see<00:03:33.230> that<00:03:34.230> it's

right here you can see that it's

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.100 
right here you can see that it's
effective<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.400> works<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.970> this<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:36.959> a

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110
