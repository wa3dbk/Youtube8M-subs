in<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:05.130> episode<00:00:05.430> I'll<00:00:05.790> teach<00:00:06.089> you<00:00:06.240> guys<00:00:06.390> how

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
in this episode I'll teach you guys how

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.690 
in this episode I'll teach you guys how
to<00:00:06.720> do<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.140> Borel<00:00:07.620> dragged<00:00:07.950> back<00:00:08.189> combo

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
to do the Borel dragged back combo

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.970 
to do the Borel dragged back combo
you'll<00:00:09.210> need<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.540> two-star<00:00:10.230> scale<00:00:10.469> through<00:00:10.830> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
you'll need a two-star scale through the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.249 
you'll need a two-star scale through the
Borel<00:00:11.340> drag<00:00:11.639> pack<00:00:11.880> so<00:00:12.240> let's<00:00:12.269> not<00:00:12.750> waste<00:00:12.960> any

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
Borel drag pack so let's not waste any

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.470 
Borel drag pack so let's not waste any
time<00:00:13.530> at<00:00:13.710> all<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.040> start<00:00:14.429> with<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> normal<00:00:15.179> ball

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
time at all and start with a normal ball

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.320 
time at all and start with a normal ball
roll<00:00:15.719> it's<00:00:16.440> basically<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.310> easy<00:00:17.640> skill<00:00:18.150> move

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
roll it's basically the easy skill move

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.510 
roll it's basically the easy skill move
there<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.140> can<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.890> borrow<00:00:20.189> by

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
there is so you can do the borrow by

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.400 
there is so you can do the borrow by
holding<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.119> right<00:00:21.359> stick<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.960> left<00:00:22.170> or

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
holding the right stick to the left or

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.410 
holding the right stick to the left or
to<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.769> right<00:00:22.890> if<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.580> hold<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.119> too<00:00:24.390> long

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
to the right if you hold it too long

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.960 
to the right if you hold it too long
you'll<00:00:24.900> do<00:00:25.109> multiple<00:00:25.740> bottles<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.550> row<00:00:26.670> so

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
you'll do multiple bottles in a row so

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.880 
you'll do multiple bottles in a row so
just<00:00:27.240> practice<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.930> little<00:00:28.199> bit<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.650> got

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
just practice it a little bit so you got

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.040 
just practice it a little bit so you got
the<00:00:29.010> timing<00:00:29.279> right<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.880> think<00:00:30.390> you'll<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:30.840> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the timing right I think you'll have to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.770 
the timing right I think you'll have to
hold<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.710> for<00:00:31.740> like<00:00:32.099> two<00:00:32.430> seconds<00:00:32.820> or<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.120> now

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
hold it for like two seconds or so now

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.780 
hold it for like two seconds or so now
here<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.290> where<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.500> gets<00:00:34.590> interesting<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.670> do

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
here is where it gets interesting to do

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.310 
here is where it gets interesting to do
the<00:00:35.910> ball<00:00:36.090> roll<00:00:36.300> drag<00:00:36.540> back<00:00:36.809> you'll<00:00:37.110> obviously

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
the ball roll drag back you'll obviously

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.400 
the ball roll drag back you'll obviously
need<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.129> start<00:00:38.520> with<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.850> ball<00:00:39.000> roll<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:40.200> is

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
need to start with the ball roll this is

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.990 
need to start with the ball roll this is
how<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> ball<00:00:41.190> roll<00:00:41.399> drag<00:00:41.730> back

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
how you can do the ball roll drag back

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.209 
how you can do the ball roll drag back
you'll<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.079> hold<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.469> right<00:00:43.739> stick<00:00:44.070> to

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
you'll have to hold the right stick to

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.069 
you'll have to hold the right stick to
the<00:00:44.340> right<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:44.850> two<00:00:45.090> seconds<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.780> then

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the right for two seconds and then

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.130 
the right for two seconds and then
instantly<00:00:46.860> after<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.399> hold<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.480> r-1<00:00:49.110> button

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
instantly after that hold the r-1 button

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
instantly after that hold the r-1 button
which<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.770> RB<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.670> Xbox<00:00:51.329> then<00:00:52.320> flick<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.860> left

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
which is RB on Xbox then flick the left

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.029 
which is RB on Xbox then flick the left
stick<00:00:53.370> backwards<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.210> then<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> left<00:00:55.050> you

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
stick backwards and then to the left you

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.310 
stick backwards and then to the left you
can<00:00:56.219> obviously<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.270> drag<00:00:57.510> back<00:00:57.719> into<00:00:58.109> all

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
can obviously do the drag back into all

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.470 
can obviously do the drag back into all
directions<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> think<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> most

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
directions but I think it's the most

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.200 
directions but I think it's the most
effective<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.140> cut<00:01:01.410> inside<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.940> when

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
effective to cut inside with so when

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.579 
effective to cut inside with so when
you're<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> right<00:01:03.719> wing<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.199> should<00:01:04.409> do

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
you're on the right wing you should do

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.440 
you're on the right wing you should do
the<00:01:04.739> ball<00:01:04.920> roll<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.400> right<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.150> you'll<00:01:06.299> end

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the ball roll to the right so you'll end

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.750 
the ball roll to the right so you'll end
up<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> left<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.100> showed<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.490> in

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
up to the left just like I showed you in

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.210 
up to the left just like I showed you in
the<00:01:09.030> example<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.990> I'll<00:01:10.170> show<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.590> few<00:01:10.979> clips

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the example so I'll show you a few clips

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.580 
the example so I'll show you a few clips
of<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.729> used<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.180> borrow<00:01:12.420> drag<00:01:12.810> back<00:01:13.020> it's

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
of when I used to borrow drag back it's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.499 
of when I used to borrow drag back it's
probably<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.400> scale<00:01:14.640> move<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.030> use<00:01:15.240> in

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
probably the scale move I use in

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.600 
probably the scale move I use in
basically<00:01:15.990> all<00:01:16.200> my<00:01:16.560> skill<00:01:16.830> run<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.580> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
basically all my skill run so I have a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.880 
basically all my skill run so I have a
lot<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.030> clips<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.509> choose<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.020> one<00:01:19.259> you

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
lot of clips to choose for this one you

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.620 
lot of clips to choose for this one you
should<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.490> borrow<00:01:20.670> drag<00:01:21.060> back<00:01:21.270> when<00:01:21.479> your

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
should do the borrow drag back when your

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.749 
should do the borrow drag back when your
opponent<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.290> tracking<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.950> down<00:01:22.979> looming<00:01:23.549> or

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
opponent is tracking you down looming or

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.850 
opponent is tracking you down looming or
anywhere<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> pitch<00:01:25.020> when<00:01:25.470> he<00:01:25.500> almost

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
anywhere on the pitch when he almost

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.280 
anywhere on the pitch when he almost
catched<00:01:26.610> up<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.479> should<00:01:27.689> use<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
catched up with you you should use the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.530 
catched up with you you should use the
ball<00:01:28.439> rule<00:01:28.650> drag<00:01:28.890> back<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:30.090> ahead<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
ball rule drag back just go ahead and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.480 
ball rule drag back just go ahead and
practice<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.170> few<00:01:31.439> times<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.100> practice

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
practice it a few times in the practice

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.219 
practice it a few times in the practice
arena<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.360> try<00:01:33.630> them<00:01:33.810> out<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.140> some

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
arena and then try them out in some

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.740
