use<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:05.120> Hobby<00:00:06.120> wing<00:00:06.420> programming<00:00:07.290> card<00:00:07.589> for

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
use the Hobby wing programming card for

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.089 
use the Hobby wing programming card for
your<00:00:07.980> ESC<00:00:08.760> s<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.440> I<00:00:10.440> just<00:00:10.620> wanted<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.920> show<00:00:11.040> you

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
how you hook it all up to program it

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.870 
how you hook it all up to program it
take<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.299> card<00:00:16.670> take<00:00:17.670> your<00:00:17.820> wire<00:00:19.460> put<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.580> into

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
take the card take your wire put it into

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.340 
take the card take your wire put it into
the<00:00:21.000> top<00:00:21.210> right<00:00:21.510> corner<00:00:21.810> or<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.740> says<00:00:22.920> B<00:00:23.130> EC

for number one break I have it off for

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.390 
for number one break I have it off for
battery<00:01:16.979> type<00:01:17.900> I'm<00:01:18.900> actually<00:01:19.170> going<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:20.159> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
battery type I'm actually going with a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.080

NiCad<00:01:20.939> light<00:01:21.320> or<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.650> NiCad<00:01:23.040> because<00:01:23.490> what<00:01:23.970> it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
NiCad light or the NiCad because what it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.300 
NiCad light or the NiCad because what it
does<00:01:24.470> is<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:26.030> it<00:01:27.030> shuts<00:01:27.360> off<00:01:28.040> that<00:01:29.040> power

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
does is it it shuts off that power

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.020 
does is it it shuts off that power
that's<00:01:29.670> going<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.140> you<00:01:31.140> know<00:01:31.259> give<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.590> that
