enough<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.570> get<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:33.050> good<00:02:33.800> shot<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.670> orange<00:02:34.910> on

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
enough to get a good shot that orange on

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.440 
enough to get a good shot that orange on
his<00:02:35.330> forehead<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.900> was<00:02:36.140> told<00:02:36.410> was<00:02:36.709> pollen<00:02:37.520> was

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
his forehead I was told was pollen was

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.640 
his forehead I was told was pollen was
coming<00:02:38.750> out<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.050> flowers<00:02:39.320> of<00:02:39.620> the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
coming out of the flowers of the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.760 
coming out of the flowers of the
reflects<00:02:40.490> that<00:02:40.910> he<00:02:40.970> was<00:02:41.500> putting<00:02:42.500> his<00:02:42.620> head

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
reflects that he was putting his head

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.150 
reflects that he was putting his head
into<00:02:43.070> and<00:02:43.250> taking<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.090> nectar<00:02:44.360> from

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
into and taking the nectar from

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.050 
into and taking the nectar from
originally<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.220> thought<00:02:46.400> it<00:02:46.520> was<00:02:46.610> part<00:02:46.850> of<00:02:46.910> his

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
originally I thought it was part of his

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.810 
originally I thought it was part of his
original<00:02:47.239> coloring<00:02:47.810> but<00:02:48.080> no<00:02:48.320> it's<00:02:48.500> not<00:02:48.820> now

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
original coloring but no it's not now

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.050 
original coloring but no it's not now
this<00:02:50.000> was<00:02:50.150> one<00:02:50.180> of<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.540> highlights<00:02:51.020> of<00:02:52.060> the

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
this was one of the highlights of the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.420 
this was one of the highlights of the
trip<00:02:53.300> because<00:02:53.600> really<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:54.140> didn't<00:02:54.620> expect<00:02:55.250> that

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
trip because really I didn't expect that

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.920 
trip because really I didn't expect that
I<00:02:55.580> was<00:02:55.730> going<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.030> see<00:02:56.209> one<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.510> these<00:02:56.630> boats

rare<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.380> we<00:03:06.920> were<00:03:07.040> just<00:03:07.250> walking<00:03:07.430> along<00:03:07.640> one

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
rare and we were just walking along one

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.350 
rare and we were just walking along one
of<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.120> tracks<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:09.820> even<00:03:10.820> though<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.000> wasn't

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
of the tracks and even though it wasn't

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.090 
of the tracks and even though it wasn't
that<00:03:11.450> hot<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:12.260> bird<00:03:12.440> seemed<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.830> be<00:03:12.950> enjoying

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
that hot the bird seemed to be enjoying

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.770 
that hot the bird seemed to be enjoying
the<00:03:13.550> various<00:03:14.150> some<00:03:16.120> bird<00:03:17.120> bars<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:17.660> things

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
the various some bird bars and things

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.090 
the various some bird bars and things
that<00:03:17.900> have<00:03:18.049> been<00:03:18.140> set<00:03:18.350> up<00:03:18.380> around<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.739> island

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
that have been set up around the island

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.680 
that have been set up around the island
so<00:03:19.280> here<00:03:19.970> we<00:03:20.090> were<00:03:20.180> just<00:03:20.390> sitting<00:03:20.660> there

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
so here we were just sitting there

so here we were just sitting there
waiting<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.350> hoping<00:03:21.890> some<00:03:22.220> of<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.370> birds

waiting and hoping some of the birds

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.160 
waiting and hoping some of the birds
would<00:03:22.640> come<00:03:22.850> along<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.209> this<00:03:23.480> guy<00:03:23.720> did<00:03:23.989> and

put on really quite a great performance
for<00:03:25.940> us<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:26.739> was<00:03:27.739> actually<00:03:27.890> with<00:03:28.070> a<00:03:28.130> friend<00:03:28.489> of

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610

mine who's part of forest and bird and
was<00:03:31.580> his<00:03:32.110> idea<00:03:33.110> that<00:03:33.440> we<00:03:33.530> should<00:03:33.739> go<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.600> spend

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
was his idea that we should go and spend

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.890 
was his idea that we should go and spend
the<00:03:35.750> day<00:03:35.780> on<00:03:36.110> Tori<00:03:36.590> Tori<00:03:36.769> martini<00:03:37.570> so<00:03:38.570> it<00:03:38.780> was

the day on Tori Tori martini so it was
really<00:03:39.080> good<00:03:39.350> but<00:03:39.500> this<00:03:39.769> bird<00:03:39.980> was<00:03:40.130> quite

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
really good but this bird was quite

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.330 
really good but this bird was quite
fascinating<00:03:41.170> I've<00:03:42.170> never<00:03:42.739> seen<00:03:42.980> one<00:03:43.160> of<00:03:43.250> these

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
fascinating I've never seen one of these

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.569 
fascinating I've never seen one of these
birds<00:03:43.670> before<00:03:46.780> unfortunately<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:49.130> the

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
birds before unfortunately of the the

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:50.800 
birds before unfortunately of the the
video<00:03:49.790> is<00:03:49.880> a<00:03:49.940> little<00:03:50.000> bit<00:03:50.360> out<00:03:50.480> of<00:03:50.510> focus

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
video is a little bit out of focus

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.850 
video is a little bit out of focus
because<00:03:51.700> due<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.730> my<00:03:52.940> excitement<00:03:53.329> I<00:03:53.709> zoomed<00:03:54.709> in

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
because due to my excitement I zoomed in

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.819 
because due to my excitement I zoomed in
a<00:03:54.920> little<00:03:54.980> bit<00:03:55.250> too<00:03:55.400> close<00:03:55.640> but<00:03:56.620> yeah<00:03:57.620> this<00:03:57.769> was

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
a little bit too close but yeah this was

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.069 
a little bit too close but yeah this was
probably<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.310> highlight<00:03:58.519> of<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.910> day<00:03:59.060> of

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:07.940 

spotting<00:04:03.079> this<00:04:03.200> bird

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
as you can see he put on quite a good

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:26.100 
as you can see he put on quite a good
performance<00:04:12.810> for<00:04:13.019> us

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.200 

at<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.259> time<00:04:27.470> of<00:04:27.620> taking<00:04:27.770> this<00:04:28.069> shot<00:04:28.400> or

taking this video this bird would have

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.399 
taking this video this bird would have
only<00:04:32.629> been<00:04:32.870> probably<00:04:34.599> three<00:04:35.599> meters<00:04:35.960> away

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409
