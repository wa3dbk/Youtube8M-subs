this<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.490> final<00:00:08.880> training<00:00:09.120> video<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.450> we

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
this is the final training video that we

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.350 
this is the final training video that we
want<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.929> go<00:00:10.019> over<00:00:10.230> which<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:11.000> the<00:00:12.000> probably

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
want to go over which is the probably

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.970 
want to go over which is the probably
most<00:00:12.389> advanced<00:00:13.019> way<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.290> training<00:00:13.740> which<00:00:13.860> is

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
most advanced way of training which is

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.650 
most advanced way of training which is
when<00:00:14.130> you're<00:00:14.280> hitting<00:00:14.429> live<00:00:14.940> ball<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.480> live

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
when you're hitting live ball to live

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.540 
when you're hitting live ball to live
ball<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.049> second<00:00:16.410> what<00:00:16.920> I'm<00:00:17.010> going<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.310> is

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
ball in a second what I'm going to do is

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.010 
ball in a second what I'm going to do is
all<00:00:17.970> we're<00:00:18.119> gonna<00:00:18.210> do<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.420> work<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.660> hitting

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
all we're gonna do is work on hitting

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.870 
all we're gonna do is work on hitting
cross<00:00:19.350> courts<00:00:19.890> I'm<00:00:20.100> gonna<00:00:20.430> continue<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.789> work

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
cross courts I'm gonna continue to work

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.490 
cross courts I'm gonna continue to work
on<00:00:21.180> hitting<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.630> ball<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.840> my<00:00:21.960> strike<00:00:22.230> zone

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
on hitting the ball in my strike zone

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.189 
on hitting the ball in my strike zone
and<00:00:22.710> because<00:00:23.670> we're<00:00:24.449> going<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.930> be<00:00:25.019> hitting

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
and because we're going to be hitting

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.230 
and because we're going to be hitting
cross<00:00:25.529> courts<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> lot<00:00:26.580> more<00:00:26.609> things

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
cross courts you have a lot more things

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.939 
cross courts you have a lot more things
to<00:00:27.420> deal<00:00:27.660> with<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:28.260> know<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.500> went<00:00:28.650> from<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
to deal with you know we went from the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.740 
to deal with you know we went from the
volleying<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.820> me<00:00:29.939> being<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.240> baseline

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
volleying to me being on the baseline

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.749 
volleying to me being on the baseline
now<00:00:30.929> baseline<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> baseline<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.340> both<00:00:32.550> have

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
now baseline the baseline we both have

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.100 
now baseline the baseline we both have
to<00:00:32.880> control<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.270> put<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> certain

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
to control it put it in a certain

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.810 
to control it put it in a certain
location<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:35.160> know<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.610> great

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
location you know this is a great

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.549 
location you know this is a great
practice<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.390> get<00:00:36.570> out<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.960> hit<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> lot<00:00:37.440> of

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
practice to get out and hit a lot of

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.709 
practice to get out and hit a lot of
cross<00:00:37.770> courts<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.340> also<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.420> make<00:00:39.540> this

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
cross courts and also you can make this

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.560 
cross courts and also you can make this
drill<00:00:39.930> as<00:00:40.280> advanced<00:00:41.280> as<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.910> want<00:00:42.180> meaning

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
drill as advanced as you want meaning

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.660 
drill as advanced as you want meaning
that<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.170> go<00:00:43.320> let's<00:00:43.680> say<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.129> combination

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that we can go let's say a combination

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.790 
that we can go let's say a combination
of<00:00:45.210> three<00:00:45.450> cross<00:00:45.690> courts<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.260> down<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.620> line

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
of three cross courts one down the line

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.190 
of three cross courts one down the line
we<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.430> go<00:00:47.640> three<00:00:48.239> cross<00:00:48.480> courts<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:48.989> down

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
we can go three cross courts one down

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.900 
we can go three cross courts one down
the<00:00:49.320> line<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:49.860> she<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.550> take<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> ball

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the line and then she can take the ball

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.549 
the line and then she can take the ball
cross<00:00:51.210> court<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.690> we're<00:00:51.899> back<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.350> doing

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
cross court and we're back in to doing

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.990 
cross court and we're back in to doing
the<00:00:52.710> same<00:00:52.739> thing<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> backhand<00:00:53.610> side<00:00:53.820> as

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the same thing on the backhand side as

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.720 
the same thing on the backhand side as
well<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.860> make<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.250> drill<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.520> come

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
well so you can make this drill and come

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.189 
well so you can make this drill and come
up<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:56.969> an<00:00:57.300> infinite<00:00:57.719> number<00:00:58.170> of

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
up with an infinite number of

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.500 
up with an infinite number of
possibility<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.250> combinations<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.359> you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
possibility and combinations that you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.860 
possibility and combinations that you
use<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.199> better<00:01:02.359> now<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.420> biggest<00:01:03.690> thing

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
use to get better now the biggest thing

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.299 
use to get better now the biggest thing
you<00:01:04.019> want<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.470> when<00:01:04.799> you're<00:01:04.890> trying<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.189> hit

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
we're trying to get better here and to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.149 
we're trying to get better here and to
get<00:01:15.360> better<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.020> find<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.590> common

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
get better you have to find a common

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.399 
get better you have to find a common
ground<00:01:17.580> where<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.299> both<00:01:18.509> work<00:01:18.869> at<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.140> speed

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
ground where we can both work at a speed

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.980 
ground where we can both work at a speed
that<00:01:19.619> helps<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.490> get<00:01:20.580> better<00:01:20.790> now<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.750> know

that helps you to get better now I know
we<00:01:22.200> talked<00:01:22.409> about<00:01:22.560> hitting<00:01:22.740> bigger<00:01:23.040> four

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
we talked about hitting bigger four

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.100 
we talked about hitting bigger four
hands<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.790> more<00:01:23.880> power<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> thing<00:01:25.049> about

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
hands and more power but the thing about

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.050 
hands and more power but the thing about
tennis<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.650> making<00:01:26.070> balls<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.850> go

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
tennis is making balls so you have to go

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.120 
tennis is making balls so you have to go
and<00:01:27.330> hit<00:01:27.780> maybe<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.080> bigger<00:01:28.320> forehand<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:28.979> in

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and hit maybe a bigger forehand with in

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.429 
and hit maybe a bigger forehand with in
the<00:01:29.220> speed<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:30.060> make<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.140> drill

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
the speed you can make but in this drill

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.990 
the speed you can make but in this drill
in<00:01:31.950> particular<00:01:32.400> we're<00:01:32.549> talking<00:01:32.790> about

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
in particular we're talking about

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.510
