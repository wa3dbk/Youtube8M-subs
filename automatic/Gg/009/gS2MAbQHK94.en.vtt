 The event also visited and 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.050

 I will paint the walls for the time being 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.800
 Medvedev tries himself in trendy art 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.599
 the course of graffiti in the tent where will 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.130
 pass the meeting itself to her actively 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.050
 preparing someone in prayer 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.059
 lonely again and again pronounces 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.340
 your question and someone at all prepared 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.250
 cheat sheet worried it is understandable not 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.390
 every day there is a chance to communicate with 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.610
 prime minister excitement vanishes 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.739
 when the guest himself enters the tent 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.629
 plaid shirt in sneakers and conditionally 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.180
 one of the forum participants is waving at 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.489
 the offer to sit down is what to communicate 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.949
 will cost and the first question from the most 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.320
 representative delegation from Dagestan 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.170
 Is it possible to create conditions for labor 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.809
 migrations from central and maybe 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.850
 northern regions to the north caucasus this 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.100
 it would be simple and cultural 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.159
 communication and sharing is not experience just 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.810
 very big step aspen people are leaving 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.580
 work in other parts of Russia but also 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.150
 to come to the North Caucasus with 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.740
 other places 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.710
 what otherwise just isn't 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.740
 will be a normal cultural exchange well 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.689
 and what to hide 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.570
 a good specialist from Moscow after all and 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.540
 Dagestan and any other region 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.220
 North Caucasus would not be superfluous for 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.680
 it is necessary to create normal conditions 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.509
 just create the conditions for 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.549
 attractive labor to 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.439
 the salary was normal but also to engage 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.650
 solving those issues that are on 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.020
 North Caucasus including questions of the same 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.299
 security unemployment itself too 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.310
 our guys wondered why 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.409
 Domestic flights for Russians 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.299
 often costs more than foreign 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.220
 inflated ticket prices as one of 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.869
 barriers between national intercourse 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.700
 sums up the premier added 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.170
 already developed programs that 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.119
 provide a discount system 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.159
 if not for all who for a certain 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.469
 categories of citizens one more issues 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.630
 Dagestanis you, too, with the words why 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.330
 expensive than connected increase in gasoline prices 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.510
 Russia is one of the leading countries in the world 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.430
 oil export from lecturing intonation 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.200
 Medvedev answers the question of a young 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.000
 Dagestanis obviously tired of 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.130
 extortionate gas prices 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.080
 but I do not promise you paradise 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.530
 regret it is an objective economic 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.900
 the process of rising prices will slow down and may even 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.170
 crash down but on one condition 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.940
 if tomorrow crash oil prices it 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.250
 for our country even more offense than 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.599
 rising gas prices 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.730
 stated topic of the meeting information 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.739
 technology but it was young people interested 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.959
 will be the least asked a lot 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.920
 social issues talked even more 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.870
 about education 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.269
 because almost all forum members 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.920
 these are students and some are not yet 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:03:01.750

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:03.910
 called and g 2 hours that the meeting lasted 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.769
