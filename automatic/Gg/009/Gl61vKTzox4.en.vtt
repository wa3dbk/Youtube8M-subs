00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.300
 training a little differently than usual 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.030
 Professional preparation in Ireland 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.360
 and that includes the Irish 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.900
 So the normal ball from in 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.900
 the bag 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:31.260
 the balls are different of course 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.510
 It is unfamiliar of advantage that we 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.670
 The balls have now as he 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.560
 behaves in flood balls by who pass 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.260
 jumps are already different 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.450
 move 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.820
 a novelty the training camera on 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.400
 a twelve meter high tripod 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.400
 not quite so easy 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.220
 two workouts and in the morning 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.650
 Technique training fun units with the 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.729
 part of the players on sunday not in the 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.939
 were used 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:28.670
 aim at all exercises against the game 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:30.770
 ireland a heavy game i believe 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.810
 think your country is known for that 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.930
 they are incredibly strong fight yes it 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.670
 I do not think they are not the ones 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.130
 The best technician there is , I said 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.560
 time in european football but me 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.060
 think no team drives milan 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.920
 and said here come the beat we 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.080
 now 450 summer uncomfortable too 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.640
 play and we have to counter it 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.500
 footballing we are better but we 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.819
 must be combative of the attitude 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.819
 then hold against it would win 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.689
 at the end of the training work continues on 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:14.180
 Camera tripod for the tactical units 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:18.099
 in the afternoon with may then press time 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.099
 among other things with mesut Ã¶zil 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.280
 17 o'clock second training session and it 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.280
 everything works with the built-tripod 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.340
 90 minutes of intensive training everything 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.340
 watched from the very top
