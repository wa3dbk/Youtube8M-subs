00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.569 
is it for my under eye circles and I've
really<00:00:51.539> bad<00:00:51.660> dark<00:00:52.170> under<00:00:52.440> eye<00:00:52.469> circles<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.190> it

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
really bad dark under eye circles so it

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.090 
really bad dark under eye circles so it
pretty<00:00:54.210> much<00:00:54.329> helps<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> lot<00:00:55.410> i<00:00:55.440> think<00:00:55.920> i

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
think it lasts a lot longer than any

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.930 
think it lasts a lot longer than any

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
none of them were the best and I always

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.300 
none of them were the best and I always
went<00:04:19.300> back<00:04:19.480> to<00:04:19.660> this<00:04:19.810> one<00:04:20.080> so<00:04:20.709> this<00:04:21.040> is

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
went back to this one so this is

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.910 
went back to this one so this is
actually<00:04:21.910> out<00:04:22.540> of<00:04:22.570> makeup<00:04:22.960> removers<00:04:23.530> but<00:04:23.770> they

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
actually out of makeup removers but they

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.870 
actually out of makeup removers but they
just<00:04:24.130> come<00:04:24.280> in<00:04:24.400> here<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:24.820> yeah<00:04:25.240> there<00:04:25.600> I<00:04:26.050> mean
