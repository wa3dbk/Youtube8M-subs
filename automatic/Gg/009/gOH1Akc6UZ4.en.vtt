00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.080

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.539

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.160

 we make songs for it's time to throw and I 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.359
 a little bomb prepared for you 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.949
 but more about that later I defended my diploma 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.619
 literally here a few days ago I 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.840
 now a certified screenwriter if 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.239
 you need to spoil the movie or your show 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.730
 call me I'll ruin everything 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.370
 during the defense you are my dear friends 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.230
 supported congratulated when the diploma 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.210
 protected you there were so many so many 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.980
 greetings 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.480
 wishes good luck and other stuff 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.420
 thank you very much and now bomber if 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.140
 you also watch what movie above i 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.059
 was here 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.949
 I wish I could be here like us in 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.100
 it sounds bad I'm not here 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.229
 I do not know how you used to you maybe 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.470
 have seen the recently released official 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.470
 dubbed trailer for this film and i 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.619
 I must say that the trailer was duplicated 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.810
 just terribly straight very badly called 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.630
 professional actors but the bill 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.189
 there is no direction and there is no sound processing and 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.020
 on every detail there are misses and mistakes 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.869
 insulting because well with us 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.119
 few poorly duplicated trailers 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.150
 or films to not so much of them but 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.610
 just because so much noise around it 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.229
 the film is still on the Internet expect the same 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.329
 managed Zach Braff happened if he had 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.930
 work out the money he collected 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.610
 on crowdfunding on the kickstarter everyone is waiting 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.640
 eager to know what happened 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.250
 film high expectations and suddenly 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.500
 it turns out so strangely made 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.450
 trailer hope in movie theaters such 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.610
 certainly will not be in the studio 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.469
 didn't have time maybe no money 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.770
 late with anyone does not happen but still 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.600
 a little bit unpleasant and we guys on 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.270
 the studios thought why don't we 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.520
 make your version of the trailer 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.230
 because we can but we didn't have 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.870
 true minus and that is the track of 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.910
 trailer without votes and so us 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.490
 I had to make a minus myself anew and 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.750
 it turned out that at the beginning of the trailer there 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.610
 there is a brute force 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.880
 he cannot get anywhere, and therefore our 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.650
 sound engineer martin serga leona and not 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.160
 I know how under what nickname you know him 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.110
 he asked his friend Dmitry Rybin 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.760
 re-record this brute force guitar and he 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.530
 did it and now we have in the trailer 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.840
 your guitar bust is the same as in 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.050
 the original is very cool we did 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.240
 minus we called the actors for your money 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.010
 because we want what happened cool 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.830
 I unfortunately in the voice acting itself is not 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.130
 participated took part in laying 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.120
 text to text hit the lips 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.920
 foreign actors on screen 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.600
 a little bit directed but so quite 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.490
 a little bit and the result is you actually 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.110
 saying can see now here now 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.210
 here somewhere there will be a link 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.560
 maybe in the description maybe I don't know 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.420
 where you look at the link necessarily 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.400
 will you can see what 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.200
 It turned out and I hope you enjoy it and 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.060
 I think we managed much better 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.340
 so leave comments and 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.070
 spread this trailer 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.940
 I will be very grateful to you and I hope 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.700
 that henceforth the rental will be intently 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.670
 follow up with what they have in the end 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.530
 It turns out thank you very much and I hope 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.530
 we will hear everything soon 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.660
 and
