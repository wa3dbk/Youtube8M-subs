00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.659
 good for me it's a big challenge and it's a 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.909
 event of great importance and a 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.250
 great commitment not only to be 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.380

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.840

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.520

 simply that commitment I believe 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.460
 that is unavoidable is also a 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.430
 responsibility that we have with the country 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.799

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.550
 responsibility already as you said
