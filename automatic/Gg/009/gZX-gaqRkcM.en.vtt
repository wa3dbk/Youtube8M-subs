00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
he had a very good game I he he I don't

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.439 
he had a very good game I he he I don't
really<00:00:49.890> normally<00:00:50.070> watch<00:00:50.640> him<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.120> don't<00:00:51.360> really

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
really normally watch him I don't really

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.819 
really normally watch him I don't really
normally<00:00:51.629> watch<00:00:51.899> around<00:00:52.170> Madrid<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.590> stuff

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
normally watch around Madrid and stuff

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.680 
normally watch around Madrid and stuff
like<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.129> or<00:00:53.250> Germany<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.270> just<00:00:54.510> sawed

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
like that or Germany but I just sawed

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.869 
like that or Germany but I just sawed
let's<00:00:54.840> watch<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.379> he<00:00:55.980> paid<00:00:56.190> really<00:00:56.610> really

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
let's watch it and he paid really really

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.970 
let's watch it and he paid really really
well<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.719> think<00:00:58.289> he<00:00:58.440> actually<00:00:58.559> deserves

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
well I I do think he actually deserves

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.740 
well I I do think he actually deserves
this

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
this

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.840 
this
maybe<00:01:00.750> Azul<00:01:01.379> maybe<00:01:01.949> has<00:01:02.190> deserved<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
maybe Azul maybe has deserved it a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.870 
maybe Azul maybe has deserved it a
little<00:01:03.059> bit<00:01:03.329> but<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> think<00:01:04.080> Dara<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:05.220> scraped

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
little bit but I think Dara just scraped

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.130 
little bit but I think Dara just scraped
it<00:01:06.060> through<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.570> as<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.840> see<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.049> the

ahead<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.570> 83<00:01:19.140> don't<00:01:19.860> think<00:01:20.009> he's<00:01:20.130> gonna<00:01:20.220> go

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
ahead of 83 don't think he's gonna go

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.539 
ahead of 83 don't think he's gonna go
for<00:01:20.580> too<00:01:20.820> much<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.930> think<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:23.189> use<00:01:23.340> him

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
for too much but I think if you use him

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.969 
for too much but I think if you use him
right<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.939> think<00:01:24.210> he'll<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.360> very<00:01:24.600> good<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
right I think he'll be very good but the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.410 
right I think he'll be very good but the
only<00:01:26.100> thing<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.460> don't<00:01:26.700> really<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.119> using

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
only thing is I don't really not using

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.819 
only thing is I don't really not using
certain<00:01:27.630> transmit<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:28.470> they're<00:01:28.590> kind<00:01:28.770> of

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
certain transmit I think they're kind of

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.780 
certain transmit I think they're kind of
wasted<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.880> game<00:01:30.200> but<00:01:31.200> then<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.310> some

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
wasted in the game but then in some

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.429 
wasted in the game but then in some
people<00:01:33.329> might<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.630> him<00:01:33.840> some<00:01:34.049> people<00:01:34.290> might

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
people might like him some people might

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.100 
people might like him some people might
