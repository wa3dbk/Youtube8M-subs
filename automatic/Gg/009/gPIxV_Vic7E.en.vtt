00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:21.199 
fingers on the fact is that he did say

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:23.470 
fingers on the fact is that he did say
at<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.709> peak<00:02:21.889> performance<00:02:22.340> wing<00:02:22.519> will<00:02:23.090> be<00:02:23.120> a

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
at the peak performance wing will be a

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.710 
at the peak performance wing will be a
tremendous<00:02:23.989> asset<00:02:24.919> and<00:02:25.430> probably<00:02:26.329> about<00:02:26.570> the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
tremendous asset and probably about the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.950 
tremendous asset and probably about the
old

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
old

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.350 
old
way<00:02:27.110> with<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.770> spine<00:02:28.070> fusion<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:29.000> think<00:02:29.240> as

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
way with the spine fusion and I think as

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.660 
way with the spine fusion and I think as
well<00:02:29.540> as<00:02:29.690> any<00:02:29.870> other<00:02:30.110> back<00:02:31.100> issues<00:02:31.490> that

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
well as any other back issues that

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.730 
well as any other back issues that
people<00:02:31.820> have<00:02:32.000> had<00:02:32.240> to<00:02:32.480> be<00:02:32.810> able<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.080> have<00:02:33.500> back

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
people have had to be able to have back

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.000 
people have had to be able to have back
issues<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.150> still<00:02:35.390> swing<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:36.530> golf

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
issues and and and still swing a golf

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.640 
issues and and and still swing a golf
club<00:02:37.340> with<00:02:37.970> little<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.390> no<00:02:38.420> pain<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.080> stand

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
club with little to no pain and stand

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.200 
club with little to no pain and stand
and<00:02:39.890> on<00:02:40.010> top<00:02:40.220> of<00:02:40.250> that<00:02:40.460> hit<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.820> ball<00:02:40.970> more

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
and on top of that hit the ball more

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.440 
and on top of that hit the ball more
solid<00:02:41.600> straight<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:43.000> consistent<00:02:44.000> which<00:02:44.300> is

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
solid straight and consistent which is

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.150 
solid straight and consistent which is
what<00:02:44.600> golf's<00:02:44.900> all<00:02:45.020> about<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.980> key<00:02:46.130> is

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
what golf's all about and so the key is

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.410 
what golf's all about and so the key is
is<00:02:46.460> that<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:47.980> playing<00:02:48.980> golf<00:02:49.420> naturally

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
is that is that playing golf naturally

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.640 
is that is that playing golf naturally
everybody<00:02:50.630> does<00:02:51.020> it<00:02:51.140> for<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.320> number<00:02:51.470> of

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
everybody does it for a number of

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.080 
everybody does it for a number of
reasons<00:02:51.740> one<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.280> them<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.610> fun<00:02:52.820> will<00:02:53.030> exercise

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
reasons one of them is fun will exercise

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.420 
reasons one of them is fun will exercise
companionship<00:02:56.090> with<00:02:56.330> with<00:02:56.540> friends<00:02:56.930> and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
companionship with with friends and

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.950 
companionship with with friends and
family<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.850> go<00:02:58.970> play<00:02:59.210> with<00:02:59.240> and<00:02:59.600> it's

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
family that you go play with and it's

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.050 
family that you go play with and it's
it's<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.200> great<00:03:00.230> way<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.620> get<00:03:01.040> exercising<00:03:01.880> and

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
it's a great way to get exercising and

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.480 
it's a great way to get exercising and
hopefully<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:02.930> helps<00:03:03.290> they<00:03:03.410> fit<00:03:03.740> as<00:03:03.860> well<00:03:04.340> as

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
hopefully it helps they fit as well as

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.460 
hopefully it helps they fit as well as
challenge<00:03:04.910> your<00:03:05.090> your<00:03:05.540> skills<00:03:05.870> levels<00:03:06.260> and

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
challenge your your skills levels and

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.680 
challenge your your skills levels and
and<00:03:07.070> we<00:03:07.520> all<00:03:07.670> play<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:08.000> for<00:03:08.150> different<00:03:08.270> reasons

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
and we all play it for different reasons

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.970 
and we all play it for different reasons
so<00:03:08.750> we<00:03:08.870> all<00:03:08.960> play<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.350> different<00:03:09.500> levels

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
so we all play it to different levels

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.560 
so we all play it to different levels
but<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.460> point<00:03:10.670> is<00:03:10.820> is<00:03:10.970> if<00:03:11.120> we<00:03:11.330> are<00:03:11.360> playing

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
but the point is is if we are playing

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.960 
but the point is is if we are playing
golf<00:03:11.930> just<00:03:12.920> for<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.160> fact<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.520> playing<00:03:13.760> golf

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
golf just for the fact of playing golf

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.510 
golf just for the fact of playing golf
the<00:03:14.720> key<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.350> most<00:03:15.530> important<00:03:15.920> factor<00:03:16.220> is<00:03:16.370> is

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
the key the most important factor is is

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.700 
the key the most important factor is is
that<00:03:16.670> that<00:03:16.850> you<00:03:17.450> shouldn't<00:03:17.780> your<00:03:18.200> golf<00:03:18.560> swing

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
that that you shouldn't your golf swing

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.310 
that that you shouldn't your golf swing
shouldn't<00:03:19.220> be<00:03:19.370> hurting<00:03:20.120> your<00:03:20.240> body<00:03:20.480> whether

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
shouldn't be hurting your body whether

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.930 
shouldn't be hurting your body whether
you<00:03:21.500> don't<00:03:21.830> have<00:03:21.980> any<00:03:22.130> issues<00:03:22.490> and<00:03:22.670> especially

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
you don't have any issues and especially

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.960 
you don't have any issues and especially
if<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:23.270> do<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.830> key<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.430> key<00:03:25.460> that<00:03:25.760> we

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
if you do and so the key the key that we

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.410 
if you do and so the key the key that we
know<00:03:26.150> that<00:03:26.420> that<00:03:27.700> sets<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.850> peak<00:03:29.000> performance

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
know that that sets the peak performance

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.090 
know that that sets the peak performance
golf<00:03:29.630> swing<00:03:29.810> apart<00:03:30.110> from<00:03:30.230> any<00:03:30.410> other<00:03:30.470> swing<00:03:30.920> is

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
golf swing apart from any other swing is

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.520 
golf swing apart from any other swing is
the<00:03:31.370> fact<00:03:31.730> that<00:03:31.820> it<00:03:32.000> is<00:03:32.120> 100%<00:03:32.870> founded<00:03:33.440> on

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
the fact that it is 100% founded on

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.770 
the fact that it is 100% founded on
physics<00:03:33.920> founded<00:03:34.310> on<00:03:34.400> physiology<00:03:34.780> blended

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
physics founded on physiology blended

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.330 
physics founded on physiology blended
together<00:03:35.930> it's<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.350> only<00:03:36.530> swing<00:03:36.860> that<00:03:37.010> blends

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
together it's the only swing that blends

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.890 
together it's the only swing that blends
to<00:03:37.430> both<00:03:37.550> physics<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.090> physiology<00:03:38.600> together

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
to both physics and physiology together

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.280 
to both physics and physiology together
to<00:03:39.380> produce<00:03:39.560> a<00:03:39.860> swing<00:03:40.100> that<00:03:40.580> that<00:03:40.910> is

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
to produce a swing that that is

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.750 
to produce a swing that that is
basically<00:03:42.290> stressed<00:03:43.040> pretty<00:03:43.610> much

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
basically stressed pretty much

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.090 
basically stressed pretty much
stress-free<00:03:44.270> and<00:03:44.540> therefore<00:03:45.350> for<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.920> most

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
stress-free and therefore for the most

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.680 
stress-free and therefore for the most
part<00:03:46.340> in<00:03:46.520> that<00:03:46.640> case<00:03:46.850> will<00:03:47.060> be<00:03:47.180> injury<00:03:47.480> free

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
part in that case will be injury free

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.260 
part in that case will be injury free
from<00:03:47.930> from<00:03:48.500> issues<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.790> are<00:03:49.910> caused<00:03:50.090> by

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
from from issues that are caused by

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.870 
from from issues that are caused by
stress<00:03:50.600> and<00:03:50.840> why<00:03:51.320> is<00:03:51.380> that<00:03:51.530> well<00:03:51.950> because<00:03:52.460> the

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
stress and why is that well because the

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.790 
stress and why is that well because the
peak<00:03:53.060> performance<00:03:53.510> golf<00:03:53.720> swing<00:03:53.960> is<00:03:54.170> is<00:03:54.410> the

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
peak performance golf swing is is the

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.260 
peak performance golf swing is is the
only<00:03:54.950> swing<00:03:55.250> that<00:03:55.430> believes<00:03:55.730> in<00:03:55.880> a<00:03:55.970> limited

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
only swing that believes in a limited

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.800 
only swing that believes in a limited
turn<00:03:56.570> and<00:03:57.290> limited<00:03:57.800> turn<00:03:58.180> means<00:03:59.180> that<00:03:59.300> we<00:03:59.570> turn

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
turn and limited turn means that we turn

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.930 
turn and limited turn means that we turn
only<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.530> toe<00:04:00.680> line<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.460> if<00:04:01.610> I<00:04:01.760> was

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
swing behind the tow line and as you all

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.689 
swing behind the tow line and as you all
know<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.259> straight<00:04:52.560> line<00:04:52.800> across<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.460> toes

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
know the straight line across the toes

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.820 
know the straight line across the toes
is<00:04:53.940> what<00:04:54.360> I<00:04:54.389> call<00:04:54.690> everything<00:04:55.080> behind<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:55.740> is

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
is what I call everything behind it is

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.710 
is what I call everything behind it is
what<00:04:55.860> I<00:04:56.009> call<00:04:56.070> the<00:04:56.400> sacred<00:04:56.580> burial<00:04:57.060> ground<00:04:57.150> the

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
what I call the sacred burial ground the

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.999 
what I call the sacred burial ground the
rule<00:04:57.870> is<00:04:58.050> you<00:04:58.080> may<00:04:58.289> stand<00:04:58.500> in<00:04:58.680> it<00:04:58.800> but<00:04:58.949> if

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
rule is you may stand in it but if

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:00.170 
rule is you may stand in it but if
you're<00:04:59.130> swinging<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.580> you're<00:04:59.729> dead

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
you're swinging it you're dead

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.870 
you're swinging it you're dead
and<00:05:00.270> so<00:05:00.810> we<00:05:01.229> have<00:05:01.380> a<00:05:01.410> limited<00:05:01.889> turn<00:05:02.039> swing<00:05:02.370> so

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
and so we have a limited turn swing so

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.300 
and so we have a limited turn swing so
the<00:05:03.120> question<00:05:03.479> then<00:05:03.660> becomes<00:05:03.780> is<00:05:04.259> if<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:05.070> golf

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
the question then becomes is if the golf

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.480 
the question then becomes is if the golf
swing<00:05:05.460> has<00:05:05.820> taught<00:05:06.690> in<00:05:07.020> believe<00:05:07.500> vite<00:05:07.800> at

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
swing has taught in believe vite at

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.460 
swing has taught in believe vite at
least<00:05:08.729> probably<00:05:09.030> 99%<00:05:09.600> of<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.960> golfers<00:05:10.320> and

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
least probably 99% of the golfers and

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.080 
least probably 99% of the golfers and
teachers<00:05:10.770> in<00:05:10.889> the<00:05:10.979> world<00:05:11.009> is<00:05:11.370> that<00:05:11.820> power

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
teachers in the world is that power

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.060 
teachers in the world is that power
comes<00:05:12.389> from<00:05:12.570> this<00:05:12.720> huge<00:05:13.169> rotation<00:05:13.860> in<00:05:13.979> the

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
comes from this huge rotation in the

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.029 
comes from this huge rotation in the
backswing<00:05:14.490> and<00:05:14.699> then<00:05:15.090> you<00:05:15.210> snap<00:05:15.690> you<00:05:16.500> turn

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
backswing and then you snap you turn

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.890 
backswing and then you snap you turn
your<00:05:17.220> body<00:05:17.400> as<00:05:17.580> fast<00:05:17.880> as<00:05:18.030> you<00:05:18.120> can<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:18.660> pull

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
your body as fast as you can to pull

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.629 
your body as fast as you can to pull
your<00:05:19.020> arms<00:05:19.289> down<00:05:19.410> and<00:05:19.620> through<00:05:19.830> power<00:05:20.340> comes

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
your arms down and through power comes

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.640 
your arms down and through power comes
from<00:05:20.699> the<00:05:20.880> shoes<00:05:21.060> rotation<00:05:21.690> well<00:05:22.169> since<00:05:22.500> we

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
from the shoes rotation well since we

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.350 
from the shoes rotation well since we
don't<00:05:22.680> have<00:05:23.039> the<00:05:23.190> huge<00:05:23.370> huge<00:05:23.639> rotation<00:05:24.240> with

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
does our power come from well again as

does our power come from well again as

body<00:05:31.080> friendly<00:05:31.440> swing<00:05:31.650> but<00:05:31.800> it's<00:05:31.949> also<00:05:32.130> the

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
body friendly swing but it's also the

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.960 
body friendly swing but it's also the
the<00:05:33.320> energy<00:05:34.320> efficient<00:05:34.770> golf<00:05:34.979> swing<00:05:35.190> it<00:05:35.639> is<00:05:35.789> it

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
the energy efficient golf swing it is it

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.640 
the energy efficient golf swing it is it
is<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.210> green<00:05:36.479> golf<00:05:36.720> swing<00:05:37.020> as<00:05:37.169> to<00:05:37.320> go<00:05:37.470> with

is the green golf swing as to go with

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.790 
is the green golf swing as to go with
Martin<00:05:38.160> terms<00:05:38.490> because<00:05:39.240> we<00:05:39.440> get<00:05:40.440> our<00:05:40.560> power

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
Martin terms because we get our power

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
Martin terms because we get our power
from<00:05:40.889> a<00:05:41.130> different<00:05:41.340> source

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
from a different source

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.570 
from a different source
in<00:05:42.240> and<00:05:42.780> we<00:05:42.990> get<00:05:43.169> our<00:05:43.289> power<00:05:43.530> from<00:05:43.650> holding<00:05:44.490> the

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
in and we get our power from holding the

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.189 
in and we get our power from holding the
body<00:05:44.760> more<00:05:45.060> still<00:05:45.360> so<00:05:45.539> we<00:05:45.630> can<00:05:45.780> swing<00:05:46.020> our<00:05:46.169> arms

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
body more still so we can swing our arms

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.310 
body more still so we can swing our arms
faster<00:05:46.830> centrifugal<00:05:47.310> force<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:48.199> concept<00:05:49.199> is

faster centrifugal force the concept is

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.990 
faster centrifugal force the concept is

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
the peak performance golf swing is this

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.140 
the peak performance golf swing is this
is<00:06:01.470> the<00:06:01.590> rock<00:06:01.770> the<00:06:01.979> club<00:06:02.190> heads<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.520> rock<00:06:02.699> the

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
is the rock the club heads the rock the

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.649 
is the rock the club heads the rock the
shaft<00:06:03.479> and<00:06:03.750> your<00:06:04.080> forward<00:06:04.440> arm<00:06:04.590> is<00:06:04.970> the<00:06:05.970> is<00:06:06.180> the

string and then in the backswing and in

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.700 
string and then in the backswing and in
the<00:06:08.760> follow-through<00:06:09.090> the<00:06:09.750> shaft<00:06:10.050> the<00:06:10.530> head

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
the follow-through the shaft the head

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.320 
the follow-through the shaft the head
front<00:06:11.039> and<00:06:11.190> the<00:06:11.250> shaft<00:06:11.490> inner<00:06:11.760> and<00:06:11.909> the

front and the shaft inner and the

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.149 
front and the shaft inner and the
trailing<00:06:12.840> on<00:06:13.110> the<00:06:13.260> background<00:06:13.680> becomes<00:06:13.979> the

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
trailing on the background becomes the

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:16.339 
trailing on the background becomes the
strength<00:06:14.820> and<00:06:15.000> then<00:06:15.360> your<00:06:15.510> body<00:06:15.720> your<00:06:16.050> entire

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
strength and then your body your entire

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.320 
strength and then your body your entire
body<00:06:16.620> is<00:06:16.919> the<00:06:17.039> hand<00:06:17.280> so<00:06:17.699> when<00:06:17.880> we<00:06:18.000> want<00:06:18.240> to

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
body is the hand so when we want to

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.230 
body is the hand so when we want to
swing<00:06:18.570> a<00:06:18.780> rock<00:06:19.169> faster<00:06:19.740> we<00:06:20.190> we<00:06:20.610> move<00:06:20.849> our<00:06:21.000> body

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
swing a rock faster we we move our body

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.600 
swing a rock faster we we move our body
less<00:06:21.599> so<00:06:22.289> same<00:06:22.590> concept<00:06:23.039> is<00:06:23.190> rocking<00:06:23.550> a

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
less so same concept is rocking a

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.159 
less so same concept is rocking a
strength<00:06:23.909> so<00:06:24.330> that's<00:06:24.510> why<00:06:24.659> we<00:06:24.840> have<00:06:24.990> the

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
strength so that's why we have the

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.350 
strength so that's why we have the
narrow<00:06:25.560> stance<00:06:25.919> the<00:06:26.520> wide<00:06:26.729> knees<00:06:26.909> outward

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
narrow stance the wide knees outward

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.939 
narrow stance the wide knees outward
pressure<00:06:27.570> we<00:06:27.870> resist<00:06:28.260> the<00:06:28.349> movement<00:06:28.620> of<00:06:28.860> the

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:28.949 
pressure we resist the movement of the

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:30.560 
pressure we resist the movement of the
knees<00:06:29.130> because<00:06:29.760> too<00:06:29.909> much<00:06:30.060> knee<00:06:30.330> movement

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
knees because too much knee movement

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.930 
knees because too much knee movement
causes<00:06:30.930> spine<00:06:31.710> angle<00:06:31.860> changes<00:06:32.370> it<00:06:32.550> causes<00:06:32.880> the

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
causes spine angle changes it causes the

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.909 
causes spine angle changes it causes the
body<00:06:33.120> go<00:06:33.330> up<00:06:33.419> and<00:06:33.599> down<00:06:33.720> move<00:06:34.020> sideways<00:06:34.320> it

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 
body go up and down move sideways it

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:36.680 
body go up and down move sideways it
allows<00:06:35.250> more<00:06:35.550> turn<00:06:35.849> so<00:06:36.060> you<00:06:36.150> can<00:06:36.240> get<00:06:36.360> back<00:06:36.539> in

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
allows more turn so you can get back in

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.360 
allows more turn so you can get back in
a<00:06:36.750> sacred<00:06:36.930> burial<00:06:37.380> ground<00:06:37.440> and<00:06:37.800> that's<00:06:38.220> the

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
a sacred burial ground and that's the

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.250 
a sacred burial ground and that's the
whole<00:06:38.490> key<00:06:38.729> if<00:06:38.909> you<00:06:39.270> take<00:06:39.479> a<00:06:39.510> 90<00:06:39.870> degree<00:06:40.229> turn

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
whole key if you take a 90 degree turn

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.200 
whole key if you take a 90 degree turn
amor<00:06:40.740> and<00:06:40.949> you<00:06:41.010> swing<00:06:41.280> the<00:06:41.400> parallel<00:06:41.820> you're

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
amor and you swing the parallel you're

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.550 
amor and you swing the parallel you're
definitely<00:06:42.449> going<00:06:42.780> deep<00:06:43.020> in<00:06:43.169> the<00:06:43.260> sacred

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
definitely going deep in the sacred

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.810 
definitely going deep in the sacred
burial<00:06:43.800> ground<00:06:43.860> so<00:06:44.190> we<00:06:44.310> have<00:06:44.400> the<00:06:44.520> limited

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
burial ground so we have the limited

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.790 
burial ground so we have the limited
turn<00:06:45.030> and<00:06:45.240> the<00:06:45.630> knees<00:06:45.840> is<00:06:46.080> what<00:06:46.260> helps<00:06:46.530> it<00:06:46.650> the

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
turn and the knees is what helps it the

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.019 
turn and the knees is what helps it the
knees<00:06:47.010> the<00:06:47.610> knees<00:06:48.180> are<00:06:48.599> our<00:06:49.760> trademark<00:06:50.760> of<00:06:50.940> the

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:51.029

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:52.610 
knees the knees are our trademark of the
set<00:06:51.240> up<00:06:51.360> in<00:06:51.539> US<00:06:51.779> and<00:06:52.080> a<00:06:52.409> peak<00:06:52.590> performance

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
set up in US and a peak performance

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.500 
set up in US and a peak performance
called<00:06:53.190> swinging<00:06:53.580> that<00:06:53.669> they<00:06:53.820> move<00:06:54.000> less

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.510 
called swinging that they move less

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.670 
called swinging that they move less
so<00:06:54.660> we<00:06:54.750> get<00:06:54.870> the<00:06:54.990> wide<00:06:55.140> knees<00:06:55.350> outward

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
so we get the wide knees outward

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.110 
so we get the wide knees outward
pressure<00:06:55.860> and<00:06:56.160> we<00:06:56.250> just<00:06:56.460> make<00:06:56.640> the<00:06:56.790> the

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
pressure and we just make the the

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.010 
pressure and we just make the the
limited<00:06:57.480> turn<00:06:57.630> 3/4<00:06:58.260> swing<00:06:58.460> and<00:06:59.510> bang<00:07:00.510> you<00:07:00.870> hit

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
limited turn 3/4 swing and bang you hit

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.140 
limited turn 3/4 swing and bang you hit
it<00:07:01.110> solid<00:07:01.440> and<00:07:01.530> straight<00:07:01.800> and<00:07:02.040> what's<00:07:03.000> more

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
it solid and straight and what's more

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.730 
it solid and straight and what's more
consistently<00:07:03.690> and<00:07:03.870> that's<00:07:04.200> what<00:07:04.320> golf's<00:07:04.590> all

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
about all right so the peak performance

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.320 
about all right so the peak performance
golf<00:07:07.980> swing<00:07:08.160> is<00:07:08.280> the<00:07:08.340> only<00:07:08.550> body<00:07:08.880> friendly

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330 
golf swing is the only body friendly

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.090 
golf swing is the only body friendly

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 
swing out there with the least amount of

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.740 
swing out there with the least amount of
stress<00:07:11.220> the<00:07:11.490> strength<00:07:11.790> of<00:07:12.000> any<00:07:12.270> swing<00:07:12.570> there

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
stress the strength of any swing there

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.450 
stress the strength of any swing there
is<00:07:12.780> and<00:07:13.110> so<00:07:13.440> therefore<00:07:13.830> it<00:07:13.950> makes<00:07:14.130> being<00:07:14.370> the
