00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.660
 Supreme Rada beat over the edge 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.690
 but deputies ask employees will come over 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.180
 places the slightest spark is enough for a trifle 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.020
 to start a massacre deputies heated 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.420
 leaks 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.760
 from the Ukrainian delegation from Minsk about 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.310
 the fight of nerves and about the fact that Poroshenko 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.349
 holding on without knowing the result puts 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.599
 to vote anti-russian law 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.850
 suspend accreditation of funds 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.960
 Russian mass media for allegedly 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.540
 inform war 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.610
 the murderous arguments are divided known 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.890
 fighter press radical radical 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.649
 walked the key sheypa davis russian channel 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.899
 if you turn on and look Russian 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.270
 channel then in 20 minutes you will surely become 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.980
 ardent jacket that means people 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.960
 just turn into zombies 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.230
 then for zombies take in hand 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.199
 machine gun and put on a shahid belt 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:02.870
 go to the checkpoint and explode and glad where already 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.870
 for a long time only one point of view is voting 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.729
 This means that a list of those will appear soon. 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.000
 the media of those persons who will cease to let 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.680
 to the state authorities in Ukraine is stupid that 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.240
 You can think of it to send Russian 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.460
 Ukrainian journalists from Ukraine 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.450
 Russia and each sit their own enclave 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.540
 tell therefore this decision is not 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.390
 smart people this decision is not constructive 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.220
 and it is not aimed at the world the world seems 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.320
 there thought last and foremost 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.540
 problems with the passage in the genus of our 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.020
 colleagues arose immediately studied my number 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.220
 checked if my number matches 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.630
 numbers apparently those people who already 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.970
 today does not let the Supreme Council 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.520
 attempts not to let work Russian 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.649
 journalists have long been made 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.869
 right there easily under the hooting of the local 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.119
 press last year tried to expel 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.600
 of our Sobkor Alexander Obolonsky but 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.030
 then there was no law after all to walk 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.740
 through the streets of our Ukrainian cities 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.570
 Christmas still no one has not yet 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.610
 banned why this was needed 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.190
 anti-russian payouts today are not 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.349
 itâ€™s clear that fragile has finally appeared 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.840
 opportunity to stop war and sensible 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.319
 thoughts among the deputies we all sounded 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.150
 we hope this is a chance 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.250
 the settlement will be high and 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.739
 we will all develop according to 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.239
 a diplomatic and peaceful son on then 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.640
 the representatives of the party took the floor 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.770
 Popular Front Premier Yatsenyuk became 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.200
 clearly the world in the Donbas for them is not 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.560
 The main anti-Russian rhetoric is their 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.569
 seahorse 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.030
 According to our data, Putin is quite 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.310
 specific plans for continuing the hybrid 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.080
 wars not only in Ukraine well 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.819
 and territories in the civilized section 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.099
 countries that is to the Minsk agreements 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.319
 Poroshenko ambiguous attitude 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.540
 tomorrow the family decided to call the head 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.060
 Ukrainian mida and elicit what he 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.220
 promised and among the deputies acting 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.640
 warlords are now in the east 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.400
 Ukraine is fighting about 40 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.470
 the so -called volunteer 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.500
 battalions that are not controlled by 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.209
 side of the president and here the question will be able 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.860
 whether 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.680
 Petr Alekseevich agree with people 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.750
 that control data formation 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.060
 that is, there are oligarchs who are cashing in 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.069
 in war there is a so-called party 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.349
 war which earns points on 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.180
 confrontation and the president arrived 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.459
 after communicating with Europeans with 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.650
 relative peaceful rhetoric of what and who 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.049
 when the big question prevails 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.580
 Evgeny horns Dmitriy Khrustalyov Maxim 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.790
 Alexey Alekseenko
