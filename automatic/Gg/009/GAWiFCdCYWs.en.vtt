anything with a screen tell us about
what<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.220> got<00:00:23.359> so<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.570> basic<00:00:24.869> idea<00:00:24.960> is

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
what you got so the basic idea is

instead of having to tap each individual
letter<00:00:27.449> precisely<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.680> trace<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> very

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
letter precisely you trace a very

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.890 
letter precisely you trace a very

through<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> letters<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.040> word<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.550> it

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
through the letters of the word and it

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.090 
through the letters of the word and it
figures<00:00:33.390> out<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.780> word<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.590> if<00:00:34.739> I'm<00:00:34.890> going<00:00:35.010> to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
figures out the word so if I'm going to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.680 
figures out the word so if I'm going to
do<00:00:35.190> something<00:00:35.460> simple<00:00:36.500> this<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:38.510> how<00:00:40.190> simple
