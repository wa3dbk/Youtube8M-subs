00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
with this I mean from a trailer yeah a

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.010 
with this I mean from a trailer yeah a
little<00:01:32.520> bombastic<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.630> mean<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.810> like<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
little bombastic but I mean I like the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.440 
little bombastic but I mean I like the
premise<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.560> yeah<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.700> by<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.000> look<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.899 
premise so yeah I by the look at the
movie<00:01:36.810> um<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.530> think<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.369> trailer<00:01:38.790> is

vanilla<00:01:59.909> sky<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.110> American<00:02:01.560> remake<00:02:01.740> but

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
vanilla sky in the American remake but

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.670 
vanilla sky in the American remake but
the<00:02:02.369> Spanish<00:02:02.820> version<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.450> much<00:02:04.020> better<00:02:04.409> and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
the Spanish version is much better and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.520 
the Spanish version is much better and
the<00:02:05.549> sea<00:02:05.700> inside<00:02:05.850> which<00:02:06.329> won<00:02:06.659> an<00:02:06.990> Oscar<00:02:07.500> for
