00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.629
 unemployed and still lives at home 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.090
 Mama this loser is the main part 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:17.460
 error on the entertain anyway 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:18.779
 this is what you will learn here ryota sakamoto 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.340

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.470
 most successful team player 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.330
 in the world this anime system 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.099
 popular video game with the goal 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.849
 enemy players using bombs too 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.890
 eliminate 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.140
 one day just dead on one 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.570
 tropical island without memories like 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.100
 he came here and he himself 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.270
 he is provided by an unknown 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.460
 man attacked 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.379
 for out of his life seeks 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.000
 jutta has to realize that in 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.370
 a real version of tower caught 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.370
 is and can now be in real life 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.070
 under proof must be tropical 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.899
 island deadly deathmatch only the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.110
 winner can live on me 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.320
 not somehow known before exactly 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.460
 the death candidates from the year 2007 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.350
 So the idea is not only 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.270
 still the survival anime from the studio 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.710
 madhouse he still has more to offer 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.880
 because culture stands out above all else 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.680
 through his many interesting ones 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.659
 characters from which most 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.640
 are insane or mentally disturbed 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.290
 it leaves you a lot of time that 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.970
 to describe the inner lives of the characters 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.040
 and thus explain their behavior 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.540
 for it frequently used flashbacks 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.369
 I especially liked it 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.630
 which the spectator with dramatic 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.439
 want to captivate stories emotionally 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.930
 but we also come to the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.880
 weaken the anime the action-packed 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.170
 survival anime that did not expect 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.090
 I did not get that 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.770
 There were well staged and exciting fights 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.810
 it's almost nothing at all 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.650
 also because that was only with bombs 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.360
 was fought 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.890
 there were also many different ones 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.350
 bomb types do not rip out much anymore 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.030
 and even if I'm the characters in the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.860
 overall package liked it well 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.990
 the bulk toyota often on the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.030
 annoying because he plays again and again 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.750
 moral apostle and trust and forgive 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.549
 just after twelve episodes everyone finds 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.500
 but he does not have his hands 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.329
 conclusion and many questions remain open 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.600
 It is expected that a continuation 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.899
 follows even if the parents do not shine 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.390
 can 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.099
 I give the anime 75 out of 100 points 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.619
 that's what he's crazy about 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.940
 actors and the interesting ones 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.430
 background stories 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.170
 to all those who are on survival animes 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.060
 crazy characters are recommended 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.320
 I fully support the anime all 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.910
 others may risk a look 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.910
 and form your own opinion
