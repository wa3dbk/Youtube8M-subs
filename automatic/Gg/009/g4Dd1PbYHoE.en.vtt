you're thinking of getting one he's

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.350 
you're thinking of getting one he's
brilliant<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.070> doesn't<00:00:53.640> answer<00:00:53.760> everything

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
brilliant it doesn't answer everything

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.959 
brilliant it doesn't answer everything
it<00:00:54.780> does<00:00:55.020> sound<00:00:55.379> really<00:00:55.559> good<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.160> there<00:00:56.789> are

it does sound really good but there are

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.439 
it does sound really good but there are
a<00:00:57.000> few<00:00:57.800> minuses<00:00:58.800> with<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.160> unit<00:00:59.609> but<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.239> think

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
a few minuses with this unit but I think

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.180 
a few minuses with this unit but I think
you'll<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.809> made<00:01:00.960> aware<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.320> which<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.829> one

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
you'll be made aware of which is one

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.770 
you'll be made aware of which is one

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
gear obviously is two or three times the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.730 
gear obviously is two or three times the
price<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.380> get<00:01:55.500> what<00:01:55.680> you

probably<00:06:55.060> if<00:06:55.120> the<00:06:55.240> sound<00:06:55.480> quality<00:06:55.960> wasn't<00:06:56.290> as

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
probably if the sound quality wasn't as

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.260 
probably if the sound quality wasn't as
good<00:06:56.590> as<00:06:56.710> it<00:06:56.770> was<00:06:56.860> believe<00:06:57.639> me<00:06:57.850> I'd<00:06:57.970> have<00:06:58.090> taken

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
good as it was believe me I'd have taken

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.720 
good as it was believe me I'd have taken
it<00:06:58.510> back<00:06:58.690> the<00:06:58.900> same<00:06:59.139> day<00:06:59.169> but<00:07:00.040> because<00:07:00.430> it<00:07:00.580> is

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:00.730 
it back the same day but because it is

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.510 
it back the same day but because it is
I'm<00:07:01.060> sticking<00:07:01.870> with<00:07:01.900> it<00:07:02.169> but<00:07:02.800> I<00:07:02.980> just<00:07:03.040> don't

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
I'm sticking with it but I just don't

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.370 
I'm sticking with it but I just don't
think<00:07:03.730> it's<00:07:03.850> good<00:07:04.030> enough<00:07:04.060> that<00:07:04.570> this<00:07:04.930> does

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
think it's good enough that this does

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.340 
think it's good enough that this does
not<00:07:05.590> work<00:07:05.800> so<00:07:06.550> having<00:07:07.240> that<00:07:07.510> good<00:07:07.780> people<00:07:08.139> if
