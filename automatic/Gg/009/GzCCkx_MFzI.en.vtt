dusty<00:05:33.089> and<00:05:33.479> then<00:05:33.629> I<00:05:33.900> turn<00:05:34.349> it<00:05:34.439> back<00:05:34.560> over<00:05:36.169> just

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
dusty and then I turn it back over just

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.469 
dusty and then I turn it back over just
dust<00:05:37.409> on<00:05:37.589> the<00:05:37.680> other<00:05:37.800> side<00:05:37.979> okay<00:05:38.539> um<00:05:41.240> I'm<00:05:42.240> gonna

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
dust on the other side okay um I'm gonna

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:49.080 
dust on the other side okay um I'm gonna
guess<00:05:42.689> it<00:05:42.870> goes<00:05:43.020> like<00:05:43.259> this

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:06:01.170 

well<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.139> fan<00:05:50.860> used<00:05:51.070> to<00:05:51.250> be<00:05:55.169> like<00:05:56.169> this

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180

yeah<00:06:02.180> I'm<00:06:02.270> going<00:06:02.450> to<00:06:02.540> guess<00:06:02.750> that<00:06:02.780> because

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
yeah I'm going to guess that because

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:16.680 
yeah I'm going to guess that because
there's<00:06:03.680> a<00:06:03.740> little<00:06:03.980> notch<00:06:04.880> there<00:06:05.300> for<00:06:05.570> the<00:06:05.920> top
