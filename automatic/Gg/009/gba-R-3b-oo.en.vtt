we<00:00:44.809> thought<00:00:44.960> Drax<00:00:45.290> was<00:00:45.470> stealing<00:00:45.800> secrets

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
we thought Drax was stealing secrets

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.610 
we thought Drax was stealing secrets
about<00:00:46.370> rocket<00:00:46.880> propulsion<00:00:47.150> but<00:00:48.050> it<00:00:48.200> turns<00:00:48.410> out

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
about rocket propulsion but it turns out

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.500 
about rocket propulsion but it turns out
he<00:00:48.770> was<00:00:48.920> after<00:00:49.220> the<00:00:49.309> bio<00:00:49.520> experiments<00:00:50.239> we<00:00:50.330> ran

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
he was after the bio experiments we ran

he was after the bio experiments we ran
on<00:00:50.630> the<00:00:50.720> space<00:00:50.960> shuttle<00:00:50.989> I<00:00:51.440> think<00:00:51.860> he's<00:00:51.980> trying

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
on the space shuttle I think he's trying

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.950 
on the space shuttle I think he's trying
to<00:00:52.400> develop<00:00:52.580> some<00:00:52.879> kind<00:00:53.000> of<00:00:53.150> nerve<00:00:53.390> agent<00:00:53.809> but

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
to develop some kind of nerve agent but

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.630 
to develop some kind of nerve agent but
I<00:00:54.140> don't<00:00:54.950> know<00:00:55.010> why<00:00:56.980> maybe<00:00:57.980> we'd<00:00:58.280> better<00:00:58.430> find

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
I don't know why maybe we'd better find

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.170 
I don't know why maybe we'd better find
out<00:00:58.880> I<00:00:59.120> thought<00:01:00.050> you<00:01:00.260> wanted<00:01:00.380> to<00:01:00.560> leave<00:01:01.180> things

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
we should look for fingerprints and
