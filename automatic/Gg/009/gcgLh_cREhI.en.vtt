00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.540
 Soon you will see how fast and easy 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.490
 with the 19th 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.350
 Chris can prepare expensive coffee 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.000
 philips has something new this time 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.710
 dared so far saw the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.530
 coffee machines of the senseo series all 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.750
 pretty similar to that is the conclusion 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.360
 new sensi trist follows one completely 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.400
 other design concept the preparation 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.080
 But it is as easy as before with the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.000
 You have coffee pads at senseo 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.660
 coffee makers as usual the big one 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.160
 selection 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.530
 because so many companies fit petz 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.580
 offer at the original senseo petz 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.620
 but you already can 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.630
 choose between 14 different varieties 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.340
 there was the senseo petz best point 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.320
 closed on the coffee 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.090
 Quality reserves when the machine 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.530
 is ready puts the robes 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.420
 just a pad in the bracket 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.640
 put and in a sufficiently large 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.900
 cup down 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.930
 By default, you have the nct's 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.450
 the choice between 125 and 60 milliliters 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.880
 coffee at this point in the video use 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.450
 I have a espresso cup unis 60s option 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.640
 to choose 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.590
 the amount of liquid chose over one 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.220
 special virtual button in the touch 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.780
 display 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.880
 then you decide for 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.190
 the preparation of one or two 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.870
 portions at the same time we prepare here 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.790
 first only a portion before 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.900
 it only takes a few seconds until the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.240
 coffee is ready 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.710
 finally used the removed 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.690
 coffee pod from the machine 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.729
 the coffee preparation goes with this 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.650
 gets fast easy and comfortable 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.549
 in this video you can see the version hd 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.060
 78 72 the senses he does exist in three 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.979
 variants the hd 78 73 has 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.690
 additionally via a water filter 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.670
 in both models , the 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.970
 set the water volume individually 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.610
 this is the cheapest model hd 78th 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.930
 70 not adjusting the amount of water 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.210
 I show you here once 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.950
 instead of put on much or little water 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.110
 the selection on the asterisk position 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.750
 then he presses the selection switch 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.220
 until the star blinks when 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.560
 you now the symbol for a cup 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.240
 touched started the transition is the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.350
 desired amount of water reaches squeezed 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.840
 the symbol again 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.820
 but beware, there is still something dribbling 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.680
 After that the cup is running too small 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.909
 coffee over the edge here we have 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.950
 just had luck again 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.819
 the maximum amount of water is at the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.619
 sncf is 145 milliliters that's always 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.359
 not much but coffee pads and 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.410
 small and you want something else too 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.450
 taste 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.520
 so rather take less water 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.560
 the result can be seen and 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.480
 also tastes good the set 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.280
 amount of water, the device remembers the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.590
 stays on the asterisk position 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.170
 saved with the new design power 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.340
 philips senseo again exciting the touch 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.160
 display is in the trend 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.990
 a little impractical is the shiny one 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.790
 surface, however, already 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.610
 hopefully you have no problem with 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.380
 highly visible fingerprints the senseo 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.950
 At least it is very good to be dreary 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.440
 clean 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.600
 not to have to clean so much 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.160
 pulls the coffee spout by light 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.260
 push down on the sides slightly 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.330
 then it is close to the cup 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.040
 The water tank deserves special praise 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.080
 They are not just really good at it 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.750
 philips has the perfect job 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.640
 chosen back right so he is not 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.320
 in the way but very easy to reach 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.000
 you can take it off easily 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.520
 fresh water directly from the line 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.010
 then filled him 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.510
 simply could instead back 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.890
 let the tanker farmers of the machine 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.670
 and take the lid off water 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.680
 refill 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.940
 The removal is in my opinion 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.950
 but the better choice 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.540
 Overall, I am satisfied with the senseo 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.370
 tour is easy to use and 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.040
 Easy to clean the coffee tastes and 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.690
 is very typically quite cheap with 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.880
 net he just comes away cheaper than 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.020
 with capsules and more environmentally friendly for 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.780
 coffee pads anyway 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.910
 you want to know more about the sncf 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.640
 then left the test report in my blog 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.590
 on coffee navigator de below you will find 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.120
 the link if you have questions I have 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.709
 Maybe she can answer 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.790
 here in the comments or even better 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.790
 commented in the blog
