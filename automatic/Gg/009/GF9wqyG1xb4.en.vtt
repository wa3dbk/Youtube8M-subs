00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.280
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:06.140
 i go to the space 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.620
 and today we will have a review on my 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.200
 homemade this homemade by place and 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.269
 oh well this homemade by 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.390
 steampunk u like you already could 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.070
 guess this is something in between 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.190
 steampunk and westerns somewhere here by 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.890
 the middle of vodka is the plane how to get out 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.650
 he made the gun going on I do not know 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.960
 why and here they are on moving 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.370
 elements of these guns so that you can 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.560
 moving here is such a thing 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:37.190
 airplane well let's look at 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.170
 minifigure that I planted there and so 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.610
 minifigure here is my small 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.800
 remake of the sheriff 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.079
 of a new series of minifigures which 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.660
 quite recently came out so here it is 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.170
 I got vodka poison I have a limit 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:57.430
 konce monocle as you can see 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:01:00.020
 also in such a tab hat from and is called 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.660
 standing from that sheriff but 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.210
 she suits him well enough and I 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.630
 decided why not to use it 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.030
 what is it, but the model itself is on our own 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.440
 on the highway can drive here such here 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.200
 we have plastic highways 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.600
 rides takes off spinning screw all 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.580
 functional and very cool also 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.010
 here are these stairs to manage 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.590
 air flow where it turns 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.130
 our plane will fly there and so 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.890
 of this 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.710
 acts everything so here it flies also 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.070
 it is possible to put them like this 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.619
 as if braking well and as usual 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.740
 put the screw as you can see made 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:43.009
 cool enough design itself I don't know 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.340
 you like me personally for me this is mine 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.130
 the best the best homemade post 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.740
 the bar if you decide to put one 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.229
 brown one gold such two sticks 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.009
 for decor there is some kind of pipe with pairs 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:01.759
 goes to the plane itself and gives them energy here 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.220
 such here details for strengthening the general 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.250
 view and add all of these 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.739
 small pretty detail 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.200
 Here such a plane, in principle, turned out 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.830
 very beautiful little 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.250
 from 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.010
 arm somewhere a small airplane that's how he 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.990
 looks from this angle from the side of course 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.090
 right here you can watch something that doesn't 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.610
 found such brown parts had 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.120
 use gray that's one green but 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.030
 What is terrible in principle from the party then 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.840
 never looks but he is in front 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.430
 turned out quite well, I think 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.800
 from above even if you look at it too 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.290
 very attractive here 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.810
 airplane you hope my review 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.990
 liked you I was a domino for space 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.360
 put the usual sheriff me by the way 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.820
 saying i'm going to move on to normal now 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.340
 why not immediately show minifigure 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.340
 well and on it all all good luck and all while
