00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
now sort of it is just like you'd find

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.760 
now sort of it is just like you'd find
most<00:01:13.040> ATVs<00:01:13.790> just<00:01:14.540> like<00:01:14.690> that<00:01:14.960> cracker<00:01:15.470> town

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
most ATVs just like that cracker town

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.370 
most ATVs just like that cracker town
now<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.490> scooter<00:01:19.970> isn't<00:01:20.390> on<00:01:20.509> full<00:01:20.840> charge<00:01:21.170> at

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
now the scooter isn't on full charge at

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.490 
now the scooter isn't on full charge at
the<00:01:21.470> moment<00:01:22.030> it<00:01:23.030> is<00:01:23.090> on<00:01:23.299> half<00:01:23.720> charge<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:24.320> any

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
the moment it is on half charge so any

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.469 
the moment it is on half charge so any
so<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.130> I<00:01:25.190> think<00:01:25.369> for<00:01:25.640> spin<00:01:25.909> it<00:01:26.060> won't<00:01:26.210> be<00:01:26.330> that

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
so and I think for spin it won't be that

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:35.279 
so and I think for spin it won't be that
fast<00:01:30.970> down<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.149> bottom<00:01:32.420> here<00:01:33.250> it<00:01:34.250> has<00:01:34.729> a

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
fast down the bottom here it has a

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:42.460 
fast down the bottom here it has a
charging<00:01:36.289> port<00:01:37.569> or<00:01:39.159> recharge<00:01:41.170> take<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.200> quick

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
charging port or recharge take a quick

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.539 
charging port or recharge take a quick
look<00:01:42.590> at<00:01:42.740> that

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.219 

right<00:01:47.180> here<00:01:48.159> now<00:01:49.159> you<00:01:49.490> just<00:01:49.670> turn<00:01:50.570> this<00:01:50.840> open

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
right here now you just turn this open

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.190 
right here now you just turn this open
and<00:01:51.469> you<00:01:52.219> charge<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:52.670> up<00:01:52.789> it<00:01:53.659> takes<00:01:54.020> about

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
and you charge it up it takes about

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.609 
and you charge it up it takes about
eight<00:01:54.619> hours<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.280> charge<00:01:55.549> up<00:01:56.439> after<00:01:57.439> you've

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
eight hours to charge up after you've

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.450 
eight hours to charge up after you've
used<00:01:57.649> it<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.250> max<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:59.469> right<00:02:00.469> here<00:02:00.860> we

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
used it to the max and right here we

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.469 
used it to the max and right here we
have<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.960> suspension<00:02:03.880> it's<00:02:04.880> dual<00:02:05.240> suspension

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
have the suspension it's dual suspension

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.419 
have the suspension it's dual suspension
so<00:02:06.110> there's<00:02:06.289> an<00:02:06.439> exact<00:02:06.770> same<00:02:06.950> one<00:02:07.159> on<00:02:07.310> the

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
so there's an exact same one on the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.969 
so there's an exact same one on the
other<00:02:07.579> side<00:02:08.319> but<00:02:09.319> other<00:02:09.560> than<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:09.709> it's

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
other side but other than that it's

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.039 
other side but other than that it's
pretty<00:02:10.220> cool<00:02:10.519> like<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.209> really<00:02:11.569> does<00:02:11.810> absorb

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
pretty cool like it really does absorb

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.630 
pretty cool like it really does absorb
off<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:13.190> arm<00:02:13.400> shop<00:02:13.819> and<00:02:15.190> we've<00:02:16.190> also<00:02:16.400> got
