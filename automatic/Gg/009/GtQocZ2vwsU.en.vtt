 where m is powerlink that fires 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.539
 in what it is there that was born place 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.460
 chic x hd who had in his package 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.310
 strategic of a good played to yourself 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.690
 if it does not require that we see 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.250
 a lot of style to have one that she 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.720
 in the package but hey it always 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.010
 pleasure to have one so here is 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.440
 today I propose a cam 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.470
 strike on the vub and air so a cam as 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.990
 it is expressly said in 2046 a little 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.060
 close so go pretty enough to watch 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.920
 it's just ruck so here I am you 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.420
 lets watch the gameplay so my 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.500
 class I present it to you so I had 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.600
 6 years taking care of course 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.989
 we all had no tracker 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 looters determination and 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.580
 and here I think and specialist is 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.330
 ready ready yes here and in specialist as 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.950
 the trigger 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.880
 he too is this dead silence so 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.660
 in this video I'm going to talk about a 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.680
 little subject I wanted to talk 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.270
 what console game take 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.540
 soon so next-gen consoles 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.760
 so I think I take the ps4 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.850
 why do I explain to you the reason 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.290
 after that I think I'll learn it to 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.330
 December so their acts and addresses where 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.650
 I may have them around January where 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.790
 after January I do not know because 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.040
 that apparently there are breaks in 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.840
 stocks and problems in not one is going 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.070
 wait a bit that who solves who 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.100
 solves problems 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.840
 so here are the reasons why I 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.450
 take the place 4 a first reason the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.960
 joystick I do not know if for you it's 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.100
 the same but for example on xbox 360 the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.840
 clan and the xbox one is a little 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.460
 similar to that exaults 360 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.470
 I can not simply aim 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.790
 because the joysticks sound hollow and me 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.229
 I can strictly palliate with the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.610
 two sticks reused a sick thing the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.350
 people talk about it with the magic box 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.210
 and what's more thing about xbox 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.590
 and that she is really fat and 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.700
 learns all the hand and I responded to 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.170
 the sight is a crazy thing 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.310
 so that's why I take the place 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.709
 what is also for the controller that is 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.500
 pretty much like that of ps3 even 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.230
 if they have changed the joystick it's 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.480
 joystick curved on ps3 / cap that 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.130
 are a little bulging and a little hollow we 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.230
 that it's a little mix of xbox and 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.600
 ps3 so here it is 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.880
 and the second reason is the lead he 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.400
 is cheaper is the legros legros 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.220
 selfish it is 10 euros cheaper 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.170
 we know it 's so we're going to say 50 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.110
 euros I believe for the psn and 60 for 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.090
 the xbox live so here are the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.190
 reasons and then it's been quite a while 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.570
 that at sony so here we change not 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.620
 a team that wins 1 as we say 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.000
 so here I hope that 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.409
 you like the video so here I soon 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.840
 are worried even if I feel good 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.459
 yeah I think that's where you wait 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.349
 yeah that's where I get my cam 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.420
 strike pretty quickly so that's it 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:00.170
 I hope you like the gameplay 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.430
 So here I had the c do not hesitate to 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.150
 leave a lake a comment that makes 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.519
 always happy 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.739
 and I tell you to a next video 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.700
 on rabies or on my chain so here is 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.620
 I hope gameplay friends 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.620
 it was blackbird hd giotto world
