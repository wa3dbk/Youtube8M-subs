quick<00:00:18.849> look<00:00:19.090> at<00:00:19.300> the<00:00:19.599> apt<00:00:19.960> pantograph<00:00:20.880> as<00:00:21.880> you

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
quick look at the apt pantograph as you

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.760 
quick look at the apt pantograph as you
can<00:00:22.210> see<00:00:22.390> here<00:00:22.630> this<00:00:23.110> is<00:00:23.169> the<00:00:23.820> apt<00:00:24.820> motor<00:00:25.090> car

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
can see here this is the apt motor car

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.040 
can see here this is the apt motor car
or<00:00:26.770> power<00:00:27.099> car<00:00:27.340> and<00:00:28.950> it<00:00:29.950> has<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:31.300> motor<00:00:31.840> end

or power car and it has the motor end

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.450 
or power car and it has the motor end
right<00:00:33.040> here<00:00:33.280> and<00:00:34.559> at<00:00:35.559> the<00:00:35.739> very<00:00:35.920> top<00:00:36.129> of<00:00:36.370> the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
right here and at the very top of the

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.670 
right here and at the very top of the
ring<00:00:36.760> filled<00:00:36.940> motor<00:00:37.180> it<00:00:37.540> says<00:00:37.840> all<00:00:38.079> plastic

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680

ring filled motor it says all plastic
connector<00:00:39.039> and<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.840> actually<00:00:41.140> screwed<00:00:41.530> into

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
connector and it's actually screwed into

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.389 
connector and it's actually screwed into
the<00:00:42.030> ring<00:00:43.030> field<00:00:43.239> motor<00:00:43.450> and<00:00:44.039> if<00:00:45.039> you<00:00:45.159> look<00:00:45.309> at

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
the ring field motor and if you look at

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.279 
the ring field motor and if you look at
the<00:00:45.489> top<00:00:45.699> here<00:00:46.059> you'll<00:00:46.659> see<00:00:46.839> there's<00:00:46.989> a<00:00:47.079> little

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
the top here you'll see there's a little

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.380 
the top here you'll see there's a little
notch<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:48.879> pantograph

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
notch for the pantograph

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.720 
notch for the pantograph
and<00:00:50.670> here's<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:51.850> actual<00:00:53.219> apt<00:00:54.219> pantograph

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
and here's the actual apt pantograph

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.130 
and here's the actual apt pantograph
itself<00:00:56.129> while<00:00:57.129> it<00:00:57.280> does<00:00:57.460> look<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:58.030> lot<00:00:58.600> like<00:00:58.809> the

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
itself while it does look a lot like the

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.410 
itself while it does look a lot like the
ones<00:00:59.319> that<00:00:59.530> you<00:00:59.649> might<00:00:59.769> find<00:01:00.039> on<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.640> class<00:01:01.420> 86

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
ones that you might find on a class 86

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.170 
ones that you might find on a class 86
you<00:01:04.420> can<00:01:04.510> see<00:01:04.690> there<00:01:04.870> it<00:01:05.199> looks<00:01:05.350> quite<00:01:05.590> similar

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
you can see there it looks quite similar

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.210 
you can see there it looks quite similar
however<00:01:07.180> if<00:01:07.540> you'll<00:01:07.750> quickly<00:01:08.530> notice<00:01:08.710> that

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
however if you'll quickly notice that

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.190 
however if you'll quickly notice that
the<00:01:09.370> base<00:01:09.550> of<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:10.030> world<00:01:10.210> on<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.360> 86<00:01:10.810> is<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.020> lot

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
the base of the world on the 86 is a lot

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.090 
the base of the world on the 86 is a lot
larger<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:14.020> one<00:01:14.200> key<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.590> does<00:01:14.740> not<00:01:14.860> have

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
larger and the one key and does not have

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.200 
larger and the one key and does not have
this<00:01:15.310> little<00:01:15.690> connector<00:01:16.690> at<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.810> bottom<00:01:18.210> so

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
this little connector at the bottom so

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.080 
this little connector at the bottom so
to<00:01:19.420> attach<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.810> pantograph<00:01:20.110> you<00:01:20.770> simply<00:01:21.280> find

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
to attach the pantograph you simply find

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.730 
to attach the pantograph you simply find
a<00:01:22.270> notch<00:01:22.450> there<00:01:23.550> find<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.670> notch<00:01:24.910> on<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:28.740> apt

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
a notch there find the notch on the apt

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.150 
a notch there find the notch on the apt
itself<00:01:30.160> and<00:01:31.440> then<00:01:32.440> you<00:01:32.740> simply<00:01:33.040> installed<00:01:35.160> so

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
itself and then you simply installed so

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.000 
itself and then you simply installed so
the<00:01:36.460> notch<00:01:36.910> is<00:01:38.610> hard<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.730> see<00:01:39.940> but<00:01:39.970> it's<00:01:41.010> behind

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
the notch is hard to see but it's behind

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.320 
the notch is hard to see but it's behind
all<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.310> way<00:01:42.430> it's<00:01:42.760> right<00:01:42.910> there<00:01:43.120> on<00:01:43.150> the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
all the way it's right there on the

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:50.640 
all the way it's right there on the
right<00:01:43.510> say<00:01:44.500> i<00:01:44.950> don't--why<00:01:45.730> it<00:01:45.970> like<00:01:46.150> so<00:01:49.650> then

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
right say i don't--why it like so then

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.840 
right say i don't--why it like so then
you<00:01:50.830> simply<00:01:51.190> push<00:01:52.180> down<00:01:52.210> on<00:01:53.190> and<00:01:54.190> one<00:01:54.730> thing

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
you simply push down on and one thing

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.730 
you simply push down on and one thing
you'll<00:01:54.970> notice<00:01:55.210> is<00:01:55.540> that<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.440> actual

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
you'll notice is that the actual

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.520 
you'll notice is that the actual
paragraph<00:01:57.160> for<00:01:57.490> motor<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:57.880> stuff<00:01:58.200> stays<00:02:01.530> with

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
paragraph for motor and stuff stays with

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.670 
paragraph for motor and stuff stays with
with<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.430> bogie<00:02:03.730> so<00:02:04.390> it's<00:02:04.540> all<00:02:04.690> one<00:02:04.960> solid

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
with the bogie so it's all one solid

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.369 
with the bogie so it's all one solid
piece<00:02:05.710> for<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.310> tilting<00:02:06.610> mechanism<00:02:07.379> Kenworth

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
piece for the tilting mechanism Kenworth

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.469 
piece for the tilting mechanism Kenworth
can<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.649> see<00:02:08.860> there<00:02:09.009> I'm<00:02:09.119> tilting<00:02:10.119> it<00:02:10.450> back

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
can you see there I'm tilting it back

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.550 
can you see there I'm tilting it back
and<00:02:10.899> forth<00:02:11.170> in<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.650> pantograph<00:02:11.920> stays<00:02:12.760> still

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
and forth in the pantograph stays still

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.640 
and forth in the pantograph stays still
so<00:02:14.560> if<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.099> want<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.310> compare<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
so if you want to compare that to the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.870 
so if you want to compare that to the
paragraph<00:02:18.489> only<00:02:18.970> class<00:02:19.420> 86<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:21.730> is

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
paragraph only class 86 and this is

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.059 
paragraph only class 86 and this is
similar<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.510> paragraph<00:02:22.930> that's<00:02:23.110> only

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
similar to the paragraph that's only

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.559 
similar to the paragraph that's only
90<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:24.939> 91<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:26.010> as<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.129> can<00:02:27.280> see<00:02:27.459> there<00:02:27.640> it

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
90 and 91 and as you can see there it

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.339 
90 and 91 and as you can see there it
looks<00:02:28.900> very<00:02:29.079> similar<00:02:30.540> but<00:02:31.540> unfortunately

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
looks very similar but unfortunately

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.670 
looks very similar but unfortunately
they<00:02:32.920> do<00:02:32.980> not<00:02:33.069> fit<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.760> that's<00:02:34.749> why<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.019> apt

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
they do not fit and that's why the apt

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.379 
they do not fit and that's why the apt
pantographs<00:02:36.159> command<00:02:36.639> a<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.939> much<00:02:37.209> higher

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:37.389 
pantographs command a a much higher

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.979 
pantographs command a a much higher
price<00:02:37.749> on<00:02:38.530> sites<00:02:39.040> like<00:02:39.189> eBay<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:40.659> good<00:02:40.810> news

is you can't pick up one of these

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.759 
is you can't pick up one of these
without<00:02:42.760> breaking<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.209> bank<00:02:43.389> and<00:02:43.689> I<00:02:44.469> got<00:02:44.620> this
