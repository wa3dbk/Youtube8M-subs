fusion luminous case for the iphone 4
and<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.510> retails<00:00:21.870> for<00:00:21.990> 2495<00:00:22.940> the<00:00:23.940> fusion<00:00:24.300> case

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
and it retails for 2495 the fusion case

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.330 
and it retails for 2495 the fusion case
is<00:00:24.720> made<00:00:24.869> from<00:00:25.080> both<00:00:25.289> rubber<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.890> plastic

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
is made from both rubber and plastic

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.430 
is made from both rubber and plastic
using<00:00:26.640> double<00:00:26.940> injection<00:00:27.360> technology<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.440 
using double injection technology the

using double injection technology the
clear<00:00:28.680> back<00:00:28.920> casing<00:00:29.310> allows<00:00:29.520> for<00:00:29.699> custom

clear back casing allows for custom
photos<00:00:30.330> insert<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.810> be<00:00:30.900> displayed<00:00:31.289> which

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
photos insert to be displayed which

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.650 
photos insert to be displayed which
makes<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.340> case<00:00:32.579> very<00:00:32.969> unique<00:00:33.329> from<00:00:33.539> other

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
makes this case very unique from other

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.569 
makes this case very unique from other
cases<00:00:34.020> out<00:00:34.289> there<00:00:34.320> now<00:00:34.739> I'm<00:00:34.859> quite<00:00:35.070> upset<00:00:35.430> that

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
cases out there now I'm quite upset that

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.950 
cases out there now I'm quite upset that
this<00:00:35.699> case<00:00:35.940> didn't<00:00:36.270> come<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:36.510> any<00:00:36.540> screen

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
this case didn't come with any screen

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.630 
this case didn't come with any screen
protector<00:00:37.470> now<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> did<00:00:38.010> come<00:00:38.220> with<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> flash

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
protector now a did come with a flash

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.190 
protector now a did come with a flash
diffuser<00:00:39.000> which<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.510> pretty<00:00:39.690> cool<00:00:39.960> because

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
diffuser which is pretty cool because

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.930 
diffuser which is pretty cool because
that's<00:00:40.470> really<00:00:40.620> put<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.040> packaging<00:00:41.520> nowadays

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
that's really put in packaging nowadays

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.180 
that's really put in packaging nowadays
so<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.570> case<00:00:42.720> itself<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> mix<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.950> hard

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
so the case itself is a mix of a hard

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.580 
so the case itself is a mix of a hard
shell<00:00:44.460> with<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> TPU<00:00:45.239> type<00:00:45.630> material<00:00:46.170> at<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
shell with a TPU type material at the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.350 
shell with a TPU type material at the
TPU<00:00:46.980> material<00:00:47.070> would<00:00:47.640> say<00:00:47.850> would<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
TPU material would say would be the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.000 
TPU material would say would be the
rubber<00:00:48.570> material<00:00:49.110> around<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.500> phone<00:00:49.710> and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
rubber material around the phone and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.650 
rubber material around the phone and
after<00:00:50.309> installing<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.880> case<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.300> your<00:00:51.420> phone

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
after installing this case on your phone

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.510 
after installing this case on your phone
holding<00:00:52.260> your<00:00:52.290> phone<00:00:52.559> fields<00:00:52.920> even<00:00:53.280> better

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
holding your phone fields even better

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.229 
holding your phone fields even better
than<00:00:53.790> before<00:00:55.430> having<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.550> case<00:00:56.790> installed

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
than before having this case installed

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.299 
than before having this case installed
on<00:00:57.360> your<00:00:57.390> iphone<00:00:57.570> 4<00:00:58.200> feels<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:58.710> your<00:00:58.890> iphone

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
on your iphone 4 feels like your iphone

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.330 
on your iphone 4 feels like your iphone
is<00:00:59.579> actually<00:01:00.120> 3gs<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.039> if<00:01:02.039> i<00:01:02.160> actually

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
is actually 3gs and if i actually

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.459 
is actually 3gs and if i actually
haven't<00:01:02.730> mentioned<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.300> before<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:04.140> case

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:04.469 
haven't mentioned this before this case

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:06.289 
haven't mentioned this before this case
does<00:01:04.769> offer<00:01:05.039> a<00:01:05.250> little<00:01:05.489> bit<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.759> a<00:01:05.909> lay<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
does offer a little bit of a lay in the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.700 
does offer a little bit of a lay in the
table<00:01:06.479> design<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.170> wish<00:01:07.439> they<00:01:07.560> could<00:01:07.680> have

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
table design I wish they could have

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.770 
table design I wish they could have
raised<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.190> little<00:01:08.580> bit<00:01:08.820> more<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.540> feel<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
raised it a little bit more so it feel a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.210 
raised it a little bit more so it feel a
little<00:01:10.049> safer<00:01:10.320> putting<00:01:10.619> my<00:01:10.799> phone<00:01:11.010> down

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
little safer putting my phone down

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.300 
little safer putting my phone down
screen<00:01:11.610> facing<00:01:12.030> down<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.950> mentioned

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
screen facing down and as I mentioned

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.950 
screen facing down and as I mentioned
before<00:01:14.340> they'd<00:01:14.940> come<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> flash<00:01:15.600> diffuser

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
before they'd come with a flash diffuser

Mike<00:01:42.619> they<00:01:43.619> call<00:01:43.830> this<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> luminous<00:01:44.280> case

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
Mike they call this the luminous case

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.660 
Mike they call this the luminous case
for<00:01:45.720> one<00:01:45.900> reason<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.590> reason<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.430> this

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
for one reason and that reason is this

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.210 
for one reason and that reason is this
it<00:01:48.540> glows<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.020> dark<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.009> probably

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
it glows in the dark this is probably

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.710 
it glows in the dark this is probably
the<00:01:50.369> coolest<00:01:50.579> case<00:01:50.970> I've<00:01:51.150> ever<00:01:51.240> reviewed

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the coolest case I've ever reviewed

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.929 
the coolest case I've ever reviewed
