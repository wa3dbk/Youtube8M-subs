you<00:01:20.860> anything<00:01:21.190> special<00:01:22.740> each<00:01:23.740> level<00:01:24.009> gets

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
you anything special each level gets

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.210 
you anything special each level gets
harder<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:24.910> it<00:01:25.780> gives<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:26.110> more<00:01:26.320> valuables

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
guys to see the top level so I'm just

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.450 
guys to see the top level so I'm just
trying<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.399> get<00:01:48.520> through<00:01:48.729> it<00:01:52.710> each<00:01:53.710> chest<00:01:54.190> has

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
trying to get through it each chest has

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.600 
trying to get through it each chest has
more<00:01:54.789> and<00:01:54.910> more<00:01:55.119> items<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:57.039> can<00:01:57.280> start

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
more and more items and you can start

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.219 
more and more items and you can start
falling<00:01:58.060> through<00:01:58.300> like<00:01:58.509> I<00:01:58.539> said<00:01:58.780> each<00:01:58.899> level

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
falling through like I said each level

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:07.650 
falling through like I said each level
gets<00:01:59.350> harder<00:01:59.679> and<00:01:59.800> harder<00:02:06.390> think<00:02:07.390> I'm<00:02:07.509> almost

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
gets harder and harder think I'm almost

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:17.640 
gets harder and harder think I'm almost
to<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:07.959> top

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.509 

yeah<00:02:18.650> I'm<00:02:18.769> about<00:02:18.829> to<00:02:19.010> die<00:02:19.159> maybe<00:02:19.700> maybe<00:02:20.030> not

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
all right so here's the top but probably

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.250 
all right so here's the top but probably
going<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:26.959> die<00:02:27.019> as<00:02:27.170> soon<00:02:27.349> as<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.680> get<00:02:27.739> up<00:02:27.950> here

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
going to die as soon as I get up here

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:37.980 
going to die as soon as I get up here
but<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.739> is<00:02:30.950> what's<00:02:31.250> up<00:02:31.489> here
