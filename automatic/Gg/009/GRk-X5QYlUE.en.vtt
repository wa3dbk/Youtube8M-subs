00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
what I thought to it wasn't like that at

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.240 
what I thought to it wasn't like that at
all<00:00:51.329> all<00:00:52.050> there<00:00:52.260> wasn't<00:00:52.500> there<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> lot<00:00:53.129> of

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
all all there wasn't there a lot of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.069 
all all there wasn't there a lot of
players<00:00:53.399> were<00:00:53.610> missing<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.539> don't<00:00:55.020> know

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
players were missing but I don't know

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.779

it's<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> good<00:00:55.410> game<00:00:55.559> nonetheless<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.190> think<00:00:56.219> I

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
it's a good game nonetheless I think I

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.340 
it's a good game nonetheless I think I
never<00:00:57.480> really<00:00:57.690> played<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:57.989> those<00:00:58.140> teams

but<00:02:56.670> for<00:02:56.850> me<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:58.230> first<00:02:58.410> touch<00:02:58.739> is<00:02:59.010> huge<00:02:59.790> I<00:03:00.030> did

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
but for me the first touch is huge I did

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.850 
but for me the first touch is huge I did
some<00:03:00.510> weird<00:03:00.720> like<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.110> dribble<00:03:01.440> thing<00:03:01.680> with

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
some weird like the dribble thing with

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.320 
some weird like the dribble thing with
one<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.190> players<00:03:02.370> where<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.730> just<00:03:02.880> if

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
one of the players where you just if

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.850 
one of the players where you just if
anyone<00:03:03.750> that's<00:03:03.930> watching<00:03:04.050> remembers<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.709> on

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
anyone that's watching remembers that on

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.500 
anyone that's watching remembers that on
Reid<00:03:05.130> Ribble<00:03:05.280> work<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.760> like<00:03:05.880> nearing<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.360> and

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
Reid Ribble work it like nearing it and

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.330 
Reid Ribble work it like nearing it and
kicking<00:03:06.750> up<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.110> ran<00:03:07.260> about<00:03:07.380> 40<00:03:07.830> yards<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.190> did

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
kicking up and ran about 40 yards I did

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.460 
kicking up and ran about 40 yards I did
something<00:03:08.640> very<00:03:08.670> similar<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.480> all<00:03:10.230> with

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
something very similar to that all with

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.640 
something very similar to that all with
the<00:03:10.590> first<00:03:10.800> touch<00:03:11.010> control<00:03:11.430> stick<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.239> think

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
the first touch control stick so I think

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.530 
the first touch control stick so I think
the<00:03:13.650> first<00:03:13.800> touch<00:03:14.100> is<00:03:14.340> going<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.640> just<00:03:14.820> change

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
the first touch is going to just change

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.090 
the first touch is going to just change

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 
like I keep bringing him up but he was

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.170 
like I keep bringing him up but he was
right<00:07:10.650> next<00:07:10.770> to<00:07:10.950> me<00:07:11.010> he<00:07:11.220> played<00:07:11.400> with<00:07:11.700> PSG

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 
right next to me he played with PSG

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.480 
right next to me he played with PSG
quite<00:07:12.420> a<00:07:12.450> bit<00:07:12.660> and<00:07:12.840> there<00:07:13.290> you<00:07:13.980> know<00:07:14.100> fast

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
quite a bit and there you know fast

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.700 
quite a bit and there you know fast
they're<00:07:14.790> good<00:07:15.030> for<00:07:15.480> star<00:07:15.690> skills<00:07:15.990> dense<00:07:16.350> tends

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:16.710 
they're good for star skills dense tends

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.110 
they're good for star skills dense tends
to<00:07:16.830> bring<00:07:16.980> a<00:07:17.070> lot<00:07:17.190> of<00:07:17.220> nice<00:07:17.550> skills<00:07:17.820> into<00:07:18.030> the

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 
to bring a lot of nice skills into the

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.250 
to bring a lot of nice skills into the
game<00:07:18.240> anyway<00:07:18.270> so<00:07:18.600> you<00:07:18.780> don't<00:07:18.930> have<00:07:19.080> to<00:07:19.230> have

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.260 
game anyway so you don't have to have

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.410 
game anyway so you don't have to have
the<00:07:19.440> five<00:07:19.620> stars<00:07:19.860> killers<00:07:20.160> but<00:07:20.400> I<00:07:20.640> think<00:07:21.210> that

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:21.420 
the five stars killers but I think that

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.210 
the five stars killers but I think that
if<00:07:22.050> they<00:07:22.290> were<00:07:22.380> all<00:07:22.530> five<00:07:22.740> stars<00:07:23.010> it<00:07:23.130> would

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.220 
if they were all five stars it would

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.420 
if they were all five stars it would
have<00:07:23.310> made<00:07:23.370> them<00:07:23.580> just<00:07:23.760> way<00:07:24.240> too<00:07:24.300> good<00:07:24.600> yeah<00:07:25.430> so

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430 
have made them just way too good yeah so

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.610 
have made them just way too good yeah so
uh<00:07:26.460> I<00:07:27.060> don't<00:07:27.510> know<00:07:27.660> what<00:07:27.960> do<00:07:28.020> you<00:07:28.110> think<00:07:28.350> um

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:28.620 
uh I don't know what do you think um

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.260 
uh I don't know what do you think um
what<00:07:29.220> do<00:07:29.280> you<00:07:29.340> think<00:07:29.460> was<00:07:29.550> missing<00:07:29.880> from<00:07:30.000> fifa

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.270 
what do you think was missing from fifa

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.580 
what do you think was missing from fifa
13<00:07:30.300> you<00:07:30.690> think<00:07:30.840> there's<00:07:30.990> anything<00:07:31.170> that<00:07:31.320> was

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:31.590 
13 you think there's anything that was

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.080 
13 you think there's anything that was
not<00:07:32.070> touched<00:07:32.310> on<00:07:32.520> yet<00:07:32.550> or<00:07:32.940> um<00:07:33.650> 10<00:07:34.820> once<00:07:35.820> I<00:07:35.940> was

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.090 
not touched on yet or um 10 once I was

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.760 
not touched on yet or um 10 once I was
missing<00:07:36.450> but<00:07:36.570> I<00:07:36.630> think<00:07:36.930> they've<00:07:37.080> toned<00:07:37.440> down<00:07:37.710> a

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:37.770 
missing but I think they've toned down a

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.860 
missing but I think they've toned down a
little<00:07:38.310> too<00:07:38.490> much<00:07:38.640> the<00:07:38.850> finesse<00:07:39.150> shots<00:07:39.420> like

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:39.870 
little too much the finesse shots like

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.350 
little too much the finesse shots like
I'm<00:07:40.440> not<00:07:40.740> a<00:07:40.800> huge<00:07:41.130> fan<00:07:41.220> of<00:07:41.430> people<00:07:41.910> being<00:07:42.030> able

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 
I'm not a huge fan of people being able

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.180 
I'm not a huge fan of people being able
to<00:07:42.450> finesse<00:07:42.750> it<00:07:42.810> from<00:07:43.050> my<00:07:43.140> 30<00:07:43.410> yards<00:07:43.830> out<00:07:43.950> and

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:44.190 
to finesse it from my 30 yards out and

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.580 
to finesse it from my 30 yards out and
score<00:07:44.580> every<00:07:44.880> time<00:07:44.910> but<00:07:45.690> I'm<00:07:45.810> also<00:07:45.960> not<00:07:46.110> a<00:07:46.290> huge

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:46.590 
score every time but I'm also not a huge

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.380 
score every time but I'm also not a huge
fan<00:07:46.770> of<00:07:46.830> people<00:07:47.370> missing<00:07:47.550> finesse<00:07:48.030> shots<00:07:48.270> for

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:48.390 
fan of people missing finesse shots for

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.700 
fan of people missing finesse shots for
my<00:07:48.480> 8<00:07:48.630> yards<00:07:48.990> out<00:07:49.140> you<00:07:49.320> know<00:07:49.440> so<00:07:49.560> I<00:07:49.620> think

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:49.710 
my 8 yards out you know so I think

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.170 
my 8 yards out you know so I think
they've<00:07:49.980> gone<00:07:50.100> from<00:07:50.280> one<00:07:50.550> extreme<00:07:50.700> to<00:07:50.970> the

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:51.180 
they've gone from one extreme to the

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.910 
they've gone from one extreme to the
other<00:07:51.270> at<00:07:51.570> the<00:07:51.630> moment<00:07:51.960> and<00:07:52.080> they<00:07:52.500> really<00:07:52.770> need

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:52.920 
other at the moment and they really need

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.320 
other at the moment and they really need
to<00:07:52.950> just<00:07:53.070> find<00:07:53.400> that<00:07:53.460> middle<00:07:53.670> ground<00:07:53.820> with<00:07:54.150> it

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:54.330 
to just find that middle ground with it

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.590 
to just find that middle ground with it
definitely<00:07:55.110> has<00:07:55.380> to<00:07:55.500> be
