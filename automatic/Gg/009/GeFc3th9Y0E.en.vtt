00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:10.260
 4 Hello, Epec today. 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:16.500
 I'll practice writing with two pencils. 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.690
 What about the fact that if you type 4 was a record 41 itjyo finished a little before four 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.990
 It's not. 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.470
 I know how to record, and I'm stronger alone. 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:32.129
 4 When I write it, I do not want to make a recording button. 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:37.440
 4 So I'll take back the first 4 to create and compile true composition 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:42.719
 Well, t1, I make one for about seven seconds. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:46.559
 And please write my text today. 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:51.899
 4 and the size of the pair is 4 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:55.139
 Please give me a little more. 4 The next station made a solid layer. 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.260
 4 Here, the Teth line is going to work. 

00:00:55.139 --> 00:01:03.479
 Yeogieda take kkane Lara 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.949
 Last time Blade &amp; Soul The two letters Ken, the same way , 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.949
 4 this way 4 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:15.860
 The poem about a yoreonsik 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:17.030
 Haejusimyeon 4 is so fast-paced as it did before a little geolro 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.740
 I'll do it 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.430
 Then you see here are four examples so far have already turned the straight path complete 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.580
 There. 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:32.180
 I'll do this for you. 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.630
 And then I got four pencils and I got a glutinous cream. 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:41.900
 Yes . It's the same for a pencil drawing. 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:46.540
 Double-click the pencil to align the point of mind with the point at the end . 4 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:51.310
 Come back now. 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:55.540
 Press m to make a space. 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:00.910
 I will paste 4 pencil positions. 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:03.760
 Now that we have this pass, the pencil is stuck at first. 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:08.619
 Now yes rattling 6 days 4 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:11.470
 The location on the path that comes in a cream pencil benefited little something here 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.230
 Let's make a reasonable four seconds. 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.470
 And press self-press 4 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.110
 I'll show you how to write 4 then 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.000
 Now, I do not see any word yet. 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.670
 Then I'll just move the moving party is not one solid layer parties 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.420

 Channel Light Next Light On 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:50.120
 Now we seek to give yogeol splashed by 9% in the first position within the itjyeo s Toba 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.860
 Next time I press the button, my organic lady turns on the brush 4g for me 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.200
