00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
that works a little bit differently but

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.059 
that works a little bit differently but
you<00:03:58.919> would<00:03:59.220> say<00:03:59.430> let's<00:04:00.209> say<00:04:00.480> here's<00:04:01.409> one<00:04:01.620> this

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
these movies difficulty wise we have we

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.220 
these movies difficulty wise we have we
have<00:05:24.970> mall<00:05:25.150> of<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:25.360> board<00:05:25.660> we<00:05:25.750> were<00:05:25.840> trying<00:05:26.110> to

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
have mall of the board we were trying to

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.610 
have mall of the board we were trying to
have<00:05:26.320> a<00:05:26.350> broad<00:05:26.620> appeal<00:05:26.950> teenagers<00:05:27.910> family<00:05:28.620> and

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
have a broad appeal teenagers family and

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.020 
have a broad appeal teenagers family and
that's<00:05:29.800> why<00:05:29.920> there<00:05:30.070> are<00:05:30.100> hints<00:05:30.340> provided<00:05:30.880> to

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
that's why there are hints provided to

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.610 
that's why there are hints provided to
we<00:05:31.120> give<00:05:31.270> you<00:05:31.360> two<00:05:31.540> hints<00:05:31.810> to<00:05:32.020> help<00:05:32.200> people<00:05:32.380> and

we give you two hints to help people and

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.320 
we give you two hints to help people and
then<00:05:32.860> you<00:05:32.950> can<00:05:33.070> also<00:05:33.220> handicap<00:05:33.910> the<00:05:34.090> movie

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
then you can also handicap the movie

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.270 
then you can also handicap the movie
buff<00:05:34.510> that<00:05:34.750> way<00:05:34.930> so<00:05:35.620> if<00:05:35.740> you<00:05:35.830> had<00:05:36.040> let's<00:05:36.220> say

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
buff that way so if you had let's say

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.470 
buff that way so if you had let's say
people<00:05:36.610> are<00:05:36.760> really<00:05:36.940> knowledgeable<00:05:37.180> about

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
people are really knowledgeable about

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.060 
people are really knowledgeable about
movies<00:05:37.810> put<00:05:37.990> them<00:05:38.140> on<00:05:38.260> one<00:05:38.440> team<00:05:38.710> and<00:05:38.950> then

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
movies put them on one team and then

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.100 
movies put them on one team and then
they<00:05:39.160> don't<00:05:39.250> get<00:05:39.400> the<00:05:39.550> hints<00:05:39.880> you<00:05:40.810> know<00:05:40.960> and

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
they don't get the hints you know and

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.630 
they don't get the hints you know and
everybody<00:05:41.440> else<00:05:41.620> can<00:05:41.860> play<00:05:41.950> on<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.520> other

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
everybody else can play on the other

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.700 
everybody else can play on the other
team<00:05:42.940> and<00:05:43.300> they<00:05:43.420> do<00:05:43.480> get<00:05:43.720> the<00:05:43.840> heads<00:05:44.020> we<00:05:44.440> find

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
team and they do get the heads we find

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.590 
team and they do get the heads we find
that<00:05:44.950> the<00:05:45.490> team<00:05:45.760> that<00:05:45.790> knew<00:05:46.120> the<00:05:46.300> most<00:05:46.450> about

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
that the team that knew the most about

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.390 
that the team that knew the most about
the<00:05:46.870> movies<00:05:47.200> actually<00:05:47.500> did<00:05:47.920> well<00:05:48.130> at<00:05:48.280> this

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
the movies actually did well at this

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.160 
the movies actually did well at this
game<00:05:48.670> it<00:05:48.880> wasn't<00:05:49.030> like<00:05:49.300> this<00:05:49.420> game<00:05:49.660> is<00:05:49.690> pre

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
game it wasn't like this game is pre

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.720 
game it wasn't like this game is pre
balanced<00:05:50.710> so<00:05:50.920> that<00:05:50.950> it's<00:05:51.250> always<00:05:51.370> going<00:05:51.580> to<00:05:51.670> be

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
balanced so that it's always going to be

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.690 
balanced so that it's always going to be
close<00:05:52.150> I<00:05:52.420> like<00:05:52.960> the<00:05:53.110> idea<00:05:53.440> that<00:05:53.500> the<00:05:54.160> this<00:05:54.430> the

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
close I like the idea that the this the

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.100 
close I like the idea that the this the
people<00:05:54.970> that<00:05:55.090> knew<00:05:55.210> the<00:05:55.330> most<00:05:55.510> about<00:05:55.660> movies

people that knew the most about movies

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.820 
people that knew the most about movies
actually<00:05:56.710> got<00:05:56.890> to<00:05:57.040> shine<00:05:57.310> and<00:05:57.930> and<00:05:58.930> whereas

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
actually got to shine and and whereas

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.740 
actually got to shine and and whereas
everybody<00:06:00.400> usually<00:06:00.640> knows<00:06:00.970> the<00:06:01.180> title<00:06:01.570> you

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
everybody usually knows the title you

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.930 
everybody usually knows the title you

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.110 
but you won't know his part you know is
sure<00:06:11.230> of<00:06:11.380> something<00:06:11.770> or<00:06:11.890> other<00:06:11.920> and<00:06:12.250> you<00:06:12.850> won't

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
sure of something or other and you won't

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.610 
sure of something or other and you won't
know<00:06:13.300> the<00:06:13.450> director<00:06:13.870> most<00:06:14.170> of<00:06:14.380> the<00:06:14.440> time

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
know the director most of the time

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.820 
know the director most of the time
although<00:06:14.800> in<00:06:15.010> that<00:06:15.130> case<00:06:15.210> Spielberg

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
although in that case Spielberg

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.510 
although in that case Spielberg
Spielberg<00:06:19.230> so<00:06:20.230> it<00:06:20.620> really<00:06:20.860> balances<00:06:21.040> it<00:06:21.460> out

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
Spielberg so it really balances it out

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.190 
Spielberg so it really balances it out
nicely<00:06:21.820> and<00:06:22.150> the<00:06:22.210> person<00:06:22.570> on<00:06:22.630> the<00:06:22.780> other<00:06:22.900> team

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
nicely and the person on the other team

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.050 
nicely and the person on the other team
that<00:06:23.230> has<00:06:23.920> to<00:06:24.100> be<00:06:24.190> listening<00:06:24.580> because<00:06:24.850> they

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
that has to be listening because they

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.880 
that has to be listening because they
can<00:06:25.240> jump<00:06:25.540> in<00:06:25.690> and<00:06:25.780> steal<00:06:26.050> that<00:06:26.230> director's

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
can jump in and steal that director's

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.320 
can jump in and steal that director's
name<00:06:26.919> or<00:06:27.340> something<00:06:27.580> like

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
name or something like

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.550 
name or something like
sometimes<00:06:28.659> when<00:06:28.810> it's<00:06:28.930> not<00:06:29.050> your<00:06:29.199> turn<00:06:29.409> you're

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
sometimes when it's not your turn you're

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.960 
sometimes when it's not your turn you're
not<00:06:29.680> as<00:06:29.800> nervous<00:06:29.949> so<00:06:30.220> you<00:06:30.250> remember<00:06:30.699> things

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
not as nervous so you remember things

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.300 
not as nervous so you remember things
easier<00:06:31.360> but<00:06:31.629> this<00:06:32.199> cinematically<00:06:32.800> challenged

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
easier but this cinematically challenged

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.409 
easier but this cinematically challenged
can<00:06:33.520> definitely<00:06:33.879> play<00:06:33.970> this<00:06:34.180> game<00:06:36.150> one<00:06:37.150> thing

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:37.419 
can definitely play this game one thing

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.080 
can definitely play this game one thing
I<00:06:37.569> noticed<00:06:38.110> about<00:06:38.199> this<00:06:38.530> game<00:06:38.770> and<00:06:39.699> I<00:06:39.849> didn't
