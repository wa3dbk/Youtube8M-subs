00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.490
 video a bit special that we did not

 for a little while to mention this 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.930
 cheminot the third here is number 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:30.099
 3 but this time no, but why 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:32.050
 lyon pic monday his voice are you ok yes 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.100
 it's been a while since we've been 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.100
 was finally waiting to make this video 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.100
 but no but no I do not say that I have 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.420
 bought a booster at the fneeq and we did not 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.550
 no luck so far the fnac so 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:52.079
 need never know if it's true it's 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.520
 true my motion with will of secret john 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.820
 greenway that then I box them on 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.590
 do not know up to you and so she goes 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.449
 discover that we will open two boosters 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.829
 booster to boost each of bigorre 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.619
 spectral then what will our chain do this 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.090
 will be at the celi against lille he is the tree 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.619
 finally the revenge the second round on 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.479
 will say it will be on the chain of 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.940
 pipelines comes from his string translate 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.979
 description for you to see 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.890
 walk the second round and it will be me 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.709
 tells reindeer quiet so here you go 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.369
 I 'll have a spectral force booster 

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:33.429
 with her but she gheit to placement and 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:36.780
 so canvas said here you want to keep it 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.780
 which one for this video 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.560
 the omega guard against crimes against them 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.230
 but that's what I did is 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.280
 remarkable and express it for I think 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.520
 that the chain like that you will have the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.660
 even with evening so the challenge too 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.860
 of the past blow says you are going to cut 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.300
 compatible steurs because it is under 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.490
 blister for that I'm going to cut and we 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.410
 come back no so here's to boost and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.780
 cut here are the little mosses earth 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.330
 so we recall the principle that is 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.450
 all down the best wins what the 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.780
 best pick 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.850
 that the best wins so I'm going to you 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.680
 show the back of a vigor booster 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.620
 spectral battle of fiore more 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.300
 today 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:31.590
 here it is these girls against 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:33.060
 girl so well it's johnny okay so 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.790
 ectoplasm a media that may need 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.610
 I really like both dishes 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.290
 glasses I hold in time these exchanges is 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:53.070
 a roadster 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:55.670
 I wonder which of the 2,6 to be from 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:01.799
 code into a video designed some gifts 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.910
 and good work here by then 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.040
 against the blow we are on the phone with 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.450
 lady so we do not see the pitfalls that 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.950
 we had one and the other so we go 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:20.400
 try to find memory cards 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:22.170
 it's good you're ready to leave 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:29.770
 to leave then we start with a sense 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:38.959
 critical full body and red 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:39.560
 Ã©caillon a super good I like a lot 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:46.069

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:49.640
 yes but you a corner too too beautiful 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.230
 the agreement we have not shot down before 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:59.150
 to learn flight tests is a lot 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:04:09.340
 open to life in fact it's true it's 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:09.340
 where she was putting up roller brazier 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:20.540
 trainer 20 years 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:22.700
 I come for example I love it is this 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.380
 name is too low and so there we 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.750
 go on arrival it seems to me that's it 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.770
 so we have a darling departure I 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.770
 remember in their various 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.160
 I did not understand the name to agree ok 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.960
 so bah we go to the mia did at the 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:50.780

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:07.010
 only mucus that his job I wanted 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.130
 but I had it governs guys it's 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.910
 the flop is we won both 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.850
 or then finally function points 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.500
 it condemns equal or what 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.850
 talk about what is reported on the pv is 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.010
 what we let subscribers decide or 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:28.010

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.150
 you subscribers who won so is this 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.470
 that we are tied because we have 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.000
 both a hollow or so is 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.800
 what we do according to the pv in 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.210
 these cases there when inequalities and in this 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.380
 case there there will be a winner I 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.790
