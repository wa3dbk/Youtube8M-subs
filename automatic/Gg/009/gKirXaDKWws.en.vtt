00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.599
 hello again how are you friends 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.000
 welcome to another video more this time 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.139
 I come with a new map that I just 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.170
 touch install 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.810
 this time I come with the hunger game 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.070
 but more updated is much better than 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.460
 the one that already had the one that had already 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:34.879
 uploaded before I hope you like them 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.350
 I'm going to show here I have them 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.660
 Y 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.660
 it's much better I liked it much more 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.970
 and we are as always 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.810
 here are the names of the 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.550
 creators 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.070
 to tell us that around me 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.800
 I'm left with the credit because there are not 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.250
 the little creators signs are already in 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.239
 big the poster or ts that says creators 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.340
 Well, I'll show it to you 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.340
 they have to enter here to the little house 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.579
 here there are also more posters there 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.640
 I think they are rules have to read that 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:22.130
 Well, if they are not English, they look for the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.310
 translator on google and ready 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.310
 let's enter this is more orderly 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.799
 ay carts 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.480
 like in the movie I had to leave 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.950
 I think it's train 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.950
 this is much better 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.880
 now I show you there is something that 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.290
 I want to show also that it is very very 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.650
 good are a very automatic elevator 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.479
 well I also know that I can 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.880
 that these days there was a tutorial of 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.000
 how to do it right now I show you how it is 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.000
 it works 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.720
 and good 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.429
 for what they do not know because this map is 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.790
 based on a movie called the 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.020
 Hunger games just like the map and 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.020
 good here 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.930
 is for players who can see 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:26.650
 is much more orderly every player are 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:31.819
 by all seven players each one has 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:35.140
 your room where you have to enter 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.140
 have to go up here 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.240
 here we have as always a chick 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.240
 troll 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.140
 the plants 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.319
 you have to wait you have to wait here 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.579
 why 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.769
 the moderator press a lever so that 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.670
 all the players can come out I think 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:01.080
 that here is a piston down 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.310
 and there we have a piston has to 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.680
 get up has to open up so that 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.260
 can go out and start playing 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.989
 kill yourself and all the chaos there have 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.670
 also an automatic countdown 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.420
 It's pretty good, I'm going to 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.420
 show in a while 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.100
 system has a d 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:26.110
 and repeaters and all that is pretty 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.110
 complicated but it's pretty good 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.740
 for the moderator he has to come here 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.210
 down 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.210
 where is here is the door 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.960
 why 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.290
 has that good or that is the one that does not 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.320
 will play the one that will only control 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.440
 the whole game you will play the 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.940
 lever to start the game 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.590
 has to come here here's what 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.590
 I wanted to show you the elevator 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.400
 that is very handsome that also the 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.780
 I'm going to teach you in a tutorial 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.459
 how to do it 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.390
 you just have to stop in this 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.390
 pressure lever 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.790
 It is pretty good if you want it 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.010
 I can do a how-to tutorial how 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.540
 do this and the good the moderator has 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.540
 to come up here 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.539
 I do not know where the lever is 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:38.409
 I forgot to donate up the lever 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.960
 you have to come here here is the 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.199
 button 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.930
 if we touch this button we will see that 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.820
 here the picture that is there that has 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.370
 a 5 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.160
 and it's something amazing that there are going to 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.260
 see what will happen if I touch the button 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.020
 the pistons are going to open and they are going to 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.890
 can leave the players and also going to 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.890
 have a countdown 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.050
 touched the button look what happens there 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.600
 32 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.240
 one 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.710
 and the game starts, pussy is 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.110
 pretty pretty good 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.990
 and I'm going to investigate how they did 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.900
 that to do a tutorial maybe what 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.860
 achieved because the truth is quite 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.009
 complicated 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.800
 and well now I will go out to show you 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:41.949
 more the map as you can see is 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.719
 pretty good already when as you can see 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.259
 here it gets up scratching the pistons already 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:49.569
 the players will be able to leave and 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:52.740
 start killing yourself trunks to 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:57.690
 find things to 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.960
 that you can create weapons eat I do not know 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.960
 what else 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.820
 and they have to go out into the forest to look 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:08.529
 more things 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.689
 Paul is hidden 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:14.559
 and well, she believes that most 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:18.039
 He knows that it will be the last one 

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:20.289
 is the winner and well I hope 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:23.439
 that you liked this video this 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:27.929
 Haiga map to the video to 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:27.929
 look for more maps and then 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:34.900
 nothing to comment subscribe is it 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:36.730
 they have not done it in like favorite and 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.910
 Well I hope you like it and even the
