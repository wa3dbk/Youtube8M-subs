and<00:00:33.440> here<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.650> the<00:00:34.980> analogue<00:00:35.430> filter

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.870 

Wow

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.630 

so<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.329> is<00:01:27.719> the<00:01:27.990> analogue<00:01:28.320> filter<00:01:28.530> 443<00:01:29.369> from

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
so this is the analogue filter 443 from

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.959 
so this is the analogue filter 443 from

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
on it the frequency knob resonance knob

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.749 
on it the frequency knob resonance knob
and<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.969> envelope<00:01:36.659> knob<00:01:36.960> they<00:01:37.950> all<00:01:38.100> interact

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
and the envelope knob they all interact

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.419 
and the envelope knob they all interact
together<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.560> change<00:01:40.829> one<00:01:41.100> you're

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
together so you can change one you're

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:42.529 
together so you can change one you're
probably<00:01:41.640> gonna<00:01:41.880> want<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.149> change<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> couple

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
probably gonna want to change a couple

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.210 
probably gonna want to change a couple
the<00:01:42.689> other<00:01:42.810> ones<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.350> achieve<00:01:43.679> this<00:01:43.890> sound

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the other ones to achieve this sound

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.600 
the other ones to achieve this sound
that<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.670> looking<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.679> I'm

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
that you are looking for and so I'm

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.700 
that you are looking for and so I'm
going<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.479> play<00:01:48.659> maybe<00:01:49.319> a<00:01:49.409> little<00:01:49.560> bit

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
going to just play maybe a little bit

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.660 
going to just play maybe a little bit
more<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.039> traditional

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:48.520 

sort<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.850> funky<00:01:57.450> use<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.319> style<00:01:58.590> pedal

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.860 

so<00:02:49.530> there<00:02:50.280> we<00:02:50.400> have<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:50.640> traditional<00:02:51.209> funky

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
so there we have the traditional funky

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.250 
so there we have the traditional funky
use<00:02:52.349> of<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:53.040> analogue<00:02:53.459> filter<00:02:53.900> style<00:02:54.900> pedal

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
use of the analogue filter style pedal

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.259 
use of the analogue filter style pedal
I'm<00:02:55.950> going<00:02:56.159> to<00:02:56.220> now<00:02:56.340> just<00:02:56.640> try<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:56.879> show<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.120> a

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
I'm going to now just try and show you a

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.539 
I'm going to now just try and show you a
little<00:02:57.569> bit<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.170> differences<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.890> what

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
little bit of the differences and what

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.089 
little bit of the differences and what
the<00:02:59.700> knobs<00:02:59.909> do<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.599> bear<00:03:01.440> in<00:03:01.530> mind<00:03:01.560> I'll<00:03:01.890> try

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
the knobs do and bear in mind I'll try

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.589 
the knobs do and bear in mind I'll try
and<00:03:02.220> show<00:03:02.280> some<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.819> range<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.209> each<00:03:03.329> knob

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
and show some of the range of each knob

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.680 
and show some of the range of each knob
but<00:03:03.870> they<00:03:04.019> also<00:03:04.549> you<00:03:05.549> want<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.819> interact<00:03:06.359> and

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
but they also you want to interact and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.300 
but they also you want to interact and
do<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.930> few<00:03:07.319> different<00:03:07.409> things<00:03:07.739> so<00:03:07.890> this<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.069> the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
do a few different things so this is the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:21.819 
do a few different things so this is the
the<00:03:08.760> stock<00:03:09.030> setting<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:09.629> had<00:03:09.840> there

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.710 

so<00:03:22.829> let's<00:03:23.010> show<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.579> frequency<00:03:24.180> knob

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
so let's show you the frequency knob

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.229 
so let's show you the frequency knob
first<00:03:25.049> that<00:03:25.890> is<00:03:26.159> where<00:03:26.370> we<00:03:26.519> have<00:03:26.670> had<00:03:26.849> it<00:03:27.000> and

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
first that is where we have had it and

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:58.150 
first that is where we have had it and
now<00:03:27.390> let's<00:03:27.659> crank<00:03:28.019> it<00:03:28.170> over<00:03:28.590> here

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.170 

why<00:03:59.030> so<00:03:59.900> now<00:04:00.740> let's<00:04:01.280> look<00:04:01.460> at<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:01.940> envelope

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
why so now let's look at the envelope

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:13.830 
why so now let's look at the envelope
knob

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.390 

probably<00:04:14.840> when<00:04:15.019> you<00:04:15.140> get<00:04:15.290> that<00:04:15.499> low<00:04:15.890> in<00:04:16.250> the

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
probably when you get that low in the

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.069 
probably when you get that low in the
envelope<00:04:16.789> range<00:04:17.060> you're<00:04:17.630> gonna<00:04:17.750> want<00:04:18.019> to

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
envelope range you're gonna want to

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.229 
envelope range you're gonna want to
adjust<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.620> frequency<00:04:18.799> but<00:04:19.430> just<00:04:19.759> to<00:04:19.910> keep

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
adjust the frequency but just to keep

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.759 
adjust the frequency but just to keep
the<00:04:20.419> frequency<00:04:20.660> there<00:04:21.049> and<00:04:21.259> show<00:04:21.500> you<00:04:21.530> the

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
the frequency there and show you the

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:55.490 
the frequency there and show you the
full<00:04:21.979> range<00:04:22.160> of<00:04:22.370> this<00:04:22.460> right<00:04:22.729> now

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.840 

and<00:04:56.500> now<00:04:56.770> we<00:04:56.830> will<00:04:57.070> look<00:04:57.190> at<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:57.370> resonance

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
and now we will look at the resonance

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:23.740 
and now we will look at the resonance
knob

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:35.470 

so<00:05:24.750> this<00:05:24.900> is<00:05:25.050> about<00:05:25.170> where<00:05:25.500> we<00:05:25.530> started<00:05:31.640> so

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:56.129 

let's<00:05:36.480> try<00:05:36.810> some<00:05:37.080> different<00:05:37.710> settings

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.939 

so<00:05:57.139> as<00:05:57.949> you<00:05:58.580> can<00:05:58.729> see<00:05:59.029> all<00:05:59.779> the<00:06:00.139> knobs<00:06:00.319> interact

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
so as you can see all the knobs interact

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.579 
so as you can see all the knobs interact
quite<00:06:01.249> well<00:06:01.430> together<00:06:02.389> and<00:06:02.779> as<00:06:02.960> well<00:06:03.139> each<00:06:03.409> of

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:03.589 
quite well together and as well each of

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:05.469 
quite well together and as well each of
them<00:06:03.710> has<00:06:03.919> its<00:06:03.949> own<00:06:04.249> particular<00:06:04.580> range<00:06:05.089> and

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
them has its own particular range and

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.269
