read the andre agassi book open and i
think<00:04:44.979> that<00:04:45.159> you<00:04:45.189> know<00:04:45.400> one<00:04:45.669> thing<00:04:45.849> that<00:04:45.969> I

00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:45.999 
think that you know one thing that I

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:49.110 
think that you know one thing that I
guess<00:04:46.270> he<00:04:46.389> did<00:04:46.539> is<00:04:46.689> he<00:04:46.719> shut<00:04:47.080> it<00:04:47.110> down<00:04:47.379> and<00:04:48.219> and

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
guess he did is he shut it down and and

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.909 
guess he did is he shut it down and and
and<00:04:49.449> I<00:04:49.719> just<00:04:50.020> decided<00:04:50.169> look<00:04:50.589> it's<00:04:50.740> time<00:04:50.860> to

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
and I just decided look it's time to

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.980 
and I just decided look it's time to
shut<00:04:51.189> it<00:04:51.339> down<00:04:51.370> this<00:04:52.360> has<00:04:52.509> been<00:04:52.539> the<00:04:52.960> worst

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
shut it down this has been the worst

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.040 
shut it down this has been the worst

that that record might have stood for

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:00.540 
that that record might have stood for
another<00:05:58.990> 20<00:05:59.379> years<00:05:59.409> if<00:05:59.770> they<00:06:00.009> didn't<00:06:00.279> have<00:06:00.399> the

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
another 20 years if they didn't have the

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.339 
another 20 years if they didn't have the
four-month<00:06:00.939> break<00:06:01.209> because<00:06:01.779> i<00:06:01.930> don't<00:06:02.139> think

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:02.349 
four-month break because i don't think

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:04.619 
four-month break because i don't think
anybody<00:06:02.919> under<00:06:03.219> the<00:06:03.249> age<00:06:03.339> of<00:06:03.520> 24<00:06:04.029> can<00:06:04.240> really

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:04.629 
anybody under the age of 24 can really

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:06.689 
anybody under the age of 24 can really
visualize<00:06:05.199> themselves<00:06:05.800> winning<00:06:06.399> the<00:06:06.520> main

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
visualize themselves winning the main

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.670 
visualize themselves winning the main
event<00:06:06.999> i<00:06:07.240> think<00:06:08.050> that<00:06:08.169> i<00:06:08.199> was<00:06:08.349> one<00:06:08.529> of<00:06:08.560> the

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
event i think that i was one of the

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.529 
event i think that i was one of the
first<00:06:09.069> people<00:06:09.430> in<00:06:09.459> history<00:06:09.520> that<00:06:09.849> visualized

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
first people in history that visualized

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.420 
first people in history that visualized
himself<00:06:11.020> winning<00:06:11.319> the<00:06:11.409> main<00:06:11.560> event<00:06:11.860> you<00:06:12.310> know

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
himself winning the main event you know

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.909 
himself winning the main event you know
and<00:06:12.639> just<00:06:12.669> was<00:06:12.969> convinced<00:06:13.599> I<00:06:13.779> was<00:06:14.349> convinced<00:06:14.860> I

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
and just was convinced I was convinced I

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:16.320 
and just was convinced I was convinced I
was<00:06:15.069> going<00:06:15.219> to<00:06:15.279> win<00:06:15.399> it<00:06:15.550> and<00:06:15.639> then<00:06:15.879> I<00:06:15.909> wanted

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
was going to win it and then I wanted

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.389 
was going to win it and then I wanted
and<00:06:16.509> I<00:06:17.050> just<00:06:17.080> don't<00:06:17.439> think<00:06:17.770> I<00:06:17.919> think<00:06:18.159> with<00:06:18.279> the

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:18.399 
and I just don't think I think with the
