sides I'll take a quick measurement to

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.609 
sides I'll take a quick measurement to
see<00:01:27.789> how<00:01:28.030> far<00:01:28.270> away<00:01:28.390> from<00:01:28.569> the<00:01:28.899> carrier<00:01:29.470> that

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
see how far away from the carrier that

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.139 
see how far away from the carrier that
is<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.979> like<00:01:33.130> it's<00:01:33.310> about<00:01:33.520> eight<00:01:33.789> inches

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
is that's like it's about eight inches

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.480 
is that's like it's about eight inches
away<00:01:34.330> we'll<00:01:35.289> want<00:01:35.440> to<00:01:35.500> keep<00:01:35.649> that<00:01:35.890> distance<00:01:36.100> in

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
away we'll want to keep that distance in

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.039 
away we'll want to keep that distance in
mind<00:01:36.729> if<00:01:36.909> we're<00:01:37.060> transporting<00:01:37.630> any<00:01:37.750> kind<00:01:37.959> of
