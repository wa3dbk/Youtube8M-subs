00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.980
 hi guys are brent welcome in 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.140
 this new video 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.550
 then today I wanted to talk to you a lot 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.389
 quickly of a question concerning 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.610
 minecraft ok the background game 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.859
 Any game taken this way to talk 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.990
 just not to frame simply 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.820
 the excess desktop to bring the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.340
 gigantic video and take six years for 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.220
 upload it for those who want to know it need 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.170
 for perfect speed we already start well and 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.170
 what I wanted to talk about as you will 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.820
 definitely heard from video 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.649
 probably mine too but also of 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.469
 surreal does for there is an update in 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.910
 world cup course which car is that one 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.219
 update running the package of 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.890
 fashions we're using up su 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.910
 minecraft black 1.4.5 will add the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.710
 red power 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.140
 we don't know if we have to remove 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.969
 something to add if use a 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.329
 package all our own modify that 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.080
 in short, that we previously did not 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.689
 knows nothing 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.100
 what is the risk guys that in this 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.790
 update you lose you lose the world 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.240
 since there may be some sayings 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.310
 of how to say the conflicts of the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.409
 conflict between the different di 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.850
 objects of incompatibilities etc. 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.170
 etc. then said this precisely not 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.320
 it seems to me the case at least for the moment 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.380
 to continue playing on that again 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.180
 server until I know for sure 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.799
 whether the world will be there or not 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.960
 think if maybe I get to 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.479
 still record I make machinery things 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.829
 various and then maybe we have to change but 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.570
 can anyway those machines 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.490
 they disappear for some reason it would be 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.140
 then all work thrown up to 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.790
 when we are not sure of what 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.100
 we'll have to do on minecraft with that 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.649
 series I prefer at this point not 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.299
 continue to register no 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.070
 alternatively, therefore always on 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.220
 minecraft I wanted to hear a little bit from 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:08.200
 you what you had to propose to me then 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:10.420
 for example what could always keep me 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.140
 always about minecraft example a non 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.210
 I know if I play single player on one 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.700
 custom map or maybe some mode 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.830
 strange as all such multiplayer 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.830
 you will know there are hunger games are 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.100
 been contacted lately by the dal 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.190
 Creator of the greased miners server that i 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.320
 he invited and invited nothing too 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.150
 because month however a reason or for a 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.830
 I have never had time to enter 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.570
 in if it will come but how can I not see 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:48.520
 the machines an inch you see that does 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:50.440
 unfortunately I don't know what to say then 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.580
 hunger games and I saw the video today 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.350
 surreal does where it said that 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.500
 probably he would have started 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.030
 with hunger games so I wouldn't want to 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.310
 to hear me say that I copied from him 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.320
 etc. etc. so first wait 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.140
 a little your opinions on the matter 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.670
 whether to play that or another 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.290
 what in single player 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.480
 in short, to see a moment naturally 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.370
 you can express your opinions to 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.910
 regard by personal message 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.800
 by comment as you wish 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.140
 here we feel a little bit so we find 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.019
 this this series of replacements e 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.700
 however, it will last only a few days 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.100
 I suppose because it's going to come out anyway 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.500
 this this mode pack too 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.769
 updated so we will soon know what it is 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.980
 in short, something must be done 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.720
 at the moment to fill we say 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.720
 this on this hole in quotation marks 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.920
 so expect your advice 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.860
 meanwhile, I want to tell you how you will do it 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.860
 seen there is a second video of the day 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.840
 what mac I put in when I can 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.820
 to put it in dependence on the time that a 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.560
 arrangement that many times a series 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.130
 with super fa for example battlefield 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.440
 3 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.920
 now we have also registered equips 2 ad 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.600
 example according to you there is a game in 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.040
 particular that I can bring in 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.870
 alternation and video with su rafah for 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.120
 because it keeps however apart from that not 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.220
 we always record every day why 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.650
 we have for another we may not 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.579
 be there neither I nor he, et cetera 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.049
 besides that we put one every day 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.639
 once a video and once a video of him 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.389
 so not every day video increase 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.830
 a super faber 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.840
 so I also need a game 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.090
 alternative to minecraft is at battlefield 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.510
 3 for when it's not my day 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.639
 take it round what is a game that 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.520
 you may be interested in what i can bring 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.770
 now I tell you one thing in advance 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.870
 I don't know how many of you play magic 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:46.900
 that in the reggiano well benino on magic 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:52.560
 but surely one of us is there and 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.560
 he is me I play magic we say from 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:03.580
 nine years are very passionate and how 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.539
 you know magic the gathering is out 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.340
 duels of the planeswalkers 2013 edition 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.680
 I'd like to maybe bring some 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.020
 clash of those there but I know that maybe 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.580
 many of you don't play magic then 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.080
 I want to know in advance before 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.220
 shit, maybe I can make a video 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.870
 pre or try to see who follows him at 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.380
 those who like magic and so on 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.639
 meanwhile I'm asking here to learn 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.490
 advance 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:33.340
 alternatively there are other types 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.100
 of games I don't know for example lately 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:40.220
 the video of the 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:42.480
 the game of pelatone hitman absolution 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.850
 that could be an alternative to the 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.650
 problem kate mania just a campaign 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:51.360
 see i don't know what i'm doing in these 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:53.280
 moments the fact is that I would not bring 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.950
 however the whole hitler campaign 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.450
 because maybe I don't know 40 episodes 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.900
 that puts every other day 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:03.480
 I finish after 6,000 years so not 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.800
 I want to do so so I prefer more 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.800
 what else a game of the is made of 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.720
 precise matches closed for its own sake 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.820
 same the next video is not 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:16.050
 connected to others so I was 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.850
 thinking for example also of ad cox 2 that 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.870
 however I have never yet brought you there 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:25.620
 would like to maybe do some analysis on 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:27.120
 some weapons stuff like that though also 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.310
 in short, I wait for you there 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.220
 in short, say vox populi in your mind 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.260
 vox pop the themes of themes all of tebi 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.120
 all I hear you write through 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.610
 personal message through features 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.890
 all that is nothing more than anything else 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.570
 I can thank you for this point 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.430
 watching this video I know for 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.050
 background game could be 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.230
 was crappy also because i'm 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.760
 leaving in half a second 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.070
 but I hope the message is more or 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.730
 less arrived strong and clear and nothing 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:59.160
 with this I thank you 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:02.030
 we get the next ok thanks 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.030
 a thousand bye bye
