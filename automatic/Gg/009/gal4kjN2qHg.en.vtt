00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
of shock mounts which is what this is

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.420 
of shock mounts which is what this is
isolate<00:01:43.040> isolates<00:01:43.939> it<00:01:44.180> from<00:01:45.340> vibration<00:01:46.340> and

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
isolate isolates it from vibration and
