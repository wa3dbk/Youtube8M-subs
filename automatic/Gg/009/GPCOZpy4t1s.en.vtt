around the same is that we will close
down<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.649> highways<00:02:08.420> approximately<00:02:09.420> 12

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
down the highways approximately 12

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.700 
down the highways approximately 12
minutes<00:02:09.810> before<00:02:09.959> they<00:02:10.259> employ<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.770> stadium

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
minutes before they employ the stadium

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.050 
minutes before they employ the stadium
okay<00:02:12.010> so<00:02:12.070> we<00:02:12.190> had<00:02:12.280> 12<00:02:12.490> minutes<00:02:12.790> before<00:02:13.000> the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
okay so we had 12 minutes before the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.040 
okay so we had 12 minutes before the
state<00:02:13.270> same<00:02:13.960> goes<00:02:14.200> off<00:02:14.490> it'll<00:02:15.490> come<00:02:15.910> down<00:02:16.050> the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
state same goes off it'll come down the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.420 
state same goes off it'll come down the
dust<00:02:17.260> will<00:02:17.410> clear<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.920> then<00:02:18.100> we'll<00:02:18.220> let<00:02:18.310> the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
dust will clear and then we'll let the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.550 
dust will clear and then we'll let the
traffic<00:02:18.910> go<00:02:19.180> again<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.930> roads<00:02:20.380> will<00:02:20.470> be

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
traffic go again so the roads will be

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.490 
traffic go again so the roads will be
closed<00:02:20.830> probably<00:02:21.520> 30<00:02:21.820> minutes<00:02:22.090> or<00:02:22.300> so<00:02:22.500> while

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
closed probably 30 minutes or so while

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.440 
closed probably 30 minutes or so while
we<00:02:23.620> wait<00:02:23.740> for<00:02:23.770> just<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.190> clear<00:02:24.460> he<00:02:25.000> later<00:02:25.180> went
