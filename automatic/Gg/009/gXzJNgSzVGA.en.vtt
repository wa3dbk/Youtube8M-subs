dark<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.300> think<00:00:48.390> then<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.200> want<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.379> make<00:00:49.530> it

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
dark I think then if you want to make it

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.380 
dark I think then if you want to make it
more<00:00:49.920> formal<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.460> doesn't<00:00:50.730> stick<00:00:50.940> out<00:00:51.120> it's

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
more formal it doesn't stick out it's

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.510 
more formal it doesn't stick out it's
something<00:00:51.860> all-american<00:00:52.860> maybe<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.190> plaid

something all-american maybe a plaid

to keep it sportive we want to keep the
jeans<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.710> notice<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> colors<00:01:32.130> are<00:01:32.220> all

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
jeans on you notice the colors are all

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.469 
jeans on you notice the colors are all
slightly<00:01:32.579> different<00:01:32.700> because<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> wheels

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
slightly different because the wheels

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.789 
slightly different because the wheels
are<00:01:33.600> slightly<00:01:33.840> different<00:01:34.229> even<00:01:34.380> if<00:01:34.590> they're

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
are slightly different even if they're

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.830 
are slightly different even if they're
very<00:01:34.950> close<00:01:35.250> they<00:01:35.549> end<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:35.759> giving<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> bit

very close they end up giving you a bit
of<00:01:36.869> depth<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:37.890> need<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.100> something

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
of depth so what we need is something

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.609 
of depth so what we need is something
that<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.450> work<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.170> more<00:01:40.350> dressy

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
have formal wait- so in this case of

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.580

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
actually real people are choosing to

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.900 
actually real people are choosing to
dress<00:02:23.170> not<00:02:23.800> according<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.250> some<00:02:24.370> age-old

rules which some of which are great and
some<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:27.070> which<00:02:27.130> don't<00:02:27.400> really<00:02:27.490> apply<00:02:27.760> anymore

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
some of which don't really apply anymore

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.820 
some of which don't really apply anymore
depending<00:02:28.690> on<00:02:28.780> your<00:02:28.900> mood<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.290> can<00:02:29.440> take<00:02:29.650> this

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
depending on your mood you can take this

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.980 
depending on your mood you can take this
more<00:02:30.250> simple<00:02:30.700> take<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.030> tire<00:02:31.270> off<00:02:31.300> lose<00:02:31.840> the

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
more simple take the tire off lose the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.200 
more simple take the tire off lose the
vest<00:02:32.230> lose<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.800> coat<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.760> idea<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.180> that

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
vest lose the coat so the idea is that

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.150 
vest lose the coat so the idea is that
it's<00:02:34.540> never<00:02:34.780> entirely<00:02:35.200> formal<00:02:35.770> it's<00:02:35.920> never

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
it's never entirely formal it's never

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.400 
it's never entirely formal it's never
entirely<00:02:36.550> casual<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.960> way<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.260> always

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
entirely casual and that way it always

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.720 
entirely casual and that way it always
raises<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:39.040> level<00:02:39.160> of<00:02:39.340> what<00:02:39.490> you're<00:02:39.610> wearing

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
raises the level of what you're wearing

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.640 
raises the level of what you're wearing
but<00:02:40.420> down<00:02:40.630> there<00:02:40.780> we<00:02:40.900> have<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.140> we've<00:02:41.260> got<00:02:41.410> two

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
but down there we have it we've got two

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.530 
but down there we have it we've got two
looks<00:02:41.890> but<00:02:42.130> they're<00:02:42.280> actually<00:02:42.460> probably<00:02:43.030> 10

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
looks but they're actually probably 10

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.640 
looks but they're actually probably 10
looks<00:02:43.810> depending<00:02:44.170> on<00:02:44.260> how<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:44.440> put<00:02:44.560> them

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
looks depending on how you put them

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.020 
looks depending on how you put them
together<00:02:44.770> when<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.490> buy<00:02:45.610> something<00:02:45.670> you

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
together when you buy something you
