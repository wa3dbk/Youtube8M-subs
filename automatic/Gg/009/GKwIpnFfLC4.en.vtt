00:00:53.909 --> 00:01:01.870
 And then everyone, beauty vertigo and bringing 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:04.540
 But you and I am here. 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.659
 wanting to start a new series here in the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.890
 channel and the chance is people will be kit 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:16.090
 and saw hugo galera that same a series 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.590
 shot and saw the hunger games and MCMV 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.090
 It's going to be this series, people. I'm seeing. 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.020
 many Brazilians and gringos too 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.560
 making this series of kits and saw that it is the 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.330
 that you take an mvp kit and make a 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.119
 review to give you an explanation 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.659
 live in the video about it makes a gameplay 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:38.229
 commented on the background he makes and how 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.880
 I got one live pro now on mpb and 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.459
 I have all the kits gonna get this one. 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.429
 series that now and I hope you guys 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:47.549
 enjoy and support suffer from beck and 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:51.069
 expects feedback from your device 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.080
 because these videos you've reviewed give 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.259
 job typing is very young. 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.750
 edit and to be able to record also and the kit 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.239
 today reviewed what people who tank you 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:07.569
 very good kit to be able to play you 

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:10.269
 against teams and go and until then I think 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:14.310
 There is nothing else, no more people, and no more. 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.310
 that's it and let's go to the river 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.599
 ae 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:34.970
 in so many people in what he reviewed today is the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.570
 first thing you saw here on the channel is what 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.180
 tank tank what does tank do or 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.550
 tank kit it simply causes that 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.260
 your opponent as soon as you mars 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.780
 he exploded 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.240
 then your opponent will come to a club only 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.350
 that they can die if they do not arrive 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.230
 close to you 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.510
 so I know if you kill him and him 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.520
 is a team so his team 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.740
 It goes by below what will be the 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.300
 explosion so if the guy has to 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.210
 Armor, I think she's the coordinator. 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.560
 will never die will also stay 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.290
 where there is a continuous 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.770
 from 5 there one point you kill was already mine 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.630
 people gave general exploded can even see in the 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.690
 hour play technician I think I killed one 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.460
 which was continuous from 2012 I know that 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.310
 she has 11 hit the other too 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.950
 and you take here because of that another 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.100
 sic good thing is also hot obvious 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.080
 that had to be you are vulnerable to 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.870
 blast you do not take damage with the 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.390
 blast your opponent all your 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.610
 opponent will explode will not take damage 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.350
 because it was going to be kind of stupid 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.990
 You get a kit if you can die. 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.440
 along with the guy was going to be very ridiculous 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:48.290
 That's it and then this is it guys the tip 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.180
 in this kit is that you play the 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.240
 game to continue playing with teams and will 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.460
 end up killing his of his friends too 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.060
 play alone look for a team or you want 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:01.340
 killing someone will find wine is 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.740
 exploded face of lonely zoeira anyway 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.930
 but it's good to be able to play against teams 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.450
 Galley to play solo only 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.690
 so that's it guys adidas play solo 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.250
 in the hunger games with the tank kit and go 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.470
 pull against the teams there you go 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.989
 have a good day, have a good time 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.030
 I thought beck's sampa guys there. 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.510
 see if you like this series 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.730
 television and I hope we like it 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.490
 left the favorite team that this video 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.830
 It's a job to dictate and more is 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.940
 That's good people and that's it guys until 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.420
 next 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.420
 loew
