00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
the first thing you want to do is just

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.810 
the first thing you want to do is just
drink<00:03:04.200> tons<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.680> water<00:03:04.739> so<00:03:05.250> drink<00:03:05.550> about<00:03:05.640> a

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
drink tons of water so drink about a

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.120 
drink tons of water so drink about a
gallon<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.480> water<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.230> your<00:03:07.530> body<00:03:07.830> can

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
gallon of water so that your body can

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.010 
gallon of water so that your body can
get<00:03:08.280> rid<00:03:08.459> of<00:03:08.550> all<00:03:08.700> those<00:03:08.850> toxins<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.690> clean

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
itself out so you'll probably go over

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
quite a few times as well but that's the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.440 
quite a few times as well but that's the
point<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.220> want<00:03:17.430> your<00:03:17.580> body<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.880> do<00:03:18.120> start
