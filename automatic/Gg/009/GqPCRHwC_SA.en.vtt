this<00:05:05.300> book<00:05:05.600> is<00:05:06.560> that<00:05:06.760> there's<00:05:07.760> some<00:05:07.910> seems

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
this book is that there's some seems

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.460 
this book is that there's some seems
that<00:05:08.330> some<00:05:08.510> people<00:05:08.810> maybe<00:05:08.960> wouldn't<00:05:09.380> be

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
that some people maybe wouldn't be

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.779 
that some people maybe wouldn't be
comfortable<00:05:10.099> obviously<00:05:10.550> there's

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
comfortable obviously there's

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.850 
comfortable obviously there's
dismembered<00:05:11.360> body<00:05:11.810> which<00:05:12.050> is<00:05:12.169> quite<00:05:12.410> detailed

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
dismembered body which is quite detailed

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.589 
dismembered body which is quite detailed
I'm<00:05:13.099> not<00:05:13.580> fond<00:05:13.760> of<00:05:13.789> blood<00:05:14.120> I<00:05:14.240> don't<00:05:14.419> really

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
I'm not fond of blood I don't really

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.060 
I'm not fond of blood I don't really
like<00:05:14.780> things<00:05:15.020> like<00:05:15.139> that<00:05:15.289> and<00:05:15.470> actually<00:05:15.979> it

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
like things like that and actually it

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.250 
like things like that and actually it
wasn't<00:05:16.220> so<00:05:16.460> bad<00:05:16.639> in<00:05:17.000> that<00:05:17.090> respect<00:05:17.570> it's

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
wasn't so bad in that respect it's

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.310 
wasn't so bad in that respect it's
described<00:05:19.039> as<00:05:19.479> though<00:05:20.479> he's<00:05:20.840> an<00:05:21.110> animal

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
described as though he's an animal

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.580 
described as though he's an animal
because<00:05:22.450> when<00:05:23.450> we<00:05:23.539> doing<00:05:23.810> it<00:05:23.900> attach<00:05:24.139> themself

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
because when we doing it attach themself

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.190 
because when we doing it attach themself
so<00:05:24.880> you<00:05:25.880> read<00:05:26.090> it<00:05:26.120> from<00:05:26.360> that<00:05:26.450> attachment<00:05:27.020> and

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
so you read it from that attachment and

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.219 
so you read it from that attachment and
you<00:05:27.400> also<00:05:28.400> therefore<00:05:28.639> feel<00:05:29.000> detached<00:05:29.360> but

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
you also therefore feel detached but

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.190 
you also therefore feel detached but
actually<00:05:30.560> you<00:05:30.620> get<00:05:30.740> nearer<00:05:30.979> to<00:05:31.190> the<00:05:31.310> end

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
actually you get nearer to the end

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.930 
actually you get nearer to the end
that's<00:05:33.200> some<00:05:33.440> some<00:05:34.099> things<00:05:34.370> that<00:05:34.520> maybe<00:05:34.700> some

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
that's some some things that maybe some

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.700 
that's some some things that maybe some
people<00:05:35.090> wouldn't<00:05:35.330> like<00:05:35.539> described<00:05:36.320> from

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
people wouldn't like described from

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.550 
people wouldn't like described from
characters<00:05:37.370> past<00:05:37.550> so<00:05:37.970> and<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.660> the<00:05:39.020> gangster

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
characters past so and the the gangster

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.290 
characters past so and the the gangster
has<00:05:40.220> a<00:05:40.250> very<00:05:40.550> violent<00:05:41.030> past<00:05:41.479> and<00:05:42.400> he<00:05:43.400> raped<00:05:44.060> and

has a very violent past and he raped and
tortured<00:05:44.360> a<00:05:44.750> woman<00:05:45.050> when<00:05:45.530> he<00:05:45.650> was<00:05:45.770> much

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
tortured a woman when he was much

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.089 
tortured a woman when he was much
younger<00:05:45.950> and<00:05:46.990> he<00:05:47.990> describes<00:05:48.349> these<00:05:48.620> things<00:05:48.860> to

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
younger and he describes these things to

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.610 
younger and he describes these things to
you<00:05:49.280> several<00:05:50.030> times<00:05:50.240> throughout<00:05:50.419> the<00:05:50.479> book

you several times throughout the book

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.409

terms<00:06:33.860> of<00:06:33.980> the<00:06:34.070> characters<00:06:34.490> it<00:06:34.850> works

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
terms of the characters it works

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.830 
terms of the characters it works
perfectly<00:06:35.960> and<00:06:36.550> you<00:06:37.550> when<00:06:37.970> you<00:06:38.000> step<00:06:38.300> back<00:06:38.480> and

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.870 
perfectly and you when you step back and
think<00:06:39.470> of<00:06:40.070> it<00:06:40.190> from<00:06:40.250> the<00:06:40.370> character's<00:06:40.730> point

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
think of it from the character's point

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.020 
think of it from the character's point
of<00:06:41.030> view<00:06:41.980> if<00:06:42.980> there<00:06:43.190> were<00:06:43.280> real<00:06:43.460> people<00:06:43.640> that

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
of view if there were real people that

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.940 
of view if there were real people that
is<00:06:44.180> what<00:06:44.360> would<00:06:44.450> have<00:06:44.570> happened<00:06:44.900> that<00:06:45.260> is<00:06:45.380> why

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.950 
is what would have happened that is why

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.190 
is what would have happened that is why
they<00:06:46.160> don't<00:06:46.310> develop<00:06:46.490> that<00:06:46.790> is<00:06:46.910> what<00:06:47.300> they've

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.200 
they don't develop that is what they've

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.550 
they don't develop that is what they've
become

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 
become

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.200 
become
and<00:06:49.690> yeah<00:06:50.690> it<00:06:50.870> works<00:06:51.080> it<00:06:51.320> works<00:06:51.410> perfectly

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
and yeah it works it works perfectly

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.710 
and yeah it works it works perfectly
it's<00:06:53.210> maybe<00:06:53.419> not<00:06:53.570> what<00:06:53.810> you<00:06:53.930> want<00:06:54.139> to<00:06:54.620> happen

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
it's maybe not what you want to happen

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.090 
it's maybe not what you want to happen
so<00:06:56.720> yeah<00:06:56.840> I've<00:06:57.110> struggled<00:06:57.470> with<00:06:57.620> the<00:06:57.770> ending

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
so yeah I've struggled with the ending

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.760 
so yeah I've struggled with the ending
so<00:06:58.970> that<00:06:59.300> was<00:06:59.540> out<00:06:59.750> why<00:07:00.050> not<00:07:00.200> so<00:07:00.380> can<00:07:00.590> we<00:07:00.650> know

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770 
so that was out why not so can we know

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.930
