also have the USB and power cord now

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.759 
also have the USB and power cord now
this<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.480> interesting<00:02:42.629> it's<00:02:43.560> got<00:02:43.680> the

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
this is interesting it's got the

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.350 
this is interesting it's got the
standard<00:02:44.099> micro<00:02:44.819> oh<00:02:45.030> no<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:47.360> different

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
standard micro oh no this is a different

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.759 
standard micro oh no this is a different
USB<00:02:48.540> cord<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.049> was<00:02:49.140> expected<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.680> the

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
USB cord that was expected this is the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.890 
USB cord that was expected this is the
micro<00:02:50.010> USB<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.610> believe<00:02:51.510> that's<00:02:51.660> what<00:02:51.810> it's

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
micro USB I believe that's what it's

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.130 
micro USB I believe that's what it's
called<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.849> here<00:02:53.849> they've<00:02:54.000> given<00:02:54.209> us<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.629> power

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
called and here they've given us a power

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.979 
called and here they've given us a power
adapter<00:02:55.349> that<00:02:55.739> goes<00:02:55.799> into<00:02:56.099> USB<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.810> imagine

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
adapter that goes into USB so I imagine

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:58.970 
adapter that goes into USB so I imagine
this<00:02:58.200> could<00:02:58.379> be<00:02:58.440> used<00:02:58.560> for<00:02:58.590> lots<00:02:58.799> of<00:02:58.890> other

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
this could be used for lots of other

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.900 
this could be used for lots of other
things<00:02:59.250> too<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:01.620> there's<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.100> power<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.639> data

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
things too so there's the power and data

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.039 
things too so there's the power and data
cord<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:04.100> that's<00:03:05.100> basically<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.609> so<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.900> terms

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
cord and that's basically it so in terms

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.479 
cord and that's basically it so in terms
of<00:03:07.230> what's<00:03:07.410> useful<00:03:07.620> for<00:03:07.859> the<00:03:07.920> cable<00:03:08.069> we<00:03:08.280> have

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
of what's useful for the cable we have

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.490 
of what's useful for the cable we have
the<00:03:08.940> power<00:03:09.150> cord<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.889> the<00:03:10.889> Kindle<00:03:11.519> itself<00:03:12.500> so

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
the power cord and the Kindle itself so

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.080 
the power cord and the Kindle itself so
let's<00:03:13.739> take<00:03:13.950> off<00:03:14.130> this<00:03:14.310> protective<00:03:14.519> screen

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
let's take off this protective screen

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.440 
let's take off this protective screen
cover<00:03:19.700> actually<00:03:20.700> this<00:03:20.790> was<00:03:20.970> on<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.150> screen

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
cover actually this was on the screen

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.330 
cover actually this was on the screen
itself<00:03:21.569> I<00:03:21.900> find<00:03:22.109> this<00:03:22.200> very<00:03:22.290> interesting<00:03:22.470> so

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
itself I find this very interesting so

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.789 
itself I find this very interesting so
on<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.819> Kindle<00:03:24.269> they've<00:03:24.959> actually<00:03:25.139> shifted
