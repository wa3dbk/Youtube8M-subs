my<00:01:02.430> opinion<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.150> his<00:01:03.240> Q<00:01:03.480> alone<00:01:03.750> hit<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
my opinion just on his Q alone hit the

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.950 
my opinion just on his Q alone hit the
AP<00:01:05.250> scaling<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.030> used<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.390> 0<00:01:06.420> point<00:01:06.660> 6

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
AP scaling for this used to be 0 point 6

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.320 
AP scaling for this used to be 0 point 6
and<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.800> now<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.190> way<00:01:08.310> down<00:01:08.460> 2.3<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and it's now all the way down 2.3 and

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.030 
and it's now all the way down 2.3 and
for<00:01:10.140> anyone<00:01:10.410> who<00:01:10.530> doesn't<00:01:10.680> know<00:01:10.800> what<00:01:10.920> that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
for anyone who doesn't know what that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.500 
for anyone who doesn't know what that
means<00:01:11.250> let<00:01:11.430> me<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.640> hover<00:01:11.790> over<00:01:12.000> his<00:01:12.090> cue<00:01:12.300> it

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
means let me just hover over his cue it

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.930 
means let me just hover over his cue it
says<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.410> deals<00:01:13.590> 10<00:01:13.950> damage<00:01:14.220> right<00:01:14.550> now<00:01:14.700> plus

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
says it deals 10 damage right now plus

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.630 
says it deals 10 damage right now plus
42<00:01:15.380> now<00:01:16.380> he<00:01:16.440> would<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.890> had<00:01:17.040> his<00:01:17.190> original

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
42 now he would have had his original

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.880 
42 now he would have had his original
scaling<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.390> would<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.690> at<00:01:18.810> about<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.050> plus<00:01:19.380> 72

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
scaling that would be at about a plus 72

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.070 
scaling that would be at about a plus 72
so<00:01:20.640> that's<00:01:20.910> that's<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.450> difference<00:01:21.660> there

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
so that's that's the difference there

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.350 
so that's that's the difference there
and<00:01:22.260> it<00:01:22.619> also<00:01:22.770> caps<00:01:23.190> out<00:01:23.430> when<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.700> max<00:01:23.940> your<00:01:24.180> Q

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and it also caps out when you max your Q

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.570 
and it also caps out when you max your Q
it<00:01:24.540> caps<00:01:24.750> out<00:01:24.930> at<00:01:25.050> 70<00:01:25.380> damage<00:01:25.740> instead<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.130> 130

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
it caps out at 70 damage instead of 130

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.260 
it caps out at 70 damage instead of 130
which<00:01:27.540> i<00:01:27.690> think<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.960> kind<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.290> big<00:01:28.470> deal<00:01:29.270> that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
which i think is kind of a big deal that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.150 
which i think is kind of a big deal that
that's<00:01:30.570> definitely<00:01:31.050> eliminates<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.920> lot<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
that's definitely eliminates a lot of

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.670 
that's definitely eliminates a lot of
his<00:01:32.340> damage<00:01:32.550> but<00:01:32.910> we'll<00:01:33.510> see<00:01:33.780> how<00:01:33.810> he<00:01:34.050> kind<00:01:34.560> of

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
his damage but we'll see how he kind of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.990 
his damage but we'll see how he kind of
gets<00:01:34.830> made<00:01:35.070> up<00:01:35.190> for<00:01:35.369> with<00:01:35.400> his<00:01:35.610> ultimate

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
gets made up for with his ultimate

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.770 
gets made up for with his ultimate
that's<00:01:36.210> that's<00:01:36.479> changed<00:01:36.840> as<00:01:36.930> well<00:01:37.070> now<00:01:38.070> his<00:01:38.280> W

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
that's that's changed as well now his W

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.609 
that's that's changed as well now his W
this<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.960> where<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.200> gets<00:01:40.229> kind<00:01:40.470> of

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
this is where it gets kind of

this is where it gets kind of

here now his old scaling is still 11.0
that's<00:02:15.300> not<00:02:15.510> changing<00:02:15.870> anytime<00:02:16.110> soon<00:02:16.290> that's

that's<00:02:32.100> why<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:33.030> W<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.600> down<00:02:33.810> that's<00:02:34.019> why<00:02:34.230> the

that's why the W is down that's why the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.650 
that's why the W is down that's why the
Q<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.650> down<00:02:34.860> because<00:02:35.820> of<00:02:35.850> this<00:02:36.060> damage<00:02:36.299> boost

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
Q is down because of this damage boost

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.110 
Q is down because of this damage boost
now<00:02:36.870> six<00:02:37.170> seconds<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:38.700> like<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.030> average

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
now six seconds to like the average

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.880 
now six seconds to like the average

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
see right now I go in I don't know why

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.130 
see right now I go in I don't know why
flash<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.790> get<00:02:50.970> silence<00:02:51.360> but<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.570> altar<00:02:51.959> and

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
flash and I get silence but I altar and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.080 
flash and I get silence but I altar and
I<00:02:52.650> don't<00:02:52.799> know<00:02:52.860> if<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.100> me<00:02:53.250> doing<00:02:53.580> twenty

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
I don't know if it's me doing twenty

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.490 
I don't know if it's me doing twenty
percent<00:02:54.299> extra<00:02:54.600> damage<00:02:54.750> although<00:02:55.140> I'm<00:02:55.350> pretty

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
percent extra damage although I'm pretty

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.530 
percent extra damage although I'm pretty
sure<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:55.950> because<00:02:56.549> i<00:02:56.640> only<00:02:56.790> had<00:02:56.970> two<00:02:57.180> items

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
sure it is because i only had two items

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.350 
sure it is because i only had two items
and<00:02:57.750> she<00:02:58.230> just<00:02:58.349> gets<00:02:58.530> deleted<00:02:59.060> so<00:03:00.060> there<00:03:00.209> it<00:03:00.300> is

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
and she just gets deleted so there it is

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.270 
and she just gets deleted so there it is
all<00:03:00.599> in<00:03:00.780> all<00:03:00.900> it's<00:03:01.410> pretty<00:03:01.650> good<00:03:01.800> change<00:03:02.069> I

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
all in all it's pretty good change I

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.740 
all in all it's pretty good change I
mean<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.550> balances<00:03:03.060> out<00:03:03.180> with<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.420> 20

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
mean it balances out with the 20

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.230 
mean it balances out with the 20
damage<00:03:04.230> increase<00:03:04.560> but<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.880> only<00:03:06.060> thing

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
damage increase but it the only thing

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.670 
damage increase but it the only thing
that<00:03:06.360> that<00:03:06.480> means<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.810> his<00:03:07.080> Q<00:03:07.320> doesn't<00:03:07.470> do

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
that that means is that his Q doesn't do

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.550 
that that means is that his Q doesn't do
damage<00:03:08.180> any<00:03:09.180> extra<00:03:09.570> damage<00:03:09.750> normally<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.380> lane
