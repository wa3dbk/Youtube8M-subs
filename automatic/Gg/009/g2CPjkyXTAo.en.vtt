 I have a special recipe for tenderloin 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.050
 pork with sauteed vegetables so 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.290
 let's start seasoning the back of 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.990
 pork 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.990
 we put a little salt 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.260
 and we add pepper 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:39.040
 Well, we have the loin ready, we're going 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.040
 to take to hot oil to seal 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.159
 let's see how our steak 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.119
 we are going to turn it around 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.119
 finish sealing 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.140
 after sealing our pork steak 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.980
 let's add the vegetables to the pan 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.980
 where we seal it these vegetables are 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:09.190
 mushrooms broccoli onion paprika and 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.240
 a little garlic let's add the broth 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.060
 of chicken 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.140
 Y 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.140
 and the wine 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.310
 when you see that the onion is already 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.460
 begins to put transparent is the point 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.120
 where you are ready to add the 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.120
 other ingredients 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.800
 ah 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.850
 our vegetables are already finishing 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.870
 cook now let's place 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.000
 for this pork steak we have a 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.210
 excellent option that is the puree of 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.100
 Sweet potato is very simple to prepare alone 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.250
 is to take the potatoes to put them to cook 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.170
 at 35 minutes has a high content in 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.450
 Folic acid is perfect for 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.790
 pregnant women for people 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.280
 older and in general for all those 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.310
 want to eat a balanced diet 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:10.550
 let's serve the steak 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:14.240
 and finally we are going to put the vegetables 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.240

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.580
 and we finished putting the vegetables 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.950
 I present the pork steak with 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.010
 sauteed vegetables 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.010

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.870
 i 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:41.140
 spectacular and for this region 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.299
 and even for food as a meal 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.010
 little girl can not start so much in one 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.910

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.790
