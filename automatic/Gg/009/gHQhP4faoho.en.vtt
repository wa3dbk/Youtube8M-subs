00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:51.260
 the oven half town instead of very 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.340
 beaten very well and that is the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.340
 dynamic movement 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.280
 Maybe many think that is 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.170
 outside again look that 's almost 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.470
 Finished it outside is actually 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.470
 outside the sound but that is outside 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.080
 on road 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.590
 this is a phantom gate the 6th 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.540
 that's why it's been set crate says 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.820
 Now maybe David Michael 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.130
 was not that stefan kieÃŸling and 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.530
 two spectators so that there is 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.610
 I also do not know that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.690
 harm 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:47.060
 this is not so but which was, of course, 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.060
 Followed where that yourself 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.830
 followed 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.099
 and that is quite embarrassing that 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.519
 had seen the hair up 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.379
 probably failed again represents the 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.349
 is the second goal 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:39.829
 so be conceivable artificial poor and 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:39.829
 gets back image brichta deposition 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.769
 felix brych there is a group the 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.780
 an absurd scene 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.269
 He was now outside supervision years 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.799
 elapse 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.610
 there is a fraction of a second 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.870
 The way to survive is in the hit and he does 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.870
 something happens 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.990
 gate
