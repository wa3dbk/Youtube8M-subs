the latest minecraft 1.3 snapshots being
12<00:00:39.989> w<00:00:40.500> 27a<00:00:41.280> at<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.790> moment<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.510> what<00:00:43.470> it<00:00:43.590> does

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
12 w 27a at the moment so what it does

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.630 
12 w 27a at the moment so what it does
is<00:00:44.070> with<00:00:44.580> a<00:00:44.610> button<00:00:45.769> you<00:00:46.769> can<00:00:47.010> control<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
is with a button you can control the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.670 
is with a button you can control the
redstone<00:00:48.120> lamp<00:00:50.330> without<00:00:51.330> having<00:00:52.019> a<00:00:52.290> lever

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
redstone lamp without having a lever

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.640 
redstone lamp without having a lever
well<00:00:53.550> buttons<00:00:54.000> are<00:00:54.180> buttons<00:00:55.140> are<00:00:55.260> cooler<00:00:55.530> than

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
well buttons are buttons are cooler than

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.950 
well buttons are buttons are cooler than
levers<00:00:57.260> so<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.470> way<00:00:58.589> that<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.890> works<00:00:59.100> is

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
levers so the way that this works is

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.680 
levers so the way that this works is
with<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.260> new<00:01:02.000> properties<00:01:03.000> added<00:01:03.479> to

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
with the new properties added to

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.100 
with the new properties added to
dispensers<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.680> water<00:01:05.010> lava<00:01:05.909> buckets<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.570> 12

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
dispensers and water lava buckets in 12

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.620 
dispensers and water lava buckets in 12
w<00:01:07.500> 21a<00:01:08.190> i<00:01:08.220> think<00:01:08.869> they<00:01:09.869> now<00:01:10.170> dispense<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:11.630> lava

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
w 21a i think they now dispense a lava

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.380 
w 21a i think they now dispense a lava
and<00:01:13.020> water<00:01:13.350> when<00:01:13.710> there's<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.950> bucket<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.520> there

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
and water when there's a bucket in there

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.920 
and water when there's a bucket in there
when<00:01:15.960> there's<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.290> bucket<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.220> respective

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
when there's a bucket of the respective

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.480 
when there's a bucket of the respective
respective<00:01:18.930> item<00:01:19.350> or<00:01:19.650> whatever<00:01:20.190> you<00:01:20.280> want<00:01:20.430> to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
respective item or whatever you want to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.200 
respective item or whatever you want to
call<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.640> bucket<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.720> water<00:01:23.030> dispenses<00:01:24.030> water

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
call it bucket of water dispenses water

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.410 
call it bucket of water dispenses water
it's<00:01:25.020> basic<00:01:25.380> right<00:01:25.760> so<00:01:26.760> what<00:01:27.120> does<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.360> have

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
it's basic right so what does this have

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.110 
it's basic right so what does this have
to<00:01:27.660> do<00:01:27.780> with<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.110> T<00:01:28.620> flip-flop<00:01:29.130> well<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.910> in

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
to do with the T flip-flop well that in

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.440 
to do with the T flip-flop well that in
itself<00:01:30.330> is<00:01:30.810> kind<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.200> 80<00:01:31.440> flip-flop<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.300> can

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
itself is kind of 80 flip-flop so it can

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.230 
itself is kind of 80 flip-flop so it can
have<00:01:33.690> a<00:01:33.950> bat<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.190> a<00:01:35.370> block<00:01:35.610> updates<00:01:36.000> decker

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
have a bat and a block updates decker

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.690 
have a bat and a block updates decker
the<00:01:36.800> detector<00:01:37.800> I<00:01:37.830> should<00:01:38.100> say<00:01:38.480> but<00:01:39.480> this<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.230> a

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
the detector I should say but this is a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.660 
the detector I should say but this is a
design<00:01:41.700> that's<00:01:41.760> argument<00:01:42.450> done<00:01:42.630> before<00:01:43.110> it's

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
design that's argument done before it's

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.810 
design that's argument done before it's
by<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:45.210> don't<00:01:45.900> know<00:01:45.990> who<00:01:46.170> made<00:01:46.410> it<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:46.820> it's

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
by I don't know who made it but it's

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.930 
by I don't know who made it but it's
kind<00:01:48.120> of<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.300> mixture<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.230> I<00:01:49.640> got<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.760> idea

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
kind of a mixture and I got this idea

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.990 
kind of a mixture and I got this idea
from<00:01:51.300> a<00:01:51.600> seat<00:01:51.840> NSAC<00:01:52.320> link<00:01:53.280> will<00:01:53.430> probably<00:01:53.850> be

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
from a seat NSAC link will probably be

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.660 
from a seat NSAC link will probably be
in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> description<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:54.870> I<00:01:54.960> remember<00:01:55.490> so<00:01:56.490> how

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
in the description if I remember so how

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.560 
in the description if I remember so how
this<00:01:56.820> works<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.270> when<00:01:58.250> there's<00:01:59.250> water<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
this works is when there's water the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.920 
this works is when there's water the
boat<00:02:00.780> rises<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:02.190> sleeves<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.120> and<00:02:03.330> leaving

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
boat rises the sleeves the and leaving

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.830 
boat rises the sleeves the and leaving
this<00:02:04.260> it<00:02:04.770> leaves<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.190> pressure<00:02:05.460> plate<00:02:05.840> which

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
this it leaves this pressure plate which

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
this it leaves this pressure plate which
I'm<00:02:07.140> kind<00:02:07.620> of<00:02:07.680> looking<00:02:07.950> at<00:02:08.280> right<00:02:08.429> now<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:09.860> it

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
I'm kind of looking at right now and it

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.729 
I'm kind of looking at right now and it
kind<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.400> hovers<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.879> air<00:02:12.500> with<00:02:13.500> this

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
kind it hovers in the air with this

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.820 
kind it hovers in the air with this
water<00:02:14.690> so<00:02:15.690> it's<00:02:15.930> off<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.409> pressure<00:02:16.620> plate

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
water so it's off of the pressure plate

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.309 
water so it's off of the pressure plate
so<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.159> doesn't<00:02:17.430> power<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.760> lamp<00:02:17.970> but<00:02:18.780> when

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
so it doesn't power the lamp but when

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.170 
so it doesn't power the lamp but when
there's<00:02:19.560> no<00:02:19.739> water<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.250> sits<00:02:20.670> on<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:20.970> pressure

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
there's no water it sits on the pressure

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.800 
there's no water it sits on the pressure
plate<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.629> it<00:02:21.720> powers<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.080> lamp<00:02:22.379> and<00:02:23.810> it's

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
plate so it powers the lamp and it's

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.690 
plate so it powers the lamp and it's
recommended<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.409> have<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.620> block<00:02:26.010> on<00:02:26.190> top<00:02:26.250> and

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
recommended to have a block on top and

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.570 
recommended to have a block on top and
you'll<00:02:27.420> see<00:02:27.690> why<00:02:27.930> in<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:28.230> minute<00:02:28.349> so<00:02:29.190> I'm<00:02:29.400> just

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
you'll see why in a minute so I'm just

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.890 
you'll see why in a minute so I'm just
going<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.790> build<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.150> off<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.480> side<00:02:30.569> you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
going to build this off to the side you

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.300 
going to build this off to the side you
can<00:02:31.020> use<00:02:31.230> any<00:02:31.470> semi

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
can use any semi

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.970 
can use any semi
well<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:33.700> can<00:02:33.849> use<00:02:33.880> most<00:02:34.330> blocks<00:02:35.020> that<00:02:35.920> are

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
well you can use most blocks that are

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.270 
well you can use most blocks that are
like<00:02:36.280> semi-transparent<00:02:36.910> or<00:02:38.130> whatever<00:02:39.130> you

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
like semi-transparent or whatever you

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.880 
like semi-transparent or whatever you
call<00:02:39.459> them<00:02:39.599> so<00:02:40.599> you<00:02:40.690> can<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:41.200> can<00:02:41.349> use<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> fence

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
call them so you can you can use a fence

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.430 
call them so you can you can use a fence
you<00:02:42.550> can<00:02:42.700> use<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:42.940> glass<00:02:43.270> pane<00:02:43.569> you<00:02:43.959> can<00:02:43.989> use<00:02:44.290> an

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
you can use a glass pane you can use an

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.150 
you can use a glass pane you can use an
iron<00:02:44.590> bar<00:02:45.690> that's<00:02:46.690> that's<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.440> good<00:02:47.650> design<00:02:48.010> to

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
iron bar that's that's a good design to

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.780 
iron bar that's that's a good design to
use<00:02:48.280> i'm<00:02:48.400> good<00:02:48.610> i'm<00:02:48.760> going<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.120> show<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.360> with

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
use i'm good i'm going to show you with

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.699 
use i'm good i'm going to show you with
fences<00:02:51.790> just<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:52.720> see<00:02:52.989> that<00:02:53.019> it's<00:02:53.410> not

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
fences just so you see that it's not

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.030 
fences just so you see that it's not
just<00:02:53.790> with<00:02:54.790> iron<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.540> iron<00:02:56.470> bars<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.890> glass

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
just with iron and iron bars and glass

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.350 
just with iron and iron bars and glass
panes<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.620> like<00:02:59.830> this<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.280> put<00:03:00.550> a<00:03:00.760> bucket<00:03:01.180> of

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
panes so like this you put a bucket of

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.580 
panes so like this you put a bucket of
water<00:03:01.569> inside<00:03:02.080> it<00:03:03.959> after<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.080> cap<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.380> would

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
water inside it after the cap that would

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.660 
water inside it after the cap that would
whatever<00:03:06.600> so<00:03:07.600> get<00:03:08.019> this<00:03:08.410> get<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:09.010> bucket<00:03:09.340> of

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
whatever so get this get the bucket of

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.710 
whatever so get this get the bucket of
water<00:03:11.610> put<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:12.730> inside<00:03:12.819> this<00:03:13.239> dispenser<00:03:13.900> and

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
water put it inside this dispenser and

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.110 
water put it inside this dispenser and
put<00:03:16.720> a<00:03:16.930> power<00:03:17.440> source<00:03:17.769> so<00:03:18.489> i'm<00:03:18.730> just<00:03:18.790> going<00:03:19.269> to

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
put a power source so i'm just going to

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.270 
put a power source so i'm just going to
put<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.150> button<00:03:22.390> here<00:03:23.549> it<00:03:24.549> works<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.950> actually

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
put a button here it works this actually

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.330 
put a button here it works this actually
looks<00:03:27.370> ugly<00:03:28.290> there<00:03:29.290> we<00:03:29.349> go<00:03:29.440> not<00:03:29.799> symmetrical

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
looks ugly there we go not symmetrical

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.870 
looks ugly there we go not symmetrical
all<00:03:31.049> nice<00:03:32.049> and<00:03:32.260> symmetrical<00:03:32.709> so<00:03:33.580> then<00:03:33.760> you

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
all nice and symmetrical so then you

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.160 
all nice and symmetrical so then you
want<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.120> place<00:03:34.269> a<00:03:34.510> boat<00:03:34.750> on<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.930> pressure

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
want to place a boat on the pressure

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.780 
want to place a boat on the pressure
plate<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.560> doesn't<00:03:35.920> matter<00:03:36.069> how<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:36.280> place<00:03:36.610> it

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
plate it doesn't matter how you place it

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.370 
plate it doesn't matter how you place it
it<00:03:36.910> just<00:03:36.940> has<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.269> be<00:03:37.390> placed<00:03:37.750> on<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.170> pressure

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
it just has to be placed on the pressure

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.490 
it just has to be placed on the pressure
plate<00:03:38.880> so<00:03:39.880> like<00:03:40.209> this<00:03:40.359> is<00:03:40.420> fine<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:41.380> can

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
plate so like this is fine you can

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.960 
plate so like this is fine you can
either<00:03:41.590> do<00:03:41.829> it<00:03:41.859> like<00:03:42.040> this<00:03:42.190> or<00:03:42.340> like<00:03:42.370> this<00:03:42.519> the

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
either do it like this or like this the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.700 
either do it like this or like this the
water<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.329> going<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.510> reach<00:03:43.660> anyway<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:45.340> then

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.310 

there<00:03:48.460> you<00:03:48.580> go<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:51.900> I'm<00:03:52.900> just<00:03:53.080> going<00:03:53.200> to

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
there you go and I'm just going to

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.820 
there you go and I'm just going to
quickly<00:03:53.470> wire<00:03:54.160> up<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.640> current<00:03:55.120> from<00:03:55.450> here

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
quickly wire up the current from here

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.550 
quickly wire up the current from here
into<00:03:57.990> another<00:03:58.990> redstone<00:03:59.410> lamp<00:04:00.780> off<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:02.440> the

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
into another redstone lamp off to the

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.340 
into another redstone lamp off to the
side<00:04:02.970> now<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.030> reason<00:04:04.330> why<00:04:04.600> you'd<00:04:04.870> want<00:04:05.140> a

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
side now the reason why you'd want a

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.900 
side now the reason why you'd want a
block<00:04:05.800> here<00:04:05.830> is<00:04:06.600> because<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:09.100> boat<00:04:09.340> will<00:04:09.640> come

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
block here is because the boat will come

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.600 
block here is because the boat will come
down<00:04:10.150> faster<00:04:10.780> because<00:04:10.990> it<00:04:11.740> doesn't

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
down faster because it doesn't

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.730 
down faster because it doesn't
completely<00:04:13.090> rise<00:04:13.450> up<00:04:13.690> so<00:04:13.990> let's<00:04:14.560> see<00:04:14.710> a

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
completely rise up so let's see a

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.200 
completely rise up so let's see a
different<00:04:15.130> will<00:04:15.490> see<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:15.670> difference<00:04:16.060> over

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.210 
different will see a difference over

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:21.060 
different will see a difference over
here<00:04:17.700> when<00:04:18.700> I<00:04:18.730> push<00:04:19.060> this<00:04:19.210> button<00:04:19.860> so<00:04:20.860> you<00:04:20.950> see

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
here when I push this button so you see

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.930 
here when I push this button so you see
it<00:04:21.220> just<00:04:21.400> rises<00:04:21.880> up<00:04:21.910> till<00:04:22.240> there<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.730> then<00:04:24.730> it

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
it just rises up till there and then it

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.980 
it just rises up till there and then it
falls<00:04:25.720> down<00:04:25.870> way<00:04:26.170> faster<00:04:26.850> but<00:04:27.850> when<00:04:28.660> I<00:04:28.690> push

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
falls down way faster but when I push

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.680 
falls down way faster but when I push
the<00:04:29.140> button<00:04:29.410> without<00:04:29.530> a<00:04:29.680> block<00:04:30.120> you<00:04:31.120> see<00:04:31.330> to

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
the button without a block you see to

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.100 
the button without a block you see to
where<00:04:31.900> it<00:04:32.020> rises<00:04:32.200> up<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:33.450> takes<00:04:34.450> longer<00:04:34.600> to

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
where it rises up so it takes longer to

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.800 
where it rises up so it takes longer to
turn<00:04:35.290> off<00:04:35.530> slightly<00:04:36.400> longer<00:04:36.790> so<00:04:37.510> that's<00:04:37.690> why

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
turn off slightly longer so that's why

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.450 
turn off slightly longer so that's why
I'd<00:04:37.930> like<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.200> have<00:04:38.290> a<00:04:38.320> lock<00:04:38.620> on<00:04:38.650> top<00:04:38.980> of<00:04:39.130> it<00:04:39.220> and

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
I'd like to have a lock on top of it and

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.420 
I'd like to have a lock on top of it and
you<00:04:39.760> can<00:04:39.910> just<00:04:40.060> enclose<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.720> whole<00:04:40.900> thing

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
you can just enclose the whole thing

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.430 
you can just enclose the whole thing
make<00:04:42.430> sure<00:04:42.460> though<00:04:43.000> that<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.420> is<00:04:43.870> not<00:04:44.140> a

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
make sure though that it is not a

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.030 
make sure though that it is not a
regular<00:04:45.040> block<00:04:45.370> because<00:04:46.180> boats<00:04:47.170> take<00:04:47.620> 1.5

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
regular block because boats take 1.5

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.420 
regular block because boats take 1.5
blocks<00:04:48.850> of<00:04:49.270> space<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.350> now<00:04:50.710> I<00:04:50.740> can't<00:04:51.010> put<00:04:51.220> this

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
blocks of space and now I can't put this

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.730 
blocks of space and now I can't put this
there<00:04:52.060> you<00:04:52.120> go<00:04:52.180> they<00:04:52.900> take<00:04:53.170> one<00:04:53.470> and<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.710> half

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
there you go they take one and a half

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.530 
there you go they take one and a half
blocks<00:04:54.250> of<00:04:54.400> space<00:04:54.940> so<00:04:55.810> just<00:04:57.000> so<00:04:58.000> having<00:04:58.360> two

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
blocks of space so just so having two

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.860 
blocks of space so just so having two
blocks<00:04:58.840> on<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.140> side<00:05:00.300> like<00:05:01.440> like<00:05:02.440> this<00:05:03.870> this

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
blocks on the side like like this this

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.990 

there<00:05:33.800> we<00:05:33.860> go<00:05:34.009> now<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:35.870> boat<00:05:36.080> oh<00:05:36.610> I<00:05:37.610> just<00:05:37.669> got

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
there we go now the boat oh I just got

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.330 
there we go now the boat oh I just got
stuck<00:05:38.360> there<00:05:40.900> place<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:42.169> boat<00:05:42.350> over<00:05:43.030> here<00:05:44.030> and

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
stuck there place the boat over here and

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.460 
stuck there place the boat over here and
it's<00:05:46.340> it's<00:05:46.550> not<00:05:46.789> going<00:05:47.090> down<00:05:47.330> so<00:05:47.750> you<00:05:47.870> see<00:05:48.169> it

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
it's it's not going down so you see it

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.090 
it's it's not going down so you see it
has<00:05:48.860> to<00:05:49.100> be<00:05:49.280> it<00:05:49.780> has<00:05:50.780> to<00:05:51.110> be<00:05:51.229> at<00:05:51.350> least<00:05:51.380> one<00:05:51.949> and

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
has to be it has to be at least one and

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.710 
has to be it has to be at least one and
a<00:05:52.190> half<00:05:52.220> blocks<00:05:52.669> of<00:05:52.789> space<00:05:53.030> so<00:05:53.240> in<00:05:53.360> this<00:05:53.479> case

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
a half blocks of space so in this case

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.950 
a half blocks of space so in this case
it's<00:05:54.470> two<00:05:54.800> blocks<00:05:55.009> of<00:05:55.340> space<00:05:55.580> because<00:05:55.970> there's

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
it's two blocks of space because there's

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.320 
it's two blocks of space because there's
half<00:05:57.620> a<00:05:57.740> block<00:05:57.919> here<00:05:57.979> half<00:05:58.639> the<00:05:58.669> block<00:05:59.000> here

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
half a block here half the block here

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.230 
half a block here half the block here
and<00:05:59.509> one<00:05:59.660> block<00:05:59.870> here<00:06:00.229> which<00:06:00.889> is<00:06:01.070> perfect<00:06:01.520> this

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
and one block here which is perfect this

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.520 
and one block here which is perfect this
actually<00:06:02.660> the<00:06:03.169> design<00:06:03.500> i'm<00:06:03.680> using<00:06:04.070> and<00:06:05.530> that's

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
actually the design i'm using and that's

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.980 
actually the design i'm using and that's
pretty<00:06:07.010> much<00:06:07.190> all<00:06:07.699> there<00:06:07.970> is<00:06:08.030> to<00:06:08.300> it<00:06:08.389> before

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
pretty much all there is to it before

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.840 
pretty much all there is to it before
you'd<00:06:09.139> have<00:06:09.320> to<00:06:09.470> use<00:06:09.620> pistons<00:06:10.130> and<00:06:10.460> it's<00:06:10.699> all

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
you'd have to use pistons and it's all

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.990 
you'd have to use pistons and it's all
complicated<00:06:11.090> and<00:06:11.930> whatever<00:06:12.289> I<00:06:12.590> never<00:06:13.460> grasped

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
complicated and whatever I never grasped

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.420 
complicated and whatever I never grasped
it<00:06:14.120> but<00:06:14.600> now<00:06:15.320> it's<00:06:15.530> even<00:06:15.889> easier<00:06:16.180> with<00:06:17.180> the<00:06:17.510> new

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
it but now it's even easier with the new

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.700 
it but now it's even easier with the new
stuff<00:06:19.430> added<00:06:19.699> to<00:06:20.030> Minecraft<00:06:20.360> 1.3<00:06:21.350> which<00:06:21.530> is

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710
