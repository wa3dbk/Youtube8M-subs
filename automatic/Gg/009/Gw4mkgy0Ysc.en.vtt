bed every morning doesn't take that much

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.570 
bed every morning doesn't take that much
time<00:00:06.960> it<00:00:07.170> takes<00:00:07.290> like<00:00:07.529> three<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:08.069> five<00:00:08.099> minutes

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
time it takes like three to five minutes

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.970 
time it takes like three to five minutes
if<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:09.210> sometimes<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:10.080> takes<00:00:10.260> more<00:00:10.530> mental

just let make the bed so I actually I
use<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> quilt<00:01:02.039> instead<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.879> comforter<00:01:03.329> or<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
use a quilt instead of a comforter or a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.920 
use a quilt instead of a comforter or a
bedspread<00:01:03.989> because<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.619> quilt<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.689> it's<00:01:06.689> like

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
bedspread because a quilt is it's like

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.899 
bedspread because a quilt is it's like
thin<00:01:07.229> material<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.340> easily<00:01:08.520> tuck

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
thin material and so you can easily tuck

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.969 
thin material and so you can easily tuck
it<00:01:09.060> into<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> bed<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.439> talk<00:01:10.590> things<00:01:10.799> in

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
it into the bed I like to talk things in

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.500 
it into the bed I like to talk things in
because<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.250> feel<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.700> looks<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.450> much

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
because I feel like it looks so much

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.030 
because I feel like it looks so much
more<00:01:12.630> neater<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.080> cleaner<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.590> stuff<00:01:13.890> as

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
more neater and cleaner and stuff as

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.590 
more neater and cleaner and stuff as
opposed<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.880> comforter<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.270> bed's<00:01:15.509> ready

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
opposed to a comforter or bed's ready

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.350 
opposed to a comforter or bed's ready
can't<00:01:15.930> really<00:01:16.080> tuck<00:01:16.229> them<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.740> as<00:01:16.920> easily<00:01:17.640> so

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
can't really tuck them in as easily so

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.240 
can't really tuck them in as easily so
that's<00:01:18.780> why<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.020> like<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.439> quote<00:01:19.590> okay

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
that's why I like this quote okay

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.120 
that's why I like this quote okay
so<00:01:20.720> put<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:22.020> aside<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.159> then<00:01:23.750> now<00:01:25.130> we're

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
so put that aside and then now we're

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.649 
so put that aside and then now we're
just<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> straighten<00:01:27.000> up<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.390> sheets

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
just going to straighten up the sheets

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.350

that<00:01:52.549> one<00:01:53.549> side<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.850> not<00:01:54.210> longer<00:01:54.509> than<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
that one side is not longer than the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.219 
that one side is not longer than the
other<00:01:55.049> side<00:01:55.380> because<00:01:56.509> when<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.600> tuck<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.049> in

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
other side because when you tuck it in

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.480 
other side because when you tuck it in
and<00:01:58.500> one<00:01:58.680> side<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:58.920> longer<00:01:59.130> than<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> other

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and one side is longer than the other

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.270 
and one side is longer than the other
side<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.600> too<00:02:01.350> much<00:02:01.500> fabric<00:02:01.799> or<00:02:02.159> too

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
side it's like too much fabric or too

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.310 
side it's like too much fabric or too
much<00:02:02.430> material<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.119> then<00:02:03.600> once<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.049> get<00:02:04.110> it's

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
much material and then once I get it's

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.510 
much material and then once I get it's
tighter<00:02:04.560> than<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.829> other<00:02:04.860> side<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.430> then

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
tighter than the other side and then

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.169 
tighter than the other side and then
tarted<00:02:06.000> um<00:02:06.469> it's<00:02:07.469> hard<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.799> tuck<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.369> quilt<00:02:09.000> in

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
tarted um it's hard to tuck the quilt in

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.760 
tarted um it's hard to tuck the quilt in
so<00:02:10.140> we're<00:02:10.440> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> have<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.890> even
