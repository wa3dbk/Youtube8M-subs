his<00:03:17.900> way<00:03:18.110> I<00:03:18.380> don't<00:03:18.800> think<00:03:19.160> it'll<00:03:19.489> be<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.640> stage

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
his way I don't think it'll be the stage

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.670 
his way I don't think it'll be the stage
we<00:03:20.120> know<00:03:20.300> the<00:03:20.480> Colombian<00:03:20.930> rider<00:03:21.080> looks<00:03:21.410> at<00:03:21.560> him

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
we know the Colombian rider looks at him

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.640 
we know the Colombian rider looks at him
says<00:03:21.980> okay<00:03:22.430> I'll<00:03:23.000> take<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.600> win<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.080> pranati

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
says okay I'll take the win and pranati

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.290 
says okay I'll take the win and pranati
will<00:03:25.070> take<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.489> thing<00:03:25.700> I<00:03:25.790> think<00:03:25.850> that's<00:03:26.150> been

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
will take the thing I think that's been

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.490 
will take the thing I think that's been
agreed<00:03:26.510> there<00:03:26.840> with<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:27.080> shake<00:03:27.350> of<00:03:27.470> the

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
agreed there with that shake of the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.040 
agreed there with that shake of the
heads<00:03:27.709> well<00:03:28.640> it's<00:03:28.940> not<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.239> given<00:03:29.540> here<00:03:29.810> as<00:03:29.930> you

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
heads well it's not a given here as you

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.570 
heads well it's not a given here as you
can<00:03:30.080> see<00:03:30.170> laverda<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.890> still<00:03:31.160> accelerating

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
can see laverda is still accelerating

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.670 
can see laverda is still accelerating
but<00:03:32.420> I<00:03:32.480> think<00:03:32.750> for<00:03:32.900> Pilate<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.470> most

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
but I think for Pilate the most

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.350 
but I think for Pilate the most
important<00:03:34.160> thing<00:03:34.310> is<00:03:34.400> he<00:03:34.550> now<00:03:34.730> knows

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
important thing is he now knows

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.150 
important thing is he now knows
riding<00:03:35.750> himself<00:03:36.110> into<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.380> little<00:03:36.740> bit<00:03:36.920> full<00:03:37.130> of

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
riding himself into a little bit full of

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.060 
riding himself into a little bit full of
junior<00:03:37.610> Tattaglia<00:03:38.120> history

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
junior Tattaglia history

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.680 
junior Tattaglia history
well<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:40.220> Verdi<00:03:40.460> himself<00:03:41.000> doesn't<00:03:41.330> win<00:03:41.480> many

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
well the Verdi himself doesn't win many

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.720 
well the Verdi himself doesn't win many
races<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.380> this<00:03:42.530> is<00:03:42.710> his<00:03:42.830> biggest<00:03:43.100> ever<00:03:43.430> win

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
races and this is his biggest ever win

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.670 
races and this is his biggest ever win
he's<00:03:43.880> had<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.150> stage<00:03:44.390> win<00:03:44.660> before<00:03:44.810> in<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.350> Giro

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
he's had to stage win before in the Giro

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.270 
he's had to stage win before in the Giro
and<00:03:45.950> he's<00:03:46.310> won<00:03:46.520> two<00:03:47.000> races<00:03:47.210> and<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:48.350> very<00:03:48.890> minor

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
and he's won two races and a very minor

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.100 
and he's won two races and a very minor
one<00:03:49.550> so<00:03:49.820> this<00:03:50.030> is<00:03:50.180> not<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:50.390> big<00:03:50.630> one<00:03:50.840> for<00:03:51.050> the

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
one so this is not a big one for the

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.790 
one so this is not a big one for the
verde<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:53.330> long<00:03:53.600> wait<00:03:53.870> now<00:03:54.110> first<00:03:54.590> will

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
verde and a long wait now first will

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.440 
verde and a long wait now first will
come<00:03:55.040> in<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.310> other<00:03:55.460> two<00:03:55.700> riders<00:03:56.000> of<00:03:56.420> the

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
come in the other two riders of the

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.930 
come in the other two riders of the
escape<00:03:57.050> for<00:03:57.350> Kern<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:57.950> Schwab<00:03:58.280> here<00:03:58.610> they<00:03:58.760> are

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
escape for Kern and Schwab here they are

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.420 
escape for Kern and Schwab here they are
Schwab<00:03:59.300> got<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.660> lead<00:03:59.870> at<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.170> moment<00:04:00.430> well

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
Schwab got the lead at the moment well

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.100 
Schwab got the lead at the moment well
these<00:04:01.610> two<00:04:01.850> riders<00:04:02.090> you're<00:04:02.750> gonna<00:04:02.840> see

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
these two riders you're gonna see

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.570 
these two riders you're gonna see
they'll<00:04:03.320> cross<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.800> line<00:04:03.950> at<00:04:04.160> around<00:04:04.370> about

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
they'll cross the line at around about

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.790 
they'll cross the line at around about
the<00:04:04.850> 30<00:04:05.120> seconds<00:04:05.690> they<00:04:05.840> were<00:04:05.900> behind<00:04:06.500> I'm<00:04:06.680> not

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
the 30 seconds they were behind I'm not

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.960 
the 30 seconds they were behind I'm not
sure<00:04:07.010> whether<00:04:07.100> they'll<00:04:07.340> sprint<00:04:07.700> it<00:04:07.820> out

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
sure whether they'll sprint it out

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.580 
sure whether they'll sprint it out
because<00:04:08.120> they're<00:04:08.450> all<00:04:08.600> pretty<00:04:08.990> much<00:04:09.200> spent

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
because they're all pretty much spent

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.960 
because they're all pretty much spent
forces<00:04:10.040> here<00:04:10.190> this<00:04:10.370> afternoon

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.000 
forces here this afternoon
it<00:04:11.300> was<00:04:11.480> a<00:04:11.510> long<00:04:11.840> breakaway<00:04:12.440> it<00:04:12.560> had<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:12.860> happen

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
it was a long breakaway it had to happen

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.520 
it was a long breakaway it had to happen
really<00:04:13.370> since<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.970> stress<00:04:14.330> we've<00:04:14.570> had<00:04:14.750> since

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
really since the stress we've had since

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.289 
really since the stress we've had since
the<00:04:15.709> very<00:04:15.950> start<00:04:16.040> of<00:04:16.519> this<00:04:16.609> race<00:04:16.790> across<00:04:17.150> the

the very start of this race across the

the very start of this race across the

island of Sardinia then the move across

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.280 
island of Sardinia then the move across
to<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.459> mainland<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:20.060> lot<00:04:20.510> of<00:04:20.630> riders<00:04:20.989> I<00:04:21.109> think
