next now there are many uses for

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.340 
next now there are many uses for
handheld<00:00:02.340> mic<00:00:02.669> like<00:00:02.970> this<00:00:03.179> guy<00:00:03.360> here<00:00:03.659> one<00:00:04.259> that

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
handheld mic like this guy here one that

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.380 
handheld mic like this guy here one that
comes<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.650> mind<00:00:04.890> is<00:00:05.310> or<00:00:05.609> for<00:00:06.120> when<00:00:06.240> you're

loud environment check out the

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.640 
loud environment check out the
difference<00:00:11.250> between<00:00:11.480> the<00:00:12.480> built-in<00:00:13.049> mics<00:00:13.349> and

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
difference between the built-in mics and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.279 
difference between the built-in mics and
a<00:00:14.219> hand-held<00:00:14.790> cardioid<00:00:15.599> mic<00:00:15.929> like<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.379> one

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
a hand-held cardioid mic like this one

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.750 
a hand-held cardioid mic like this one
this<00:00:19.289> from<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.619> built-in<00:00:19.859> mics<00:00:20.310> where<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.640> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
this from the built-in mics where on the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.580 
this from the built-in mics where on the
top<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.660> can<00:00:21.810> hear<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.199> lot<00:00:22.320> of

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
top you can hear this a lot of

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.830 
top you can hear this a lot of

up<00:00:25.170> my<00:00:25.380> voice<00:00:26.599> now<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> cardioid<00:00:28.439> mic

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
up my voice now we have a cardioid mic

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.589 
up my voice now we have a cardioid mic
built-in<00:00:29.279> right<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.789> bottom<00:00:30.060> here<00:00:30.300> that's

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
built-in right in the bottom here that's

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.179 
built-in right in the bottom here that's
going<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.900> reject<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.349> lot<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> sound<00:00:31.920> pick

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
going to reject a lot of the sound pick

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.350 
going to reject a lot of the sound pick
up<00:00:32.309> my<00:00:32.430> voice<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.700> whole<00:00:33.239> lot<00:00:33.899> better

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
up my voice a whole lot better

big difference huh mic like this one has
a<00:00:39.000> very<00:00:39.390> tight<00:00:39.870> pickup<00:00:40.440> pattern<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:40.920> it

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
a very tight pickup pattern so it

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.700 
a very tight pickup pattern so it
rejects<00:00:41.520> most<00:00:42.090> sound<00:00:42.390> from<00:00:42.600> behind<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.500> mic

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
rejects most sound from behind the mic

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.860 
rejects most sound from behind the mic
and<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.280> only<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.700> sensitive<00:00:45.180> when

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and it is only really sensitive when

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.630 
and it is only really sensitive when
you're<00:00:46.020> really<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.620> top<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.160> right<00:00:47.190> there

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
you're really on top of it right there

here<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.869> type<00:01:07.140> use<00:01:07.320> an<00:01:07.439> XLR<00:01:07.799> cable<00:01:07.860> which

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
here this type use an XLR cable which

here this type use an XLR cable which
which<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.180> balanced<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.990> avoid<00:01:10.350> some<00:01:10.740> hums<00:01:11.010> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
which is balanced to avoid some hums and

which is balanced to avoid some hums and
buzzes<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.610> might<00:01:11.790> come<00:01:12.030> through<00:01:12.330> some

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
buzzes that might come through some

other cheaper mic cables now being a

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.289 
other cheaper mic cables now being a
condenser<00:01:16.439> mic<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.920> needs<00:01:17.400> power<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.119> operate

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299

condenser mic it needs power to operate
and<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.960> would<00:01:19.080> normally<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.950> maybe

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
and you would normally have to maybe

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.440 
and you would normally have to maybe
connect<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.330> into<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> mixer<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.490> power<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.360> up

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
connect this into a mixer to power it up

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.940 
connect this into a mixer to power it up
with<00:01:24.689> phantom<00:01:25.110> power<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.650> know<00:01:25.740> what<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
with phantom power but you know what the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.149 
with phantom power but you know what the
h4n<00:01:26.520> has<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.970> functionality<00:01:27.560> built<00:01:28.560> right

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
h4n has that functionality built right

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.660 
h4n has that functionality built right
in<00:01:29.869> we<00:01:30.869> go<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.079> menu<00:01:32.360> input<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:34.280> down<00:01:35.280> here

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
in we go to menu input and down here

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.090 
in we go to menu input and down here
till<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.150> find<00:01:36.509> phantom<00:01:37.380> power<00:01:37.590> okay<00:01:37.979> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
till we find phantom power okay and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.740 
till we find phantom power okay and
we'll<00:01:38.220> select<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.060> two<00:01:39.360> settings

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
we'll select that we have two settings

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.249 
we'll select that we have two settings
here<00:01:39.930> 48<00:01:40.590> volt<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.130> 28<00:01:41.909> Volt<00:01:42.750> most

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
here 48 volt and 28 Volt most

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.389 
here 48 volt and 28 Volt most
professional<00:01:43.979> mics<00:01:44.189> use<00:01:44.430> 48<00:01:44.880> volt<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:47.070> with

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
professional mics use 48 volt so with

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.700 
professional mics use 48 volt so with
mono<00:01:47.759> mix<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.540> phantom<00:01:49.049> power<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.530> can

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
mono mix on and phantom power you can

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.550 
mono mix on and phantom power you can
record<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.640> high-quality<00:01:51.560> narrations

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
with a mic like this just remember to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.620 
with a mic like this just remember to
turn<00:01:55.979> phantom<00:01:56.460> power<00:01:56.670> off<00:01:56.880> when<00:01:56.939> you're<00:01:57.509> not

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
turn phantom power off when you're not

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.690 
turn phantom power off when you're not
using<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.229> conserve<00:01:58.740> your<00:01:59.009> battery<00:01:59.100> power

external mixer that way you could record

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.229 
external mixer that way you could record
