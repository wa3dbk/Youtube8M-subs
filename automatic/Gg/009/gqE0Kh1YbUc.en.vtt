00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
bit more you can see the finish spreads

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.440 
bit more you can see the finish spreads
very<00:03:10.470> well<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.160> will<00:03:11.730> go<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.910> long<00:03:12.210> way

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
very well and will go a long way

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.810 
very well and will go a long way
actually<00:03:13.110> one<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.710> keys<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.490> finish

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
actually one of the keys to the finish

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.860 
actually one of the keys to the finish
is<00:03:15.000> not<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.960> use<00:03:16.860> too<00:03:17.280> much<00:03:17.490> if<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.540> apply<00:03:18.810> too

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
is not to use too much if you apply too

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.130 
is not to use too much if you apply too
much<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.770> will<00:03:19.950> sit<00:03:20.490> on<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.760> surface<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.480> then

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
much it will sit on the surface and then

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.410 
much it will sit on the surface and then
you'll<00:03:22.290> have<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.650> buff<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.100> off<00:03:23.280> which<00:03:24.120> takes

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
you'll have to buff it off which takes

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.690 
you'll have to buff it off which takes
more<00:03:24.660> time<00:03:24.930> more<00:03:25.620> energy<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.220> your<00:03:26.400> finish

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
more time more energy and your finish

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.360 
more time more energy and your finish
won't<00:03:26.940> go<00:03:27.090> as<00:03:27.240> far<00:03:27.860> so<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:28.950> can<00:03:29.040> see<00:03:29.220> I've<00:03:29.340> used

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
won't go as far so you can see I've used

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.160 
won't go as far so you can see I've used
very<00:03:29.820> little<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.270> I've<00:03:30.390> almost<00:03:30.570> coated<00:03:31.050> this

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
very little and I've almost coated this

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.150 
very little and I've almost coated this
entire<00:03:31.560> piece
