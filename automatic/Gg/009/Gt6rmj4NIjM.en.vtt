00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
because it's got a two minute delay

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.989 
because it's got a two minute delay
built<00:02:01.409> into<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.039> when<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.520> put<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.880> out

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999 
built into it so when you put it out

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:04.969 
built into it so when you put it out
there<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.899> got<00:02:04.109> two<00:02:04.350> minutes<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.799> get<00:02:04.920> back

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
there you got two minutes to get back

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.340 
there you got two minutes to get back
and<00:02:05.340> set<00:02:05.520> up<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.939> before<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.659> starts<00:02:06.960> making<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
and set up and before it starts making a

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.840 
and set up and before it starts making a
sound<00:02:07.560> because<00:02:07.859> sometimes<00:02:08.310> those<00:02:08.520> predators

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
sound because sometimes those predators

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.029 
sound because sometimes those predators
will<00:02:09.600> come<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.140> as<00:02:10.319> soon<00:02:10.500> as<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.800> sound

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
will come just as soon as that sound

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.100 
will come just as soon as that sound
starts<00:02:11.490> so<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:11.730> gives<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.180> little<00:02:12.360> delay

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
starts so this gives you a little delay

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.130 
starts so this gives you a little delay
to<00:02:13.950> get<00:02:14.100> set<00:02:14.310> up<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.580> get<00:02:14.760> going<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.900> know<00:02:15.990> at

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
e-collar

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.559 
e-collar
so<00:02:47.920> we<00:02:48.129> take<00:02:48.370> this<00:02:48.549> decoy<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.209> put<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:49.450> out

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
so we take this decoy and put it out

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.420 
so we take this decoy and put it out
about<00:02:49.780> 35<00:02:50.260> yards<00:02:50.530> from<00:02:50.860> us<00:02:51.010> we<00:02:51.159> put<00:02:51.340> an

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
about 35 yards from us we put an

sound<00:02:53.769> out<00:02:54.250> for<00:02:54.609> our<00:02:54.760> decoys<00:02:55.180> that's<00:02:55.659> the<00:02:55.750> same

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
sound out for our decoys that's the same

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.569 
sound out for our decoys that's the same
thing<00:02:56.170> as<00:02:56.319> we<00:02:56.439> do<00:02:56.620> with<00:02:56.769> this<00:02:56.890> decoy<00:02:57.310> right

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
thing as we do with this decoy right

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.140 
thing as we do with this decoy right
here<00:02:57.879> well<00:02:58.390> what<00:02:58.569> that<00:02:58.720> does<00:02:59.019> is<00:02:59.379> it<00:03:00.150> does

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
here well what that does is it does

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.420 
here well what that does is it does
several<00:03:01.480> things<00:03:01.689> number<00:03:02.200> one<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.799> validates

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
several things number one it validates

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.670 
several things number one it validates
your<00:03:03.640> sound<00:03:03.939> there's<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.390> motion<00:03:04.659> there<00:03:05.109> that's

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
your sound there's a motion there that's

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.559 
your sound there's a motion there that's
validating<00:03:06.189> your<00:03:06.430> sound<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:07.030> their<00:03:07.239> predator

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
validating your sound so their predator

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.110 
validating your sound so their predator
comes<00:03:07.840> up<00:03:08.109> he<00:03:08.560> not<00:03:08.769> only<00:03:08.799> hears<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.459> sound<00:03:09.760> it

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
comes up he not only hears a sound it

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.699 
comes up he not only hears a sound it
could<00:03:10.269> be<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.450> wounded<00:03:10.930> prey<00:03:11.139> or<00:03:11.349> another

whatever<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.319> might<00:03:14.470> be<00:03:14.739> but<00:03:15.310> he<00:03:15.370> can<00:03:15.579> also<00:03:15.790> see

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
whatever it might be but he can also see

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.839 
whatever it might be but he can also see
some<00:03:16.420> motion<00:03:16.629> associated<00:03:17.170> with<00:03:17.650> that<00:03:17.829> but<00:03:18.670> the

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
some motion associated with that but the

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.819 
some motion associated with that but the
sound<00:03:19.150> has<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.599> be<00:03:19.750> right<00:03:19.959> there<00:03:20.200> if<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.590> blow
