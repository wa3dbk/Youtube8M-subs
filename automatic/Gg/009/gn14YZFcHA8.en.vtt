that you do it as soon as possible now

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.700 
that you do it as soon as possible now
some<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:26.970> these<00:00:27.269> have<00:00:27.750> come<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.260> beautifully

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
some of these have come up beautifully

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.009 
some of these have come up beautifully
these<00:00:28.859> are<00:00:29.039> bush<00:00:29.279> beans<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.449> they<00:00:30.599> won't<00:00:30.779> grow

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
these are bush beans so they won't grow

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.170 
these are bush beans so they won't grow
tall<00:00:31.380> like<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.890> runner<00:00:32.070> beans<00:00:32.369> they<00:00:32.940> will

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
tall like the runner beans they will

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.319 
tall like the runner beans they will
just<00:00:33.630> grow<00:00:33.960> about<00:00:34.500> 18<00:00:35.399> inches<00:00:35.579> tall<00:00:36.030> and

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
just grow about 18 inches tall and

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.540 
just grow about 18 inches tall and
they'll<00:00:36.899> Bush<00:00:37.140> out<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.770> then<00:00:38.070> you'll<00:00:38.250> get<00:00:38.430> all

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
they'll Bush out and then you'll get all

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.119 
they'll Bush out and then you'll get all
the<00:00:38.700> beans<00:00:38.910> from<00:00:39.210> there<00:00:39.480> now<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.890> grown

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the beans from there now I have grown

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.770 
the beans from there now I have grown
these<00:00:41.280> ones<00:00:41.579> before<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.210> they<00:00:42.300> didn't<00:00:42.600> do

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
these ones before but they didn't do

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.440 
these ones before but they didn't do
very<00:00:42.809> well<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.890> my<00:00:44.040> first<00:00:45.000> year<00:00:45.390> of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
very well so this is my first year of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.600 
very well so this is my first year of
them<00:00:45.870> being<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.230> huge<00:00:46.649> success

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
them being a huge success

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.110 
them being a huge success
now<00:00:48.239> when<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.600> plant<00:00:48.989> them<00:00:49.670> you<00:00:50.670> take<00:00:50.940> them

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
now when you plant them you take them

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.510 
now when you plant them you take them
out<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.390> their<00:00:51.870> little<00:00:52.379> cell<00:00:52.710> or<00:00:53.070> their<00:00:53.250> little

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
out of their little cell or their little

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.959 
out of their little cell or their little
pot<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.210> dig<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> nice<00:00:54.989> big<00:00:55.320> hole<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.610> put

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
pot you dig a nice big hole and you put

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.729 
pot you dig a nice big hole and you put
them<00:00:57.270> down<00:00:58.039> about<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.640> would<00:01:00.270> suggest<00:01:00.750> three

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
them down about I would suggest three

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.149 
them down about I would suggest three
inches<00:01:02.460> below<00:01:03.030> how<00:01:03.840> they<00:01:04.080> as<00:01:04.619> low<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:05.010> they

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
inches below how they as low as they

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.270 
inches below how they as low as they
were<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.390> compost<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> pot<00:01:07.619> because

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
were in the compost in the pot because

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.340 
were in the compost in the pot because
the<00:01:08.549> deeper<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.000> get<00:01:09.180> them<00:01:09.420> then<00:01:09.900> they'll

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
the deeper you get them then they'll

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.370 
the deeper you get them then they'll
have<00:01:10.650> more<00:01:10.950> stability<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.659> do<00:01:12.900> find<00:01:13.140> that

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
have more stability if you do find that

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.320 
have more stability if you do find that
when<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.770> put<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> bit<00:01:14.970> wobbly

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
when you put one in it is a bit wobbly

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.080 
when you put one in it is a bit wobbly
then<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.439> attach<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.979> stick<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.759> know

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
then just attach a stick to it you know

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.050 
then just attach a stick to it you know
so<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.689> will<00:01:19.140> stay<00:01:19.680> there<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.909> won't

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
so that it will stay there and it won't

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.719 
so that it will stay there and it won't
blow<00:01:21.390> over<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:22.140> after<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> while<00:01:22.830> they'll<00:01:23.549> be

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
blow over but after a while they'll be

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.670 
blow over but after a while they'll be
absolutely<00:01:23.850> fine<00:01:24.450> I've<00:01:24.689> only<00:01:24.900> had<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.350> stay

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
absolutely fine I've only had to stay

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.490 
absolutely fine I've only had to stay
five<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:27.000> these<00:01:27.420> ones<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:29.960> just<00:01:30.960> water<00:01:31.170> them

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
five of these ones and just water them

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.910 
five of these ones and just water them
in<00:01:31.950> very<00:01:32.369> very<00:01:32.640> well<00:01:32.820> put<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> few<00:01:34.229> slug<00:01:34.619> pellets

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
in very very well put a few slug pellets

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.060 
in very very well put a few slug pellets
around<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:36.570> wait<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.530> had<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> load

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
around and just wait and we had a load

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.200 
around and just wait and we had a load
of<00:01:38.220> rain

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
them when they're about six inches long

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.649 
them when they're about six inches long
if<00:01:56.159> they<00:01:56.400> do<00:01:56.460> get<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.820> bit<00:01:57.000> bigger<00:01:57.150> it<00:01:57.390> doesn't

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
if they do get a bit bigger it doesn't

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.780 
if they do get a bit bigger it doesn't
really<00:01:57.750> matter<00:01:58.050> but<00:01:58.470> they<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:59.009> they're<00:01:59.610> at

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
really matter but they just they're at

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.730 
really matter but they just they're at
their<00:02:00.000> best<00:02:00.030> when<00:02:00.509> they're<00:02:00.780> relatively<00:02:01.409> thin

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
their best when they're relatively thin

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.399 
their best when they're relatively thin
and<00:02:02.040> they're<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.180> long<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.780> when<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.050> pick

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
and they're just long so when you pick

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.560
