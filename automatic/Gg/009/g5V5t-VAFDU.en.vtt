00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
and the equity graph this thing's been

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.930 
and the equity graph this thing's been
running<00:00:32.230> beautifully<00:00:32.410> and<00:00:32.950> what<00:00:33.640> I<00:00:33.699> want<00:00:33.850> to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
running beautifully and what I want to

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.390 
running beautifully and what I want to
do<00:00:34.120> is<00:00:34.150> just<00:00:34.660> show<00:00:34.780> you<00:00:34.989> that<00:00:35.559> sometimes

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
do is just show you that sometimes

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.160 
do is just show you that sometimes
obviously<00:00:37.120> you're<00:00:37.449> going<00:00:37.480> to<00:00:37.660> get<00:00:37.750> slippage

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
obviously you're going to get slippage

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.960 
obviously you're going to get slippage
on<00:00:38.320> some<00:00:38.620> markets<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:39.370> we<00:00:39.489> factored<00:00:39.940> that

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
on some markets and we factored that

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.520 
on some markets and we factored that
into<00:00:40.270> our<00:00:40.390> performance<00:00:40.960> report<00:00:41.290> but<00:00:41.470> you

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
into our performance report but you

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.710 
into our performance report but you
don't<00:00:41.710> get<00:00:41.800> slippage<00:00:42.160> every<00:00:42.400> time<00:00:42.580> so<00:00:42.820> on<00:00:43.390> our

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
don't get slippage every time so on our

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.530 
don't get slippage every time so on our

the gold on the live server made 746
tonight<00:01:04.059> so<00:01:04.299> this<00:01:04.449> is<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.809> actual<00:01:05.049> contract

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
tonight so this is the actual contract

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.469 
tonight so this is the actual contract
here<00:01:05.890> this<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:06.280> tonight's<00:01:06.640> trading<00:01:07.180> this<00:01:07.299> is

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
here this is tonight's trading this is

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.859 
here this is tonight's trading this is
our<00:01:07.630> live<00:01:07.840> charts<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.640> we've<00:01:10.180> got<00:01:10.330> a<00:01:10.360> position

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
our live charts and we've got a position

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.340 
our live charts and we've got a position
open<00:01:11.140> at<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.350> moment<00:01:11.530> but<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.900> can<00:01:14.080> see

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
open at the moment but you can see

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.940 
open at the moment but you can see
they're<00:01:14.590> 746<00:01:15.580> was<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.570> trade<00:01:16.930> same<00:01:17.530> trade

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
they're 746 was the the trade same trade

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.880 
they're 746 was the the trade same trade
and<00:01:18.510> obviously<00:01:19.510> much<00:01:19.810> better<00:01:20.080> there's<00:01:20.590> really

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
and obviously much better there's really

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.219 
and obviously much better there's really
there's<00:01:21.250> no<00:01:21.460> slippage<00:01:21.909> there<00:01:22.180> we're<00:01:22.780> factored

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
there's no slippage there we're factored

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.069 
there's no slippage there we're factored
in<00:01:23.369> ten<00:01:24.369> dollars<00:01:24.729> of<00:01:24.850> slippage<00:01:25.299> there's<00:01:25.689> zero

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
in ten dollars of slippage there's zero

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:27.899 
in ten dollars of slippage there's zero
slippage<00:01:26.469> so<00:01:26.619> sometimes<00:01:27.250> you're<00:01:27.579> not<00:01:27.700> going

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
slippage so sometimes you're not going

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.429 
slippage so sometimes you're not going
to<00:01:27.969> get<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.270> slippage<00:01:28.659> that<00:01:28.960> you<00:01:29.079> factored

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
to get the slippage that you factored

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.590 
to get the slippage that you factored
into<00:01:29.590> you<00:01:29.859> so<00:01:30.430> it's<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.700> bit<00:01:30.820> of<00:01:30.909> it's<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.359> bit<00:01:31.509> of

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
into you so it's a bit of it's a bit of

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.270 
into you so it's a bit of it's a bit of
a<00:01:31.689> case<00:01:31.930> of<00:01:32.140> swings<00:01:32.409> and<00:01:32.590> roundabouts<00:01:33.070> but

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
a case of swings and roundabouts but

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.520 
a case of swings and roundabouts but
typically<00:01:34.030> what<00:01:34.299> i<00:01:34.329> recommend<00:01:34.570> traders<00:01:35.259> do<00:01:35.409> is

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
typically what i recommend traders do is

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.380 
typically what i recommend traders do is
factor<00:01:35.829> in<00:01:36.009> that<00:01:36.039> ten<00:01:36.369> dollars<00:01:36.640> of<00:01:36.939> slippage

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
factor in that ten dollars of slippage

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.520 
factor in that ten dollars of slippage
for<00:01:37.780> gold<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.799> crude<00:01:39.009> /<00:01:39.340> /<00:01:39.850> side<00:01:40.179> and<00:01:40.509> if<00:01:41.320> you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
for gold and crude / / side and if you

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.109 
for gold and crude / / side and if you
don't<00:01:41.890> get<00:01:42.039> the<00:01:42.189> slippage<00:01:42.549> during<00:01:42.909> the

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
don't get the slippage during the

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.760 
don't get the slippage during the
session<00:01:43.840> then<00:01:44.259> you'll<00:01:44.439> be<00:01:44.560> pleasantly

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
session then you'll be pleasantly

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.819 
session then you'll be pleasantly
surprised<00:01:45.460> but<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.899> to<00:01:47.020> have<00:01:47.170> that<00:01:47.200> in<00:01:47.499> just

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
surprised but just to have that in just

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.279 
surprised but just to have that in just
ensures<00:01:48.249> that<00:01:48.280> when<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.850> run<00:01:49.060> your

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
ensures that when you run your

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.050 
ensures that when you run your
performance<00:01:50.289> report<00:01:50.649> you've<00:01:51.310> got<00:01:51.609> that<00:01:51.759> built

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
performance report you've got that built

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.819 
performance report you've got that built
in<00:01:52.270> your<00:01:52.600> commissions<00:01:53.109> and<00:01:53.289> slippage<00:01:53.679> and

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
in your commissions and slippage and

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.499 
in your commissions and slippage and
then<00:01:54.039> you're<00:01:54.520> not<00:01:54.670> disappointed<00:01:55.270> when<00:01:55.390> you
