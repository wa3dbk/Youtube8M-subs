nonetheless<00:02:58.660> here<00:02:59.660> we<00:02:59.870> go<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:00.320> wish<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.100> was<00:03:01.220> at

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
nonetheless here we go I wish it was at

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.970 
nonetheless here we go I wish it was at
least<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:02.090> spinner<00:03:02.900> plate<00:03:03.140> was<00:03:03.350> metal<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:03.920> it

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
least a spinner plate was metal so it

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.460 
least a spinner plate was metal so it
would<00:03:04.100> go<00:03:04.280> faster<00:03:04.850> because<00:03:05.810> otherwise<00:03:06.170> it

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
would go faster because otherwise it

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.170 
would go faster because otherwise it
just<00:03:06.650> ends<00:03:06.920> really<00:03:07.130> quick<00:03:07.550> like<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:07.970> you

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
just ends really quick like that you

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.680 
just ends really quick like that you
don't<00:03:08.360> get<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.690> full<00:03:10.000> long<00:03:11.000> spin<00:03:11.360> I<00:03:11.390> guess

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
don't get the full long spin I guess

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.900 
don't get the full long spin I guess
there's<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.709> name<00:03:12.890> plate<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:13.370> can<00:03:13.580> engrave

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
there's the name plate you can engrave

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.620 
there's the name plate you can engrave
that'd<00:03:14.239> be<00:03:14.360> pretty<00:03:14.510> cool<00:03:14.680> says<00:03:15.680> champ<00:03:16.630> Monday

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630
