area of a sort of all native hedgerow
the<00:00:44.840> first<00:00:45.079> thing<00:00:45.290> to<00:00:45.380> point<00:00:45.530> out<00:00:45.680> is<00:00:45.739> that<00:00:45.890> we

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
the first thing to point out is that we

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.740 
the first thing to point out is that we
really<00:00:47.270> dug<00:00:47.480> into<00:00:47.660> the<00:00:47.870> hillside<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:49.750> created

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
really dug into the hillside and created

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.049 
really dug into the hillside and created
a<00:00:50.840> basin<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:51.590> berm<00:00:51.800> system<00:00:52.309> or<00:00:52.460> a<00:00:52.489> swale<00:00:52.820> where

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
a basin and berm system or a swale where

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.170 
a basin and berm system or a swale where
there's<00:00:53.210> this<00:00:53.780> part<00:00:54.110> in<00:00:54.200> here<00:00:54.440> is<00:00:54.559> a<00:00:54.590> nice<00:00:55.180> bowl

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
there's this part in here is a nice bowl

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.569 
there's this part in here is a nice bowl
for<00:00:56.630> collecting<00:00:57.260> rainwater<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:57.829> holding

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.930 

now<00:01:08.560> we<00:01:08.620> have<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:08.920> berm<00:01:11.550> which<00:01:12.550> is<00:01:12.700> actually

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
now we have a berm which is actually

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.160 
now we have a berm which is actually
supported<00:01:13.810> by<00:01:13.960> some<00:01:14.400> some<00:01:15.400> logs<00:01:15.730> and<00:01:16.630> stones

is<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> an<00:01:59.340> edible<00:01:59.970> native<00:02:00.780> plant<00:02:01.080> that<00:02:01.229> also

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
is a an edible native plant that also

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.070 
is a an edible native plant that also
tracks<00:02:01.710> beneficial<00:02:02.250> insects<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:03.930> then

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
tracks beneficial insects so then

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.809 
tracks beneficial insects so then
heading<00:02:04.350> back<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:06.320> we've<00:02:07.320> got<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
diversity of if Barry crops we have four

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:22.759

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:33.370 

we<00:02:23.769> have<00:02:24.489> a<00:02:26.400> golden<00:02:27.400> current

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.059 

we<00:02:33.590> have<00:02:33.800> some<00:02:34.330> chocolates<00:02:35.330> chokecherries

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:48.020

and then on the other side we've got
another<00:02:50.490> golden<00:02:51.000> current<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.709> couple<00:02:52.950> of

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
another golden current and a couple of

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:02.290 
another golden current and a couple of
improved<00:02:54.540> American<00:02:55.310> hazelnuts

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.070 

locusts<00:03:03.290> over<00:03:03.620> here<00:03:03.860> on<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.100> berm<00:03:04.340> with

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
locusts over here on the berm with

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.390 
locusts over here on the berm with
lupins<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.350> other<00:03:06.500> things<00:03:07.360> so<00:03:08.360> this<00:03:08.810> is<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:09.400> the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
lupins and other things so this is a the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.270 
lupins and other things so this is a the
idea<00:03:10.700> here<00:03:10.940> in<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.150> long<00:03:11.330> term<00:03:11.570> is<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:12.280> the

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
idea here in the long term is that the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.790 
idea here in the long term is that the
nitrogen-fixing<00:03:13.790> species<00:03:14.630> will<00:03:14.870> serve<00:03:15.140> as<00:03:15.380> a

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
nitrogen-fixing species will serve as a

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.500 
nitrogen-fixing species will serve as a
living<00:03:16.190> hedgerow<00:03:16.700> on<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.940> berm

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.539 

post<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.049> used<00:03:23.230> as<00:03:23.409> mulched<00:03:23.890> improve<00:03:24.370> the

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
we also did a lot of sheet mulching in

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.890 
we also did a lot of sheet mulching in
here<00:03:42.390> there's<00:03:42.570> about<00:03:42.920> eight<00:03:43.920> inches<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.400> good

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
here there's about eight inches of good

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:55.150 
here there's about eight inches of good

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.119 

so<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.239> nitrogen-fixing<00:04:05.989> species<00:04:06.769> will<00:04:06.980> be<00:04:07.010> a

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
so the nitrogen-fixing species will be a

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.460 
so the nitrogen-fixing species will be a
hedge<00:04:07.459> that<00:04:07.610> will<00:04:07.819> catch<00:04:08.030> snow<00:04:08.450> which<00:04:09.379> is

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
hedge that will catch snow which is

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.080 
hedge that will catch snow which is
where<00:04:09.650> a<00:04:09.680> lot<00:04:09.709> of<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:09.920> precipitation<00:04:10.489> here

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
where a lot of the precipitation here

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.860 
where a lot of the precipitation here
comes<00:04:11.360> to<00:04:11.840> help<00:04:11.989> it<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.230> melt<00:04:12.379> down<00:04:13.870> they'll

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
comes to help it to melt down they'll

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.479 
comes to help it to melt down they'll
stabilize<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.590> Berman<00:04:15.980> help<00:04:16.130> with<00:04:16.280> rainwater

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
stabilize the Berman help with rainwater

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.479 
stabilize the Berman help with rainwater
capture<00:04:17.389> and<00:04:17.600> they'll<00:04:18.560> be<00:04:18.709> chopped<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.400> use

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
capture and they'll be chopped and use

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.090 
capture and they'll be chopped and use
this<00:04:19.639> coppice<00:04:20.180> mulch<00:04:20.989> to<00:04:21.289> improve<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:21.919> soil

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
this coppice mulch to improve the soil

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.920 
this coppice mulch to improve the soil
in<00:04:22.250> here<00:04:22.550> this<00:04:23.259> planting<00:04:24.259> of<00:04:25.090> native<00:04:26.090> fruiting

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
in here this planting of native fruiting

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.340 
in here this planting of native fruiting
and<00:04:27.080> not<00:04:27.470> producing<00:04:27.949> shrubs<00:04:28.509> will<00:04:29.509> also<00:04:30.020> serve

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
and not producing shrubs will also serve

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.800 
and not producing shrubs will also serve
as<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:30.590> nursery<00:04:31.039> for<00:04:31.370> planting<00:04:32.000> out<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.600> rest

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
as a nursery for planting out the rest

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.930 
as a nursery for planting out the rest
of<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.050> site<00:04:33.259> which<00:04:33.530> is<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.710> total<00:04:34.130> of<00:04:34.250> 62<00:04:34.759> acres

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
of the site which is a total of 62 acres

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.450 
of the site which is a total of 62 acres
so<00:04:35.330> there's<00:04:35.509> plenty<00:04:35.780> of<00:04:36.250> plenty<00:04:37.250> of<00:04:37.280> that<00:04:37.430> to

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
so there's plenty of plenty of that to

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.310 
so there's plenty of plenty of that to
plan<00:04:37.789> out<00:04:37.970> so<00:04:38.360> this<00:04:38.510> is<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.810> beginning<00:04:38.990> of

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
plan out so this is the beginning of

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.570 
plan out so this is the beginning of
something<00:04:39.560> very<00:04:39.830> exciting<00:04:40.070> here<00:04:40.520> would<00:04:41.419> buy
