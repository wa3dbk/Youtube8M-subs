00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
yet again to figure out some sort of DIY

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.720 
yet again to figure out some sort of DIY
workaround<00:00:27.450> and<00:00:27.800> I'm<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> little<00:00:29.460> bit<00:00:29.580> more

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
workaround and I'm a little bit more

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.130 
workaround and I'm a little bit more
proud<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.450> than<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> crankshaft

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
proud of this one than the crankshaft

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.840 
proud of this one than the crankshaft
one<00:00:31.560> because<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.129> lot<00:00:32.340> less<00:00:32.850> dangerous<00:00:34.850> so

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
one because it's a lot less dangerous so

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.009 
one because it's a lot less dangerous so
I<00:00:35.879> found<00:00:36.449> a<00:00:36.899> tool<00:00:37.170> for<00:00:38.039> it<00:00:38.329> online<00:00:39.329> made<00:00:39.989> by

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
I found a tool for it online made by

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.279 
I found a tool for it online made by
Blue<00:00:40.409> Point<00:00:40.699> but<00:00:41.699> I<00:00:42.030> searched<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.079> searched

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
Blue Point but I searched and searched

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.430 
Blue Point but I searched and searched
and<00:00:43.559> searched<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.159> it<00:00:44.609> really<00:00:44.850> did<00:00:45.210> not<00:00:45.440> seem

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
and searched and it really did not seem

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.500 
and searched and it really did not seem
to<00:00:46.800> exist<00:00:47.280> anywhere<00:00:48.140> anymore<00:00:49.699> so<00:00:50.699> this<00:00:51.179> is<00:00:51.359> not

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
to exist anywhere anymore so this is not

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.180 
to exist anywhere anymore so this is not
genuine<00:00:51.960> inspiration<00:00:52.109> because<00:00:52.769> essentially

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
genuine inspiration because essentially

genuine inspiration because essentially
what<00:00:53.429> I've<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.609> done<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.269> to<00:00:54.449> replicate<00:00:54.659> that

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
what I've just done is to replicate that

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.000 
what I've just done is to replicate that
tool<00:00:55.699> with<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.969> bunch<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.389> junk<00:00:57.749> around<00:00:58.589> my

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
refrigerator magnet but one of those

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.510 
refrigerator magnet but one of those
doughnut<00:01:25.140> shaped<00:01:25.440> magnets<00:01:25.980> that<00:01:26.190> you<00:01:26.280> seem<00:01:26.490> to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
doughnut shaped magnets that you seem to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.330 
doughnut shaped magnets that you seem to
find<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.180> little<00:01:27.420> stores<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.020> whatnot<00:01:28.380> for

you know novelties entertainment or
whatever<00:01:31.730> magnets<00:01:32.730> are<00:01:32.820> very<00:01:32.850> brittle<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.810> I

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
whatever magnets are very brittle so I

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.100 
whatever magnets are very brittle so I
just<00:01:34.350> hit<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.620> with<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.950> hammer<00:01:35.100> until<00:01:36.110> it

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
just hit it with a hammer until it

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.410 
just hit it with a hammer until it
turned<00:01:37.590> into<00:01:37.740> those<00:01:37.890> little<00:01:38.010> shards<00:01:38.490> only

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
turned into those little shards only

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.830 
turned into those little shards only
took<00:01:39.570> about<00:01:39.630> two<00:01:40.020> wax<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.680> then<00:01:41.580> placed<00:01:42.360> those

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
took about two wax and then placed those

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.250 
took about two wax and then placed those
little<00:01:43.230> magnet<00:01:43.620> shards<00:01:44.070> inside<00:01:44.940> this<00:01:45.840> jack

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
little magnet shards inside this jack

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.070 
little magnet shards inside this jack
handle<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:47.910> essentially<00:01:48.450> serves<00:01:48.690> as<00:01:49.050> a

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
handle and this essentially serves as a

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.460 
handle and this essentially serves as a
very<00:01:49.800> shitty<00:01:50.520> version<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.120> the<00:01:52.020> special
