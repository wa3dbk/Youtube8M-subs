 percent true to its roots but you 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.299
 know thanks to crooked control 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.720
 gameplay of classic survival horror 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:35.610
 looks like this okay okay stop everything and 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.409

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.159

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.030
 100 does the police have anything to do with 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.429
 genetics can stick flashlight 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.590
 gun but you need a lot 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.209
 time to figure out which one 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.170
 a sequence of buttons for this 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:07.560
 answers but it was worth the connection 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.079
 Weapons and flashlight Step 2 Press backspace 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.860
 down + press to enable the menu 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.860
 adhesive tape 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:21.030
 like breaking a lock 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.250
 it reminds me you can make 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.019
 woman moving your closet while you 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.019
 portray yourself samurai 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.219
 if any character dies then he 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:41.260
 will die like always and no one and 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:45.299
 will never play for him again 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:49.859
 even your grandmother especially your grandmother 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:52.420
 I think that the machine is not in order so well, 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.790
 you know you have something in common 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.349
 puzzles in the spirit of the shoulders cup with 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.209
 acid and closed doors that simple 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.280
 the lock is closed with tongue and classic 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.170
 silent hill ovsky things like point 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.480
 set coordinates on the map 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.819
 but still compared to the whole frail 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.409
 ups is pretty casual every 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.780
 the character has a unique 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.269
 feature one tells you whether 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.030
 in the room useful things another can 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:19.480
 quickly crack locks 3 can quickly 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.760
 run tv in hand advertising 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.139

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.139
 say no staff 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.530
 you break the glass to let in 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.540
 the premise is light and weaken the enemy and this 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.220
 great gameplay coupled with 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.260
 the need to break machines with 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.270
 energetic it gives a strong element 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.340
 Survival and you have to 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.750
 interact with the environment to 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.030
 survive and it's a fur seal that what I 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.630
 wrong picked words no 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:58.760

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:02.550
 sea snakes and ocean cat 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.310
