00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
bit strange with

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.610 
bit strange with
well<00:02:16.790> more<00:02:17.060> just<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.569> last<00:02:17.750> one<00:02:18.050> was<00:02:18.230> too<00:02:18.410> late

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
well more just the last one was too late

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.850 
well more just the last one was too late
and<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.880> was<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.030> little<00:02:20.270> bit<00:02:20.390> annoying<00:02:20.630> but

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860

rest there's some some different tracks

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.540 
rest there's some some different tracks
or<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.780> year<00:03:09.019> so<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.590> keeps<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:10.070> exciting

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
or this year so it keeps it exciting

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.340
