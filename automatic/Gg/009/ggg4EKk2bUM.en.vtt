00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.049
 my name is daniel eduardo cuervo 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.320
 alviar I am an agronomist of the 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:14.570
 food and agro foundation at this time 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.150
 Well, we are here in the part of 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.820
 the location of the farm where 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.449
 we produce all our vegetable under 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.550
 hydroponics systems aeroponics and 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:31.150
 organ put this system that we see here 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.150
 it's called vertical cascading 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.790
 This is a system in which water 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.130
 enter through the top 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.920
 falling in the form of a waterfall and coming back and 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.810
 the water is collected for the part of 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.450
 the plants in this system that 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.220
 we observe here we have an area of ​​6 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.670
 square meters these 6 meters 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.610
 squares in plants we have 720 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.830
 units 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.930
 if we make the comparison of the 6 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.880
 meters on land in traditional cultivation 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.860
 just plant and grow 194 plants 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.310
 so we're talking about a 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.040
 Planting density per meter of 120 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.840
 plants in this system and in the system 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.390
 traditional on land we would be 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.730
 talking about 16 plants per meter is the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.130
 system that we have here are the famous 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.490
 hydroponic trays or what we 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.570
 we call of mini homemade gardens 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.850
 this space has an area of ​​one 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.220
 sixty meters long by 80 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.630
 centimeters wide and at this moment 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.270
 what we are driving here 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.979
 is the density of planting us here 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.530
 We have exactly 80 80 plants 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.240
 parsley so what we 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.270
 we show here that we can 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.600
 plant different different species 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.630
 in a larger planting area if this 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.490
 we passed ashore on this in this space 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.579
 small we would not fit this density of 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.579
 sowing 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:07.790
 this is a eros put vertical 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.300
 rotational since your entire system 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.300
 tour 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.129
 for all 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.110
 in this system we do not have any 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.410
 type of substrate 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.200
 and the only thing that there is is a water vapor or 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.910
 dry water where the plant absorbs what 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.530
 needs and the rest is released and returns 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.560
 and the spraying process is done 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.349
 of the water 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.260
 in this in this module that is here in 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.260
 a space of 3 x 3 or 9 meters 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.940
 squares we have a density of 500 4 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.730
 plants 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.850
 equally in these systems we have a 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.540
 95% water saving and apart from that 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.520
 we have a higher productivity we 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.640
 we are here giving vegetables in 7 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.280
 weeks what tells us that in crops 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.910
 traditional a lettuce is delayed 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.820
 nine weeks in the systems of 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.400
 Hydroponics takes seven weeks and 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.960
 we are doubling the crops while 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.450
 that in a traditional crop are removed 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.190
 four harvests a year and we in 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.960
 those systems we are taking seven 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.790
 harvests a year that's the process of 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.070
 sowing that are done in the part the 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.400
 hydroponics systems what we 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.610
 we perform is a root cleaning 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.500
 after the root is clean what 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.260
 The only thing we do is put it in a 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.209
 foam 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.640
 that will make us this foam alone 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.400
 sustain the plant more is not going to meet 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.650
 another function and the system the only thing that 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.640
 is done is to introduce the foam 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.680
 inside the hole 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.850
 that is the size in which it should be 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.860
 the root line 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.860
 to be able to enter the systems 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:00.290
 the part of natural resources does not 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:03.379
 renewable with soil water and air water 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.569
 because we are taking advantage of 95 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.999
 hundred 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.519
 soil we are taking advantage of the density 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:12.159
 of sowing that is to say in a larger one in a 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:15.819
 minimum space we will increase the 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:17.859
 productivity the change in soil does not and the 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.519
 part of air because we here are 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:24.400
 in small spaces we are capturing 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.470
 greater amount of carbon dioxide than 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.229
 in a traditional crop put because 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.539
 by the density of sowing agribusiness
