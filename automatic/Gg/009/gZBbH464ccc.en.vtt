00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.890 
it isn't gone the West I think this
would<00:01:46.140> be<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> best<00:01:46.530> idea

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
would be the best idea

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.900 
would be the best idea
because<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:48.250> server<00:01:48.460> gets<00:01:48.610> way<00:01:48.880> too

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
because the server gets way too

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.360 
because the server gets way too
cluttered<00:01:49.330> and<00:01:49.630> it's<00:01:50.470> not<00:01:50.620> a<00:01:50.650> bottling<00:01:51.100> I<00:01:51.250> mean

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
cluttered and it's not a bottling I mean

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.130 
cluttered and it's not a bottling I mean
it<00:01:51.490> gets<00:01:51.610> closer<00:01:51.820> big<00:01:52.120> stuff<00:01:52.360> it<00:01:52.570> just<00:01:52.600> gets

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
it gets closer big stuff it just gets

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.580 
it gets closer big stuff it just gets
close<00:01:54.300> we<00:01:55.300> look<00:01:55.480> at<00:01:55.570> this<00:01:55.660> as<00:01:55.840> was<00:01:56.020> i<00:01:56.110> justified

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
close we look at this as was i justified

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.590 
close we look at this as was i justified
the<00:01:56.830> moment<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.310> it's<00:01:57.850> really<00:01:58.000> awesome<00:01:58.210> that

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
the moment and it's really awesome that

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.030 
the moment and it's really awesome that
I<00:01:58.900> have<00:01:59.080> this<00:01:59.260> amount<00:01:59.440> of<00:01:59.590> people<00:01:59.800> on<00:01:59.890> this

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
I have this amount of people on this

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.460 
I have this amount of people on this
server<00:02:00.660> creating<00:02:01.660> all<00:02:01.750> this<00:02:01.870> awesome<00:02:02.230> stuff

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
server creating all this awesome stuff

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.430 
server creating all this awesome stuff
but<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.550> mean<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.570> gets<00:02:04.720> too<00:02:04.870> cluttered<00:02:05.050> up<00:02:05.290> and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
but I mean I gets too cluttered up and

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.350 
but I mean I gets too cluttered up and
say<00:02:05.530> before<00:02:05.890> but<00:02:06.040> look<00:02:06.400> it<00:02:06.640> really<00:02:06.910> so<00:02:07.150> many

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360
