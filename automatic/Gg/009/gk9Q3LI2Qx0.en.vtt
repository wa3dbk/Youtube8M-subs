00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.550
 day 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.550
 peace 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.349
 but also in other legal aspects of the state in which we are going to continue 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.090
 with the way of the world in this little sign a small one of the worst of the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.659
 few days that last 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.609
 you just have to require some customer in mont 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.430
 this while the elites how are you going to grab this trophy then any 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.119
 anything can pull its fellow ports weapons the box 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.330
 esther end almost anything 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.760
 the only thing that loaves left a stump to Maria a problem as you want 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.770
 to call 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.500
 and here a living example of if you do not leave what can happen to you and I join 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.600
 another but kill 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.710
 it was as he said telling the truth 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.660
 the only thing they have to do is that here was something that occupied the 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.960
 Well obviously the poster is the meeting of people 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.330
 any of the three laboratory floors the principle that always goes 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.690
 to be in the first two floors because 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.880
 I made the three liters according to ap open one more door 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.700
 700 of the a-4 in the first two pilots because you want to act soon 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.010
 and it's all little radar but I think the president is there until now 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.400
 I'm going to leave a hostile world of a night intrusion 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.590
