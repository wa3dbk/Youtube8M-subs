00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 ah 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.500
 Well first thing we're going to do is going to 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.640
 be our letter let's grab a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.099
 needle let's draw a heart 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.619
 with our picture we draw a heart 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:27.829
 smaller than the first one we're going to 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.230
 use this transparent to cover it 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.260
 and make a type indicated with our 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.420
 pen we wrote our letter back 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.300
 we also return to cover it cut if 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:44.559
 I like to apply is fine and 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.559
 That's how my little house and guy stayed in my house 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.550
 Now what we are going to need is going to be 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.430
 a packet of gelatin the flavor of your 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.809
 preference and another dislike a mold 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:59.700
 to cut fruit a mold to put the 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.700
 gelatin and our letter 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.180
 now what we are going to do in a fret 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:12.020
 let's put two cups of water 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.560
 We serve them and we wait for them 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.560
 boil 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.970
 since it's boiling now we pay the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.490
 fire 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.950
 and we are going to take the package of 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.910
 flavor jelly that you have 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.190
 chosen and we are going to put it very well for 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.500
 that they are not going to hit me leave me a 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.750
 poison until it is this way 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.600
 Now what will we do let's take 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.900
 two cups of cold water 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:48.220
 back in our jelly 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:52.220
 I turn to stir 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.120
 and then we 're going to put it in this mold 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.460
 and we're going to put the refrigerator 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.800
 we do it very carefully our 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.800
 gelatin in our mold 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.070
 we leave it to set in the 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.100
 refrigerator and here is already ready 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.610
 our gelatin I put strawberries here in 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.460
 the corner is already curdled now the 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.390
 we take the leave a moment here and 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.460
 let's go with the next step 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.130
 now our next step we are going to 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.790
 make our grenetina let's take 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:34.540
 We will dissolve a cup of water 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.180
 packet in a mold 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.469
 we emptied our package 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:45.510
 We emptied the water and started to wag 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:45.510
 until it dissolves well 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.780
 since it dissolved well look good 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.840
 now we leave it here a little bit and now 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.020
 we go with our next step that goes 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.380
 to be mark make our heart 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:06.000
 inside the gelatin we are going to grab 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:09.040
 our mold and we are going to press it 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.930
 here in the jelly later with a 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.319
 spoon let's take out all the gelatin 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.340
 from inside 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.140
 we press carefully 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.459
 thus 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:26.530
 and now let's take it out with a spoon 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:29.020
 all the jelly left inside 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.910
 so very carefully 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.540
 and the one inside you the 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.540
 they can go eating 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.800
 and thus they will be as 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.890
 have removed all the gelatin now with 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.050
 very careful you have to take out the mold and 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.980
 let's take our little card and we're going 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.930
 to put inside 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.310
 in this way they had to have 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.750
 left 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.099
 and now we go to the next step 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.020
 Now what will we do we will 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.840
 grab our clementine that we had 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.600
 dissolved we are going to put the micro by 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.650
 15 seconds 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:10.850
 we leave it there for 15 seconds in 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:14.090
 how much is it removed and now what 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.910
 we stir a little and we're going to throw it out 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:21.380
 inside our heart in the 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:25.490
 gelatin we help with a spoon and 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:29.690
 so we are filling our hole here 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.050
 so that it covers our letter of this 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.050
 shape 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.000
 we put it back in the fridge until 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.000
 that set 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.570
 good as we over a little 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.210
 grenetina and as you do not have water we are going to 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.910
 squeeze an orange to make the 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:57.300
 orange jelly or the like can 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.300
 squeeze a lemon we empty it in a glass 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.590
 and chop fruit that we have 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:07.030
 this way and we put it inside the 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.760
 bread and nothing else we put 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.040
 the refrigerator so that any together 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.900
 with our other gelatin and so not 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.229
 we spoil anything 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.190
 and good here is our jelly 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:24.669
 well curd ready to give it away and 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:28.150
 to eat we were very beautiful, and 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.669
 here is the glass with the gelatin that is 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.520
 It was not good, I hope there was 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.710
 liked this recipe if you liked it not 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.389
 I would have subscribed to my channel that 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.199
 God bless you see you for the 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.289
 next 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.289
 bye
