go<00:02:36.060> up<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.750> zero<00:02:37.170> point<00:02:37.379> what<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.160> zero

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
go up to the zero point what is the zero

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.920 
go up to the zero point what is the zero
point

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.330 

the<00:02:45.769> best<00:02:46.599> that<00:02:47.599> will<00:02:47.780> be<00:02:47.930> like<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.439> this<00:02:49.159> is

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
the best that will be like this this is

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.170 
the best that will be like this this is
the<00:02:49.430> zero<00:02:49.640> point

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
the zero point

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.119 
the zero point
so<00:02:50.959> here<00:02:51.280> anteriorly<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:52.519> will<00:02:52.640> have<00:02:52.819> 18

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
so here anteriorly you will have 18

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.979 
so here anteriorly you will have 18
right<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:56.150> on<00:02:56.510> that<00:02:56.780> back<00:02:57.290> side<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:58.730> will<00:02:58.989> just

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
right so on that back side it will just

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.759

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
the way you can add now as I says if you

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.680 
the way you can add now as I says if you
feel<00:06:09.080> the<00:06:09.350> patients<00:06:09.800> need<00:06:09.860> more<00:06:10.640> to<00:06:11.240> bring<00:06:11.450> his

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
cheek in the in the position the same

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.490 
cheek in the in the position the same
thing<00:06:14.780> you<00:06:14.930> can<00:06:15.140> do

thing you can do

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.660 
thing you can do
check<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:16.040> works<00:06:16.250> and<00:06:16.550> you<00:06:17.090> can<00:06:17.120> add<00:06:18.340> here<00:06:19.340> to

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 
check the works and you can add here to

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.300 
check the works and you can add here to
make<00:06:19.820> it<00:06:19.970> more<00:06:20.180> thick<00:06:20.450> if<00:06:21.200> it<00:06:21.410> is<00:06:21.560> if<00:06:21.860> it<00:06:22.070> in<00:06:22.220> the

patient's mode you feel it is already

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.800 
patient's mode you feel it is already
