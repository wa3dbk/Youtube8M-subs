00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.470
 hello friends with you semenihin line and in 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.630
 this blog we discuss all the questions 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.610
 food related to sports and 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.080
 achieving excellent physical fitness 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.120
 last time we talked to you about 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.980
 vitamins and today is the time 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.600
 talk about minerals as i promised 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.030
 generally you know the more i think about 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.340
 volume of how many components 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.050
 human nutrition and what a huge 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.730
 the number of things is basically necessary 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.650
 consider the more I understand that if 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.629
 zamorochitsya this really can 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.510
 I think all other things in life 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.929
 generally forget because if everyone 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.579
 element in the diet to devote at least 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:42.079
 one program then half a life can 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.460
 talk about different elements and I don’t 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.019
 talking about how confused by him 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.789
 you need to become a man to each of 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.559
 of these elements 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.960
 integrate your diet exclusively 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.839
 true proportions also give it 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.729
 attention forget about it i'm trying to 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.399
 this blog to share with you practical 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.289
 methods of embedding all of these elements 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.600
 your diet and most importantly those ways 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.760
 or dishes that are using in order 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.290
 so that all these elements are present in 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.060
 my diet that will allow me 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.509
 train intensely active and 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.670
 the main thing is long and so to speak minerals it 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.320
 inorganic substances source for 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.600
 human minerals serves first 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.250
 all vegetable food sea ​​products 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.530
 also a good source of mineral strength 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.119
 the fact that dwells in the environment rich 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.210
 minerals but in general it can be said so 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.369
 that animals need minerals and 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.229
 get them from plant foods therefore 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.090
 and man better get minerals from 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.560
 plant food which means the fact 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.200
 what are these inorganic substances 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.299
 This means that when heated minerals and 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.399
 don't disappear anywhere that is if you 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.020
 take any any source 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.210
 peace love here on my desk here already 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.420
 there are several sources put them in 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.520
 fire and they completely burn that ashes and 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.409
 In general, this is all that will remain and 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.630
 there will be no minerals to destroy them 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.609
 what not to say about organic 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.350
 food components and so now on screen 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:59.090
 you see a list of the main minerals and 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.369
 minor difference between these two 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.170
 groups only in the amount that 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.060
 necessary for the human body if in 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.340
 In the first case, the quantity is greater than 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.210
 the second case, the amount is less but those 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.709
 and other essential minerals in general 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.500
 absolutely necessary to impart 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.370
 structures to the human body 4 percent 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.000
 demon of man 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.560
 this is a mineral 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.510
 if you start looking in those literature 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.310
 products that are good 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.200
 source of certain minerals then 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.760
 there are abundant sources then again and 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.470
 stumble again on products like 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.860
 dried apricots almonds nuts cashews and walnuts 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.330
 nut 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.850
 but naturally there are those products that 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.440
 sort of like in nature there but we have them 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.390
 never seen in practice at 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.280
 I do not know where to buy them so guys I 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.330
 chose those products that any of you 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.300
 will find anywhere 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.910
 these are the products we will now 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:51.470
 mercilessly smash special devices 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:55.610
 and so 50 grams of walnuts 50 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:59.200
 grams of cashew 100 grams of almond and 100 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.630
 grams of dried apricots half a lemon 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.760
 that's okay and forearm training 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:12.100
 great, it already smells great 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.100
 close the devil and destroy 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.480
 so apparently need to add more lemon 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:29.439
 a little juice and another second forearm 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:35.799
 I'm kidding some water I 'll give Victoria 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:37.810
 that rain and lemon juice and preservative you 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.840
 know as a child I remember me somehow 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.879
 spoke motto do you want to be always 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.099
 healthy mix dried apricots and walnut 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:50.709
 honey here so much components 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.629
 more interesting is that this mess 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.930
 Well, let's call it porridge and although in fact 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:58.840
 don't even know what to compare it with 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.549
 dry enough it can be easily taken 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.769
 by itself in a small container and for 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.299
 maintaining strength and energy and the influx of those 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.060
 the very elements we are talking about 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.579
 use during the day so why 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.530
 I have to try it, I think you are 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.000
 ask why i didn't use honey i 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.159
 I will answer that in my opinion too 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.769
 sugary a lot of sugar simple 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:22.060
 carbohydrates here dried apricots this function 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:25.090
 quite well done grandfather 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.849
 excellent what can be said about this 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.160
 this is the product that the body 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.229
 really want to chew that is 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.570
 chew in order to learn all 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.720
 these elements are so necessary 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.979
 great for maintaining strength and the most 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.260
 the main thing is that in this small amount 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.760
 contains more than the daily rate 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.190
 many components 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.169
 that is, it 's basically enough for two days 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.210
 but friends we have prepared a dish today 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.400
 exceptionally rich in minerals though 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.249
 possible from a culinary point of view and not 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.349
 the most well recognized 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:56.639
 maybe even we are the first who this dish 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.649
 did but i can tell you that 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.089
 Tasty enough and only in terms of its 

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:02.099
 functional meaning 

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:03.629
 there is simply no better dish because 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.099
 minerals here for two days as 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:07.079
 least so i welcome any 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.849
