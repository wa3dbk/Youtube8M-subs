come in sections the 124 comes in for
pretty<00:00:21.480> thick<00:00:21.689> sections<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> beefy<00:00:22.529> shorter

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
pretty thick sections is a beefy shorter

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.920 
pretty thick sections is a beefy shorter
one<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.340> then<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.760> 118<00:00:24.300> comes<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.750> three

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
one and then the 118 comes in three

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.029 
one and then the 118 comes in three
sections<00:00:25.170> we'll<00:00:25.410> come<00:00:25.529> back<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.740> one<00:00:25.920> in

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
sections we'll come back to this one in

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.560 
sections we'll come back to this one in
a<00:00:26.099> second<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:26.820> when<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.000> open<00:00:27.029> up<00:00:27.240> your<00:00:27.300> sheath

a second so when you open up your sheath
here's<00:00:28.380> what<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.590> get<00:00:28.740> for<00:00:29.460> our<00:00:29.990> cottage<00:00:30.990> hope

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
here's what you get for our cottage hope

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.110 
here's what you get for our cottage hope
sections<00:00:31.800> these<00:00:31.949> two<00:00:32.099> are<00:00:32.219> aluminum<00:00:32.640> I'm

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
sections these two are aluminum I'm

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.790 
sections these two are aluminum I'm
pretty<00:00:33.390> sure<00:00:33.480> these<00:00:33.600> are<00:00:33.750> steel<00:00:34.020> benchmade

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
pretty sure these are steel benchmade

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.530 
pretty sure these are steel benchmade
calls<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.130> an<00:00:35.219> aluminum<00:00:35.640> narcotic<00:00:36.030> pro<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.390> i

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
calls it an aluminum narcotic pro but i

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.940 
calls it an aluminum narcotic pro but i
think<00:00:36.930> these<00:00:36.989> dealing<00:00:37.320> two<00:00:37.410> aluminum<00:00:37.739> pieces

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
think these dealing two aluminum pieces

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.100 
think these dealing two aluminum pieces
they<00:00:38.489> screw<00:00:38.790> together<00:00:38.910> screw<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.809> couple

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
they screw together screw a couple

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.900 
they screw together screw a couple
together<00:00:40.200> until<00:00:40.950> i<00:00:41.040> get<00:00:41.100> off<00:00:41.280> frame<00:00:41.520> will<00:00:41.760> come

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
together until i get off frame will come

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.630 
together until i get off frame will come
back<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.570> bigger<00:00:43.410> assembled<00:00:43.920> probe<00:00:44.160> and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
back with the bigger assembled probe and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.860 
back with the bigger assembled probe and
we'll<00:00:44.730> just<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:44.940> probing<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.660> gonna<00:00:45.750> be

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
we'll just in probing it's gonna be

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.619 
we'll just in probing it's gonna be
awesome<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:50.190> end<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.329> particular

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
awesome so the end on this particular

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.290 
awesome so the end on this particular
piece<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.260> perforated<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.070> when<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.340> stick<00:00:54.180> it

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
piece is perforated so when you stick it

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.850 
piece is perforated so when you stick it
into<00:00:54.420> something<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.020> actually<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.440> sample

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
into something you actually get sample

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.099 
into something you actually get sample
when<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.430> extract<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.969> that's<00:00:57.930> how<00:00:58.050> that

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
when you extract it that's how that

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.880 
when you extract it that's how that
works<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.699> then<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> handle<00:01:01.640> screw<00:01:02.840> this<00:01:03.890> so

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
works and then the handle screw this so

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980 
works and then the handle screw this so
this<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.220> 124<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.360> thicker<00:01:06.600> but

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
this is the 124 this is the thicker but

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.920 
this is the 124 this is the thicker but
shorter<00:01:07.439> extraction<00:01:08.070> tool<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.060> 18<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
shorter extraction tool this is 18 and a

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.340 
shorter extraction tool this is 18 and a
half<00:01:10.110> inches<00:01:10.320> overall<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.850> then<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.150> about

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
half inches overall and then it's about

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.260 
half inches overall and then it's about
13.6<00:01:13.350> ounces<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.950> pretty<00:01:14.580> heavy<00:01:14.790> actually

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
13.6 ounces so pretty heavy actually

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.330 
13.6 ounces so pretty heavy actually
it's<00:01:15.390> about<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> pound<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:16.619> could<00:01:17.070> probably

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it's about a pound you could probably

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.039 
it's about a pound you could probably
use<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> weapon<00:01:18.150> if<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> had<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.840> but

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
use it as a weapon if you had to but

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.030 
use it as a weapon if you had to but
that's<00:01:19.200> not<00:01:19.350> what<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:19.680> its<00:01:19.979> for

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
that's not what it's for its for

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.910 
that's not what it's for its for
extraction<00:01:21.020> you<00:01:22.020> know<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.560> safely

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
extraction you know this is for safely

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280 
extraction you know this is for safely

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
there anyway this is the smaller one the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.840 
there anyway this is the smaller one the
118<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:40.380> much<00:01:40.829> much<00:01:41.130> lighter<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
118 is much much lighter and then the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.520 
118 is much much lighter and then the
top<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.240> top<00:01:42.360> handle<00:01:42.689> piece<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.049> aluminum<00:01:43.409> on

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
top the top handle piece is aluminum on

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.649 
top the top handle piece is aluminum on
this<00:01:43.649> too<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.820> shaft<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.180> aluminum<00:01:45.570> and
