00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
especially because we were stepping

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.350 
especially because we were stepping
across<00:06:29.660> the<00:06:29.960> line<00:06:30.140> there<00:06:30.380> they<00:06:30.500> go<00:06:31.030> my<00:06:32.030> camo

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
across the line there they go my camo

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.150 
across the line there they go my camo
dudes
