00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
to show you how the lockout kit works

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.810 
to show you how the lockout kit works
when<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.559> open<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> package<00:00:50.160> you'll

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
when you open up the package you'll

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
notice there's a few different pieces in

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.630 
notice there's a few different pieces in
here<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.309> first<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.360> D<00:00:54.539> flash<00:00:54.870> now<00:00:55.640> we

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
here the first one is the D flash now we

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.180 
here the first one is the D flash now we
have<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> accessory<00:00:57.390> shoe<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
have the accessory shoe and we have the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.849 
have the accessory shoe and we have the
3-inch<00:00:59.579> balance<00:01:00.000> wing<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.020> used<00:01:01.320> when

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
3-inch balance wing this is used when

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.799 
3-inch balance wing this is used when
you<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:01.980> more<00:01:02.340> weight<00:01:02.579> distributed<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.570> one

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
you have more weight distributed to one

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.870 
you have more weight distributed to one
side<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> camera<00:01:04.559> than<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> other<00:01:05.339> for

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
side of the camera than the other for

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.810 
side of the camera than the other for
example<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> monitor<00:01:07.380> setup<00:01:07.890> here<00:01:08.130> so

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
example we have a monitor setup here so

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.429 
example we have a monitor setup here so
the<00:01:08.939> camera<00:01:09.270> will<00:01:09.390> be<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> little<00:01:09.840> heavier<00:01:10.170> on

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
the camera will be a little heavier on

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.980 
the camera will be a little heavier on
the<00:01:10.799> left-hand<00:01:11.220> side<00:01:11.390> then<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.479> will<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:12.810> on

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the left-hand side then it will be on

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:29.370 
the left-hand side then it will be on
the<00:01:13.110> right

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.560 

now<00:01:30.380> we<00:01:30.440> put<00:01:30.710> our<00:01:30.740> 3-inch<00:01:31.220> wing<00:01:31.430> on<00:01:31.610> we<00:01:32.330> take

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
now we put our 3-inch wing on we take

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.560 
now we put our 3-inch wing on we take
our<00:01:32.750> D<00:01:32.930> flash<00:01:33.230> nur<00:01:33.500> set<00:01:34.280> this<00:01:34.430> aside<00:01:34.610> someplace

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
our D flash nur set this aside someplace

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.130 
our D flash nur set this aside someplace
safe

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
safe

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.720 
safe
so<00:01:36.410> you<00:01:36.470> can<00:01:36.680> keep<00:01:36.830> it<00:01:37.010> now<00:01:37.400> attach<00:01:37.700> the

accessory shoe upside down onto the

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.810 
accessory shoe upside down onto the
scorpion

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.790 

go<00:01:46.420> a<00:01:46.450> little<00:01:46.540> further<00:01:46.900> back<00:01:47.230> than<00:01:47.440> your<00:01:47.590> flash

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
go a little further back than your flash

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.930 
go a little further back than your flash
ooh<00:01:48.150> you<00:01:49.150> want<00:01:49.360> to<00:01:49.420> put<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.660> D<00:01:49.840> flasher<00:01:50.140> in<00:01:50.380> and

ooh you want to put the D flasher in and
then<00:01:51.940> slide<00:01:52.270> this<00:01:52.450> up<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:55.600> meet<00:01:55.810> with<00:01:55.990> the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
then slide this up to meet with the

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.770 
then slide this up to meet with the
camera<00:01:57.240> tighten<00:01:58.240> down<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.570> D<00:01:58.720> flash<00:01:58.990> knife

camera tighten down the D flash knife
and<00:02:01.780> now<00:02:02.020> you're<00:02:02.500> ready<00:02:02.620> to<00:02:02.770> go<00:02:02.920> if<00:02:03.790> you<00:02:04.000> need

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
and now you're ready to go if you need

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.360 
and now you're ready to go if you need
to<00:02:04.330> you<00:02:04.960> can<00:02:05.110> adjust<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.560> camera<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.280> left

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
to you can adjust the camera to the left

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.740 
to you can adjust the camera to the left

and to the right

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.690 
and to the right
this<00:02:08.110> allows<00:02:08.380> you<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.619> compensate<00:02:08.950> for<00:02:09.610> the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
this allows you to compensate for the

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.720 
this allows you to compensate for the
weight<00:02:09.880> of<00:02:10.270> any<00:02:10.600> added<00:02:11.020> year<00:02:11.200> now<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.220> camera

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
weight of any added year now the camera
