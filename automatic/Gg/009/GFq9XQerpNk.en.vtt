00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.720
 hello robert when i thank at one 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.130
 more gives a hand look there 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.050
 I could have arrived but I'm not 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.550
 plumber and I would like to install a 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.840
 washing machine and here it is 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.340
 need two things a water inlet and 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.990
 an assault that's clear is the 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.670
 know it's true we're pretty bad 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.840
 so placed this story of doing everything 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.340
 Immediately the installation I showed 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.489
 after beast but techniques like the 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.489
 steam 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.700
 so we want to use that it seems like a 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.950
 little odd there is a self tap 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.770
 piercer so at cock self cradle he 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.470
 will fix on the tube like that 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:56.630
 okay there is a seal 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.280
 and when I'm going to turn she'll come 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.260
 breakthrough this is actually a 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.660
 important room next door will cut the 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.699
 tuning tube penetrate do a whole 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.320
 little step sic that will fall 28 so when 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.210
 even put on it already for good 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.470
 understand how it works 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.020
 so whatever ink diameter 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.250
 yvon not quite pellet but we can 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.070
 work on several diameters of 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.460
 ass since we usually have tubes of 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.550
 12 14 or 16 years old and I really meet 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.950
 just do the sealing and 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.520
 it's when I'm going to do this and that 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.550
 resists 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.050
 because the self piercing guy him he in 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.810
 getting into the leather is a 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.000
 little bit hard inside the tube a 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.940
 agreement we actually see because 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.530
 the little pie not those times there 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.690
 now I fix them and in real 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.020
 truth because they propose and we are going 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.979
 block with this nut 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.860
 this is really a blocking listening and 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.990
 I obviously cut the web open 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.850
 on our arrival of water for the machine and 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.450
 we will now take care of 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.909
 evacuation 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.340
 so here we will install a system for 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.820
 come connect on the evacuation so 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.530
 for a whole set of elbow tubes 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.090
 with a siphon because obviously the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.040
 can then from the machine she had to 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.540
 get in there and that's the way it is 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.049
 avoid their odors rising any 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.850
 simply 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:21.650
 so how do we wear the t on 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.430
 will trace the piece cut on the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.070
 piping 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.640
 if you can not lend yourself a 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.209
 going on to cut after obviously I 'm going 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.010
 canned 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.189
 the study 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.019
 good I so my exit and I 'm doing 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:39.560
 necessarily a montage called 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.980
 to white he stick to put all that 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.420
 market 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.510
 once I did the blank editing 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:49.310
 but a rule we find like that I 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:52.159
 know I'm going to stick so cleaning to 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.500
 steel wool or at the stellar noise this 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.810
 until the little toddler of the hull 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.359
 special for pvc knowing that now 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.590
 there is glue for pvc in this 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.780
 quick-drying maquis like these 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.620
 markets there but that is special water 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.989
 potable 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.319
 so that's the rating that can not 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.879
 we poison a lot not disagree and 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.159
 the tumor is just on a length 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.970
 a centimeter to fresh when I'm going 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:19.480
 put my report I turn a little and 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.340
 the glue she's going to do a weld 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.500
 which she sticks but at the same time 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.000
 amalgamate the two pipes and elf and 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.680
 sealing so I have not only a 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.959
 sticking and sealing that is done 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.970
 then we grant the water supply 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.549
 are obviously simple the faucet 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.319
 and wind diameter I open it's a 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.299
 quarter turn valve so very fast 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.019
 there it is it is food water 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:45.829
 and then we'll put the camera 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.970
 evacuation it was not very complicated 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.590
 it takes a little bit of material when 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.569
 not even what you need to know is that 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.220
 the same type of installation can be 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.299
 to do for a dishwasher because 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.400
 it's the same thing you need an arrival in 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.019
 an evacuation always make sure not to 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.370
 do not forget the little if they do that 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.480
 look at Arias but it avoids 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.180
 bad smells and it's still 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.360
 essential big thank you robert

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.589
 Yes 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.530
 and 

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:31.240
 [Music] 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.240
 where they give together is better
