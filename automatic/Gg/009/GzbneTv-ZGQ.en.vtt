00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 welcome this video tutorial has how 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.610
 argument to explain how with a 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.010
 normal usb hard drive will succeed 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.880
 via the diva utility feature 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.580
 things to get 3 partitions from 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.970
 use for example for time machines 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.250
 one for as universal disc is for 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.029
 market that he is not one dedicated to 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:32.130
 mac with usb hard drive that i loaded 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:36.120
 here it is classic fat32 file system ai 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.489
 of dimensions of 160 gb as the attack 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.969
 obviously as I connect it in the car 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.079
 proposes me to use it as a disk of 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.829
 time machine backup 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.030
 but in this case I decide later 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.270
 to carry out the operation we have 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.910
 simply connect the hard drive you can 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.440
 take us to disk utility applications 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.070
 that we find inside the folder 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.210
 utility 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.640
 here it is once opened 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.909
 German notes program shows everyone 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.290
 the risks connected to the system 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.580
 here is our system disk 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.990
 operational and so on 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.170
 here is this hard drive we have 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.990
 which we used which we have 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.810
 simply connected via usb 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.689
 selecting here and bringing us up 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.939
 partition we can decide how many 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.470
 protections create in this case us 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.189
 we want to create three so we do 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.130
 crib 3 partitions at this point not 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.310
 there is nothing to do but decide to do the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.869
 file system for a partition is 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.720
 name it the first partition we have 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.079
 said we will use portai machine then 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:55.079
 write no time machine we will leave the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.250
 dina format obviously things we leave 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.110
 in this case also the size 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.380
 automatic time machine is set 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.219
 obviously wishing we could move it to 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.470
 our liking but in this case me 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:12.040
 they said of 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.040
 let's assume we leave 53 koch e 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:21.760
 we set the second the second 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:28.280
 partition as a hard disk always for 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:35.570
 mac systems is the third one as hard 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:39.830
 disk fat32 here of course we have to 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.900
 put fat32 file systems to this 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.480
 point by simply clicking on 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.880
 apply button we can send 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.170
 the operation if we were not convinced that 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.120
 the procedure is simply enough 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.390
 click on the track an original you can 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.570
 start changing the settings 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.610
 we click on apply which is asked 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:04.130
 to confirm the operation we give 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.510
 ok and by partition we wait for some 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.250
 second penalty of course one 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.660
 size of the nord disk this hard 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.459
 160 GB disks on the market today are 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.730
 hard drives present in very size 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:20.300
 wider but to get a hard disk e 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.580
 let's say multi system can be good 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.550
 here is what operation already done 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:31.310
 an interesting thing is that in the end 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:37.670
 of the operation we find loaded 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:39.950
 on the desk of the mac three hard disks in 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.160
 reality is always one that is seen three 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.290
 simply at this point 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.700
 we can exit the utilities disco e 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:53.780
 decides to manage my own disks 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.239
 consider this hard disk this 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.100
 hard disk is 32 will be the only one to come 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.080
 seen on both mac and windows 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.350
 this hard disk but that will be the only one 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.440
 seen on mac and time machine and of course 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.170
 I never will be dedicated to backup 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.390
 via time machine what 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.420
 interesting that you decided to 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.400
 disassemble a risk layer I can 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.930
 decide to selectively disassemble a 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.310
 hard disk and leave in two others 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:25.610
 connected 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:31.750
 or it's everyone's ok 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.750
 I think it's all next time
