and it is very simple to download I've
already<00:00:43.620> downloaded<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.670> no<00:00:44.910> point

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
already downloaded it so it's no point

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
to follow the instructions

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.490 
to follow the instructions

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
but if asks you to put in a product key

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.549 
but if asks you to put in a product key
just<00:00:55.500> say<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.579> skip<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.210> part<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.750> it

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
just say then just skip that part as it

just say then just skip that part as it
like<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.280> it'll<00:00:59.399> still<00:00:59.730> work<00:00:59.760> fine<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.930> it

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
like and it'll still work fine but it

will be limited to 10 minutes to ten
minute<00:01:04.409> downloads<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.790> could<00:01:05.970> always

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
minute downloads but you could always

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.050 
minute downloads but you could always
just<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.960> 10<00:01:07.680> minutes<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.280> then<00:01:08.369> another<00:01:08.729> 10

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
just have 10 minutes and then another 10

just have 10 minutes and then another 10
minutes<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.510> edit<00:01:09.780> them<00:01:09.900> together<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:11.220> if

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
minutes and edit them together if you if

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.390 
minutes and edit them together if you if
need<00:01:11.820> be<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.590> after<00:01:13.590> we've<00:01:13.740> downloaded<00:01:13.979> it

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
need be so after we've downloaded it

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.460 
need be so after we've downloaded it
will<00:01:14.549> go<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:15.360> programs<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.490> look<00:01:17.490> for

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
will go to all programs and look for

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.050 
will go to all programs and look for
Microsoft<00:01:19.470> expression<00:01:19.920> right<00:01:20.640> there<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
Microsoft expression right there and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.800 
Microsoft expression right there and
then<00:01:21.780> set<00:01:22.110> has<00:01:22.590> two<00:01:22.890> parts<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.610> encoder<00:01:24.030> like

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
then set has two parts the encoder like

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.990 
then set has two parts the encoder like
screen<00:01:25.229> recorder<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.009> actual<00:01:26.610> encoder

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
screen recorder and the actual encoder

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.289 
screen recorder and the actual encoder
you<00:01:27.330> will<00:01:27.869> which<00:01:28.200> will<00:01:28.439> make<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.650> playable

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
you will which will make it playable

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.179 
you will which will make it playable
like<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.509> your<00:01:30.659> computer<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.530> I'd<00:01:32.040> recommend

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
like on your computer so I'd recommend

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.780 
like on your computer so I'd recommend
dragging<00:01:32.970> these<00:01:33.350> out<00:01:34.350> onto<00:01:34.829> your<00:01:34.860> desktop<00:01:35.520> so

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
dragging these out onto your desktop so

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.999 
dragging these out onto your desktop so
it's<00:01:35.970> easier<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> reach<00:01:36.689> them<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.829> we'll

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
it's easier to reach them but so we'll

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.969 
it's easier to reach them but so we'll
start<00:01:38.310> up<00:01:38.490> expression<00:01:39.360> encoder<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.829> can

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
start up expression encoder and you can

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.359 
start up expression encoder and you can
click<00:01:41.250> your<00:01:41.430> mic<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.369> microphone

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
click your mic if you have a microphone

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.600 
click your mic if you have a microphone
pressed<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.689> will<00:01:45.869> give<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.079> audio

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
pressed in and this will give you audio

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.819 
pressed in and this will give you audio
you<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.640> your<00:01:48.000> settings<00:01:48.420> which<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.619> can

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
you have your settings which you can

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.060 
you have your settings which you can
configure<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.869> stuff<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.560> then

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
configure on stuff like that and then

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.660 
configure on stuff like that and then
start<00:01:53.790> with<00:01:54.000> plus<00:01:54.299> record<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:56.280> will<00:01:56.460> give

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
start with plus record and it will give

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.209 
start with plus record and it will give
you<00:01:56.939> what<00:01:57.600> dimensions<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.320> want<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.560> record

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
you what dimensions you want to record

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.580 
you what dimensions you want to record
it<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.670> then<00:02:00.570> or

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it and then or

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.060 
it and then or

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
recorded we will need to send this to

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.949 
recorded we will need to send this to
encode<00:02:28.709> into<00:02:28.980> encoder<00:02:29.790> or<00:02:30.090> if<00:02:30.569> you're<00:02:30.780> not

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
encode into encoder or if you're not

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.759 
encode into encoder or if you're not
like<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.620> can<00:02:31.769> delete<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:34.530> can

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
like this you can delete it and you can

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.500 
like this you can delete it and you can
do<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> little<00:02:35.220> bit<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.459> editing<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.150> decoder

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
do a little bit of editing in decoder

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.289 
do a little bit of editing in decoder
but<00:02:37.349> I<00:02:37.560> recommend<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.220> edit<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.880> different

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
but I recommend you edit in a different

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.199 
but I recommend you edit in a different
source<00:02:39.540> as<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.900> will<00:02:40.319> probably<00:02:40.739> be<00:02:40.860> easier<00:02:41.209> but

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
source as it will probably be easier but

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.650 
source as it will probably be easier but
simply<00:02:42.569> just<00:02:42.690> click<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.140> go<00:02:43.260> down<00:02:43.290> there<00:02:43.829> and

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
simply just click and go down there and

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.430 
simply just click and go down there and
it<00:02:45.660> will<00:02:45.810> be<00:02:45.870> running<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:48.049> since<00:02:49.049> it<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.290> such

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
it will be running and since it is such

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.640 
it will be running and since it is such
a<00:02:49.500> small<00:02:49.769> file<00:02:50.099> it<00:02:50.640> will<00:02:50.910> be<00:02:51.000> easy<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.650> encode

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
a small file it will be easy to encode

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.559 
a small file it will be easy to encode
it'll<00:02:53.010> be<00:02:53.160> quick<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:53.640> now<00:02:54.269> we're<00:02:54.420> going<00:02:54.510> to

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
it'll be quick so now we're going to

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.240 
it'll be quick so now we're going to
delete<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:55.019> but<00:02:55.500> if<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.650> want<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:55.890> keep<00:02:56.040> it

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
delete this but if you want to keep it

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.759 
delete this but if you want to keep it
