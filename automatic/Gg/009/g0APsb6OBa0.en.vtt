looking<00:00:35.190> right<00:00:35.399> at<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.790> piston<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.660> behind

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
looking right at the piston and behind

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.350 
looking right at the piston and behind
that<00:00:37.200> there's<00:00:37.620> redstone<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.940> got<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.270> all

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.389 
that there's redstone and I got it all
hid<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.530> underground<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.129> don't<00:00:41.280> have

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
hid like this underground you don't have

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.619 
hid like this underground you don't have
to<00:00:41.520> do<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.730> underground<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.239> do<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.390> above

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
to do it underground you do it above

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.709 
to do it underground you do it above
ground<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.110> build<00:00:43.320> over<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.360> I<00:00:45.360> put

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
ground I just build over it and I put

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.720 
ground I just build over it and I put
another<00:00:45.960> redstone<00:00:46.260> repeater<00:00:46.800> down<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.370> keep

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
another redstone repeater down to keep

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.340 
another redstone repeater down to keep
it<00:00:47.910> going<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.450> won't<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.780> lay<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> torch

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
it going so I won't have to lay a torch

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.240 
it going so I won't have to lay a torch
and<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:51.059> fully<00:00:51.420> running<00:00:51.829> or<00:00:52.829> messing

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and it just be fully running or messing

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.680 
and it just be fully running or messing
up<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.699> could<00:00:53.879> never<00:00:53.969> get<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.329> method

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
up because I could never get that method

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.450 
up because I could never get that method
to<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.989> right<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:56.160> there's<00:00:56.309> another

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
to do it right and then there's another

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.069 
to do it right and then there's another
redstone<00:00:56.850> repeater<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> back<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.809> this

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
redstone repeater on the back of this

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.110 
redstone repeater on the back of this
sticky<00:00:58.410> piston<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:59.039> leading<00:00:59.550> with<00:00:59.760> redstone

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
sticky piston just leading with redstone

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.799 
sticky piston just leading with redstone
all<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> way<00:01:00.660> back<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:02.070> other<00:01:02.219> side<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
all the way back to the other side and

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.280 
all the way back to the other side and
then<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.559> need<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.010> link<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.700> lever<00:01:06.060> or<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
then you need to link a lever or a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.050 
then you need to link a lever or a
pressure<00:01:07.590> plate<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.640> turn<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.000> or

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
pressure plate so you can turn it on or

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:23.780 
pressure plate so you can turn it on or

our redstone repeaters right behind it
on<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.490> closest<00:02:28.490> block<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.210> sticky

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
on the closest block to the sticky

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.340 
on the closest block to the sticky
piston<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:31.780> then<00:02:32.780> you're<00:02:32.930> going<00:02:33.020> to<00:02:33.080> want<00:02:33.260> to

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
piston and then you're going to want to

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.170 
piston and then you're going to want to
lay<00:02:35.110> sure<00:02:36.110> regular<00:02:36.730> I'm<00:02:37.730> gonna<00:02:37.850> go<00:02:37.970> out<00:02:38.030> a

lay sure regular I'm gonna go out a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.830 
lay sure regular I'm gonna go out a
little<00:02:38.360> bit<00:02:38.710> redstone<00:02:40.390> for<00:02:41.390> pretty<00:02:41.690> much<00:02:41.750> the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
little bit redstone for pretty much the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.610 
little bit redstone for pretty much the
wire<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:46.900> then<00:02:47.900> you're<00:02:48.140> going<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.320> want<00:02:48.530> to

wire and then you're going to want to

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.020 
wire and then you're going to want to
lay<00:02:48.770> your<00:02:49.070> switch<00:02:49.400> somewhere<00:02:51.760> say<00:02:52.760> we're

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
lay your switch somewhere say we're

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:03.310 
lay your switch somewhere say we're
going<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.240> wait<00:02:53.360> here<00:03:01.840> see<00:03:02.840> how<00:03:02.930> only<00:03:02.990> ones

going to wait here see how only ones

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.350 
going to wait here see how only ones
working<00:03:03.560> right<00:03:03.860> now<00:03:04.060> because<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.150> want<00:03:05.330> to

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
want to add another redstone repeater

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.820 
want to add another redstone repeater
kind<00:03:07.490> of<00:03:07.610> towards<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.090> middle<00:03:08.360> or<00:03:09.260> wherever

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
kind of towards the middle or wherever

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:21.100 
kind of towards the middle or wherever
it's<00:03:10.250> it's<00:03:10.970> dead<00:03:11.270> at<00:03:12.430> like<00:03:13.430> right<00:03:14.270> here<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:20.110> we

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
it's it's dead at like right here and we

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.729 
it's it's dead at like right here and we
got<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:23.780> can<00:03:23.900> see<00:03:24.110> where<00:03:24.350> i<00:03:24.380> didn't

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
got to and you can see where i didn't

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.620 
got to and you can see where i didn't
space<00:03:25.010> them<00:03:25.220> far<00:03:25.489> enough<00:03:25.580> apart<00:03:25.850> so<00:03:26.450> we're

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
space them far enough apart so we're

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.250 
space them far enough apart so we're
gonna<00:03:26.720> have<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.200> go<00:03:28.810> five<00:03:29.810> spaces<00:03:30.260> instead<00:03:31.070> of

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
gonna have to go five spaces instead of

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.100 
gonna have to go five spaces instead of
four<00:03:33.260> like<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.680> did<00:03:34.480> that's<00:03:35.480> no<00:03:35.660> problem<00:03:35.900> that's

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
going to lay two more right there all

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:57.390 
going to lay two more right there all
right<00:04:12.140> cool<00:04:12.320> no<00:04:12.710> no<00:04:12.920> need<00:04:13.580> to<00:04:13.670> go<00:04:13.790> right<00:04:13.970> here

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:06.490 

just<00:04:58.400> like<00:04:58.580> that<00:05:04.900> so<00:05:05.900> when<00:05:06.110> you<00:05:06.200> lay<00:05:06.350> your

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
just like that so when you lay your

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.780 
just like that so when you lay your
Pistons<00:05:06.980> down<00:05:07.190> make<00:05:08.180> sure<00:05:08.210> they're<00:05:08.480> one<00:05:08.780> two

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
Pistons down make sure they're one two

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.260 
Pistons down make sure they're one two
three<00:05:10.790> four<00:05:11.630> there's<00:05:12.350> four<00:05:12.890> spaces<00:05:13.400> in

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
three four there's four spaces in

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.570 
three four there's four spaces in
between<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:15.740> Pistons<00:05:16.130> when<00:05:16.280> they're<00:05:16.400> fully

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
between the Pistons when they're fully

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.390 
between the Pistons when they're fully
closed<00:05:17.200> so<00:05:18.200> whatever<00:05:18.650> you<00:05:18.830> put<00:05:19.040> in<00:05:19.100> the<00:05:19.160> middle

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
closed so whatever you put in the middle

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.540 
closed so whatever you put in the middle
can<00:05:21.250> close<00:05:22.250> and<00:05:22.960> not<00:05:23.960> like<00:05:24.290> halfway<00:05:24.650> close<00:05:25.010> or

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
can close and not like halfway close or

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.500 
can close and not like halfway close or
the<00:05:25.669> piston<00:05:26.000> be<00:05:26.150> messed<00:05:26.360> up<00:05:26.570> and<00:05:27.470> that<00:05:28.330> is<00:05:29.330> my

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
the piston be messed up and that is my

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.920
