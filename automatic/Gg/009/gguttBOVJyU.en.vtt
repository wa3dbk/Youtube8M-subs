00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.089
 20 years ago the School of Music 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.600
 the university of sherbrooke opened its 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.900
 doors 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.000
 first announced in 1979 by the Minister 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.009
 of education jacques yvan morin a 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.120
 first project is abandoned on a background of 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.340
 economic recession 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.359
 after years of talks and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.369
 disappointed hopes 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.820
 the music school finally welcomes its 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.400
 First 18 students at the end of 1992 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.609
 the central idea was to make sure 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.610
 that we have in the region of mind 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.260
 an educational tool called 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.540
 a music school because it was at 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.350
 both a faculty of music and a 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.350
 conservatory 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.420
 so with the music school sherbrooke 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.100
 has become one of the few cities in 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.140
 canada to offer an education 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.060
 specialized in music at all levels 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.940
 from primary to university 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.190
 today some 250 academics 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.780
 music students at home strengthening 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.100
 the long musical tradition of 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.110
 sherbrooke 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.130
 this will was only carried by 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.770
 the fact that in sherbrooke and estrie 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.240
 a musical tradition that dates back to 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.360
 long their only symphonic 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.190
 sherbrooke was founded in 1939 before 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.070
 even when symphonique de montrÃ©al 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.200
 there was an intense musical life e 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.200
 sherbrooke since the 19th century 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.180
 the music school today offers ten 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.820
 music training programs and 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.580
 musical culture in jazz performance 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.440
 and classical instruments or singing but 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.540
 also in musical pedagogy in 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.990
 multimedia and singing direction 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.420
 choral 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.310
 but especially the university of sherbrooke 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.110
 provides a learning environment that 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.270
 stands out but I think that's it 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.040
 find here it's among others this 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.410
 very human character this 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.540
 availability 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.660
 they have a special contact with their 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.810
 teachers who are very present for 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.369
 them 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.399
 I think that I like I like 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.399
 a lot 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.469
 but we have more time to practice 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.100
 than at CEGEP but that's what I like 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:09.110
 in the course of improvisation that there 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.720
 several instruments then we have 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.819
 interaction we are only in private 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.620
 we have training courses of this type 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.720
 of arrangement that all joined 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.720
 fading farm in farm pleasant 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.209
 naxos 24 hours a day 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.970
 so that's one of the things that makes me 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.019
 come here as a drummer that's 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.940
 easy to have a place for 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.280
 practicing the university time provided to 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.260
 the music school radiates far beyond 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.000
 campuses of sherbrooke and longueuil 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.299
 but the music school offers 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.560
 many concerts and recitals so this 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.750
 point of view there it helps to 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.010
 the cultural animation of the region and 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.290
 also from Quebec 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.269
 it is in partnership also with 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.069
 several organisms the region I think 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.190
 especially at the orford arts center whose 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.400
 all of this will help energize 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:03.079
 important way the cultural life in 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.519
 quebec and a spirit colonize them from 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.349
 new work hoped Lyon 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.000
 the university of sherbrooke and rayon 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.709
 also for his students his graduates 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.450
 then in 20 states I still see it 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.730
 to make more radiant a function abolished 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.280
 these graduates the voice with a quarter 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.750
 even bigger faculty and still 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.750
 more involvement with the community
