00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
rotate outward about that far

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.480 
rotate outward about that far
they<00:04:26.300> also<00:04:26.570> rotate<00:04:27.020> all<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.259> way<00:04:27.409> around<00:04:27.530> they

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
they also rotate all the way around they

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.219 
they also rotate all the way around they
bend<00:04:28.820> at<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:28.969> elbow<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.389> they<00:04:29.479> also<00:04:29.780> rotate

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
bend at the elbow and they also rotate

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.980

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
resting it in his hand but at least it's

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.720

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.390 
I mean at least it looks better like
he's<00:05:29.510> gripping<00:05:29.930> it<00:05:30.200> kind<00:05:31.070> of<00:05:31.250> I<00:05:31.960> suppose<00:05:33.400> you
