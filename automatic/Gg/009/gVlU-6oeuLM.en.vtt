 pleased to meet today for a 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.330
 new video 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.430
 today I find you for the 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.950
 makeup tutorial of this makeup there 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.029
 which is a makeup that is inspired by 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.560
 katy perry makeup 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.789
 it was a brave moment that I had 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.900
 more made of star makeup and I'm 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.939
 I said I want an iron again 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.129
 but honestly I did not know what 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.969
 star take already I really like katy 

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:31.759
 perry because that's 

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:33.590
 it's someone who has the 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.329
 very very original it's someone from 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.129
 very extroverted she if they enough 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.050
 extravagant quite fruity enough colorful 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.999
 I like and suddenly I was on 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.230
 instagram and then I saw a picture 

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:43.969
 of her I saw myself doing a makeup 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.440
 inspired by her because I know she 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.159
 often has colorful makeups and 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.989
 that's who's a makeup that's in 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.730
 the shades of purple on the top with 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.469
 glitter is underneath we had 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.870
 really glass this makeup jelly 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.100
 made with a palette of elf that 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.050
 I have since a long time 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.690
 this is this pallet there you have 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.940
 the palette here's elf with them endless 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.870
 I think one to 100 and suddenly it 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.220
 was a lot of time that I was 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.930
 served more is one of the first 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.159
 palettes that I had when I really 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.000
 started to be interested in makeup 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.740
 it's really one of the first 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.750
 pallets that I had and suddenly I 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.890
 I'm good I said to myself I'm going 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.580
 will make this makeup with this 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.110
 pallet there because it's been a long time 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.970
 that I do not use and I find that it is 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.000
 good because it's really makeup 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.410
 made with small make- ups 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.940
 budgets because even fossils 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.170
 come from home primark I paid him a 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.160
 euro fifty seven palettes he's me 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.260

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.240
 something like that goes little by little 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.000

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.480
 my outer corner which formed a 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.680
 structure and I'm actually going to come to 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.300
 above the eyelid and on the 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.129

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.819
 mobile eyelid 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.020

 much on the outer side in fact of the 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.620

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.989

 everyone's makeup is 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.030

 even if there are glitter months for 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.400
