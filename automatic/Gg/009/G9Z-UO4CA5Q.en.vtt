00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.930 
of course has the SSD in the RAM already
installed<00:02:27.060> but<00:02:27.980> again<00:02:28.980> pretty<00:02:29.340> similar<00:02:29.760> oh

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
installed but again pretty similar oh

next I'm going to show you how easy it

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.070 
next I'm going to show you how easy it
is<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.099> set<00:02:38.459> up<00:02:38.580> this<00:02:38.760> device<00:02:38.940> I'm<00:02:39.810> actually

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
is to set up this device I'm actually

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.900 
is to set up this device I'm actually
going<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.380> be<00:02:40.440> removing<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:41.250> Wi-Fi<00:02:41.549> card<00:02:41.790> and

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
going to be removing the Wi-Fi card and

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.030 
going to be removing the Wi-Fi card and
putting<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.239> an<00:02:42.420> Intel<00:02:42.720> 7260<00:02:43.620> AC

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
putting in an Intel 7260 AC

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.360 
putting in an Intel 7260 AC
so<00:02:44.760> let's<00:02:44.910> do<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.269> first

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.809 

I<00:02:49.409> have<00:02:50.409> to<00:02:50.530> do<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:50.769> take<00:02:50.920> off<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.220> antenna<00:02:51.519> and

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
I have to do is take off the antenna and

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.460 
I have to do is take off the antenna and
I'll<00:02:52.000> screw<00:02:52.299> this<00:02:52.420> one<00:02:52.599> screw<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.110> supports

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
I'll screw this one screw that supports

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.570 
I'll screw this one screw that supports
it<00:02:53.590> down<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.900> go<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.620> device<00:02:56.860> pops<00:02:57.129> up<00:02:57.370> and

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
it down you go the device pops up and

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.220 
it down you go the device pops up and
you<00:02:58.360> pull<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.629> out<00:02:59.430> this<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:01.360> Intel<00:03:01.720> 70<00:03:02.110> to

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
you pull it out this is the Intel 70 to

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.319 
you pull it out this is the Intel 70 to
60<00:03:02.409> AC<00:03:02.799> again<00:03:03.610> put<00:03:04.239> it<00:03:04.330> in<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:05.909> just<00:03:06.909> screw<00:03:07.209> it

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
60 AC again put it in and just screw it

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:13.949 
60 AC again put it in and just screw it
down<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:12.040> then<00:03:12.549> make<00:03:12.819> sure<00:03:12.849> the<00:03:13.209> antennas<00:03:13.720> go

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
down and then make sure the antennas go

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:23.410 
down and then make sure the antennas go
the<00:03:14.530> same<00:03:14.829> place<00:03:15.099> that<00:03:15.370> they<00:03:15.489> were<00:03:15.549> before

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.770 

finally<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:25.110> have<00:03:25.140> Aram<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.400> use<00:03:26.850> four<00:03:27.209> gigs<00:03:27.450> of

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
finally you have Aram I use four gigs of

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.650 
finally you have Aram I use four gigs of
ddr3<00:03:29.930> ten<00:03:30.930> push<00:03:31.740> it<00:03:31.890> down<00:03:32.069> and<00:03:32.310> that's<00:03:33.300> pretty

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
ddr3 ten push it down and that's pretty

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.330 
ddr3 ten push it down and that's pretty
much<00:03:33.780> it<00:03:33.990> X<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.690> SSD<00:03:36.690> which<00:03:37.440> comes<00:03:38.190> with

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
much it X is the SSD which comes with

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:47.360 
much it X is the SSD which comes with
some<00:03:38.489> mounting<00:03:38.850> screws<00:03:39.180> in<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.600> Box<00:03:40.760> go<00:03:46.370> slide
