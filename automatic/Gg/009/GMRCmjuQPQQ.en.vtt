my<00:02:12.330> only<00:02:12.540> issue<00:02:12.900> with<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.380> as<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.680> think

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.850 

I'm<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.850> working<00:02:21.780> with<00:02:21.870> what<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.110> have<00:02:22.290> the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
I'm just working with what I have the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.950 
I'm just working with what I have the
three<00:02:23.220> bundles<00:02:23.490> were<00:02:26.360> 145<00:02:27.360> dollars<00:02:27.750> and

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
three bundles were 145 dollars and

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.680 
three bundles were 145 dollars and
fifteen<00:02:28.350> cents<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:28.860> when<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.130> got<00:02:29.520> them<00:02:29.820> they

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
fifteen cents and when I got them they

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.930 
fifteen cents and when I got them they
were<00:02:30.750> about<00:02:31.590> aliexpress<00:02:32.250> was<00:02:32.370> having<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.700> sale

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
were about aliexpress was having a sale

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.780 
were about aliexpress was having a sale
and<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:34.380> closure<00:02:34.650> wasn't<00:02:35.100> on<00:02:35.160> sailboat<00:02:35.550> I

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
and the closure wasn't on sailboat I

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.480 
and the closure wasn't on sailboat I
guess<00:02:36.240> it's<00:02:36.600> like<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.200> not<00:02:38.040> even<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.250> hit<00:02:38.370> or<00:02:38.460> miss

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
guess it's like a not even a hit or miss

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.880 
guess it's like a not even a hit or miss
i<00:02:38.700> guess<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:38.970> depended<00:02:39.360> on<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.750> vendor<00:02:40.230> but

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
i guess it depended on the vendor but

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.800 
i guess it depended on the vendor but
they<00:02:41.310> were<00:02:41.370> having<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.000> back-to-school<00:02:42.360> sale

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
they were having a back-to-school sale

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.020 
they were having a back-to-school sale
and<00:02:43.020> i<00:02:43.050> believe<00:02:43.350> now<00:02:43.860> Aliexpress<00:02:44.640> is<00:02:44.760> having<00:02:45.000> a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
and i believe now Aliexpress is having a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.730 
and i believe now Aliexpress is having a
sale<00:02:45.210> they<00:02:45.870> always<00:02:46.080> have<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.230> sale<00:02:46.440> for<00:02:46.620> one

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
sale they always have a sale for one

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.860 
sale they always have a sale for one
reason<00:02:46.890> or<00:02:47.100> another<00:02:47.160> but<00:02:47.580> hey<00:02:48.090> I'm<00:02:48.690> not

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
reason or another but hey I'm not

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.210 
reason or another but hey I'm not
complaining<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.880> closure<00:02:51.300> was<00:02:51.740> 9880<00:02:52.740> it's

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
complaining so the closure was 9880 it's

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.740 
complaining so the closure was 9880 it's
a<00:02:53.430> 16<00:02:53.940> inch<00:02:55.160> Malaysian<00:02:56.160> body<00:02:56.550> wave<00:02:56.880> silk<00:02:57.510> base

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.730 
a 16 inch Malaysian body wave silk base
closure<00:02:58.190> like<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.310> said<00:02:59.370> before<00:02:59.580> um<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.390> think

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
closure like I said before um I think

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.060 
closure like I said before um I think
the<00:03:02.330> base<00:03:03.330> I<00:03:03.510> chose<00:03:03.750> was<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.080> little<00:03:04.530> too<00:03:04.770> light

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
the base I chose was a little too light

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.880 
the base I chose was a little too light
but<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.240> made<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.630> work<00:03:07.020> because<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.680> wasn't

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
but I made it work because I wasn't

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.560 
but I made it work because I wasn't
spending<00:03:08.280> money<00:03:08.610> on<00:03:08.700> another<00:03:08.970> one<00:03:09.240> I<00:03:09.270> can

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
spending money on another one I can

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.530 
spending money on another one I can
reuse<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.950> can<00:03:11.520> probably<00:03:11.730> die<00:03:12.270> this

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
reuse this and I can probably die this

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.810 
reuse this and I can probably die this
but<00:03:12.870> I'm<00:03:13.080> not<00:03:13.800> even<00:03:14.040> trying<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.370> mess<00:03:14.520> with<00:03:14.670> that

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
but I'm not even trying a mess with that

weeks<00:03:23.970> before<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:24.390> cut<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:25.040> didn't<00:03:26.040> cut<00:03:26.280> it

weeks before I cut it I didn't cut it

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.640 
weeks before I cut it I didn't cut it

worried<00:03:30.510> about<00:03:30.570> styling<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.410> just<00:03:31.590> wanted<00:03:31.800> to

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
worried about styling I just wanted to

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.100

throughout<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.530> school<00:03:34.769> year<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.780> after<00:03:36.780> a

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
throughout the school year and after a

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.500 
throughout the school year and after a
while<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.830> got<00:03:37.860> so<00:03:38.670> tired<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.330> length

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
while I got so tired of the length

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.580 
while I got so tired of the length
because<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.890> 20<00:03:41.250> inches<00:03:41.610> i'm<00:03:41.910> 5-4<00:03:42.750> so<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:43.200> 20

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
because the 20 inches i'm 5-4 so the 20

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.539 
because the 20 inches i'm 5-4 so the 20
inches<00:03:44.040> came<00:03:44.900> down<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.350> about<00:03:47.250> my<00:03:47.580> waist<00:03:48.330> and

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
inches came down to about my waist and

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.330 
inches came down to about my waist and
the<00:03:50.549> ends<00:03:50.820> of<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.030> 20<00:03:51.299> inches<00:03:51.600> so<00:03:52.590> well<00:03:53.100> I<00:03:53.160> was

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
the ends of the 20 inches so well I was

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.160 
the ends of the 20 inches so well I was
never<00:03:53.580> really<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.880> big<00:03:54.090> fan<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.269> it<00:03:54.510> but<00:03:54.660> so

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
never really a big fan of it but so

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.510 
never really a big fan of it but so
after<00:03:55.799> about
