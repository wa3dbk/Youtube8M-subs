probably the key product that helped me

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:07.820 
probably the key product that helped me
get<00:00:06.810> over<00:00:06.870> what<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.200> was<00:00:07.350> going<00:00:07.560> through

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
get over what I was going through

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.070 
get over what I was going through
it's<00:00:08.760> 100%<00:00:09.090> naturally<00:00:09.570> fermented<00:00:09.690> from

it's 100% naturally fermented from

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.660 
it's 100% naturally fermented from
molasses<00:00:10.500> what<00:00:10.679> glutamine<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.370> it's<00:00:11.580> a

molasses what glutamine is it's a

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.220 
molasses what glutamine is it's a
protein<00:00:12.000> it's<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.269> specific<00:00:12.480> protein<00:00:13.019> which<00:00:13.200> is

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
protein it's a specific protein which is

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.499 
protein it's a specific protein which is
in<00:00:13.469> your<00:00:13.590> body<00:00:13.769> your<00:00:14.309> body<00:00:14.340> muscles<00:00:15.120> stores<00:00:15.450> a

in your body your body muscles stores a

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.849 
in your body your body muscles stores a
lot<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.719> glutamine<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.139> think<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.350> about<00:00:16.470> 50%

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
lot of glutamine I think is about 50%

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.010 
lot of glutamine I think is about 50%
I've<00:00:17.670> heard<00:00:17.850> 10%<00:00:18.300> but<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.539> believe<00:00:18.840> for<00:00:18.960> my

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
I've heard 10% but I believe for my

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.620 
I've heard 10% but I believe for my
research<00:00:19.320> was<00:00:19.439> 50%<00:00:20.029> glutamine<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> number

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
research was 50% glutamine is the number

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.939 
research was 50% glutamine is the number
one<00:00:21.810> protein<00:00:22.109> that's<00:00:22.380> used<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.800> actually

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
one protein that's used to actually

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.950

every day your digestive tract lining is
being<00:00:26.910> redone<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.510> uses<00:00:27.660> glutamine<00:00:28.050> as<00:00:28.230> a

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
being redone and it uses glutamine as a

probably jumping way ahead of myself
right<00:00:41.040> now<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.430> um<00:00:43.010> glutamine<00:00:46.820> converts<00:00:47.820> in

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
right now but um glutamine converts in

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.860 
right now but um glutamine converts in
the<00:00:48.000> liver<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.360> most<00:00:48.510> powerful

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the liver to the most powerful

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.810 
the liver to the most powerful
antioxidant<00:00:49.500> which<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.800> glutathione<00:00:50.070> who<00:00:50.730> is

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
antioxidant which is glutathione who is

a thorn to buy is very very expensive
but<00:00:52.949> glutamine<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.059> three<00:00:56.329> proteins

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
but glutamine is one of three proteins

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.299 
but glutamine is one of three proteins
that<00:00:57.629> actually<00:00:57.899> break<00:00:58.320> convert<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.129> liver

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that actually break convert in the liver

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.709 
that actually break convert in the liver
to<00:00:59.550> glutathione<00:00:59.850> which<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> most

knew it worked I was back then all my

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.920 
knew it worked I was back then all my
energy<00:01:47.670> levels<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:48.030> just<00:01:48.210> ridiculous<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.840> I

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
energy levels was just ridiculous and I

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.600 
energy levels was just ridiculous and I
went<00:01:49.079> through<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.380> wise<00:01:49.530> because<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.979> took

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
went through that wise because I took

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.280 
went through that wise because I took
the<00:01:50.700> glutamine<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.090> within<00:01:51.540> days<00:01:51.780> my<00:01:52.049> energy

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
the glutamine and within days my energy

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.600 
the glutamine and within days my energy
level<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.530> bounced<00:01:52.890> straight<00:01:53.100> up<00:01:53.399> just

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
level just bounced straight up just

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.190 
level just bounced straight up just
instantly<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.540> I'm<00:01:54.689> talking<00:01:54.899> about<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.140> is

body's<00:02:06.600> got<00:02:06.750> plenty<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.020> glutamine<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.500> take

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
body's got plenty of glutamine so I take

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.800 
body's got plenty of glutamine so I take
extra<00:02:08.099> because<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.940> reality<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.360> under<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.660> lot

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
extra because the reality is under a lot

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.940 
extra because the reality is under a lot
of<00:02:09.840> stress<00:02:10.140> your<00:02:10.440> body<00:02:10.470> starts<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.890> break

of stress your body starts to break

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.910 
of stress your body starts to break
itself<00:02:11.340> down<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.790> manufacture<00:02:12.180> glutamine

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
itself down to manufacture glutamine

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.500 
itself down to manufacture glutamine
make<00:02:13.010> sense<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:13.970> don't<00:02:14.060> want<00:02:14.240> to<00:02:14.300> do<00:02:14.390> that

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
make sense so you don't want to do that

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.120 
make sense so you don't want to do that
you<00:02:14.660> want<00:02:14.810> actually<00:02:14.900> give<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.740> you<00:02:16.010> know

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
you want actually give it to it you know

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.280 
you want actually give it to it you know
in<00:02:16.400> orally<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:17.360> what<00:02:17.599> I<00:02:17.630> do<00:02:17.720> is<00:02:17.870> like<00:02:17.959> if<00:02:18.020> you

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290

I'm getting stressed challenged

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.839 
I'm getting stressed challenged
physically<00:02:22.130> in<00:02:22.220> any<00:02:22.280> way<00:02:22.459> I'll<00:02:22.670> actually

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
physically in any way I'll actually

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.390 
physically in any way I'll actually
increase<00:02:23.390> my<00:02:23.569> dosage<00:02:23.780> of<00:02:23.959> glutamine<00:02:24.400> they've

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
increase my dosage of glutamine they've

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.740 
increase my dosage of glutamine they've
done<00:02:25.550> research<00:02:25.849> as<00:02:26.030> well<00:02:26.180> about<00:02:26.300> when<00:02:26.510> people

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
done research as well about when people

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.670 
done research as well about when people
go<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.989> hospital<00:02:27.110> they're<00:02:27.470> trying<00:02:27.650> to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
go to a hospital they're trying to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.020 
go to a hospital they're trying to
recover<00:02:27.890> they<00:02:28.069> only<00:02:28.190> just<00:02:28.400> waste<00:02:28.580> away

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
recover they only just waste away

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.580 
recover they only just waste away
they<00:02:29.420> put<00:02:29.600> glutamine<00:02:29.930> in<00:02:30.050> their<00:02:30.170> serum<00:02:30.440> and

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
they put glutamine in their serum and

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.780 
they put glutamine in their serum and
they<00:02:30.650> actually<00:02:30.739> come<00:02:31.010> back<00:02:31.040> they<00:02:31.489> recover

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
they actually come back they recover

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.710 
they actually come back they recover
quicker<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.180> they<00:02:32.270> come<00:02:32.390> back<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.540> lot

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
quicker and they come back a lot

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.510 
quicker and they come back a lot
stronger<00:02:32.959> so<00:02:33.800> they<00:02:33.920> don't<00:02:34.069> actually<00:02:34.160> waste

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
stronger so they don't actually waste

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.949 
stronger so they don't actually waste
away<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:34.790> as<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.090> said<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.330> your<00:02:35.450> muscle<00:02:35.750> tissue
