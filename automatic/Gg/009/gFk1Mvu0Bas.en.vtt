00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.910
 hey people what it fix fix sincerely 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.050
 welcome to today's meppen has for 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.939
 the 27th 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.130
 as we saw in the last video 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.410
 the m 27 is an assault rifle with one 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.939
 quite good betrayed namely 720 shot 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.779
 per minute and a very high 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.369
 precision 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.230
 besides, she is the assault rifle with the 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.340
 best reload time so now 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.250
 bad I mean my favorite 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.870
 leave for the m27 so now we come 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.579
 to my first class that's a m 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.700
 27 classes with her very fast 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.010
 The M27 can react here, so to speak 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.600
 violence his art machines then namely 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.100
 comes very quickly in the visor by the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.449
 quick access and then you can too 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.370
 move that fast with the 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.839
 adjustable so you have 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.339
 actually the advantages of assad 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.809
 machines like and the range of one 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.230
 assault rifle, that's why it's pretty 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.600
 Well 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.699
 as an extra two skills and looters 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.839
 if you follow my videos more often 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.120
 then you will see that I am this one 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.860
 combination yes often through 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.510
 toughness spoils her less 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.100
 really a huge advantage is so 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.140
 I can not do much without tenacity 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.450
 and i am just feeling yours 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.820
 keep on ammo and that 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.130
 that would have to stop keks 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.390
 as an extra 3 I have agility because 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.860
 you then after the sprint 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.540
 can shoot faster from the hip 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.580
 then it could always brain immediately 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.960
 and then go for a sight then you have 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.190
 maybe the christian couple 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.110
 balls and have such an advantage 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.110
 against the opponent as a secondary weapon 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.400
 I have the day 45 dm 27 pretty fast 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.150
 that he is not a fast formally 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.980
 magazine 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.990
 but it is always good if you are 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.340
 nor a pistol while he still a 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.350
 point freedom you can have one 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.840
 grenade primarily a clock grenade den 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.610
 tower for the day 45 over so that one 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.980
 the next class and we have 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.600
 this class of the m 27 on distance 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.220
 If you are dissatisfied, I recommend 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.230
 always the magazine extension and the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.180
 Csu's target seeker could also be one 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.930
 another visitor will take a visitor 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.880
 Pretty cool 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.650
 the magazine further just so I 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.270
 in the remote duel not run out of ammunition 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.520
 You may wonder why I am 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.050
 with the 27 sometimes on the distance 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.239
 but that's because they are indeed 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.250
 not such a huge range but has 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.560
 the beginning is an enormous precision 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.150
 You can really benefit with it 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.709
 through the brain and the weapon pulls 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.440
 anyway I and we can do well 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.450
 that dance as extra the hardliner 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.640
 is extra 20 degrees and founder of the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.560
 extra wide tactics mask so that stop 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.360
 not so great would admit so as 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.460
 Secondary weapon some gun me 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.810
 Recommend the rocks or the day 5 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.070
 When I do the cross-country skiing that way 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.030
 Do not lose your damage so quickly 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.950
 and so must have been as primary for 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.750
 any pistol i recommend for that 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.300
 long run is also possible with day 45 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.980
 very good that should always try 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.660
 if somebody from somehow um 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.370
 you walk around or come from behind 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.650
 could always be quick with yours 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.690
 pistol still now first normal 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.420
 M27 let that be with a glass with the 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.370
 silencers your reflex visor 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.020
 I do not want it all in the 27 so 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.280
 great if you like that then you can 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.600
 the flex as well as easy 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.120
 omit something else 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.070
 But I choose good geisa 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.750
 seen with her radar at a drone 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.180
 As always, become tenacious and plunderer 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.080
 and says what's up there could do that too 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.870
 take another 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.580
 rather grenade and secondary weapon 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.100
 I could vary what you have here now 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.140
 could have wanted a tower on 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.660
 Do the secondary weapon or inform 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.770
 garnet or 2 tactics garnets 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.410
 any case you can choose 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.330
 so the second and last normal class 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.780
 the m 27 is back on the road 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.790
 visor 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.740
 as already stated, the particular part so 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.970
 nice and fast pull handle that way 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.170
 Are you really fast back in 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.790
 Visor and then have one more 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.010
 nice clear visor that's you 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.510
 can always be more beautiful than extra 1 again 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.250
 hard land extra time looters 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.870
 toughness and as an extra 3 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.430
 extreme conditions make it easy 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.840
 always nice but can be in the opponent 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.430
 When we can do more, I could 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.260
 Something recommends second recommend 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.690
 I can give you the mp grenade how, firstly 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.760
 friendly equipment will destroy you 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.530
 could with an emp grenades can you 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.000
 So destroy a protected guardian 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.440
 this really pretty much died and 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.570
 besides, hardly any opponent is against it 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.190
 turned around because hardly any one almost wired 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.810
 and so you can always see if 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.820
 the enemy near there is the npd 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.560
 also has a very high range 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.880
 and even walk through walls if 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.410
 the opponent then is near then 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.390
 Can you already go to the visor since 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.740
 prepared remark so at the end of the 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.090
 I would like to ask something more videos 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.950
 namely you would like me to still have 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.440
 a new series makes the net live 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.030
 comments I'm doing a live 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.380
 comments most likely in 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.960
 free for all or so because I like that 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.520
 at the moment I like playing and jan im 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.140
 then live on and comments that 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.700
 then live if you feel like it 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.310
 then write me in the comments 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.360
 if not then write best too 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.770
 in the comments 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.270
 So I know that you do not 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.280
 wanted because the channel only for tips and 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.690
 tricks or so subscribed to can 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.280
 I also understand and if it is you 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.390
 it does not matter then it just does not write anything 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.770
 in the comments 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.770
 that 's it then on today has reinhold
