the<00:01:35.640> best<00:01:35.820> way<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:35.970> putting<00:01:36.270> it

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the best way of putting it

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.330

why<00:02:59.849> they<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.209> it<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.630> mean<00:03:01.170> it's<00:03:01.319> fun<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.680> use

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
why they have it I mean it's fun to use

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.430 
why they have it I mean it's fun to use
but<00:03:02.000> as<00:03:03.000> far<00:03:03.239> as<00:03:03.390> being<00:03:03.540> accurate<00:03:04.140> because

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
but as far as being accurate because

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.229 
but as far as being accurate because
like<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.680> bullet<00:03:04.920> drops<00:03:05.190> off<00:03:05.459> which<00:03:05.760> makes<00:03:06.120> it

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
like the bullet drops off which makes it

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.479 
like the bullet drops off which makes it
all<00:03:06.359> suck<00:03:06.690> but<00:03:07.049> I<00:03:07.470> don't<00:03:08.100> know<00:03:08.160> it's<00:03:08.310> fun<00:03:08.459> a

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
all suck but I don't know it's fun a

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.699 
all suck but I don't know it's fun a
nice<00:03:08.670> rhyme<00:03:08.910> with<00:03:09.290> yeah<00:03:10.290> I've<00:03:10.410> been<00:03:10.560> actually

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
nice rhyme with yeah I've been actually

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.360 
nice rhyme with yeah I've been actually
playing<00:03:11.370> Crysis<00:03:12.150> 2<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:13.079> game<00:03:13.260> came<00:03:13.470> out<00:03:13.530> and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
playing Crysis 2 that game came out and

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.300 
playing Crysis 2 that game came out and
I<00:03:14.910> really<00:03:15.239> like<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.630> game<00:03:15.840> because<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:17.100> can

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
I really like that game because you can

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.490 
I really like that game because you can
jump<00:03:17.609> up<00:03:17.700> people<00:03:18.030> with<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.239> shotgun<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.989> it's

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
jump up people with a shotgun and it's

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.199 
jump up people with a shotgun and it's
actually<00:03:19.890> a<00:03:19.920> good<00:03:20.069> strategy<00:03:20.640> like<00:03:20.819> you<00:03:20.940> can<00:03:21.120> go

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
actually a good strategy like you can go

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.509 
actually a good strategy like you can go
a<00:03:21.420> low<00:03:21.569> jumping<00:03:21.959> atom<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.769> there's<00:03:23.250> like<00:03:23.400> this

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
a low jumping atom and there's like this

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.319 
a low jumping atom and there's like this
a<00:03:23.760> 12<00:03:24.239> style<00:03:24.510> shotgun<00:03:25.049> in<00:03:25.140> there<00:03:25.350> but<00:03:26.069> uh<00:03:26.329> like

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
a 12 style shotgun in there but uh like

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.870 
a 12 style shotgun in there but uh like
if<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.870> do<00:03:28.079> it<00:03:28.230> full<00:03:28.440> auto<00:03:28.650> it's<00:03:29.220> like<00:03:29.430> garbage

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
if you do it full auto it's like garbage

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.610 
if you do it full auto it's like garbage
but<00:03:30.150> if<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.299> do<00:03:30.450> single<00:03:30.870> fire<00:03:31.019> it's<00:03:31.290> way<00:03:31.590> more

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
but if you do single fire it's way more

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.400 
but if you do single fire it's way more
powerful<00:03:31.980> for<00:03:32.670> some<00:03:32.910> reason<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.540> that's<00:03:34.230> a

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
powerful for some reason and that's a

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.720 
powerful for some reason and that's a
lot<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.620> fun<00:03:34.859> to<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.100> if<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.220> guys<00:03:35.310> want<00:03:35.549> to<00:03:35.609> see

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
lot of fun to it if you guys want to see

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.160 
lot of fun to it if you guys want to see
