your spawn beacon up there this is a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.470 
your spawn beacon up there this is a
great<00:00:42.960> location<00:00:43.410> rail<00:00:44.120> provide<00:00:45.120> surveillance

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
have explosives so for example you can

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.330 
have explosives so for example you can
