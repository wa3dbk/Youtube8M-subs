 channels I have faith that we are not 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.280
 running a movie to send a flip is good 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.340
 You know how to send a ball and that it goes 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.060
 facilitate the use is the position of the faithful to 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.699
 sac pay more from back on tip have and 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.420
 the front foot and three fingers behind the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.939
 bolt is to put the baths 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.849
 diagonal is easier woman makes 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.489
 beautiful I distrust flip and do 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.719
 those that they direct and not into well 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.750
 for her to leave she will hit the bug that goes 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.110
 creating the foot this part is very important 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.760
 that this flip does not turn to the semifinal 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.700
 well will you kick in the cap? 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.190
 and remember to walk diagonally then you 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.629
 get in the foot and kick him 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.059
 Off the galley 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.070
 lean foot it is important to 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.969
 I do not go out, some people have a 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.760
 mistake of wanting to kick the ie8 as soon as 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.489
 is right in front so do not 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.369
 forget kicking out giving 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.549
 birth 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.939
 over time you will arrive at the program 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.530
 he was in the air but did not start picking 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.650
 ground floor 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.439
 know that the people and for you to start 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.659
 drag you think more or less here 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.439
 hit marked because so fifa goes 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.310
 turn straight and do not repeat when you 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.009
 kick 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.340
 not because I saw you raise your back foot because 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:39.399
 otherwise go back he can hit me 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.200
 so you hurt me when he climbed 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.119
 like flip 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.840
 you raise that little baby up 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.810
 to drop that's it, I thought the most 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.740
 common these are you come to an end 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.509
 and so go a little afoito 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.759
 this is because it is time to adapt a 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.000
 flip some game on your computer 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.069
 queue together so you can train 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.009
 holding on to one as it may help 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.899
 should also fall with the front foot with 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.650
 the son the father brings him to it 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:14.319
 automatically the site so that it 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.599
 already fell basically and you with time 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.650
 things can drop basic stresses in 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.980
 plates 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.340
 the other in holy faith you and kick the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.620
 clip and kicked felipe conflict begins to 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.840
 Turn you go out again 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.590
 This means you 're not helping. 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.880
 Son out but it's not gone that 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.609
 so it does not mean that you are 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.400
 sucking clip and when it starts to 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:46.329
 want to take you pull defeat and 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.519
 the collation happens so the doorman is a 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:54.310
 afraid to stay on top so you end up 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:55.660
 having gone back there and ending up falling or 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.950
 so to pretend 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:03.690
 flip the maneuver looks dangerous but she 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.690

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.720

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.940
 teacher peb i am apl in hessen 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.690

 I liked it a lot, thanks my friend. 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.390
 the main one was the case of the 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.070
 news from the left channel and not 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.180
