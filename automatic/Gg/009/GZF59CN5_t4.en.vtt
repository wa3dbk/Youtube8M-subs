00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
their first five games so maybe they

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.500 
their first five games so maybe they
deserve<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.920> break<00:00:56.129> do<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.730> give<00:00:56.910> them<00:00:57.059> once<00:00:57.270> I

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.380 
new goalkeeper to push aah bhi aati and
instead<00:01:17.100> they<00:01:17.250> picked<00:01:17.430> up<00:01:17.549> kakad<00:01:17.880> mantri

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390

which as much as I love kakad didn't

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.429 
which as much as I love kakad didn't
make<00:01:20.640> much<00:01:20.820> sense<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.420> know<00:01:21.810> they've<00:01:22.049> had<00:01:22.229> some

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
