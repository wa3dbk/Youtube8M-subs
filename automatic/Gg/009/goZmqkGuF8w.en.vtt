going to go ahead and plug this in and

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.150 
going to go ahead and plug this in and
you<00:00:15.719> won't<00:00:15.900> be<00:00:16.020> able<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.350> see<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.710> because<00:00:17.010> I'm

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
you won't be able to see it because I'm

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.529 
you won't be able to see it because I'm
going<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.310> hold<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.760> right<00:00:17.789> up<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.420> this

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
going to hold it right up to this

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.500 
going to hold it right up to this
camcorders<00:00:19.320> microphone<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.430> hopefully<00:00:21.029> you

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
camcorders microphone so hopefully you

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.529 
camcorders microphone so hopefully you
can<00:00:21.750> hear<00:00:22.230> what<00:00:22.769> kind<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.100> weird<00:00:23.640> sounds<00:00:24.330> this

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
can hear what kind of weird sounds this

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.890 
can hear what kind of weird sounds this
se<00:00:24.840> makes<00:00:28.880> okay<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.910> think<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.390> are<00:00:30.449> all<00:00:30.689> able

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
se makes okay I think you are all able

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.190 
se makes okay I think you are all able
to<00:00:31.170> hear<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.870> definitely

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
to hear that so this is definitely

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.520 
to hear that so this is definitely
having<00:00:34.710> some<00:00:34.920> problem<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:36.079> starting<00:00:37.079> up<00:00:37.260> I

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
having some problem with starting up I

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.610 
having some problem with starting up I
mean<00:00:38.129> begins<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:39.030> run<00:00:39.329> then<00:00:39.930> something<00:00:40.440> goes

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
mean begins to run then something goes

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.580 
mean begins to run then something goes
wrong<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.370> detects<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.969> shuts<00:00:42.870> down<00:00:42.989> and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
wrong it detects that shuts down and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.540 
wrong it detects that shuts down and
starts<00:00:43.980> over<00:00:44.129> again<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:46.160> something<00:00:47.160> screwed

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
starts over again so something screwed

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.600 
starts over again so something screwed
up<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.840> let<00:00:49.500> me<00:00:49.590> go<00:00:49.770> ahead<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.309> try

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
up with this so let me go ahead and try

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.869 
up with this so let me go ahead and try
to<00:00:50.640> open<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.360> up<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.870> course<00:00:52.460> HP<00:00:53.460> does<00:00:53.699> not

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
to open this up of course HP does not

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.619 
to open this up of course HP does not
give<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.360> an<00:00:54.719> easy<00:00:54.930> way<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.829> or<00:00:56.820> no<00:00:57.120> screws

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
give you an easy way in or no screws

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.869 
give you an easy way in or no screws
under<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.230> label<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.949> will<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.670> cut

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
under this label you will have to cut

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.429 
under this label you will have to cut
this<00:01:00.059> open<00:01:01.190> so<00:01:02.190> let's<00:01:02.879> see<00:01:03.120> if<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.629> get<00:01:04.199> that

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
this open so let's see if I can get that

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.620 
this open so let's see if I can get that
done<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.360> case<00:01:06.600> cut<00:01:07.500> open

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
done and here we have the case cut open

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.390 
done and here we have the case cut open
was<00:01:09.630> intending<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.170> cut<00:01:10.530> all<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.770> way<00:01:11.040> around

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
was intending to cut all the way around

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.090 
was intending to cut all the way around
but<00:01:11.790> somehow<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.780> worked<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.590> way<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
but somehow it worked out this way and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.170 
but somehow it worked out this way and
yes<00:01:15.060> actually<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:16.409> too<00:01:16.470> bad<00:01:17.000> well<00:01:18.000> here

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
yes actually it's not too bad well here

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.120 
yes actually it's not too bad well here
we<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> power<00:01:18.750> supply<00:01:19.200> itself<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:20.009> you

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
we have the power supply itself as you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.469 
we have the power supply itself as you
can<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.869> quite<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.990> neat<00:01:22.350> little<00:01:22.530> device

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
can see it's quite a neat little device

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.700 
can see it's quite a neat little device
nicely<00:01:24.479> shielded<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.380> all<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:27.710> really

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
nicely shielded and all that really

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.550 
nicely shielded and all that really
going<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.130> say<00:01:29.990> this<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.740> nice<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:34.170> it

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
going to say this is a nice one but it

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.830 
going to say this is a nice one but it
doesn't<00:01:34.979> work<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:36.170> I'll<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:38.570> see<00:01:39.570> how<00:01:39.810> I

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
doesn't work so I'll have to see how I

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.350 
doesn't work so I'll have to see how I
can<00:01:40.200> get<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.560> shielding<00:01:41.369> off<00:01:41.549> there<00:01:41.850> should

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
can get this shielding off there should

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.550 
can get this shielding off there should
just<00:01:42.390> pull<00:01:42.960> apart<00:01:43.670> at<00:01:44.670> least<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.149> theory<00:01:45.560> let's

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
just pull apart at least in theory let's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.569 
just pull apart at least in theory let's
see<00:01:46.890> what<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.880> hiding<00:01:48.570> under<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.460> here<00:01:50.460> we

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
see what is hiding under that here we

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.200 
see what is hiding under that here we
have<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.000> power<00:01:51.329> supply<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:52.020> taken<00:01:52.470> apart<00:01:52.560> and

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
have the power supply or taken apart and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.179 
have the power supply or taken apart and
you<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.240> see<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:54.960> got<00:01:55.170> quite<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.740> bit<00:01:55.979> of

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
you can see we got quite a bit of

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.039 
you can see we got quite a bit of
shielding<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.270> quite<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.719> bit<00:01:57.930> of

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
shielding and quite a bit of

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.649 
shielding and quite a bit of
installation<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.790> was<00:01:59.939> quite<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> job

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
installation going on it was quite a job

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.139 
installation going on it was quite a job
disassembling<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:03.030> then

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
disassembling this and then

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.679 
disassembling this and then
unfortunately<00:02:03.509> they<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.259> all<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.680> this

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
unfortunately they have all this this

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.990 
unfortunately they have all this this
crap<00:02:06.689> over<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:08.090> also<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.660> side<00:02:10.280> now<00:02:11.280> what

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
crap over it also on this side now what

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.020 
crap over it also on this side now what
I<00:02:12.030> initially

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
I initially

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.270 
I initially
he<00:02:13.120> did<00:02:13.330> was<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:14.020> took<00:02:14.080> out<00:02:14.500> these<00:02:14.709> output

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
he did was I took out these output

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.370 
he did was I took out these output
capacitors<00:02:15.910> because<00:02:16.120> usually<00:02:16.420> those<00:02:16.810> go<00:02:17.140> bad

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
capacitors because usually those go bad

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.720 
capacitors because usually those go bad
and<00:02:17.680> then<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.920> whole<00:02:18.100> thing<00:02:18.370> doesn't<00:02:18.550> work

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
and then the whole thing doesn't work

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.020 
and then the whole thing doesn't work
anymore<00:02:19.350> but<00:02:20.350> they<00:02:20.680> actually<00:02:20.950> tested<00:02:21.730> good

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
anymore but they actually tested good

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.480 
anymore but they actually tested good
and<00:02:22.330> they<00:02:22.450> are<00:02:22.480> if<00:02:23.290> I'm<00:02:23.470> not<00:02:23.620> mistaken<00:02:24.160> those

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
and they are if I'm not mistaken those

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.030 
and they are if I'm not mistaken those
are<00:02:24.819> actually<00:02:25.390> some<00:02:25.630> brand<00:02:25.900> name<00:02:26.260> capacitors

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
are actually some brand name capacitors

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.900 
are actually some brand name capacitors
so<00:02:28.709> shouldn't<00:02:29.709> have<00:02:30.010> any<00:02:30.160> problems<00:02:30.670> with

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
so shouldn't have any problems with

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.970 
so shouldn't have any problems with
those<00:02:31.200> at<00:02:32.200> least<00:02:32.410> not<00:02:32.800> yet<00:02:33.780> well<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:35.290> finally

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
those at least not yet well it finally

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.059 
those at least not yet well it finally
turned<00:02:36.340> out<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.700> be<00:02:36.850> a<00:02:37.090> problem<00:02:37.780> well<00:02:38.319> I<00:02:38.650> did<00:02:38.860> I

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
turned out to be a problem well I did I

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.760 
turned out to be a problem well I did I
took<00:02:39.220> some<00:02:39.550> measurements<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.540> was<00:02:41.530> just

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
took some measurements and I was just

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.729 
took some measurements and I was just
reading<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.220> dead<00:02:42.430> short<00:02:42.850> between<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
reading a dead short between the the

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.860 
reading a dead short between the the
output<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.280> ground<00:02:45.390> was<00:02:46.390> like<00:02:46.600> you<00:02:46.750> know

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
output and ground was like you know

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.229 
output and ground was like you know
point<00:02:47.230> 4<00:02:47.590> ohms<00:02:47.830> or<00:02:48.160> something<00:02:48.580> like<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.970> so

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
point 4 ohms or something like that so

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.420 
point 4 ohms or something like that so
obviously<00:02:49.420> power<00:02:50.410> supply<00:02:50.860> is<00:02:50.920> not<00:02:51.130> going<00:02:51.340> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
obviously power supply is not going to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.400 
obviously power supply is not going to
start<00:02:51.700> up<00:02:51.880> successfully<00:02:52.300> with<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.019> kind<00:02:53.320> of

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
start up successfully with that kind of

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.360 
start up successfully with that kind of
a<00:02:53.620> load<00:02:54.220> on<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:55.290> well<00:02:56.290> eventually<00:02:57.160> the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
a load on it and well eventually the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.890 
a load on it and well eventually the
problem<00:02:57.819> turned<00:02:58.060> out<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.360> be<00:02:58.450> much<00:02:58.630> easier

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
problem turned out to be much easier

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.870 
problem turned out to be much easier
than<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.500> expected<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:01.980> actually<00:03:02.980> much<00:03:03.280> much

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
than I expected and actually much much

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.809 
than I expected and actually much much
more<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.630> much<00:03:05.350> more<00:03:05.590> of<00:03:05.769> a<00:03:05.860> problem<00:03:06.220> than<00:03:06.550> I

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
more of a much more of a problem than I

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.490 
more of a much more of a problem than I
expected<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:08.500> problem<00:03:09.069> to<00:03:09.400> repair<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:10.350> cable<00:03:11.350> has

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
expected a problem to repair a cable has

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.190 
expected a problem to repair a cable has
a<00:03:11.530> short<00:03:11.950> in<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.280> now<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.480> kind<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.810> surprised

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
a short in it now it kind of surprised

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.020 
a short in it now it kind of surprised
me<00:03:14.440> because<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:14.980> look<00:03:15.250> at<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.850> cable

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
me because it a look at the the cable

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.720 
me because it a look at the the cable
really<00:03:16.480> didn't<00:03:16.720> look<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:17.019> be<00:03:17.140> in<00:03:17.230> too<00:03:17.560> bad<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.459> a

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
really didn't look to be in too bad of a

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.569 
really didn't look to be in too bad of a
shape<00:03:19.380> but<00:03:20.380> there<00:03:20.590> must<00:03:20.950> be<00:03:21.130> a<00:03:21.160> short

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
shape but there must be a short

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.310 
shape but there must be a short
somewhere<00:03:22.030> in<00:03:22.299> this<00:03:22.510> piece<00:03:22.989> now<00:03:23.769> I<00:03:23.799> did<00:03:24.130> find<00:03:24.549> a

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
somewhere in this piece now I did find a

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.350 
somewhere in this piece now I did find a
part<00:03:26.320> where<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.920> insulation<00:03:27.400> was<00:03:27.760> damaged<00:03:28.239> so

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
part where the insulation was damaged so

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.670 
part where the insulation was damaged so
you<00:03:28.600> could<00:03:28.870> see<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:30.030> shielding<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.209> ground

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.550 

but<00:03:35.680> so<00:03:36.549> I<00:03:36.720> finally<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:37.750> said<00:03:38.140> well<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:38.530> know

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
but so I finally I said well you know

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.410 
but so I finally I said well you know
you<00:03:38.739> ain't<00:03:39.100> going<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.340> be<00:03:39.400> fixing<00:03:39.910> this<00:03:40.060> if<00:03:40.299> you

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
you ain't going to be fixing this if you

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.920 
you ain't going to be fixing this if you
don't<00:03:40.660> if<00:03:41.350> you<00:03:41.560> don't<00:03:41.590> do<00:03:42.250> it<00:03:42.489> so<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:42.820> just<00:03:43.390> cut

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
don't if you don't do it so I just cut

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.440 
don't if you don't do it so I just cut
the<00:03:44.109> cable<00:03:44.530> right<00:03:44.769> where<00:03:45.100> at<00:03:45.340> damage<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.390> the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
the cable right where at damage and the

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.970 
the cable right where at damage and the
insulation<00:03:47.200> was<00:03:47.440> but<00:03:47.769> I<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:50.500> must<00:03:50.799> be

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
insulation was but I it must be

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.960 
insulation was but I it must be
somewhere<00:03:51.370> in<00:03:51.519> here<00:03:51.549> so<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.150> actually<00:03:53.190> yeah<00:03:54.190> cut

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
somewhere in here so I actually yeah cut

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.440 
somewhere in here so I actually yeah cut
out<00:03:55.090> quite<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:55.480> piece<00:03:55.840> of<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:56.290> cable

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
out quite a piece of the cable

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.870 
out quite a piece of the cable
unnecessarily<00:03:58.560> unfortunately<00:03:59.560> but<00:03:59.739> well<00:04:00.459> you

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
unnecessarily unfortunately but well you

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.650 
unnecessarily unfortunately but well you
know<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.030> do<00:04:01.480> have<00:04:01.600> a<00:04:01.870> bit<00:04:02.079> of<00:04:02.200> a<00:04:02.320> length<00:04:02.590> left<00:04:03.010> so

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
know I do have a bit of a length left so

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.110 
know I do have a bit of a length left so
that's<00:04:04.660> ok<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:05.470> this<00:04:05.769> does<00:04:06.160> not<00:04:06.190> have<00:04:06.640> a<00:04:06.670> short

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
that's ok and this does not have a short

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.229 
that's ok and this does not have a short
in<00:04:07.299> it<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:08.739> I<00:04:09.190> guess<00:04:09.549> what<00:04:09.820> I'm<00:04:09.910> just<00:04:10.030> going<00:04:10.209> to

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
in it so I guess what I'm just going to

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.650 
in it so I guess what I'm just going to
do<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:10.870> I'm<00:04:11.200> just<00:04:11.230> gonna<00:04:11.730> try<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.790> get<00:04:13.030> seen<00:04:13.329> the

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
do is I'm just gonna try to get seen the

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.490 
do is I'm just gonna try to get seen the
insulation<00:04:14.560> off<00:04:14.709> for<00:04:14.950> this<00:04:15.070> and<00:04:16.049> I'll<00:04:17.049> try

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
insulation off for this and I'll try

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.520 
insulation off for this and I'll try
solder<00:04:18.310> it<00:04:18.519> back<00:04:18.549> in<00:04:19.030> just<00:04:19.299> wanted<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.320> show

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
solder it back in just wanted to show

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.500 
solder it back in just wanted to show
you<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:20.709> cable<00:04:21.489> as<00:04:21.609> you<00:04:21.669> can<00:04:21.940> see<00:04:22.120> it's<00:04:22.300> a

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
you that cable as you can see it's a

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.000 
you that cable as you can see it's a
double<00:04:23.580> shielded<00:04:24.580> deal<00:04:25.180> we<00:04:26.080> got

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
double shielded deal we got

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.570 
double shielded deal we got
ground<00:04:27.610> has<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.360> outer<00:04:28.540> ceiling<00:04:29.380> then<00:04:30.220> we<00:04:30.370> got

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
ground has the outer ceiling then we got

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.340 
ground has the outer ceiling then we got
the<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:32.200> operating<00:04:32.830> voltage<00:04:33.010> as<00:04:34.170> the<00:04:35.170> inner

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
the the operating voltage as the inner

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.290 
the the operating voltage as the inner
ceiling<00:04:35.980> and<00:04:36.100> then<00:04:36.250> in<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.640> center<00:04:36.940> we

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
ceiling and then in the center we

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.740 
ceiling and then in the center we
finally<00:04:37.780> have<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.050> line<00:04:38.500> marked<00:04:39.040> ID<00:04:39.730> that's<00:04:40.510> of

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
finally have a line marked ID that's of

HP product so this is going to be one of
those<00:04:52.300> deals<00:04:52.690> were<00:04:53.430> your<00:04:54.430> generic<00:04:55.140> universal

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
those deals were your generic universal

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.270 
those deals were your generic universal

anyway

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
anyway

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.150 
anyway
I<00:05:00.520> have<00:05:01.090> to<00:05:01.320> insulate<00:05:02.320> this<00:05:02.530> a<00:05:02.590> little<00:05:02.890> bit

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
I have to insulate this a little bit

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.150 
I have to insulate this a little bit
then<00:05:04.120> I<00:05:04.270> can<00:05:04.450> solder<00:05:04.810> that<00:05:05.140> back<00:05:05.380> in<00:05:05.710> and<00:05:05.950> I

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
then I can solder that back in and I

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.970 
then I can solder that back in and I
don't<00:05:06.850> know<00:05:06.940> what<00:05:07.090> I'm<00:05:07.180> gonna<00:05:07.330> do<00:05:07.690> for<00:05:08.500> strain

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
don't know what I'm gonna do for strain

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.680 
don't know what I'm gonna do for strain
relief<00:05:09.490> well<00:05:10.300> I<00:05:11.010> guess<00:05:12.010> it's<00:05:12.910> just<00:05:13.060> not<00:05:13.510> going

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
relief well I guess it's just not going

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.790 
relief well I guess it's just not going
to<00:05:13.750> be<00:05:13.960> any<00:05:14.490> I'll<00:05:15.490> just<00:05:15.700> be<00:05:15.850> careful<00:05:16.360> with<00:05:16.510> it

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
to be any I'll just be careful with it

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.650 
to be any I'll just be careful with it
well<00:05:17.800> that<00:05:18.220> sure<00:05:18.520> doesn't<00:05:18.820> look<00:05:19.060> pretty<00:05:19.330> but

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
well that sure doesn't look pretty but

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.860 
well that sure doesn't look pretty but
it<00:05:19.990> does<00:05:20.260> work<00:05:20.830> believe<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.550> or<00:05:21.580> not<00:05:21.870> just

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
it does work believe it or not just

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.410 
it does work believe it or not just
measure<00:05:23.140> it<00:05:23.380> and<00:05:23.830> I<00:05:23.920> do<00:05:23.980> have<00:05:24.400> my<00:05:24.430> 19<00:05:25.180> volts

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
measure it and I do have my 19 volts

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:31.980 
measure it and I do have my 19 volts
back<00:05:25.870> at<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:27.520> output<00:05:28.480> plug<00:05:30.180> so<00:05:31.180> now<00:05:31.390> I<00:05:31.420> can<00:05:31.810> put

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
back at the output plug so now I can put

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.460 
back at the output plug so now I can put
this<00:05:32.110> all<00:05:32.350> back<00:05:32.590> together<00:05:32.890> and<00:05:34.110> here<00:05:35.110> we<00:05:35.230> go

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
this all back together and here we go

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.490 
this all back together and here we go
the<00:05:36.070> final<00:05:36.850> test<00:05:37.530> got<00:05:38.530> this<00:05:38.770> back<00:05:39.610> together

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
the final test got this back together

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.490 
the final test got this back together
very<00:05:41.500> high-tech<00:05:41.920> looking<00:05:42.820> so<00:05:43.210> you<00:05:43.990> know<00:05:44.140> turn

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
very high-tech looking so you know turn

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.330 
very high-tech looking so you know turn
on<00:05:44.680> this<00:05:44.890> power<00:05:45.160> bar<00:05:45.750> this<00:05:46.950> should<00:05:47.950> start<00:05:48.280> up

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
on this power bar this should start up

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.310 
on this power bar this should start up
well<00:05:51.340> doesn't<00:05:52.060> seem<00:05:52.210> to<00:05:52.480> be<00:05:52.570> making<00:05:52.750> any<00:05:52.990> funny

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
well doesn't seem to be making any funny

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.100 
well doesn't seem to be making any funny
noises<00:05:54.900> let's<00:05:55.900> go<00:05:56.170> ahead<00:05:56.320> and<00:05:56.710> plug<00:05:57.130> it<00:05:57.280> in

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
noises let's go ahead and plug it in

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:05.370 
noises let's go ahead and plug it in
into<00:05:59.110> the<00:05:59.260> laptop<00:06:03.360> it's<00:06:04.360> not<00:06:04.510> doing<00:06:04.900> too<00:06:05.140> much

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
into the laptop it's not doing too much

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.730 
into the laptop it's not doing too much
don't<00:06:05.770> have<00:06:05.980> a<00:06:06.010> battery<00:06:06.580> in<00:06:06.760> it<00:06:06.880> so<00:06:07.740> probably

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
don't have a battery in it so probably

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:17.280 
don't have a battery in it so probably
won't<00:06:09.130> so<00:06:09.610> see<00:06:10.360> if<00:06:10.480> this<00:06:10.690> turns<00:06:11.680> on<00:06:16.290> it's

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
won't so see if this turns on it's

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.950 
won't so see if this turns on it's
probably<00:06:17.710> not<00:06:17.860> going<00:06:18.070> to<00:06:18.130> start<00:06:18.490> up<00:06:18.790> oh<00:06:19.030> it

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
probably not going to start up oh it

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.960 
probably not going to start up oh it
does<00:06:20.280> what<00:06:21.280> do<00:06:21.430> you<00:06:21.550> know<00:06:21.730> this<00:06:22.030> normally<00:06:22.960> has

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
does what do you know this normally has

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.270 
does what do you know this normally has
quite<00:06:24.970> a<00:06:25.000> few<00:06:25.390> problems<00:06:25.450> of<00:06:26.080> its<00:06:26.200> own<00:06:26.470> but<00:06:26.860> all

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
quite a few problems of its own but all

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.230 
quite a few problems of its own but all
there<00:06:27.550> it<00:06:27.700> goes

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
there it goes

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.860 
there it goes
nevermind<00:06:30.690> yes<00:06:31.690> that<00:06:32.410> is<00:06:33.060> from<00:06:34.060> a<00:06:34.090> ThinkPad

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
nevermind yes that is from a ThinkPad

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.200 
nevermind yes that is from a ThinkPad
that's<00:06:35.290> not<00:06:35.530> original

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
that's not original

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.390 
that's not original
so<00:06:37.750> I<00:06:38.199> guess<00:06:39.960> judging<00:06:40.960> by<00:06:41.139> how<00:06:41.500> Windows<00:06:42.009> is

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
so I guess judging by how Windows is

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:50.189 
so I guess judging by how Windows is
starting<00:06:43.030> up<00:06:44.610> this<00:06:45.610> is<00:06:47.039> fixed<00:06:48.660> with<00:06:49.660> the<00:06:49.990> one

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 
starting up this is fixed with the one

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:52.050 
starting up this is fixed with the one
exception<00:06:50.380> that<00:06:50.979> I<00:06:51.099> will<00:06:51.340> have<00:06:51.550> to<00:06:51.580> be<00:06:51.819> very

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
exception that I will have to be very

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.170 
exception that I will have to be very
careful<00:06:52.630> about<00:06:52.750> that<00:06:53.199> because<00:06:53.460> obviously<00:06:54.460> if

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
careful about that because obviously if

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.210 
careful about that because obviously if
you<00:06:55.300> pull<00:06:55.599> on<00:06:55.780> it<00:06:55.810> it's<00:06:56.289> just<00:06:56.560> gonna<00:06:56.710> rip<00:06:56.979> out

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
you pull on it it's just gonna rip out

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.779 
you pull on it it's just gonna rip out
and<00:06:57.729> then<00:06:58.030> it's<00:06:58.210> not<00:06:58.360> gonna<00:06:58.569> work<00:06:58.810> anymore

00:06:59.779 --> 00:06:59.789 
and then it's not gonna work anymore

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:04.140 
and then it's not gonna work anymore
well<00:07:01.530> thanks<00:07:02.530> for<00:07:02.650> watching<00:07:03.130> and<00:07:03.400> see<00:07:04.000> you

that power supply being broken well I

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.770 
that power supply being broken well I
got<00:07:14.949> it<00:07:15.070> along<00:07:15.310> with<00:07:15.520> this<00:07:15.639> docking<00:07:16.180> station
