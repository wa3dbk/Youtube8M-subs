00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:07.090
 Yes English 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.560
 How to get in touch with women on the horizon 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.310
 It has come the question of 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.970
 That's right 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:22.260
 I was able to get along with the woman I really liked 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:28.289
 In such a case, if it was accidentally separated from this baby 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:34.320
 I say as Dekirukana back together I feel like say to that reuniting prevention 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:37.170
 So that should make the insurance that you can keep yourself and women in the environment that can back together 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.530
 It is an image 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.680
 Ogura I actually do myself well 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.250
 Speaking of that, simply speaking 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.160
 Hmmm 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.250
 Given 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.190
 She 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:58.930
 How is there a view of the world, including around this view of the world 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.860
 I 'm sharing it, for example, but a couple of friends 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.770
 I wonder Then double date 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:11.900
 Get along well with the girl and get a version exchange 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:13.800
 In the unlikely event that there is a problem with her and it comes to parting with that woman's side 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.890
 Or convey the message 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:22.570
 Do you have me read it ? 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.840
 I am asked to have a meal, so I just make so many contacts 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:30.550
 Well, I'm doing well by myself 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:36.280
 It Well good in a strange place there you'll ne, for example, taverns of the Wai Wai to good but bad 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:42.560
 I have a group that I have a good relationship with, but I can not help putting it in that group 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.180
 It feels like it's weird I wonder if it 's the first time between men who exchange people back there 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.350
 Huh 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.030
 Let's talk about Bangkok without mixi and facebook 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:55.680
 When you get connected 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:02:00.210
 In the unlikely event that she and I have separated 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.610
 Nde Nde when it becomes everyone in facebook are connected 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.000
 Is it easy to get me a message? 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.130
 Last year's reunion is myself 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.160
 To the card 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:18.020
 Including sleep around as the first opportunity I First than go over the approach 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.810
 There is also a part that it is easy to do if you get support 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.420
 Of course hey again 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:31.110
 I also reunited with a simple sound 2 that the Tteyuu 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.489
 N Yeah I think I'm hard to me that I'd such can be written in kanji quite unexpectedly reunited 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.800
 Excuse me 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:42.680
 Speaking in a variety I Futari or couple 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.610
 I mean what is she and yourself has been cultivated has become what that something was broken because of 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.450
 Ne 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.290
 I break up and break up 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:55.350
 Or what has been cultivated 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:03:00.300
 Because I was not able to build a solid foundation, I will fall into place with some weight 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:03.420
 It is human relationship memory to say specifically what is this cultivated thing 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.720
 It 's a part like God 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.260
 If the foundation of maa is not firm, always 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.400
 Human relationships are basically no matter what 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.020
 What 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:19.560
 It is easy to crush 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:24.239
 In but I do not credit and Well easy to say I wish love amazing that this person around 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.250
 I was thinking that I would say that I did not have that credit somewhere when something happened 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:32.849
 Right 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:36.420
 So basically even though I know so first human relationships back together it is only this can absolutely trust 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:41.550
 I do not that it is not solved even migrate the point like a 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.260
 In that it only crawling say part of you is I have done it myself if put in with me 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.740
 Anyway fun 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.240
 Yup 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:51.590
 I'm just tired 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:54.830
 Here too I am absolutely against myself 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.070
 It in and I is the part that is placed a partial decision 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:04.460
 I also made a part that I do not trust 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:07.230
 It Toka It does not occur suddenly I guess that there is no router Toka Dasa slovenly, for example, in time 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.530
 Credit there is no minute is a common sleep Toka I like that part 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.800
 I'm making yeah 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.710
 In that well in light of the kind of part 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:22.049
 Well she said she had fallen apart 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:25.440
 It is not good to say how to approach when you have left 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.680
 It was fun to say my own 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:33.900
 It is no use to say at the time of partial partial reciprocity 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:37.300
 Than I Do was Re bad parts that somehow say Oh when you are going to Nefen 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:42.440
 Toka It was fun doing what I heard DoCoMo DoCoMo 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:45.180
 I wonder if it is properly in the drawer as a memory 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.820
 Sue in emotional part 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:53.190
 For example I would like to ask this way 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:57.720
 This is a treble I think that I've been wrong is bad 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:03.360
 I think this part was missing but I think I will do this 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:08.730
 You won't understand unless you talk in Kansai about the part that you think 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:12.480
 Because love is basically neither a law nor a contract of that sort of thing 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.210
 You must establish the part where you want each other to be together 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.550
 In other words 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:25.300
 It's not a theory, for example, it 's a difficult story to go along with you 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:29.319
 Thus achieved that once I men difficult in Nde part of the feelings of Tteyuu is girls 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.449
 Standing and is fine Hey 1 loaf 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:34.840
 There is a possibility to reservoir 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:39.460
 A If you or go to the bother to read in the timing 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.650
 The state Tteyuu not resonate to say anything anymore because they cool that say I'm bad 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:46.490
 I am 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:53.810
 But it is a vessel in the part which says the memory in two strange moments 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:56.660
 Casual and moment near that time Daigo-kun if full of layers in the thought that say pretty if any vessel 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:01.640
 It's a moment to say something like this 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:03.760
 Nde several times with absolute is why human beings hobbling contact at the moment you do it at the time such 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:08.140
 If the timing just matches 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.800
 I would like to meet you , so there is a sense of distance I've always got along 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.729
 is 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.560
 For example, it What is 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:16.710
 A couple who met only once a week 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:21.360
 The frequency of contact is about once every 10 days 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:22.870
 So that you do not have a one-time chat if was of the have 23 days, or in about one every other day before 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.970
 Right 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.900
 If that is not the reuniting of the method according to the base to say that he has been dating What is your own 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:35.230
 Don't 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:37.690
 That is, First of all kind of part of that relationship the way of the women in on with a view roots back together 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:42.860
 Solidify the base part 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:45.669
 More likely it is very back if the firm is the base portion even when the ground is part 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.669
 It is part that is high 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.400
 that's all
