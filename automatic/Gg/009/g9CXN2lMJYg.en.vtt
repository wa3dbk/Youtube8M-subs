top awesome little box right here comes

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.310 
top awesome little box right here comes
equipped<00:00:17.279> with<00:00:17.460> an<00:00:17.850> ion<00:00:18.449> platform<00:00:18.720> package

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
equipped with an ion platform package

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.929 
equipped with an ion platform package
inside<00:00:19.650> if<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.130> don't<00:00:20.189> know<00:00:20.520> what<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.789> is

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
inside if you don't know what that is

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.259 
inside if you don't know what that is
it's<00:00:21.150> basically<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:22.730> 9400<00:00:23.730> mobile<00:00:24.029> chipset

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
it's basically a 9400 mobile chipset

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.939 
it's basically a 9400 mobile chipset
integrated<00:00:25.019> into<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> motherboard<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.890> you

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
integrated into the motherboard so you

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.800 
integrated into the motherboard so you
not<00:00:26.130> only<00:00:26.160> have<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.580> Atom<00:00:27.000> processor

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
not only have the Atom processor

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.050 
not only have the Atom processor
you<00:00:27.990> also<00:00:28.199> have<00:00:28.470> dedicated<00:00:28.710> graphics<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
you also have dedicated graphics on the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.080 
you also have dedicated graphics on the
board<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:31.140> technically<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:31.800> not<00:00:32.090> dedicated

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
board so technically it's not dedicated

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.970 
board so technically it's not dedicated
it's<00:00:33.239> actually<00:00:33.600> onboard<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.469> works<00:00:34.649> just

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
it's actually onboard but it works just

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.900 
it's actually onboard but it works just
the<00:00:35.040> same<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.370> gives<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> power<00:00:35.850> to

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
the same it gives you the power to

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.180 
the same it gives you the power to
decode<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.870> blu-ray<00:00:37.320> files<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> exact

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
decode to blu-ray files at the exact

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.319 
decode to blu-ray files at the exact
same<00:00:38.370> time<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.730> means<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.149> want<00:00:39.270> to

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
same time that means that if you want to

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.000 
same time that means that if you want to
use<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.989> home<00:00:40.230> theater<00:00:40.500> PC<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:40.890> not

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
same time now if you were to get a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.830

little<00:00:50.820> net<00:00:51.000> top<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.629> had<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
little net top like this that had the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.900 
little net top like this that had the
Atom<00:00:52.140> processor<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.829> try<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> play<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.460> with

Atom processor and try to play it with

the integrated graphics normally without
the<00:00:56.039> ion<00:00:56.340> platform<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.329> would<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:57.539> some

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the ion platform you would have some

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.299 
the ion platform you would have some
really<00:00:58.170> really<00:00:58.410> big<00:00:58.680> problems<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.129> video

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
really really big problems the video

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.459 
really really big problems the video
would<00:00:59.399> look<00:00:59.579> horrible<00:01:00.120> it'd<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.329> chunky<00:01:00.690> it

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
would look horrible it'd be chunky it

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.660 
would look horrible it'd be chunky it
would<00:01:01.590> artifact<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.190> would<00:01:02.280> look<00:01:02.370> terrible

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
would artifact it would look terrible

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.460 
would artifact it would look terrible
but<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.570> ion<00:01:03.840> platform<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.290> get<00:01:04.379> this

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
but with the ion platform you get this

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.350 
but with the ion platform you get this
incredible<00:01:05.220> amount<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.640> graphics

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
incredible amount of graphics

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.020 
incredible amount of graphics
performance<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:07.110> besides<00:01:07.920> having<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.310> ion

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
performance now besides having the ion

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.730 
performance now besides having the ion
package<00:01:09.420> which<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.630> basically<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.990> 9400<00:01:10.560> mobile

actually<00:01:13.650> got<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.040> Atom<00:01:14.400> 330<00:01:15.150> now<00:01:15.390> you've

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
actually got a Atom 330 now you've

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.179 
actually got a Atom 330 now you've
probably<00:01:15.750> heard<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> atom<00:01:16.470> 2<00:01:16.650> 7<00:01:17.040> or<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
probably heard of the atom 2 7 or the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.219 
probably heard of the atom 2 7 or the
n270<00:01:17.790> that's<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.150> single<00:01:18.330> core<00:01:18.659> 1.6

gigahertz Atem the 330 is actually just

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.510 
gigahertz Atem the 330 is actually just
about<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.290> same<00:01:22.500> chip<00:01:22.740> except<00:01:23.009> there's<00:01:23.280> two

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
about the same chip except there's two

about the same chip except there's two
of<00:01:23.670> them<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.000> dual<00:01:24.330> core<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.080> you're

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
of them it's a dual core so you're

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.530 
of them it's a dual core so you're
actually<00:01:25.290> getting<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.710> dual-core<00:01:26.540> 1.6

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540

starting<00:02:22.050> off<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.320> back<00:02:22.650> no<00:02:22.830> let's<00:02:23.010> start<00:02:23.130> in

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
starting off the back no let's start in

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.020 
starting off the back no let's start in
the<00:02:23.280> front<00:02:23.490> but<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.610> want<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.790> show<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
the front but I want to show you the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.160 
the front but I want to show you the
back<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:24.330> this<00:02:24.420> really<00:02:24.690> important<00:02:24.990> in<00:02:25.050> this

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
back is this really important in this

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.110 
back is this really important in this
one<00:02:25.320> because<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.190> HDMI<00:02:26.550> port<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:27.060> you

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
one because of the HDMI port that you

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.880 
one because of the HDMI port that you
have<00:02:27.360> right<00:02:27.630> there<00:02:27.660> not<00:02:27.930> HDMI<00:02:28.410> port<00:02:28.710> is

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
have right there not HDMI port is

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.100 
have right there not HDMI port is
connected<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.640> ion<00:02:29.970> platform<00:02:30.210> GPU<00:02:30.900> and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
connected to that ion platform GPU and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.660 
connected to that ion platform GPU and
that<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.710> going<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.950> give<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.310> ability<00:02:32.400> to

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
that is going to give you the ability to

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.600 
that is going to give you the ability to
stream<00:02:33.060> not<00:02:33.510> only<00:02:33.870> 1080p<00:02:34.350> video<00:02:34.650> but<00:02:34.980> multiple

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
stream not only 1080p video but multiple

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.550 
stream not only 1080p video but multiple
channel<00:02:36.060> HD<00:02:36.270> audio<00:02:36.540> through<00:02:37.110> there<00:02:37.260> as<00:02:37.350> well

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
channel HD audio through there as well

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.140 
channel HD audio through there as well
it's<00:02:38.190> also<00:02:38.400> important<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.850> note<00:02:38.970> this

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
it's also important to note this

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.050 
it's also important to note this
Ethernet<00:02:39.810> port<00:02:39.990> right<00:02:40.020> here<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.380> is

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
Ethernet port right here it is

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.580 
Ethernet port right here it is
10/100/1000<00:02:42.320> Ethernet<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.470> that's

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
10/100/1000 Ethernet and that's

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.050 
10/100/1000 Ethernet and that's
important<00:02:44.010> because<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.430> can<00:02:44.580> stream<00:02:44.850> HD

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
important because you can stream HD

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.090 
important because you can stream HD
files<00:02:45.450> from<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.810> file<00:02:46.020> server<00:02:46.350> or<00:02:46.590> from<00:02:46.950> your

and<00:02:48.840> have<00:02:49.200> no<00:02:49.470> problems<00:02:49.860> as<00:02:49.920> far<00:02:49.950> as<00:02:50.130> bandwidth

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
and have no problems as far as bandwidth

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
and have no problems as far as bandwidth
goes<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.730> can<00:02:50.850> even<00:02:51.030> do<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.210> wirelessly

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
goes you can even do it wirelessly

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.050 
goes you can even do it wirelessly
because<00:02:51.930> this<00:02:52.140> thing<00:02:52.290> does<00:02:52.530> have<00:02:52.800> an<00:02:53.370> N<00:02:53.670> draft
