00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello everyone welcome I suppose if 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.950
 they are here is because they were looking 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.150
 some subject of physiology and I suppose 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.650
 who are medical students who 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.650
 they argue that to load then 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.530
 welcome is served as introduction 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.270
 to this course that aims to 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.180
 dull physiology clearly and 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.220
 simple in a faster way a 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.660
 way the best entertaining simply 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.630
 because it is a video and sometimes with video 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.060
 we have more fun and so we can 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.309
 see at home before a class in the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.229
 cellular and then it goes mainly little to 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.190
 enough medicine because the videos 

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:39.780
 they will be of human physiology and then the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.059
 objective is that you before your 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.739
 class you can see generate your doubts the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.600
 glass is the answer and after that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.170
 let the book be a teacher 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.420
 complete of the topic then the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.630
 physiology is the study of dynamics 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.580
 of the life 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.550
 what does it mean that it is the study of 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.530
 how the living thing works and is the mother 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.120
 of biochemistry and lips and here by 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.720
 that I put the image of the mother with the 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.090
 baby the mom is the physiology and the baby 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.270
 is the biochemistry and biophysics that are 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.240
 the children of this matter however 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.640
 many times to us as students 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.400
 medical costs us work the 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.560
 chemistry and physics and more applied to the 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.050
 medicine therefore in this course 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.869
 let's see biochemistry as we have it 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.270
 to see physics as we have to 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.570
 know and understand when our 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.250
 physiological processes and they will see that 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.380
 when we already understand them 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.780
 It makes us beautiful and even the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.580
 claw we like and there are even many that 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.490
 they go back to study biochemistry already by 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.220
 simple taste 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.590
 then the homeostasis are all 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.680
 those biochemical processes and 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.930
 biophysicists that keep us alive or 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.299
 that keep them and make us feel 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.150
 well then homeostasis is the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.980
 synonymous with being well 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.300
 and here comes another concept that sometimes 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.180
 it is successful to understand what are the 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.340
 negative self-regulation mechanisms 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.900
 widely used by the body to 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.080
 control the production of 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.350
 substances or hormones 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.030
 and an example of to understand it is the 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.460
 production of some hormone there is no 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.080
 best example of the mechanism of 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.360
 negative regulation that the cycle of a 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.340
 hormone so that's what we're going to see 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.800
 let's see the production cycle of 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.630
 cortisol and here we are going to understand the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.240
 negative self-regulation mechanism 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.670
 then cortisol is known as 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.620
 the stress hormone any stimulus 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.890
 that will produce us you will do us 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.170
 produce cortisol then the stress that 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.940
 the brain registers does not send the nucleus 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.700
 to ventriculate that is in the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.880
 hypothalamus and the nucleus for ventricular 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.090
 are the neural bodies of 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.580
 the hormone that releases corticotropin 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.100
 this hormone is released in the system 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.890
 pituitary portal here is stressed with 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.690
 the cursor and they get here to the police 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.560
 previous where the cortical cells are 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.140
 tropical that produce corticotropin 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.360
 the corticotropin in turn goes to the 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.020
 bloodstream and it goes and stimulates the 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.180
 adrenal gland that is 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.950
 focused on this is that it's like a 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.360
 triangulite and then when stimulating 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.810
 specifically to the adrenal cortex 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.080
 in the follicular zone the 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.760
 cortisol then all this process that 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.980
 we saw is the process of 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.380
 stimulation for the production of 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.630
 cortisol but if there was no 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.120
 negative self-regulation mechanism 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.310
 cortisol would be occurring 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.070
 indefinitely therefore cortisol 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.290
 goes and inhibits cortical cells 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.660
 tropical so that they stop producing 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.360
 corticotropin so that it does not follow 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.200
 producing cortisol then the more 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.270
 cortisol has less acth going to have at 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.500
 have less than th in the training of 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:04.980
 cortisol decreases and cortisol in turn 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.960
 goes and inhibits the core neurons 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.700
 to ventricular so they're not 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.890
 producing hormone releasing 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.040
 corticotropin so that it does not occur 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.850
 acth and so that it is not happening 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.490
 cortisol 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.340
 this cycle is the mechanism of 

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.460
 negative self-regulation but as what 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.800
 they make the cells to be thinking 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.260
 all that amount of hormones in the 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.360
 organism for that we have to 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.770
 get into cell biology and 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.080
 study the receivers that are 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.810
 they find in the membrane these 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.600
 receivers are specific to each 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.240
 substance so therefore the 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.330
 next videos and specifically the 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.710
 next video 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.710
 thank you very much until soon
