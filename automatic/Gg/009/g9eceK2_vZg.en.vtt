00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.129
 I'm the okay orthopedist 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.139

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.819

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:16.089

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:18.810
 there is a fracture I have to fix it 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.509
 there is a fracture I have to fix it 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.130
 can you tell me more 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.449
 the fracture is very decomposed 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.060
 I have to fix the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.269
 okay 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.169
 let's start with simple questions 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.890
 where the fracture 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.560
 fracture in the emergency room 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.180
 I have to fix it 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.560
 it wasn't what I meant 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.950
 to whom the fracture belongs 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.360
 the fracture belongs to a bear 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.100
 i know eeh uh femur 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.290
 and to whom belongs the femur 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.020
 the femur belongs to a 97-year-old woman from a hospice 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.200
 okay 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.340
 can you tell me something else 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.600
 and fasting 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.630
 this is a good thing 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.030
 comorbidity 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.870
 the rest is fine 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.500
 apart from the fact that 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.840
 apart from the fact what 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.390
 at 29 degrees of temperature 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.580
 I see 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.210
 and its ph essay. 8 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.460
 really 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.290
 and he has a disease I've never seen before 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.060
 hey what a disease it is 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.290
 asystole 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.100
 asystole 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.400
 sisto lia up 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.070
 hey you want me to give you her 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.760
 there is a fracture I have to fix it 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.200
 but why not you told me immediately 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.350
 I told you 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.350
 there is a fracture I have to fix the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.380
 not the damn fracture 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.909
 the asystole because you told me immediately 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.770
 because otherwise you would have refused to put her to sleep 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.520
 and do not think that I would have noticed the sight of the patient's arrival in the room 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.360
 it won't take long to fix the break 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.120
 I'm very good with hammers and drills 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.120
 he wouldn't hold a haircut at the hairdresser's 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.640
 figured operate it 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.049
 but he will lose very little blood 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.569
 I believe the patient has other priorities right now 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.659
 for example the fracture 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.849
 for example cardiopulmonary resuscitation 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:22.119
 but they have already finished it 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:26.199
 have finished cardiopulmonary resuscitation are the story noses 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.759
 it means she is dead 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:31.899
 will lose very little blood 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:33.339
 you know what 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:34.839
 you are right 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:40.349
 there is not much blood loss when there is no cardiac output 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.589
 I have to fix the fracture 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:44.529
 please go away 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:49.009
 you're hindering me with your refusal to put the patient up 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.409
 hey you're giving me a headache 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:53.979
 there is a fracture 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:55.589
 I have to fix it 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:57.219
 I have to go 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.269
 i will throw a punch on the wall to give vent to me 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:03.109
 if you break your hand, just star me
