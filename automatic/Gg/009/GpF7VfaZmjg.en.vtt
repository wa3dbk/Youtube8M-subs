00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.100
 deriving our experience from 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:15.260
 automotive sector 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:17.990
 we presented it several years ago and 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.690
 today we present it in its evolution 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.930
 the so-called pedaling systems 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:29.300
 assisted for bikers who consist of 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:32.000
 a help through a battery of 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.840
 the one that just pedaled one 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.620
 There are typically normal bikes 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.979
 two housing positions of the 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.760
 battery that is an extension of the boat 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:49.190
 and the other in what the luggage rack 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.220
 therefore normally based on 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.879
 type of bike the builder decides 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:59.059
 which housing solution is more 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.960
 suitable for the type of bike talking 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.379
 in terms of autonomy 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.320
 today we present an active line e 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.250
 performance line which are the two new ones 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.420
 evolutions of our system and let's go 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.820
 from 70 80 kilometers in the most mode 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.080
 powerful assistance up even in the 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:27.850
 eco mode in the 400 power pack 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:31.270
 the battery at almost 180 km 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.440
 allows the operation of the 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.910
 bike system is recharged with the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.009
 same logic as any 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.710
 electronic device therefore can 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.530
 be unhooked from the housing there 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.160
 a classic recharge through the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.210
 normal power outlet 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.759
 we can go from one use 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.399
 purely urban so the so-called 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.030
 city ​​the city bike so in the 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.759
 displacements in urban commuting or 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.219
 even off-road with the mountains 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.090
 bikes and equipped with this system 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.429
 talk about a real price 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.489
 it becomes difficult because it is very tight 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.019
 to the range and to the brand that comes 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.830
 equipped with our system 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.570
 however they are bicycles that go 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.550
 in short, from the order of magnitude of 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.000
 thousand euros up to even rise to 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.670
 567 thousand euros if the bicycle in fact 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.220
 which hosts the system is particularly 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.990
 the bike performs lightly a 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.900
 assisted pedaling is in effect 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.260
 a normal bicycle when you have it 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.180
 you need help and if you don't want it 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.040
 to be assisted 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.260
 just turn off the system then 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.060
 a must try 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.060
 they will be satisfied and surprises
