it looks a bit gross but it comes in
like<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.329> one<00:01:54.509> block<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:55.020> comes<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
like this is one block it comes in a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.760 
like this is one block it comes in a
block<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.649> six<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:57.240> love<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.659> because<00:01:57.780> I've

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
block of six and I love it because I've

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.770 
block of six and I love it because I've
got<00:01:59.009> short<00:01:59.219> hair<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.670> don't<00:01:59.880> only<00:02:00.030> need<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.570> I

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
got short hair I don't only need to I

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.109 
got short hair I don't only need to I
think<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.049> use<00:02:01.200> three<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.649> these<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.909> gives

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
think I use three of these so it gives

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.980 
think I use three of these so it gives
me<00:02:03.270> two<00:02:03.600> what<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.229> two<00:02:04.560> goes<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.659> costs

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
me two what and two goes and it costs

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.960 
me two what and two goes and it costs
about<00:02:07.079> nine<00:02:07.350> pounds<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.340> kind<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.640> works<00:02:08.789> at

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
about nine pounds so it kind of works at

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.660 
about nine pounds so it kind of works at
the<00:02:09.090> same<00:02:09.209> price<00:02:09.830> because<00:02:10.830> normal<00:02:11.280> hair<00:02:11.430> dies

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the same price because normal hair dies

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.710 
the same price because normal hair dies
around<00:02:12.000> five<00:02:12.300> pounds<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.810> think

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
around five pounds I think

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.500 
around five pounds I think
and<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:14.110> only<00:02:14.500> use<00:02:14.800> about<00:02:14.950> 1/3<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.030> box<00:02:16.240> die

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
and I only use about 1/3 of the box die

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.840 
and I only use about 1/3 of the box die
and<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.260> feel<00:02:17.440> like<00:02:17.590> I'm<00:02:17.710> wasting<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:18.340> much<00:02:18.550> and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
and I feel like I'm wasting so much and

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.210 
and I feel like I'm wasting so much and
with<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:19.630> there's<00:02:20.260> no<00:02:20.440> chemicals<00:02:20.950> in<00:02:21.070> it

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
with this there's no chemicals in it

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.990 
with this there's no chemicals in it
it's<00:02:21.400> all-natural<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:22.570> smells<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:23.020> bit<00:02:23.050> weird

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
it's all-natural it smells a bit weird

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.530 
it's all-natural it smells a bit weird
like<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.240> either

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
natural smell but it doesn't really

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.120 
natural smell but it doesn't really
stick<00:02:29.620> in<00:02:29.860> your<00:02:29.980> hair<00:02:30.130> too<00:02:30.310> much<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.940> yeah<00:02:32.130> but

really crumbly so when you're putting it
in<00:03:33.880> your<00:03:33.970> hair<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:35.260> crumbles<00:03:35.739> go<00:03:35.920> everywhere

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
in your hair the crumbles go everywhere

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.330 
in your hair the crumbles go everywhere
and<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.989> stand<00:03:38.290> on<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.560> crumbles<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.190> the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
and you stand on the crumbles and the

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.610 
and you stand on the crumbles and the
dye<00:03:39.610> goes<00:03:39.850> everywhere<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.860> it's<00:03:42.299> difficult

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
dye goes everywhere and it's difficult

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.990 
dye goes everywhere and it's difficult
but<00:03:44.620> basically<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.489> put<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:45.760> all<00:03:45.850> in<00:03:45.970> your

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
but basically you put it all in your

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.539 
but basically you put it all in your
hair<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:47.140> then<00:03:47.620> if<00:03:47.890> you<00:03:48.040> want<00:03:48.190> it<00:03:48.250> really

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
hair and then if you want it really

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.120 
hair and then if you want it really
bright<00:03:48.730> like<00:03:48.940> mine<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:50.110> have<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.620> keep<00:03:50.769> it<00:03:50.920> hot

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
bright like mine you have to keep it hot

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.870 
bright like mine you have to keep it hot
so<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:52.120> wrap<00:03:52.360> it<00:03:52.510> with<00:03:52.570> cling<00:03:52.810> film<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:53.880> like

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
so you wrap it with cling film and like

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.190 
so you wrap it with cling film and like
it's<00:03:55.060> much<00:03:55.150> cleaner<00:03:55.420> for<00:03:55.600> what<00:03:55.690> you<00:03:55.780> can<00:03:55.900> and

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
it's much cleaner for what you can and

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.930 
it's much cleaner for what you can and
you're<00:03:56.380> supposed<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:57.130> woman<00:03:57.370> in<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.760> shop

and you keep on you had two and a half
hours<00:04:25.090> I<00:04:25.330> think

hours I think

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.640 
hours I think
the<00:04:27.000> longevity<00:04:27.210> will<00:04:27.780> keep<00:04:27.930> on<00:04:28.080> like<00:04:28.260> six

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
the longevity will keep on like six

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.890 
the longevity will keep on like six
hours<00:04:28.860> well<00:04:29.460> I'm<00:04:29.550> pretty<00:04:29.730> sure<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:30.540> stops

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
hours well I'm pretty sure it stops

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.230 
hours well I'm pretty sure it stops
working<00:04:31.080> after<00:04:31.590> about<00:04:32.010> two<00:04:32.670> and<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.820> half<00:04:32.970> three

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
this has been straightened as well which

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.630 
this has been straightened as well which
I<00:05:40.980> need<00:05:41.160> to<00:05:41.250> stop<00:05:41.460> doing<00:05:41.580> but<00:05:42.620> yeah<00:05:43.640> and

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
because obviously obviously this is over

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.430 
because obviously obviously this is over
it<00:05:47.400> was<00:05:47.520> sort<00:05:47.730> of<00:05:47.760> like<00:05:47.820> dirty<00:05:48.090> brown<00:05:48.450> day<00:05:49.170> bad

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.160 
hair it's kind of gingery anyway that's
