I'm<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.219> use<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.390> we<00:00:36.510> simply

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
I'm going to use this one so we simply

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.190 
I'm going to use this one so we simply
drag<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.380> drop<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.040> top<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.430> our<00:00:38.520> footage

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
drag and drop it on top of our footage

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.780 
drag and drop it on top of our footage
once<00:00:40.200> we've<00:00:40.350> dropped<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:40.980> effect<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.760> can

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
once we've dropped in this effect we can

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.190 
once we've dropped in this effect we can
see<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.300> background<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.750> still<00:00:42.840> black

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
see that the background is still black

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.500 
see that the background is still black
in<00:00:43.469> order<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.160> composite<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.300> need<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
in order to composite this in we need to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.260 
in order to composite this in we need to
click<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.989> toggle<00:00:46.379> switches<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.980> modes

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
click on this toggle switches and modes

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.029 
click on this toggle switches and modes
after<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.420> go<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.899> mode<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.500> go<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.520> screen

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
after that go to mode and go to screen

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.439 
after that go to mode and go to screen
so<00:00:53.039> if<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.219> play<00:00:53.399> back<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.760> clip<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.300> see

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
so if we play back this clip we can see

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.810 
so if we play back this clip we can see
our<00:00:54.690> effect<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:55.949> not<00:00:56.070> quite<00:00:56.190> composited

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
our effect but it's not quite composited

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.700 
our effect but it's not quite composited
in<00:00:56.879> properly<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.539> one<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.230> reasons<00:00:58.559> why

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
in properly and one of the reasons why

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.040 
in properly and one of the reasons why
is<00:00:59.010> because<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.730> cameras<00:01:00.120> moving<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
is because the cameras moving and so the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.709 
is because the cameras moving and so the
effect<00:01:01.379> doesn't<00:01:01.590> hold<00:01:01.829> its<00:01:02.129> position<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:03.420> I've

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
effect doesn't hold its position so I've

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.119 
effect doesn't hold its position so I've
already<00:01:03.960> gone<00:01:04.080> ahead<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.409> tracked<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.890> shot

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
already gone ahead and tracked this shot

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.940 
already gone ahead and tracked this shot
and<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> tracker<00:01:06.540> already<00:01:06.900> set<00:01:07.140> up<00:01:07.170> so

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
and have a tracker already set up so

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.219 
and have a tracker already set up so
next<00:01:08.220> I'm<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.790> simply<00:01:09.240> position<00:01:10.080> my

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
next I'm going to simply position my

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.219 
next I'm going to simply position my
effect<00:01:10.530> where<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> desire<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.840> then<00:01:12.840> I'm<00:01:12.990> going

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
effect where I desire and then I'm going

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.109 
effect where I desire and then I'm going
to<00:01:13.380> parent<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:15.119> effect<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:16.049> my<00:01:16.200> track<00:01:17.119> now

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
to parent the effect to my track now

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.480 
to parent the effect to my track now
when<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.450> play<00:01:18.689> back<00:01:18.930> we<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.350> see<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.130> effect

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
when we play back we can see the effect

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.570 
when we play back we can see the effect
holds<00:01:20.820> its<00:01:20.970> position<00:01:21.830> this<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.040> an<00:01:23.159> attracting

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
holds its position this is an attracting

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.670 
holds its position this is an attracting
tutorial<00:01:24.119> however<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.930> will<00:01:25.140> briefly<00:01:25.470> go<00:01:25.650> over

for<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.890> went<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.159> new<00:01:50.630> no<00:01:51.630> object<00:01:53.030> then<00:01:54.030> I

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
for this I went to new no object then I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.690 
for this I went to new no object then I
went<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> edit<00:01:54.659> target<00:01:55.079> chose<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.009> null<00:01:56.189> hit

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
went to edit target chose the null hit

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.039 
went to edit target chose the null hit
ok<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.270> then<00:01:58.020> simply<00:01:58.560> hit<00:01:58.740> apply<00:01:59.659> so<00:02:00.659> after

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
ok and then simply hit apply so after

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.240 
ok and then simply hit apply so after
that<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.380> need<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.560> make<00:02:01.740> sure<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.009> this

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
that we need to make sure that this

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.429 
that we need to make sure that this
firework<00:02:02.729> effect<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.360> affecting<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
firework effect is affecting the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.679 
firework effect is affecting the
environment<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.420> need<00:02:06.630> to

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
environment that it's in so you need to

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.199 
environment that it's in so you need to
look<00:02:06.810> at<00:02:06.960> your<00:02:07.079> shot<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.649> ask<00:02:08.369> yourself<00:02:08.879> what

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
look at your shot and ask yourself what

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.669 
look at your shot and ask yourself what
would<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> light<00:02:09.720> be<00:02:09.899> doing<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:10.440> shot

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
would the light be doing in this shot

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.280 
would the light be doing in this shot
well<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.670> would<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.540> light<00:02:12.720> from<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
well I would like the light from the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.700 
well I would like the light from the
fire

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
fire

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.500 
fire
work<00:02:13.800> effect<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.610> affecting<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.300> ground

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
work effect to be affecting the ground

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.540 
work effect to be affecting the ground
right<00:02:15.660> here<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.560> do<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:16.830> what<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.250> do<00:02:17.400> is

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
right here so to do that what I do is

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.270 
right here so to do that what I do is
duplicate<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.540> firework<00:02:18.840> effect<00:02:18.960> I<00:02:19.500> take<00:02:20.100> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
duplicate the firework effect I take the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.370 
duplicate the firework effect I take the
bottom<00:02:20.460> one<00:02:20.690> drag<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.930> where<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.170> floor

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
bottom one drag it to where the floor

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.980 
bottom one drag it to where the floor
would<00:02:22.530> be<00:02:22.850> scale<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.030> down<00:02:24.210> this<00:02:24.450> way<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:24.750> it

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
would be scale it down this way so it

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.370 
would be scale it down this way so it
feels<00:02:25.170> like<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:25.500> flat<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.610> ground<00:02:27.380> then

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
feels like it's flat to the ground then

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.490 
feels like it's flat to the ground then
I'd<00:02:28.530> use<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.890> fast<00:02:29.670> blur<00:02:30.090> effect<00:02:30.540> make<00:02:31.380> sure

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
I'd use a fast blur effect make sure

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.310 
I'd use a fast blur effect make sure
it's<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.830> bottom<00:02:32.180> firework<00:02:33.180> effect<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.690> I

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
it's on the bottom firework effect and I

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.720 
it's on the bottom firework effect and I
crank<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.740> up<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.710> may<00:02:37.890> even<00:02:37.980> go<00:02:38.220> out<00:02:38.370> even<00:02:38.580> a

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
crank it up and I may even go out even a

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.420 
crank it up and I may even go out even a
little<00:02:39.000> bit<00:02:39.120> bigger<00:02:39.270> this<00:02:39.540> way<00:02:40.280> maybe<00:02:41.280> a

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
little bit bigger this way maybe a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.140 
little bit bigger this way maybe a
little<00:02:41.610> bit<00:02:41.790> more<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.180> way<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:44.000> now<00:02:45.000> when

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
little bit more this way and now when

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.090 
little bit more this way and now when
you<00:02:45.180> play<00:02:45.420> back<00:02:45.450> it'll<00:02:46.110> feel<00:02:46.350> like<00:02:46.380> the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
you play back it'll feel like the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.980 
you play back it'll feel like the
firework<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.760> actually<00:02:48.180> illuminating<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
firework is actually illuminating the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.400 
firework is actually illuminating the
ground<00:02:53.270> if<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.780> feel<00:02:54.960> like<00:02:55.080> it's<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.290> little

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
ground if you feel like it's a little

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.080 
ground if you feel like it's a little
still<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.800> little<00:02:55.920> too<00:02:56.160> intense<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:57.060> can

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
still a little too intense you can

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.400 
still a little too intense you can
always<00:02:57.450> turn<00:02:57.600> your<00:02:57.660> opacity<00:02:58.140> down<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:03.410> lastly

center<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.960> explosion<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.280> want<00:03:30.210> to

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
center of the explosion and you want to

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.540 
center of the explosion and you want to
make<00:03:30.510> sure<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.380> starts<00:03:31.860> at<00:03:32.010> the

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
make sure that it starts at the

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.610 
make sure that it starts at the
beginning<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.180> your<00:03:33.510> explosion<00:03:34.050> so<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.350> starts

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
beginning of your explosion so it starts

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.520 
beginning of your explosion so it starts
here<00:03:34.710> but<00:03:35.460> it's<00:03:35.610> gonna<00:03:36.210> be<00:03:36.300> really<00:03:36.720> soft<00:03:37.290> at

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
here but it's gonna be really soft at

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.890 
here but it's gonna be really soft at
first<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.840> hit<00:03:40.500> your<00:03:40.770> keyframe<00:03:41.690> let's<00:03:42.690> just

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
first so hit your keyframe let's just

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.280 
first so hit your keyframe let's just
start<00:03:43.080> it<00:03:43.230> down<00:03:43.740> to<00:03:44.750> sort<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.810> jump<00:03:45.990> to<00:03:46.110> like

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
start it down to sort of jump to like

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.070 
start it down to sort of jump to like
30%<00:03:47.030> make<00:03:48.030> sure<00:03:48.180> this<00:03:48.240> is<00:03:48.420> centered<00:03:48.750> up<00:03:48.900> nice

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
30% make sure this is centered up nice

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.460 
30% make sure this is centered up nice
and<00:03:49.620> then<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.730> gets<00:03:50.960> and<00:03:51.960> then<00:03:52.080> we<00:03:52.140> want<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.350> get

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
and then it gets and then we want to get

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.550 
and then it gets and then we want to get
really<00:03:52.800> bright<00:03:53.430> right<00:03:53.640> here<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:54.300> pops<00:03:54.630> so

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
really bright right here so pops so

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.100 
really bright right here so pops so
let's<00:03:55.680> just<00:03:55.860> go<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.630> 80%<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.720> then<00:03:57.990> we're

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
let's just go to 80% and then we're

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.640 
let's just go to 80% and then we're
going<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.290> quickly<00:03:58.590> go<00:03:58.830> back<00:03:58.860> down<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.370> zero

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
going to quickly go back down to zero

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.130 
going to quickly go back down to zero
now<00:04:01.650> let's<00:04:01.860> play<00:04:02.070> this<00:04:02.220> back
