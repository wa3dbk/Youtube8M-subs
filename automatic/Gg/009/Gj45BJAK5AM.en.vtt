distraction I think I think their reason

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.670 
distraction I think I think their reason
we're<00:04:53.240> of<00:04:53.330> it<00:04:53.450> I<00:04:53.600> think<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.200> players<00:04:54.410> and<00:04:54.560> the

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
we're of it I think the players and the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.440 
we're of it I think the players and the
coaches<00:04:54.740> were<00:04:55.160> focused<00:04:55.580> on<00:04:55.669> what<00:04:55.850> we<00:04:56.000> do<00:04:56.180> is

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
coaches were focused on what we do is

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.270 
coaches were focused on what we do is
probably<00:04:56.750> harder<00:04:57.200> on<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:57.410> families<00:04:57.830> on<00:04:58.130> the

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
probably harder on the families on the

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.700 
probably harder on the families on the
outside<00:04:58.640> I<00:04:58.880> think<00:04:59.060> they<00:04:59.390> are<00:04:59.600> exposed<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:00.650> a

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
outside I think they are exposed to a

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.140 
outside I think they are exposed to a
lot<00:05:00.890> more<00:05:01.130> of<00:05:01.190> it<00:05:01.310> on<00:05:01.400> a<00:05:01.460> daily<00:05:01.669> basis<00:05:03.820> coach<00:05:04.820> of

lot more of it on a daily basis coach of

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.500 
lot more of it on a daily basis coach of

against number teens can throw it you

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.469 
against number teens can throw it you
have<00:07:10.870> limited<00:07:11.169> time<00:07:11.319> and<00:07:12.219> you<00:07:12.789> got<00:07:12.969> limited

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:13.479 
have limited time and you got limited

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:14.459 
have limited time and you got limited
things<00:07:13.659> you<00:07:13.750> can<00:07:13.840> do<00:07:13.930> on<00:07:13.960> the<00:07:14.169> field<00:07:14.319> because

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:14.469 
things you can do on the field because

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:15.629 
things you can do on the field because
you<00:07:14.620> got<00:07:14.740> to<00:07:14.830> make<00:07:14.919> sure<00:07:14.979> that<00:07:15.189> their<00:07:15.310> legs<00:07:15.520> are

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639 
you got to make sure that their legs are

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:17.580 
you got to make sure that their legs are
ready<00:07:15.849> and<00:07:16.090> I<00:07:16.719> think<00:07:16.960> when<00:07:17.110> you<00:07:17.199> have<00:07:17.289> a<00:07:17.349> game

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:17.590 
ready and I think when you have a game

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.740 
ready and I think when you have a game
plan<00:07:17.620> like<00:07:17.800> this<00:07:18.069> you<00:07:18.280> have<00:07:18.400> to<00:07:18.550> really<00:07:19.180> rely

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:19.750 
plan like this you have to really rely

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.200 
plan like this you have to really rely
on<00:07:20.139> the<00:07:20.919> things<00:07:21.159> that<00:07:21.340> you've<00:07:21.460> done<00:07:21.490> over<00:07:22.030> and

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.210 
on the things that you've done over and

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.429 
on the things that you've done over and
over<00:07:22.300> again<00:07:22.539> you<00:07:22.840> got<00:07:22.960> to<00:07:23.050> rely<00:07:23.229> on<00:07:23.289> the

00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:23.439 
over again you got to rely on the

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:24.600 
over again you got to rely on the
repetitions<00:07:23.979> you<00:07:24.039> took<00:07:24.189> in<00:07:24.310> training<00:07:24.580> camp

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610 
repetitions you took in training camp

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.670 
repetitions you took in training camp
the<00:07:24.879> repetitions<00:07:25.389> you've<00:07:25.509> taken<00:07:25.719> in<00:07:26.469> each

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680 
the repetitions you've taken in each

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.110 
the repetitions you've taken in each
practice<00:07:26.919> week<00:07:27.280> I<00:07:27.430> think<00:07:27.699> those<00:07:27.819> things<00:07:27.969> are

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120 
practice week I think those things are

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.210 
practice week I think those things are
critical<00:07:30.120> thank<00:07:31.120> you
