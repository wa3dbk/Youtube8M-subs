00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.710
 ah 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.140
 the time taught me that people 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.760
 big ones are not the ones that take up a lot 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.040
 space but those that leave a huge 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.780
 hollow when they go to anyone like them 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.310
 in place that are never them 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.169
 I would appreciate everything you have done for me 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.940
 I could not do it to any million 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.650
 lives we have shared in a thousand and one 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.290
 secrets we have helped when we have 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.940
 I was afraid we cried and laughed 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.460
 spent so many unforgettable moments with 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.739
 children I could not choose ones I 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.750
 you know how I am when I feel that 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.940
 things are not going well just close 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.470
 the eyes and I think of you is something 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.910
 weird but it's as if tranquility 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.400
 I covered my whole body little by little 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.230
 open your eyes and it's as if you knew that 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.260
 some day you will be there for him 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.239
 look so awaited hug 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.309
 it's as if I knew that you will be 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.739
 there always to protect me and make me 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.840
 feel safe again I feel as if 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.369
 he knew of his whole life just to 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.409
 look at your face is a privilege 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.939
 When there is a problem, it feeds 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.979
 automatically remember our 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.320
 smiles and everything is blank everything 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.299
 disappears sometimes I do not know how to react 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.740
 if they are laughing or crying I feel as if 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.750
 you were my only way out, my only 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.340
 salvation the only people that from 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.710
 the distance understand me and they listen to me 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.840
 because when something bad happens I take refuge 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.729
 in you and I feel stronger I hear 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.080
 your voice and nothing else I need is 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.909
 almost as if you had told me that 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.009
 you will always be there for me as I do not 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.210
 I will be for you the problems not 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.860
 only things that happen in life 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.170
 experiences and you have to know how to overcome 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.090
 everything happens to be right, everything could 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.979
 change for better or for worse but if 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.569
 you are not present and capable 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.520
 keep walking with your mind up 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.319
 they are worth a word of mine to know if 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.789
 I tell the truth the embraced 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.770
 while crying pictures have made me the 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.140
 intermediate but you know what happened happens 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.270
 I will be there in the good and the bad and what 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.340
 funny in everything I know that that happens to us the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.780
 time flying we never have enough 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.730
 what counts for a moment to be 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.860
 unforgettable is the company and with them 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.050
 there are people who come to your life like this 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.790
 suddenly without an exact reason and that 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.470
 they come to stay that it does not matter 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.250
 time that we have together since in 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.810
 this little time 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.910
 abhisit has shown more than people in 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.010
 a temple without motives about destiny 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.810
 that thing that made us know each other and 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.060
 the time that made every day 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.190
 we were closer together this is life 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.200
 the seconds as small as they seem 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.480
 they are the most important thing in this world 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.950
 mark the time all we live are 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.500
 the memories that we will tell one day 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.720
 the good and the bad is like a recipe for 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.700
 kitchen if any ingredient is missing is not 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.350
 the same people decide with whom 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.930
 get together and with whom to share moments 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.030
 breathtaking often you suffer is 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.310
 cries but it is what he touches not always 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.590
 It rains to everyone's taste if I say everything is 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.030
 everything if I say always is always 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.770
 small details make great 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.480
 differences that are the little things 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.070
 those that make you happy and that the rounds 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.960
 people are the ones who make you feel 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.550
 special and it's that I'm sorry being 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.670
 you have them but each one has to 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.290
 full if yes, sisters, those 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.330
 people who count on their fingers 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.100
 the hands and for which you would do everything 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.000
 those people who are always there when 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.590
 they need them 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.690
 when it's all black when things 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.740
 they go well when you can not anymore you know 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.780
 all those moments that we have spent 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.240
 together that's what I change it for nothing 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.760
 of the world is comedy and they look at us 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.110
 they laugh and criticize we are one of 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.090
 different to anyone who goes through 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.550
 front right here edition is a family 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.800
 what point is best if any is not 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.959
 there is nothing come alone as art 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.670
 of magic in saying there is no beginning nor 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.770
 end there are no goals or anything that we 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.360
 define is that we do not need what we 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.130
 us because we must be is 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.170
 simply simple we are made 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.209
 to be united only see them 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.980
 happy makes me feel happy at each 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.780
 one of those smiles is awesome what 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.670
 that style can do for you what 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.290
 I can help you what you can get 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.910
 that you do anything, I suppose 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.739
 I deserve but in the end I'll have to 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.330
 seize them an applause for six 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.190
 people who demonstrate what they are worth 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.230
 every step that they give I want to limits 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.910
 Infinity is not always and never 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.980
 I do not want promises that later I can not 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.840
 talk I want to make life in this 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.330
 world is so short that to pass it without this 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.200
 it's a waste of time 9 the price 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.200
 exact of my happiness
