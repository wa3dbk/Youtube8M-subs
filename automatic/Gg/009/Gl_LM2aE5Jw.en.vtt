00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.890 
thousand coins for him it's been 45
times<00:01:14.790> already<00:01:15.030> i<00:01:15.180> think<00:01:15.420> its<00:01:15.540> price<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.780> going

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
times already i think its price is going

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.870 
times already i think its price is going
to<00:01:15.990> about<00:01:16.320> seven<00:01:16.830> or<00:01:16.890> eight<00:01:17.040> k<00:01:17.280> at<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> moment

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
to about seven or eight k at the moment

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.100 
to about seven or eight k at the moment
so<00:01:18.000> maybe<00:01:18.119> it'll<00:01:18.330> go<00:01:18.420> even<00:01:18.720> high<00:01:18.840> when<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
so maybe it'll go even high when the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.179 
so maybe it'll go even high when the
game<00:01:19.259> comes<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.500> now<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.830> i'll<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.040> hoping

to<00:03:06.780> 10<00:03:06.959> chemistry<00:03:07.350> now<00:03:07.470> if<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.650> didn't<00:03:07.980> know

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
to 10 chemistry now if you didn't know

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.890 
to 10 chemistry now if you didn't know
already<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.730> that's<00:03:09.120> by<00:03:09.270> playing<00:03:09.480> 10<00:03:09.690> games

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
already and that's by playing 10 games

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.880 
already and that's by playing 10 games
with<00:03:10.020> them<00:03:10.080> or<00:03:10.320> getting<00:03:10.560> them<00:03:10.650> in<00:03:10.770> your

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
with them or getting them in your

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.560 
with them or getting them in your
starter<00:03:11.340> pack<00:03:11.520> they'll<00:03:11.820> automatically<00:03:12.239> or<00:03:12.450> in

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
starter pack they'll automatically or in

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.600 
starter pack they'll automatically or in
a<00:03:12.630> pack<00:03:12.810> they'll<00:03:13.050> start<00:03:13.350> with<00:03:13.530> 10<00:03:13.769> chemistry

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
a pack they'll start with 10 chemistry

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.310 
a pack they'll start with 10 chemistry
or<00:03:14.760> they'll<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:15.150> an<00:03:15.269> extra<00:03:15.540> parachute<00:03:16.080> boost

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
or they'll have an extra parachute boost

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.750 
or they'll have an extra parachute boost
so<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:16.860> can<00:03:16.980> see<00:03:17.070> he's<00:03:17.160> got<00:03:17.280> some<00:03:17.430> very<00:03:17.549> very

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
so you can see he's got some very very

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.949 
so you can see he's got some very very
sad<00:03:17.880> sacks<00:03:18.180> they're<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.450> highest<00:03:18.570> rated

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
sad sacks they're the highest rated

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.900 
sad sacks they're the highest rated
player<00:03:19.110> in<00:03:19.290> my<00:03:19.590> team<00:03:19.830> right<00:03:20.070> there<00:03:20.280> then<00:03:20.790> on

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
player in my team right there then on

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.370 
player in my team right there then on
the<00:03:20.970> left<00:03:21.180> mid<00:03:21.360> we've<00:03:21.480> got<00:03:21.660> paris<00:03:22.019> it<00:03:22.170> you<00:03:22.290> know

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
the left mid we've got paris it you know

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.449 
the left mid we've got paris it you know
i<00:03:22.470> think<00:03:22.500> he<00:03:22.799> doesn't<00:03:23.160> really<00:03:23.310> look<00:03:23.400> like

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
i think he doesn't really look like

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.640 
i think he doesn't really look like
great<00:03:23.730> his<00:03:23.850> stats<00:03:24.090> look<00:03:24.299> kind<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.720> net<00:03:25.080> but

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
great his stats look kind of net but

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.960 
great his stats look kind of net but
when<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.160> go<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.400> foot<00:03:26.640> where<00:03:26.790> there's

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
when you go on foot where there's

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.220 
when you go on foot where there's
actually<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.269> cool<00:03:27.480> feature<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.900> can<00:03:27.989> look<00:03:28.200> for

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
actually a cool feature you can look for

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.750 
actually a cool feature you can look for
it<00:03:28.500> certainly<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.100> i<00:03:29.160> was<00:03:29.310> searching<00:03:29.580> the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
it certainly so i was searching the

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.979 
it certainly so i was searching the
Bundesliga<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.299> then<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:30.570> can<00:03:30.720> go<00:03:30.750> on<00:03:30.900> the

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
Bundesliga and then you can go on the

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.030 
Bundesliga and then you can go on the
right<00:03:31.080> hand<00:03:31.170> side<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.590> can<00:03:31.709> sort<00:03:31.920> by

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
right hand side and you can sort by

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.190 
right hand side and you can sort by
total<00:03:32.610> stats<00:03:32.910> this<00:03:33.390> one<00:03:33.570> add<00:03:33.750> up<00:03:33.900> all<00:03:34.080> the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
total stats this one add up all the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.840 
total stats this one add up all the
placed<00:03:34.440> at<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.860> show<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.070> who<00:03:35.610> is<00:03:35.640> the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
placed at and show you who is the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.460 
placed at and show you who is the
highest<00:03:36.120> grade<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.450> he's<00:03:36.600> like<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.959> second

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
highest grade and he's like the second

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.380 
highest grade and he's like the second
or<00:03:37.590> third<00:03:37.650> highest<00:03:38.280> rated<00:03:38.670> left<00:03:38.910> midfielder

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
or third highest rated left midfielder

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.170 
or third highest rated left midfielder
behind<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:40.290> know<00:03:40.410> Royce<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.400> think<00:03:41.850> maybe

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
behind you know Royce and I think maybe

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.940 
behind you know Royce and I think maybe
Frank<00:03:42.540> Ribery<00:03:42.810> other<00:03:43.410> than<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.769> he's

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
Frank Ribery other than that he's
