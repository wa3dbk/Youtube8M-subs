00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
Bobcat urine and then just apply it

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.170 
Bobcat urine and then just apply it
considerably<00:03:32.319> more<00:03:32.560> liberally<00:03:33.129> inside<00:03:33.970> the

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
inside the cage there's enough in here

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.099 
inside the cage there's enough in here
for<00:03:37.450> Oh<00:03:38.069> 75<00:03:39.069> to<00:03:39.340> about<00:03:39.609> 125<00:03:40.269> sets<00:03:40.689> depend<00:03:41.049> on

for Oh 75 to about 125 sets depend on

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.939 
for Oh 75 to about 125 sets depend on
how<00:03:41.260> much<00:03:41.409> of<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.799> use<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.790> is<00:03:43.949> water

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:44.949 
how much of it you use it is water

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:47.399 
how much of it you use it is water
soluble<00:03:45.459> so<00:03:45.790> if<00:03:46.180> you're<00:03:47.079> in<00:03:47.199> wet<00:03:47.379> weather

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
soluble so if you're in wet weather

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.750 
soluble so if you're in wet weather
you're<00:03:47.769> probably<00:03:47.979> already<00:03:48.190> doing<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.609> but

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
you're probably already doing it but

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.399 
you're probably already doing it but
you'll<00:03:49.209> want<00:03:49.359> to<00:03:49.449> cover<00:03:49.629> your<00:03:49.810> cage<00:03:50.019> trap<00:03:50.260> with

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
you'll want to cover your cage trap with

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:51.960 
you'll want to cover your cage trap with
some<00:03:50.560> plastic<00:03:50.739> if<00:03:51.069> it<00:03:51.190> does<00:03:51.400> get<00:03:51.579> rained<00:03:51.819> on

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
some plastic if it does get rained on

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.920 
some plastic if it does get rained on
just<00:03:52.239> reapply<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:54.310> it<00:03:54.909> does<00:03:55.150> separate<00:03:55.569> just<00:03:55.780> a

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
just reapply it it does separate just a

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.930 
just reapply it it does separate just a
tiny<00:03:56.409> bit<00:03:56.650> we've<00:03:56.859> worked<00:03:57.069> out<00:03:57.220> all<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.430> bugs<00:03:57.519> I

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
tiny bit we've worked out all the bugs I

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.770 
tiny bit we've worked out all the bugs I
think<00:03:58.150> it's<00:03:58.299> a<00:03:58.479> it's<00:03:59.169> a<00:03:59.290> pretty<00:03:59.409> solid<00:03:59.709> product

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
think it's a it's a pretty solid product

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.050 
think it's a it's a pretty solid product
