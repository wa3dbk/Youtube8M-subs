00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.439
 hello my name is khan saraya and 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.420
 I am currently participating in 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.610
 the contest of the united history chanel 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.919
 to change the story this video what 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.419
 I recorded to let you know the idea for 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:19.090
 that can see the scope of this 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:21.760
 have already the people who could help 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.330
 this is one of the ten semifinalists 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.400
 of an idea to change the history of 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.350
 hans araya and my idea is that every home 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.730
 have access to drinking water the 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.100
 trigger to create this system 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.870
 because I realized that there is a great 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.760
 number of people who do not have 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.530
 access to drinking water in the world the 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.930
 system works basically in three 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.270
 stages the first is the filtration of 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.550
 solid the second is the system of 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.710
 ionization copper silver and the third is 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.660
 the chlorination process the system 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.420
 complete and works through energy 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.460
 solar differentiation of this idea no 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.100
 It is based on the volume of water obtained 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.070
 but in the number of people at 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.340
 which we can reach now enters your 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.649
 history dotcom and put your vote to one 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.690
 of the ten semifinalists that I am 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.640
 presenting an idea to change the 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.250
 history with the support and commitment of 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.009
 south 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.810
 get ready vm I had an idea that I can 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.380
 help many if you think it 's good 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.600
 help me to specify it 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.579
 good now that they have a better idea of 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.860
 what is this about I would like 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:29.299
 explain where this idea was born and 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.299
 basically who would pretend 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.410
 a couple of years ago about 23 years ago the uned 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.330
 which is an international organization 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.000
 dependent on the un and that sees things 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.950
 of the environment according to a report 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.300
 called six water that you can find 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.420
 anywhere on the internet is 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.119
 public where two super 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.650
 lapidaries that is one billion 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.229
 people at this time do not have 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.760
 access to drinking water and other data that 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:01.460
 even more sad 1 million 800 thousand 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.009
 children under 5 die each year 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.380
 by the water conditions they take and 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.830
 the diseases they buy from 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.840
 this then is a super necessity 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.900
 big and that is not far from what 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.060
 is our reality currently in Chile 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.650
 and in South America there is a large amount 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.010
 of people who do not have access to water 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.939
 potable 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.030
 a great differentiation and people who are 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:30.060
 in camps or people who are in the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.250
 that are contacting island people 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.900
 small where the inhabitants are so 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.110
 few that actually a large company 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.230
 not to go drinking water people who 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.230
 is consuming water from rivers of 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.230
 sheds 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.430
 the water that comes out of power plants 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.530
 hydroelectric 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.450
 this issue of a reality not only in 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.469
 Chile not only in South America but to 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.180
 globally we have basically had 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.909
 that image that this is actually a 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.799
 African problem but not really 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.930
 it's a problem Africa is a problem 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.959
 that affects us all over the world and about 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.689
 all of us as Americans affect 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.639
 very much to what is Central America that 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:14.000
 is the second place after africa 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:17.720
 who do not have access to drinking water 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.030
 in greater quantity according to inhabitants 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.890
 good now that you know what it is about 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.050
 the scope that this has the only thing 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.980
 I am left is to ask them please support 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.140
 this idea 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.700
 get on the history page I'm going 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.280
 to be the link in the comment of the 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.950
 video can enter to vote for this 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.430
 project if we do not reach the final is 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.020
 super difficult this can come true 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.210
 the prize money will be occupied 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.430
 only for the construction of more 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.140
 prototypes we already have two prototypes in 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.660
 construction and we are 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.050
 constantly improving is a process 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.910
 super difficult and we need the resources 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.850
 we need to know this 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.160
 this initiative worldwide 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.680
 we need this to be raised as 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.709
 a necessity in the world and therefore 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.050
 it's a super good window to have the 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.390
 history chanel 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.740
 talking about this topic thank you very much and 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.740
 I hope they can continue voting
