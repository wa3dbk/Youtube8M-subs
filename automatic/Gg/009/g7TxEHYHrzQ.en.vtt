00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.900
 hi i am roxana we all have objects 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.120
 of which we have a hard time 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.299
 get rid of but today I'm going to show you 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.339
 how to give utility to those objects with 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.869
 a reduced budget with throwing 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.090
 fly our imagination to the maximum 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.400
 we all remember those wonderful 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.980
 cassettes where we listened to our 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.929
 favorite music because now we gave them a 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.730
 utility decorating our 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.710
 characterization flow are these banks 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.449
 which are some of my favorites because 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.820
 they can sit me suddenly in the 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.710
 eiffel tower today one is very mother are 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.030
 maps collected from the last trip to 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.130
 a diversity of favor that I want 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.640
 show the project that I want to share 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.480
 with all of you is a lamp 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.190
 misplaced that after a piece 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.830
 we have many objects that we think that 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.780
 they are garbage in this case we are going to 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.120
 reuse with a very budget 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.810
 small but as I told you a lot 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.570
 imagination the material is the following 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.250
 the first step is to cut the bottle what 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.740
 What we have to do is tie the cord 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.590
 of cotton to the life of the bottle to the 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.360
 desired height and cut the ends 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.570
 leftovers from this same 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.910
 We submerge the cord in alcohol and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.560
 later we put it back in 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.330
 the same place 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.700
 now let's proceed to burn the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.740
 cotton with a lighter taking the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.610
 necessary precautions turning up 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.610
 that the fire was quenched 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.350
 that's how we have the cut bottle 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.510
 then do not forget to leave all 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.850
 shores to remove the pines and avoid 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.070
 accidents we already learned the technique to 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.870
 cut the bottle I recommend that if 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.510
 it's your first time practice with another 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.910
 bottle other than that of its released what 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.010
 what we are going to need is to withdraw the 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.140
 covers of our bottle and make it 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.930
 a few small holes with a nail 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.820
 hot the next step is with the 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.810
 fire supports pass it by the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.850
 inside of the bottle 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.350
 place the wood is a piece of wood 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.750
 any material that you 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.939
 Like I made three holes for 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.710
 three bottles that I will need 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.130
 we put the covers and go through 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.350
 the cables to secure the table to 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.330
 our bottles 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.120
 the next step is to make the wiring 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.450
 electrical this is simple simply 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.880
 we are going to join the white wires with the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.730
 whites and black cables with 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.310
 blacks what follows is to connect a cable 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.200
 more to whites and separately one of 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.820
 the blacks what will allow us 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.250
 connect it directly to the 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.070
 electricity 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.440
 finally I get an aluminum in 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.540
 a window store and I did this wrong and 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.930
 here they have it we put the spotlights the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.820
 we connect to the ceiling and you will see the result 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.050
 With this I say goodbye I hope there is 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.050
 liked chau
