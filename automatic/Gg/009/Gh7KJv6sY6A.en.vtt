 multiply and divide hair by slightly 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.620
 pressed hair length and ends applied 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.180
 micro serum rinse balm 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.280

 pvp 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.360
 against split ends she 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.100

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.340
 soft and provide easy 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.670
 comb squeeze out 2-3 servings

 serum with old palm and put 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.810
 as always the smell is just incredible 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.290
 now comb my hair and start 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.060
 I would have dried hair driers are now Pryadko 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.060
 for my face I will do my bouffant 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.690
 now separate the rectangle 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.299
 turn the hair and fix then 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.299
 see as the previous time varnish 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.690
 I remove the remaining hair 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.690
 I will fasten the tail with the help 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.690
 gum off the hook 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:08.069
 when the tail is tied up 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:09.989
 side heels are the most important trick 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.239
 need to do with ordinary studs 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.239
 we stick the pin in the tail and 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:21.870
 lift it up and thread the stud 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:26.910
 along the head so the tail 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.980
 rises and the whole weight of hair 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.660
 moves from the scalp 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.250
 but this very invisibility and 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:39.450
 final result is required 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:42.690
 It should be fixed with varnish on the channel 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.280
 all things good i really hope that 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.049
