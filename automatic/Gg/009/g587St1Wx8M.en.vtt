00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:07.210
 Hi, I'm Alejandra Coghlan and you're in my 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.219
 house that is your house today because today I'm going 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.289
 to share how we made a cake 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.909
 puppy 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:15.579
 And we are making a party 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:18.730
 puppies huiquÃ­ thing more divine what 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:21.700
 I bought the fabric I came to the store I said to 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.000
 our store I will make some videos 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.620
 of puppies then good first thing 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.370
 what I did was 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:34.630
 make my mold of the puppies and good 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:37.250
 then nothing else copy them like that 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.390
 so I did the whole puppy figure 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.640
 the ear and the nose this so that the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.360
 puppy figure 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.460
 we cut it with my cakes the truth 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.489
 is that I bought these cakes 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.680
 like almost almost that in the super and what 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:59.490
 The only thing I did was to start cutting them 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.490
 very carefully 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.400
 Here I already have it very nice they had 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.790
 cut and what I'm going to do is that what 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.880
 I will cover with this mass of with this 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.430
 betty cheese cream coating 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.220
 crocker that we bought it not this is not 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.630
 fact is to buy it now yes that in the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.030
 super check it works very nice 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.540
 between what we are going to do is spread 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.729
 we take it away from the dog and we're going to 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.070
 spread the cake here you have to have 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.619
 careful because sometimes the pasta is coming 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.970
 very easily and what I did was 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.320
 first spread a part and then 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.229
 freeze it 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.130
 for later and to detail what to see here already 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.229
 we have super cute and listÃ­simo 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.420
 So what are we going to do with a 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.910
 little bit of fondant I bought this 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.610
 fondant brand happy in the store is 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.070
 that is called gourmet in Mexico and what 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.560
 I have here separate look how I have it 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.110
 wrapped because if not the fondant is made 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.229
 frightening and dries in two minutes with 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.690
 the pure air dries then I'm going to 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.850
 show how I painted it in black I have 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.850
 here my painting black 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.300
 I already have my fondant here 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.530
 my little tail and my nose and the 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.450
 Smile wow what a beautiful smile 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.450
 we are going to put the smile 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.800
 here because we are a very dog 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.980
 happy happy the ear that already had 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.980
 made 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.410
 nothing 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:52.630
 the nose well 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.660
 the little eyes of the happy puppy 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:59.350
 and now I have around here that I already had 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.800
 bought at the tail the tail 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.800
 tail 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.599
 and I have some little hearts around here 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.599
 that are very good 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.580
 how cute was that good for me 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.130
 I really love him they do not know what I 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.310
 I had fun doing it if you have your degree 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.400
 complexity complicity plotting it 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.430
 but if I could believe that you really 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.610
 It's tiresome to see if it gets very complicated 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.100
 you can cool or freeze then that 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.280
 allows you how to cut easier to put together 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.100
 easier but they were precious to me 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.380
 I loved this little bag 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.870
 little notebook the little box I think it was a great 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.120
 many of you have written to me 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.150
 please speak nice party to the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.490
 mario bros party and many 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.860
 parties have asked me I can not always 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.090
 I would really love it really 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.000
 I would love this but 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.970
 it is not always easy to deal not 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.769
 do what they ask me but I think that 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.060
 this is a very good idea so that 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:10.489
 make parties of other themes buy 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.370
 some fabric or some paper that helps you 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.669
 to inspire them and applications like 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.799
 these or productions like these are very 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.730
 simple the only thing we did was go 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.610
 cutting up 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.160
 or something like that it looks beautiful the joke is 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.350
 that you can combine what you need 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.830
 for that party of being so loved that 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.890
 you want to celebrate 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.090

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.580
