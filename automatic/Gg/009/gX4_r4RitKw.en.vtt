00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 ah 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.309
 in 1998 arose tiff game that he introduced 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.040
 stealth concepts that have been 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.500
 copied by many now eidos montreal 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.769
 gives us a reboot of the famous game 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.689
 of master thief 2 is developed in the 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:22.000
 city that is governed under the 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.890
 dictatorship of the baron in an attempt to 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.440
 steal the most precious items from 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.300
 Dictator Carmen and her companion Erin 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.820
 they accidentally interrupt a 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.320
 mysterious ritual time afterwards without 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.530
 know what happened 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.179
 Garnett sets out to unravel the mystery 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.550
 the game is stealth with sight in 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:41.649
 first person with some sections of 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.690
 action and persecutions where gareth 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.819
 will show your parkour-like skills 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.859
 very soon the controls become 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:50.589
 intuitive if we will be stealing everything 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.629
 that shine from the first moment the 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.059
 stealth is an important part of the 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.100
 Game dynamics is easier to perform 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.690
 our assaults in the dark so 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.699
 that we have an indicator in 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.280
 screen that tells us how hidden 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.049
 we are also the enemies have a 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.790
 meter on them that fills 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.850
 as they realize our 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.670
 presence in case of filling 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.770
 the best option is to run away and hide and 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.840
 that battles become complicated 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.759
 and when they ask for reinforcements it 's 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.330
 practically impossible to leave 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.430
 victorious is a game enough 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.100
 challenger and we will find ourselves looking for 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.649
 appropriate route in each section the bad is 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.140
 that although at first it seems like a world 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.330
 open that invites exploration 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.430
 it really is not like that we should move on from 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.100
 mission in mission crossing the streets 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.290
 that look more like a labyrinth adding up the 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.270
 ugly map design that does not help at all 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.130
 graphically it's good but nothing 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.870
 spectacular especially by 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.970
 constant charging times and the 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.270
 problems with textures that suddenly 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.030
 the music becomes annoying due to the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.640
 stealth is scarce effects for its 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.800
 part are very good although sometimes 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.870
 you lose the feeling of depth to 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.880
 listen to a conversation with himself 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.390
 volume no matter who the people 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.610
 be near or far 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.010
 it's a good game that despite not 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.110
 present anything new feels like a 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.750
 decent restart for the story of 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.209
 garber it is true that technical failures 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.520
 may affect the experience but more 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.400
 beyond this many will enjoy this 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.050
 dark world of thieves so this 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.330
 good stealth game receives a 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.330
 rating of 80 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.750
 thank you for your support band picks 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.240

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.710
 they give me like that we end up this 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.550
 video my name is cristian vila and the 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.550
 I hope soon
