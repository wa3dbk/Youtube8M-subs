00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
snaps of which each quarterback got ten

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.260 
snaps of which each quarterback got ten
or<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.899> three<00:00:58.410> guys<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.949> then<00:00:59.100> had<00:00:59.789> 50

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
operated I think obviously Kyle came

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
operated I think obviously Kyle came
back<00:01:16.430> doing<00:01:17.430> things<00:01:17.640> well<00:01:17.869> Kyler's<00:01:18.869> picked<00:01:19.320> it

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
back doing things well Kyler's picked it

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.160 
back doing things well Kyler's picked it
up<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:19.830> well<00:01:20.070> Jake<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.270> know<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> think<00:01:21.780> he

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
up really well Jake you know I think he

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.810 
up really well Jake you know I think he
benefits<00:01:22.680> from<00:01:22.770> being<00:01:23.189> at<00:01:23.340> Oklahoma<00:01:23.729> State

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
benefits from being at Oklahoma State

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.580 
benefits from being at Oklahoma State
for<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.299> little<00:01:24.420> bit<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.990> from<00:01:25.369> from<00:01:26.369> a

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
for a little bit this from from a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.929 
for a little bit this from from a
structural<00:01:28.590> standpoint<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.310> he<00:01:29.460> understands

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
structural standpoint so he understands

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.950 
structural standpoint so he understands
it<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.990> know<00:01:31.110> those<00:01:31.590> guys<00:01:31.770> came<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.100> and

really didn't make too many mistakes
from<00:01:36.270> an<00:01:36.420> operation<00:01:36.960> standpoint<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.590> any<00:01:37.790> and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the competition level is pretty good but

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.130

go and then you know we get in pads and
some<00:01:49.200> guys<00:01:49.409> keep<00:01:50.009> getting<00:01:50.250> better<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.549> some

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
some guys keep getting better and some

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.639 
some guys keep getting better and some
kind<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.060> disappear<00:01:51.780> once<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.140> start<00:01:52.380> hitting

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
kind of disappear once we start hitting

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.210 
kind of disappear once we start hitting
a<00:01:52.680> little<00:01:52.829> bit<00:01:53.009> when<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.939> look<00:01:54.149> at

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
a little bit when you look at

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.010 
a little bit when you look at
use<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.550> tangible<00:01:57.150> impact<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.630> Aaron<00:01:57.840> Moors

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
use the tangible impact that Aaron Moors

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.660 
use the tangible impact that Aaron Moors
had<00:01:58.230> on<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.410> receiver<00:01:58.740> course<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.160> far<00:01:59.190> yeah

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
had on this receiver course so far yeah

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.440 
had on this receiver course so far yeah
i<00:01:59.700> think<00:01:59.910> you<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.660> technique-wise<00:02:02.330> you<00:02:03.330> know

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
i think you know technique-wise you know

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.540 
i think you know technique-wise you know
we've<00:02:03.600> changed<00:02:03.840> practice<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.590> style<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.250> how

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
we've changed practice and style of how

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.020 
we've changed practice and style of how
we<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.820> things<00:02:06.230> just<00:02:07.230> did<00:02:07.440> that<00:02:07.620> the<00:02:07.740> spring<00:02:08.040> so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
we do things just did that the spring so

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.460 
we do things just did that the spring so
they've<00:02:09.180> gotten<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.810> little<00:02:10.080> different

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
they've gotten a little different

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.370 
they've gotten a little different
individual<00:02:10.979> work<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.750> from<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.870> outside<00:02:13.020> and

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
individual work in from the outside and

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.690 
individual work in from the outside and
the<00:02:13.470> inside<00:02:13.500> receivers<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.490> what<00:02:14.580> we're

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
the inside receivers and what we're

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.030 
the inside receivers and what we're
asking<00:02:14.820> them<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.180> do<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:15.540> more<00:02:16.040> specialization

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
asking them to do so more specialization

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.410 
asking them to do so more specialization
and<00:02:18.080> more<00:02:19.080> individual<00:02:19.860> route<00:02:20.330> work<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.600> think

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
and more individual route work I think

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.270 
and more individual route work I think
since<00:02:24.420> we're<00:02:24.630> practices<00:02:25.170> against<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.920> lot<00:02:26.100> more

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
since we're practices against a lot more

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.060 
since we're practices against a lot more
man-to-man<00:02:26.700> coverage<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:28.950> know

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
man-to-man coverage and it you know

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.790 
man-to-man coverage and it you know
that's<00:02:29.550> helped<00:02:29.850> us<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:31.110> because<00:02:31.470> you

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
so we get that work every day so I think

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.800 
so we get that work every day so I think
you<00:02:42.959> know<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.200> combination<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:44.270> our<00:02:45.270> skill

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
you know the combination of our skill

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.190 
you know the combination of our skill
level<00:02:46.170> on<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.770> perimeter<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.510> going<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.660> help

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
level on the perimeter is going to help

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.070 
level on the perimeter is going to help
not<00:02:49.530> only<00:02:51.680> our<00:02:52.680> defense<00:02:53.130> in<00:02:53.400> our<00:02:53.660> corners<00:02:54.660> get

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
not only our defense in our corners get

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.260 
not only our defense in our corners get
better<00:02:55.370> based<00:02:56.370> on<00:02:56.550> what<00:02:56.730> we're<00:02:56.880> working<00:02:57.060> on

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270
