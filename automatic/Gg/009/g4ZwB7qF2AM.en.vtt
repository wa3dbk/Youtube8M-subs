00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:08.180
 in my most restless dreams look at that 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.180
 city 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.260
 silent hill 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.050
 you promised to take me back here some 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.580
 day 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.580
 but you never did 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.260
 here 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.300
 Now I'm here alone 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.170
 in our place this dish 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.170
 waiting for you 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.100
 waiting for you to come see me 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.769
 but you never do it 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.550
 and I hope 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.879
 wrapped in my cocoon of pain and this 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.879
 age 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:58.390
 I'm asking you something terrible 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.390
 something for which you will never forgive me 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.199
 I wish I could change it 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.199
 you have impossible 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.719
 I feel so pathetic and horrible here 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.719
 lying down waiting for you 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.700
 every day he contemplated the cracks that there are 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:25.760
 on the roof and all I can think 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.760
 it's how unfair this is 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.200
 the doctor has had today 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.810
 he told me he could go home some 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.470
 how many days 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.370
 it's not that better 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.400
 I hope this is maybe my last 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.400
 opportunity 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.049
 I think you know what I mean 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:55.040
 Nonetheless 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.300
 I'm happy to go home 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.300
 missed very much 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.250
 but I have james diet 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.300
 diet that you really do not want to 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.690
 go home 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.590
 whenever you come to see me I see how hard 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.590
 what is for you 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.880
 I do not know if you hate me man with sufferings 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.170
 part 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.170
 it's art replenishes 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:39.330
 and I'm sorry I'm so sorry 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.330
 when I found out that I was going to die 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.650
 he would tell me to accept it 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:51.200
 it was always tied 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:54.970
 and attack those who loved me the most 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.970
 that virtue james 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.830
 that's why I would understand that you hate me 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.850
 but I want the thrips strains 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.060
 always love You 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.150
 even if our life as a couple had 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.150
 the ending that he had 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.860
 I would not change it for anything in the world 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.030
 together we had wonderful years 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.750
 This letter is getting longer 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.980
 Y 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.980
 I'm going to say goodbye 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.180
 recite the nurse to give it to you when 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.180
 I am no longer 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.849
 that means when you read it 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.849
 I'll be dead already 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.540
 I can not ask you to remember me 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.080
 but the idea that not 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.080
 forget 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.290
 in recent years since the Internet 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.470
 I regret so much in the one that I made to you 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.759
 of the two 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.850
 changes state so much I will be able to 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.850
 return from nothing 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.430
 that's why I want you to live your life now 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.880
 or whatever is better for you james 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.150
 James 

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:12.119
 this is not good
