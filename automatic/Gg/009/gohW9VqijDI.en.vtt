00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
functionality of the computer such as

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.660 
functionality of the computer such as
spooler<00:01:00.570> principle<00:01:01.079> there's<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.289> common<00:01:01.620> one

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.340 

there<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.850> print<00:01:06.270> spooler<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.229> can

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
there it is print spooler and you can

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.500 
there it is print spooler and you can
see<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:07.710> listed<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.250> spooler<00:01:08.909> so

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
see that it's listed as spooler so

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.640 
see that it's listed as spooler so
that'll<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:09.840> important<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.350> service

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
that'll be important in this service

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.760 
that'll be important in this service
name<00:01:11.270> which<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.390> listed<00:01:12.720> right<00:01:12.750> there

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
name which is listed right there

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.830 
name which is listed right there
say<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.400> example<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:15.030> ECP<00:01:15.390> i've<00:01:15.509> used<00:01:15.689> that

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
say for example the ECP i've used that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.310 
say for example the ECP i've used that
one<00:01:15.990> before<00:01:16.400> that's<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.670> DHCP<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.960> fun

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
one before that's just DHCP it's a fun

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.749 
one before that's just DHCP it's a fun
one<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.830> turn<00:01:19.979> off<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.340> other<00:01:20.430> people's

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
one to turn off on other people's

school
and<00:02:11.340> generally<00:02:12.340> sometimes<00:02:12.670> your<00:02:12.849> sometimes

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
and generally sometimes your sometimes

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.940 
and generally sometimes your sometimes
your<00:02:13.569> printer<00:02:13.780> will<00:02:13.959> get<00:02:14.110> jacked<00:02:14.379> up<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.830> you

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
your printer will get jacked up and you

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.559 
your printer will get jacked up and you
need<00:02:15.099> to<00:02:15.190> restart<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.730> spooler<00:02:15.940> service<00:02:16.060> so

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
need to restart the spooler service so

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.750 
need to restart the spooler service so
this<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.900> just<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.200> quick<00:02:18.099> way<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.340> doing<00:02:18.459> it

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
this is just a quick way of doing it

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.949 
this is just a quick way of doing it
rather<00:02:18.909> than<00:02:19.150> go<00:02:19.330> into<00:02:20.430> services.msc<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.870> you

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
rather than go into services.msc so you

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.949 
rather than go into services.msc so you
can<00:02:23.110> restart<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.620> spooler<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.159> way

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
can restart the spooler that way

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:34.710 
can restart the spooler that way
like<00:02:25.959> I<00:02:25.989> say<00:02:26.170> net<00:02:26.470> stop<00:02:29.280> browser<00:02:30.280> oh<00:02:33.299> I<00:02:34.299> must

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
like I say net stop browser oh I must

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.059 
like I say net stop browser oh I must
have<00:02:34.870> turned<00:02:34.989> it<00:02:35.140> off<00:02:35.290> at<00:02:35.440> some<00:02:35.620> point<00:02:35.860> let's

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
have turned it off at some point let's

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.940 
have turned it off at some point let's
start<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.930> start<00:02:37.930> browser<00:02:40.049> there<00:02:41.049> we<00:02:41.170> go<00:02:41.349> net

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
start it start browser there we go net

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.580 
start it start browser there we go net
start<00:02:42.250> browser<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:43.720> that's<00:02:43.870> how<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.049> stop<00:02:44.349> and

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
start browser so that's how you stop and

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.390 
start browser so that's how you stop and
start<00:02:44.829> a<00:02:44.980> service<00:02:45.220> on<00:02:45.579> a<00:02:46.590> command<00:02:47.590> line<00:02:47.860> using

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
start a service on a command line using

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.970 
start a service on a command line using
the<00:02:48.549> net<00:02:48.879> stop<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.450> net<00:02:49.599> start<00:02:49.900> command<00:02:50.170> so

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
the net stop and net start command so

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.170 
the net stop and net start command so
hopefully<00:02:51.400> you've<00:02:51.519> learned<00:02:51.579> something<00:02:51.879> from
