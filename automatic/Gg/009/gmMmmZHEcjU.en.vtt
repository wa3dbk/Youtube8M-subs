00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.600 
certainly i'm a big proponent of
graphics<00:00:34.770> because<00:00:34.860> that's<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.130> big<00:00:35.309> strength

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
graphics because that's a big strength

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.910 
graphics because that's a big strength
of<00:00:35.760> ours<00:00:35.910> but<00:00:36.390> clearly<00:00:36.660> what<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.530> in

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
of ours but clearly what we do is in in

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.130 
of ours but clearly what we do is in in
our<00:00:38.129> own<00:00:38.280> games<00:00:38.550> ism<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:39.120> put<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> gameplay<00:00:39.899> in

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
our own games ism we put the gameplay in

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.410 
our own games ism we put the gameplay in
we<00:00:40.559> try<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.860> make<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.129> fun<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.969> work<00:00:42.210> in

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
we try to make it fun we work in

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.299 
we try to make it fun we work in
elements<00:00:42.809> from<00:00:42.899> past<00:00:43.200> games<00:00:43.530> we<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> lot<00:00:44.250> of

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
elements from past games we do a lot of

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.459 
elements from past games we do a lot of
prototyping<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.120> lot<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.390> playing<00:00:45.690> around<00:00:45.899> to

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
prototyping a lot of playing around to

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.860 
prototyping a lot of playing around to
make<00:00:46.620> sure<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:46.920> right<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.399> fun<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
make sure it's just right just fun the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.360 
make sure it's just right just fun the
idea<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.559> more<00:00:49.800> important<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.219> us

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
idea is that it's more important for us

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.069 
idea is that it's more important for us
to<00:00:50.399> make<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:51.120> awesome<00:00:51.300> really<00:00:51.840> fun

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
to make a really awesome really fun

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.229 
to make a really awesome really fun
amazing<00:00:52.230> game<00:00:52.680> then<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.579> show<00:00:54.120> off

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
amazing game then it is to show off

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.729 
amazing game then it is to show off
really<00:00:54.420> great<00:00:54.660> graphics<00:00:55.050> early<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
really great graphics early on in the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.979

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
our time with it because this is the

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.950 
our time with it because this is the
first<00:01:37.960> one<00:01:38.970> that's<00:01:39.970> being<00:01:40.240> done<00:01:40.420> completely

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
first one that's being done completely

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.779 
first one that's being done completely
in-house<00:01:41.380> by<00:01:41.649> epic<00:01:41.979> in<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.189> past<00:01:42.399> as<00:01:42.580> you<00:01:42.670> know

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
in-house by epic in the past as you know

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.700 
in-house by epic in the past as you know
we<00:01:42.880> work<00:01:43.060> with<00:01:43.240> digital<00:01:43.570> extremes<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.200> so

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
we work with digital extremes and so

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.080 
we work with digital extremes and so
it's<00:01:44.860> really<00:01:44.950> important<00:01:45.520> for<00:01:45.580> us<00:01:45.670> plus<00:01:45.939> the

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
it's really important for us plus the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.029 
it's really important for us plus the
first<00:01:46.330> one<00:01:46.509> in<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.720> next<00:01:47.049> generation<00:01:47.530> it's

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
first one in the next generation it's
