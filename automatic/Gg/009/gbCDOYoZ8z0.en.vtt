00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
then we have the parallel twister for

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:40.690 
then we have the parallel twister for
our<00:02:39.840> seeker<00:02:40.260> err

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
least one more number card one that's a

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.000 
least one more number card one that's a
little<00:02:44.970> different<00:02:45.180> than<00:02:45.569> what<00:02:45.690> we<00:02:45.870> are<00:02:46.010> mainly

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
little different than what we are mainly

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.369 
little different than what we are mainly
hoping<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.489> get<00:02:47.609> a<00:02:47.670> cork<00:02:47.940> number<00:02:48.269> 95<00:02:48.900> that's

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
hoping to get a cork number 95 that's

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.559 
hoping to get a cork number 95 that's
the<00:02:49.500> speed<00:02:49.799> that<00:02:50.730> might<00:02:50.940> be<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.120> best<00:02:51.269> card<00:02:51.510> of

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
the speed that might be the best card of

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.960 
the speed that might be the best card of
the<00:02:51.660> set<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:52.109> guess<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.379> could<00:02:52.470> be<00:02:52.530> debatable

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
the set I guess that could be debatable

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.130 
the set I guess that could be debatable
those<00:02:53.970> lever<00:02:54.269> again<00:02:54.660> we<00:02:54.780> have<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.989> other

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.509 
believe what's the name of it something
like<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.829> of<00:03:07.950> course<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.220> can't<00:03:08.400> read

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
like that of course I can't read

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.890 
like that of course I can't read
Japanese<00:03:08.549> but<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.150> believe<00:03:09.329> that<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.659> the<00:03:09.690> name

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
Japanese but I believe that is the name

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.520 
Japanese but I believe that is the name
of<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:10.079> card

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
of this card

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.500 
of this card
so<00:03:10.799> yeah<00:03:10.920> unfortunately<00:03:11.069> only<00:03:11.849> got<00:03:12.090> really

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
so yeah unfortunately only got really

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.000 
so yeah unfortunately only got really
one<00:03:12.720> number<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.049> credits<00:03:13.319> we<00:03:13.409> got<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.560> comic

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
one number of credits we got a comic

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.530 
one number of credits we got a comic
version<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.459> secret<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:14.970> that's<00:03:15.120> cool

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
version of in a secret so that's cool

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.880 
version of in a secret so that's cool
but<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:15.900> was<00:03:16.200> kind<00:03:16.319> of<00:03:16.349> open<00:03:16.530> for<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.769> other

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890
