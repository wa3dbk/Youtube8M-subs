00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
more for an RV generator just because it

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
inverter generators that you can get

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.350 
inverter generators that you can get
from<00:01:19.590> hub<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.009> Yamaha<00:01:20.430> any<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> other<00:01:21.180> ones

from hub to Yamaha any of the other ones

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.679 
from hub to Yamaha any of the other ones
are<00:01:21.710> much<00:01:22.710> much<00:01:22.950> quieter<00:01:23.250> by<00:01:23.729> 20<00:01:24.390> or<00:01:24.509> 30

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
are much much quieter by 20 or 30

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.109 
are much much quieter by 20 or 30
decibels<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.710> extremely<00:01:26.490> quiet<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.000> can

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
decibels that is extremely quiet you can

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.190 
decibels that is extremely quiet you can
stand<00:01:27.390> next<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.750> them<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.049> have<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
stand next to them and have a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.429 
stand next to them and have a
conversation<00:01:28.579> plus<00:01:29.579> they<00:01:30.060> sip<00:01:30.450> gas<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.350> you

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
conversation plus they sip gas so you

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.960 
conversation plus they sip gas so you
might<00:01:31.770> only<00:01:31.979> burn<00:01:32.280> through<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> gallon<00:01:32.909> of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
might only burn through a gallon of

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.910 
might only burn through a gallon of
gasoline<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> whole<00:01:33.869> day<00:01:34.079> hmm

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
gasoline and a whole day hmm

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.620 
gasoline and a whole day hmm
so<00:01:35.070> even<00:01:35.369> though<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.729> may<00:01:35.850> cost<00:01:36.090> two<00:01:36.329> or<00:01:36.479> three

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
so even though it may cost two or three

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.240 
so even though it may cost two or three
times<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.079> much<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.710> these<00:01:37.799> suitcase

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
times as much for one of these suitcase

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.999 
times as much for one of these suitcase
generators<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.509> will<00:01:39.659> be<00:01:39.780> much<00:01:40.170> much<00:01:40.439> happier

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
generators you will be much much happier

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.460 
generators you will be much much happier
with<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.189> rather<00:01:41.909> than<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.509> loud<00:01:42.750> contractor

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
with that rather than a loud contractor

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.789 
with that rather than a loud contractor
generator<00:01:43.860> yeah<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.399> think<00:01:44.790> your<00:01:44.909> your

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
generator yeah and I think your your

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.050 
generator yeah and I think your your
fellow<00:01:46.799> campers<00:01:47.280> will<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> lot<00:01:47.759> happier

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
fellow campers will be a lot happier

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.770 
fellow campers will be a lot happier
with<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.420> too

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
with you too

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
with you too
they<00:01:49.110> will<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.500> much<00:01:49.860> happier<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.490> mean<00:01:50.850> I've

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
they will be much happier I mean I've
