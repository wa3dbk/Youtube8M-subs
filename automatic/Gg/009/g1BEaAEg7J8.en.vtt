00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.830 
thing I'd recommend going with a mini
lathe<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.850> lot<00:01:21.090> less<00:01:21.300> money<00:01:21.510> than<00:01:21.810> a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
lathe it's a lot less money than a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.990 
lathe it's a lot less money than a
larger<00:01:22.230> late<00:01:22.440> but<00:01:22.980> it<00:01:23.100> still<00:01:23.340> does<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.550> lot<00:01:23.850> of

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
larger late but it still does a lot of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.750 
larger late but it still does a lot of
great<00:01:24.180> projects<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:24.930> pins<00:01:25.350> cups<00:01:25.980> little

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
great projects like pins cups little

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
to do bigger bigger projects possibly so

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.350 
to do bigger bigger projects possibly so
you<00:01:37.830> move<00:01:38.070> into<00:01:38.220> maybe<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.550> MIDI<00:01:38.820> lathe<00:01:39.120> and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
you move into maybe a MIDI lathe and

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.780 
you move into maybe a MIDI lathe and
this<00:01:39.870> lathe<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> very<00:01:40.650> nice<00:01:40.830> style<00:01:41.190> a<00:01:41.520> that

out<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.209> right<00:02:37.420> but<00:02:37.900> look<00:02:38.140> what<00:02:38.320> happened

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
out of it right but look what happened

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.730 
out of it right but look what happened
it<00:02:38.920> cracked<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:40.180> wood<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.690> wet<00:02:40.750> when<00:02:41.560> it's

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
it cracked the wood is wet when it's

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.949 
it cracked the wood is wet when it's
brand-new<00:02:42.190> in<00:02:42.400> green<00:02:42.700> so<00:02:43.240> it's<00:02:43.420> losing

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
brand-new in green so it's losing

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.740 
brand-new in green so it's losing
moisture<00:02:44.200> like<00:02:44.740> that<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.400> cracks<00:02:45.790> what<00:02:46.570> you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
moisture like that so it cracks what you

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.410 
moisture like that so it cracks what you
need<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.080> prevent<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.500> cracking<00:02:48.010> is

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
need to prevent the cracking is

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.350 
need to prevent the cracking is
something<00:02:49.530> called<00:02:50.530> Greenwood<00:02:51.070> sealer<00:02:51.489> and<00:02:51.670> it

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
something called Greenwood sealer and it

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.830 
something called Greenwood sealer and it
looks<00:02:52.570> a<00:02:52.720> little<00:02:52.959> bit<00:02:53.320> like<00:02:53.670> milk<00:02:54.670> but<00:02:55.630> it's<00:02:55.750> an

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
looks a little bit like milk but it's an

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.350 
looks a little bit like milk but it's an
emulsion<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.590> what<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.580> does<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.180> helps

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
emulsion and what it does is it helps

seal up the pores of the wood the woods

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.040 
seal up the pores of the wood the woods
kind<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.120> like<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.270> straw<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.780> starts

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
kind of like a straw and it starts

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.120 
kind of like a straw and it starts
leaking<00:03:02.230> all<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.680> water

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
leaking all that water

leaking all that water
well<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.150> will<00:03:04.270> keep<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.690> from<00:03:04.920> cracking

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
well that will keep it from cracking

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.100 
well that will keep it from cracking
they'll<00:03:06.400> slow<00:03:06.640> it<00:03:06.790> down<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:07.780> other<00:03:07.900> thing

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
they'll slow it down the other thing

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.050 
they'll slow it down the other thing
