00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.110
 hello girls welcome to another Friday 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.090
 solid fashion drive I am guided and 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.610
 as you already know and we are almost 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.750
 coming to winter and that means 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.449
 two things a cold and the second gifts 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.670
 many small that's why in this 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.830
 video I wanted to put together those two little things 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.869
 and first I'm going to show you some 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.029
 small winter tips that I usually 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.890
 use a lot and I think that you too 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.780
 they could serve them and the second thing that they did not 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.760
 you can lose that is something that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.129
 was announcing all the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.219
 week and finally I'm going to do it is a 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.809
 mega raffle that has some prizes 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.300
 very good at the end of this video is going 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.640
 explain more details what it contains and 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.230
 How can they participate? Well, I'm going to 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.980
 leave with the video and I hope that you 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.980
 like the tips 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.490
 the fact that it is winter does not prevent 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.830
 that we can use skirts only add 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.050
 some stockings that combine with your outfit and 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.790
 you will give a great change to your look you use 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.680
 shoes the same color as stockings 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.280
 so your legs look longer 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.280
 10 days 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.170
 You can also wear short socks or 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.390
 socks combined with some 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.520
 shoes of the same color so you can 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.590
 create a booty effect and get more 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.580
 benefit to your shoes at a glance 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.580
 others will look 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.750
 to take care of your country coats and over 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.000
 all the dark clothes where usually 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.220
 notice more fluffs just 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.200
 you need to pass a roller with adhesive 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.759
 like this one and that is that the garments of 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.090
 winter they spend a lot of time in the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.679
 closet and it's very easy to wrap 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.390
 also if you have a pet you will come 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.590
 great and you can also 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.590
 get in the super 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.240
 if you're going through a lot of cold and you want 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.179
 complement all your bags and jackets 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.490
 just add with a pair of insurance a 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.560
 Synthetic fur collar like this 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.310
 to show off your clothes much more 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.979
 winter 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.319
 If you do not have one you can do it yourself 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.319
 besides I love how it looks 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.390
 the winter I like to dress 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.880
 dark colors but sometimes 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.040
 look too repetitive is why 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.330
 that from time to time I try to add to 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.330
 my outfit a striking color 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.920
 this time choose to use a clutch with a 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.740
 stamped autumn leaves and ones 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.150
 Red shoes 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.460
