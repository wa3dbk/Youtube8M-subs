rapid pulsar now this is a really cool

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.770 
rapid pulsar now this is a really cool
thing<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.070> can<00:00:47.219> do<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.700> i'm<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.690> to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
thing that you can do and i'm going to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.770 
thing that you can do and i'm going to
show<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.899> guys<00:00:49.110> how<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.320> work<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.570> now<00:00:51.570> what

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
show you guys how to work it now what

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.090 
show you guys how to work it now what
i'm<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.199> guys<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.620> i'm<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.920> going

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
i'm going to do guys is i'm just going

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.310 
i'm going to do guys is i'm just going
to<00:00:53.190> take<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.730> off<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.809> pistons

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
to take that off so that the pistons

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.439 
to take that off so that the pistons
stop<00:00:55.800> working<00:00:56.219> because<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.090> lot<00:00:57.390> of

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
stop working because that is a lot of

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.900 
stop working because that is a lot of
noise<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.129> guys<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.430> see<00:00:59.489> i<00:00:59.699> have

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
noise and as you guys can see i have

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.349 
noise and as you guys can see i have
numbered<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.710> input<00:01:02.250> with<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> number<00:01:03.030> so

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
numbered the the input with a number so

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.570 
numbered the the input with a number so
you've<00:01:03.510> got<00:01:03.539> number<00:01:04.350> one<00:01:04.559> number<00:01:04.830> two<00:01:04.979> number

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you've got number one number two number

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.570 
you've got number one number two number
three<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.659> number<00:01:06.689> four<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.439> they<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.520> to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
three and number four and they go to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.000 
three and number four and they go to
their<00:01:08.880> representative<00:01:09.750> number<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.560> their

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
their representative number for their

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.000 
their representative number for their
piston<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.270> that's<00:01:12.420> how<00:01:12.600> i've<00:01:12.750> set<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.350> now

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
piston so that's how i've set it out now

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.940 
piston so that's how i've set it out now
when<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.119> comes<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> rapid<00:01:15.930> pulsar<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.710> soon

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
when it comes to a rapid pulsar as soon

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.620 
when it comes to a rapid pulsar as soon
as<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.220> put<00:01:17.400> some<00:01:17.580> redstone<00:01:17.820> dust<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
as you put some redstone dust in the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.560 
as you put some redstone dust in the
middle<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.560> see<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.970> pulsar

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
middle you can see that the pulsar

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.039 
middle you can see that the pulsar
device<00:01:21.930> picks<00:01:22.710> random<00:01:23.070> wires<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:23.939> random<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
device picks random wires at random and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.050 
device picks random wires at random and
the<00:01:25.290> cool<00:01:25.500> thing<00:01:25.530> about<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.670> when

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the cool thing about this is that when

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.270 
the cool thing about this is that when
you<00:01:27.180> set<00:01:27.420> up<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.750> mechanism<00:01:28.290> there's<00:01:28.920> always

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
you set up this mechanism there's always

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.240 
you set up this mechanism there's always
two<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.299> sit<00:01:30.509> picks<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.079> lot<00:01:31.290> there's<00:01:31.770> one<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
two to sit picks a lot there's one it

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.120 
two to sit picks a lot there's one it
picks<00:01:32.549> rarely<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:34.049> one<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.650> picks<00:01:35.009> is

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
picks rarely and this one it picks is

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.060 
picks rarely and this one it picks is
even<00:01:35.520> rarer<00:01:35.790> than<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.380> why<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
even rarer than that so that is why is a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.420 
even rarer than that so that is why is a
very<00:01:38.729> good<00:01:38.900> mechanism<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.320> use<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.100> i'm<00:01:41.189> going

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
very good mechanism to use and i'm going

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.810 
very good mechanism to use and i'm going
to<00:01:41.490> show<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.729> guys<00:01:41.850> how<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:43.020> works<00:01:43.610> so<00:01:44.610> all<00:01:44.790> you

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
to show you guys how it works so all you

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.319 
to show you guys how it works so all you
got<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.360> very<00:01:46.110> simply<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:47.880> got<00:01:48.090> to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
got to do very simply is you got to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.020 
got to do very simply is you got to
place<00:01:49.229> one<00:01:49.710> block<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.250> anything<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.909> doesn't

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
place one block of anything it doesn't

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.359 
place one block of anything it doesn't
matter<00:01:51.270> what<00:01:51.479> block<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.049> i'm<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.189> using

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
matter what block it is i'm just using

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.340 
matter what block it is i'm just using
laughter<00:01:53.850> zuly<00:01:54.270> because<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.899> pretty<00:01:55.110> cool

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
laughter zuly because it's pretty cool

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.830 
laughter zuly because it's pretty cool
up<00:01:55.560> mr.<00:01:55.890> Zhu<00:01:56.040> Li<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.399> what<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.450> gotta<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.810> is

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
up mr. Zhu Li and what you gotta do is

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.510 
up mr. Zhu Li and what you gotta do is
you<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.140> place<00:01:58.320> redstone<00:01:58.590> torches<00:01:59.159> all

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
you have to place redstone torches all

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.660 
you have to place redstone torches all
the<00:01:59.759> way<00:01:59.850> around<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.659> block<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.710> claps<00:02:02.040> ok

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the way around the block like claps ok

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.450 
the way around the block like claps ok
and<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.840> fairly<00:02:04.110> simple<00:02:04.590> contraption<00:02:05.340> as

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
and it's a fairly simple contraption as

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.399 
and it's a fairly simple contraption as
well<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.880> another<00:02:06.390> good<00:02:06.630> reason<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:07.200> like

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
well I is another good reason to like

please like the video if you enjoy
with<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.450> video<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.319> redstone<00:02:13.620> tutorial

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
with the video this redstone tutorial

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.720 
with the video this redstone tutorial
and<00:02:14.540> all<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.660> got<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.930> do<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.110> place<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:17.010> lapis

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
and all you got to do is place the lapis

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.479 
and all you got to do is place the lapis
lazuli<00:02:17.959> blocks<00:02:18.959> or<00:02:19.379> any<00:02:19.620> block<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.280> you're

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
lazuli blocks or any block that you're

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.390 
lazuli blocks or any block that you're
using<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:21.090> top<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.780> those<00:02:22.319> redstone<00:02:22.890> torches

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
using on top of those redstone torches

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.850 
using on top of those redstone torches
now<00:02:23.940> obviously<00:02:24.030> you'll<00:02:24.420> want<00:02:24.660> light<00:02:25.230> outputs

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
now obviously you'll want light outputs

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.070 
now obviously you'll want light outputs
from<00:02:26.069> these<00:02:26.340> give<00:02:27.060> some<00:02:27.269> wire<00:02:27.540> or<00:02:27.959> something

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
from these give some wire or something

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.430 
from these give some wire or something
like<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.640> there<00:02:29.640> we<00:02:29.730> go<00:02:29.879> now<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:31.200> way<00:02:31.379> you

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
like that there we go now the way you

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.820 
like that there we go now the way you
start<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.280> Pulsar<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.060> need<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.420> place

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
start the Pulsar is you need to place

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.220 
start the Pulsar is you need to place
some<00:02:34.830> redstone<00:02:35.069> in<00:02:35.730> here<00:02:36.209> now<00:02:36.660> as<00:02:36.810> soon<00:02:36.989> as<00:02:37.110> you

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
some redstone in here now as soon as you

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.820 
some redstone in here now as soon as you
do<00:02:37.379> that<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.830> can<00:02:38.040> see<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:39.830> thing

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
do that you can see that the thing

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.360 
do that you can see that the thing
starts<00:02:41.310> moving<00:02:41.879> now<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.420> can<00:02:42.810> see<00:02:43.650> here<00:02:44.069> guys

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
starts moving now you can see here guys

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.550 
starts moving now you can see here guys
that<00:02:44.700> these<00:02:44.970> two<00:02:45.299> torches<00:02:45.720> here<00:02:45.989> are<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.319> ones

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
that these two torches here are the ones

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.280 
that these two torches here are the ones
that<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.920> uses<00:02:47.160> fairly<00:02:47.819> common<00:02:48.209> this<00:02:49.019> is<00:02:49.170> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
that it uses fairly common this is the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.319 
that it uses fairly common this is the
one<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.560> uses<00:02:49.950> rarely<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:50.880> one<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
one it uses rarely and this one is the

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.140 
one it uses rarely and this one is the
one<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:51.780> uses<00:02:52.079> even<00:02:52.620> rarer<00:02:52.950> than<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.430> so

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
one that uses even rarer than that so

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.440 
one that uses even rarer than that so
this<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.959> rapid<00:02:55.560> pulsar<00:02:56.370> now<00:02:56.940> here's<00:02:57.299> a

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
this is the rapid pulsar now here's a

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.600 
this is the rapid pulsar now here's a
pretty<00:02:57.810> cool<00:02:58.110> mechanism<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.069> can<00:02:59.250> use

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
pretty cool mechanism that you can use

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.089 
pretty cool mechanism that you can use
and<00:02:59.849> you<00:02:59.940> guys<00:03:00.150> might<00:03:00.450> be<00:03:00.599> asking<00:03:00.989> what

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
and you guys might be asking what

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.949 
and you guys might be asking what
applications<00:03:02.099> you<00:03:02.280> can<00:03:02.310> do<00:03:02.640> with<00:03:02.819> this<00:03:03.030> well

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
applications you can do with this well

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.580 
applications you can do with this well
if<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.260> want<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.590> incorporate<00:03:05.310> some<00:03:06.590> sort

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
if you want to incorporate some sort

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.400 
if you want to incorporate some sort
some<00:03:07.920> sort<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.340> thing<00:03:08.549> which<00:03:09.239> is<00:03:09.269> make<00:03:10.019> like

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
some sort of thing which is make like

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.460 
some sort of thing which is make like
with<00:03:10.650> chance<00:03:11.099> or<00:03:11.519> something<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.440> can

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
with chance or something and you can

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.390 
with chance or something and you can
make<00:03:13.799> it<00:03:14.099> oh<00:03:15.269> what<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.540> hell<00:03:16.079> that<00:03:17.069> just

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
make it oh what the hell that just

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.309 
make it oh what the hell that just
came<00:03:17.819> on<00:03:18.120> for<00:03:18.389> some<00:03:18.600> reason<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:18.989> don't<00:03:19.049> even

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
came on for some reason I don't even

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.129 
came on for some reason I don't even
know<00:03:19.590> why<00:03:20.000> that<00:03:21.000> was<00:03:21.150> really<00:03:21.450> strange<00:03:21.750> the

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
know why that was really strange the

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.890 
know why that was really strange the
creeper<00:03:22.500> just<00:03:22.940> hit<00:03:23.940> buddy<00:03:24.150> stepped<00:03:24.600> on<00:03:24.780> the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
creeper just hit buddy stepped on the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.190 
creeper just hit buddy stepped on the
wire<00:03:25.109> that's<00:03:25.530> really<00:03:25.799> weird<00:03:25.980> anyway<00:03:26.970> if<00:03:27.930> you

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
wire that's really weird anyway if you

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.289 
wire that's really weird anyway if you
want<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.530> incorporate<00:03:28.799> some<00:03:29.400> random<00:03:29.910> chance

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
want to incorporate some random chance

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.960 
want to incorporate some random chance
within<00:03:31.109> your<00:03:31.470> redstone<00:03:31.889> contraptions<00:03:32.730> this

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
within your redstone contraptions this

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.849 
within your redstone contraptions this
is<00:03:33.150> one<00:03:33.359> way<00:03:33.599> that<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.959> can<00:03:34.079> do<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.620> because

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
is one way that you can do it because

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.539 
is one way that you can do it because
two<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:36.299> outputs<00:03:36.989> from<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.410> machine<00:03:37.829> can

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
two of the outputs from the machine can

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.449 
two of the outputs from the machine can
be<00:03:38.730> very<00:03:39.000> common<00:03:39.510> one<00:03:39.840> can<00:03:40.139> be<00:03:40.380> rare<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:41.160> one

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
be very common one can be rare and one

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.270 
be very common one can be rare and one
can<00:03:41.760> be<00:03:41.910> super<00:03:42.540> rare<00:03:42.750> so<00:03:43.410> it's<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.709> pretty<00:03:43.889> cool

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
can be super rare so it's a pretty cool

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.120 
can be super rare so it's a pretty cool
mechanism<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.630> let's<00:03:46.019> say<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.290> can<00:03:46.650> strap

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
mechanism so let's say you can strap

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.039 
mechanism so let's say you can strap
these<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.639> a<00:03:47.669> dispenser<00:03:48.359> that<00:03:48.510> has<00:03:48.720> iron

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
these to a dispenser that has iron

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.629 
these to a dispenser that has iron
ingots<00:03:49.500> in<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.829> you<00:03:49.950> could<00:03:50.069> have<00:03:50.160> this<00:03:50.370> one

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
ingots in it you could have this one

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.360 
ingots in it you could have this one
strapped<00:03:51.389> to<00:03:51.569> a<00:03:51.599> dispenser<00:03:52.319> with<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.919> gold

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
strapped to a dispenser with a gold

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.949 
strapped to a dispenser with a gold
ingot<00:03:53.669> Annette<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.269> this<00:03:54.359> one<00:03:54.720> could<00:03:54.930> be

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
ingot Annette and this one could be

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.650 
ingot Annette and this one could be
diamond<00:03:55.560> or<00:03:55.950> something<00:03:56.430> like<00:03:56.549> that<00:03:56.609> you<00:03:57.450> guys

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
diamond or something like that you guys

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.159 
diamond or something like that you guys
get<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.079> picture<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:58.739> they're<00:03:59.040> absolutely

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
get the picture and they're absolutely

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.930 
get the picture and they're absolutely
infinite<00:04:01.169> amounts<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:01.889> applications<00:04:02.730> with

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
infinite amounts of applications with

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.569 
infinite amounts of applications with
this<00:04:03.180> rapid<00:04:03.870> pulse<00:04:04.139> a<00:04:04.349> device<00:04:04.739> so<00:04:05.370> hopefully

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
this rapid pulse a device so hopefully

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.940 
this rapid pulse a device so hopefully
this<00:04:05.910> was<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.299> fairly<00:04:06.690> useful<00:04:07.019> tutorial<00:04:07.739> and

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
this was a fairly useful tutorial and
