00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:10.759
 Today we are going to point out 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:12.159
 how do i know if messi 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:16.169
 the cider unlike other drinks that are poured directly the glass there 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:17.810
 what to skimp 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.579
 scalped estranged bouquets is not getting 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:21.640
 a 5 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.199
 and it will decide not the theater in a glass a certain height 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.849
 so they are required 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.849
 and strengthen your health 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.900
 The first thing we have to do is have a good bottle of cider 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.900
 which we will open as a corkscrew 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.130
 and we will teach how to sound the alarms 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.560
 - axis not of law 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.710
 mixes with coal and with ribbons 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.140
 acquiring this 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.830
 by the characteristics of a soft drink 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.500
 this is escancia 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.320
 good to pour cider we need a step like this 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.020
 and a bottle of cider 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.520
 the position in which we should grab the bottle 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.210
 it will always be like this 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.640
 in this way will allow us 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.550
 controlled the verticality of the bottle 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.930
 create a thread 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.870
 that does not wiggle 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.870
 how not to do it 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.810
 a little inclined 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.220
 to make them and the background 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.970
 and so you can escape 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.970
 the position in which we have to position ourselves is a position 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.540
 straight but yes be rigid 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.760
 we must try 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.360
 over the glass making him cider break the glass ass 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.260
 that ideas are not concerned 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.010
 But that's what it is 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.010
 and you have to see it quickly so you do not lose the woman 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.580
 correctly scaled the city 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.409
 we only have left
