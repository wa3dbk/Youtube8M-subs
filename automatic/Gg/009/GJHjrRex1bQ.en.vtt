00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that I mean it is internal you will see

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.920 
that I mean it is internal you will see
this<00:01:30.900> little<00:01:31.049> filter<00:01:32.180> let<00:01:33.180> me<00:01:33.270> get<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> new<00:01:33.689> one

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
this little filter let me get a new one

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.960 
this little filter let me get a new one
this<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.130> way<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:35.460> supposed<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> look

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
this is the way it's supposed to look

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.420 
this is the way it's supposed to look
like<00:01:36.049> like<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:40.380> here's<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> backside

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
like like this and here's the backside

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.149 
like like this and here's the backside
of<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.200> we<00:01:43.200> see<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.680> been<00:01:43.829> pushed

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
of it and we see that it's been pushed

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.210 
of it and we see that it's been pushed
to<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> opposite<00:01:44.970> direction<00:01:45.710> if<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.799> flip<00:01:47.070> this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
to the opposite direction if I flip this

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.580 
to the opposite direction if I flip this
thing<00:01:47.280> over<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:50.820> filters<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:51.590> you're

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
thing over the filters in here you're

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.260 
thing over the filters in here you're
probably<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:52.890> going<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.070> be<00:01:53.189> able<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.430> see<00:01:54.060> it

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
probably not going to be able to see it

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.940 
probably not going to be able to see it
the<00:01:54.659> camera<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.229> probably<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.560> gonna<00:01:55.680> pick<00:01:55.920> it

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the camera is probably not gonna pick it

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.859 
the camera is probably not gonna pick it
up<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:56.790> let<00:01:56.909> me<00:01:57.000> let<00:01:57.180> me<00:01:57.240> go<00:01:57.360> ahead<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.600> push

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
up but let me let me go ahead and push

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.219 
up but let me let me go ahead and push
it<00:01:58.049> push<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.040> out<00:02:02.540> that<00:02:03.540> thing<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.079> way

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
it push it out that thing out of the way

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.459 
it push it out that thing out of the way
I<00:02:05.119> mean<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.420> see<00:02:06.600> right<00:02:06.810> here<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.229> way<00:02:07.350> it

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
I mean we can see right here the way it

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.089 
I mean we can see right here the way it
looks<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.039> mean<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.700> doesn't<00:02:08.940> he<00:02:09.390> doesn't<00:02:09.539> look

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
looks I mean it doesn't he doesn't look

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.770 
looks I mean it doesn't he doesn't look
he's<00:02:11.099> pushed<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.700> air<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> other<00:02:12.330> side

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.640 

you<00:02:15.780> see<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:19.110> inside<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
you see that the inside of the

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.700 
and this is the outcome of that so if
you're<00:04:45.930> having<00:04:46.080> issues<00:04:46.260> with<00:04:46.500> your

you're having issues with your
transmission<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:48.170> need<00:04:49.170> to<00:04:49.260> keep<00:04:49.440> driving<00:04:49.740> it

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
transmission and need to keep driving it

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.190 
transmission and need to keep driving it
more<00:04:50.880> likely<00:04:51.120> this<00:04:51.510> is<00:04:51.690> how<00:04:51.900> it's<00:04:52.050> going<00:04:52.140> to

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
more likely this is how it's going to

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.830 
more likely this is how it's going to
end<00:04:52.260> up<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.860> of<00:04:53.490> course<00:04:54.150> you<00:04:54.270> cost<00:04:54.570> more<00:04:54.780> money

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
end up and of course you cost more money

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.050 
end up and of course you cost more money

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
I mean the worse it gets the more cost

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.190
