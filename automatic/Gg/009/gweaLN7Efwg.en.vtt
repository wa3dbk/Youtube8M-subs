oops<00:00:21.869> I'll<00:00:22.830> be<00:00:23.070> using<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.640> as<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.449> root<00:00:24.750> stock

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
oops I'll be using this as a root stock

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.240 
oops I'll be using this as a root stock
for<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.859> large<00:00:26.550> plant<00:00:27.060> for<00:00:27.269> one<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.480> our<00:00:27.599> waffles

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
for a large plant for one of our waffles

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.810 
for a large plant for one of our waffles
so<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:30.000> already<00:00:30.359> growing<00:00:30.689> quite<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> lot<00:00:31.820> this

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
tip there so I'm hoping because I've got

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.310 
tip there so I'm hoping because I've got
a<00:00:40.110> whole<00:00:40.320> summer<00:00:41.129> time<00:00:41.430> ahead<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.140> rest

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
a whole summer time ahead and the rest

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.650 
a whole summer time ahead and the rest
of<00:00:43.440> spring<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.789> will<00:00:44.940> grow<00:00:45.090> even<00:00:45.510> more

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
of spring that it will grow even more

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.410 
of spring that it will grow even more
and<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.950> might<00:00:47.100> slip<00:00:47.370> off<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.579> top<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.270> create

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
and I might slip off the top to create

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.049 
and I might slip off the top to create
it<00:00:48.629> into<00:00:48.750> more<00:00:48.989> established<00:00:49.379> birch<00:00:49.730> bush<00:00:50.730> but

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
it into more established birch bush but

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.229 
it into more established birch bush but

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
remember this is a root stock so soon

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.299 
remember this is a root stock so soon
it'll<00:00:54.539> be<00:00:54.600> ready<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.140> grafting<00:00:55.680> would<00:00:56.160> that
