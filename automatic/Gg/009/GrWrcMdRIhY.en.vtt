the<00:04:54.020> reasons<00:04:54.440> to<00:04:54.590> do<00:04:54.710> a<00:04:54.740> lot<00:04:55.160> of<00:04:55.190> Coast<00:04:55.550> is<00:04:55.790> just

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
the reasons to do a lot of Coast is just

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.600 
the reasons to do a lot of Coast is just
to<00:04:56.150> ensure<00:04:56.330> that<00:04:57.160> everything<00:04:58.160> will<00:04:58.460> get

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
to ensure that everything will get

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.790 
to ensure that everything will get
repelled<00:04:59.000> I<00:04:59.240> am<00:04:59.420> not<00:04:59.660> sure<00:04:59.690> if<00:04:59.990> it<00:05:00.290> will<00:05:00.440> repel

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
repelled I am not sure if it will repel

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.610 
repelled I am not sure if it will repel

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
things clear i think there might be a

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.920 
things clear i think there might be a
little<00:06:01.790> misconceptions<00:06:02.600> and<00:06:02.690> a<00:06:02.780> lot<00:06:02.900> of

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
little misconceptions and a lot of

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.720 
little misconceptions and a lot of
people<00:06:03.260> are<00:06:03.320> gonna<00:06:03.410> ask<00:06:03.500> me<00:06:03.770> this<00:06:03.890> question<00:06:03.950> so

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
people are gonna ask me this question so

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.690 
people are gonna ask me this question so
i<00:06:04.990> only<00:06:05.990> did<00:06:06.230> the<00:06:06.410> toe<00:06:06.650> box<00:06:06.830> on<00:06:07.160> that<00:06:07.430> shoe

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
i only did the toe box on that shoe

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.909 
i only did the toe box on that shoe
because<00:06:07.910> the<00:06:08.630> toe<00:06:08.840> box<00:06:09.020> was<00:06:09.290> the<00:06:09.440> only<00:06:09.560> part

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
because the toe box was the only part

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.480 
because the toe box was the only part
that<00:06:09.980> was<00:06:10.220> swayed<00:06:10.630> um<00:06:11.630> so<00:06:12.380> basically<00:06:12.680> feel

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
that was swayed um so basically feel
