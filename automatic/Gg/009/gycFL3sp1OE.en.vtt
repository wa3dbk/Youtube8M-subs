of really a part of the landscape
this<00:02:47.620> part<00:02:47.860> of<00:02:47.980> Madison<00:02:48.129> County<00:02:48.780> really<00:02:49.780> is

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
this part of Madison County really is

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.289 
this part of Madison County really is
the<00:02:50.530> vernacular<00:02:50.799> architecture<00:02:51.129> is<00:02:51.790> based<00:02:52.030> on

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
the vernacular architecture is based on

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.619 
the vernacular architecture is based on
farm<00:02:53.230> structures<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:53.920> barns<00:02:54.370> now<00:02:55.269> we<00:02:55.329> didn't

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
farm structures and barns now we didn't

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.630 
farm structures and barns now we didn't
want<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.780> emulate<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.260> or<00:02:56.590> imitate<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.250> but

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
want to emulate that or imitate that but

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.699 
want to emulate that or imitate that but
we<00:02:57.790> saw<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.150> as<00:02:58.299> a<00:02:58.329> starting<00:02:58.629> point<00:02:58.989> for<00:02:59.319> how

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
we saw that as a starting point for how

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.589 
we saw that as a starting point for how
the<00:03:00.340> overall<00:03:00.790> aesthetic<00:03:01.269> of<00:03:01.359> the<00:03:01.420> house

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
the overall aesthetic of the house

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.140 
the overall aesthetic of the house
really<00:03:01.959> wanted<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.349> look<00:03:02.560> the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
really wanted to look the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.729 
really wanted to look the
board-and-batten<00:03:04.150> siding<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.500> metal

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
board-and-batten siding and the metal

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.210 
board-and-batten siding and the metal
roof<00:03:06.010> were<00:03:06.629> probably<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:07.900> most<00:03:08.019> direct<00:03:08.379> ways

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
roof were probably the most direct ways

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.369 
roof were probably the most direct ways
that<00:03:09.519> we<00:03:09.609> try<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.910> integrate<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:10.690> aesthetic

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
that we try to integrate that aesthetic

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.619 
that we try to integrate that aesthetic
with<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:12.370> vernacular<00:03:12.640> architecture<00:03:12.940> and

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
with the vernacular architecture and

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.589 
with the vernacular architecture and
buildings<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:14.140> are<00:03:14.230> in<00:03:14.290> this<00:03:14.379> area<00:03:15.599> the

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
buildings that are in this area the

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.339 
buildings that are in this area the
kitchen<00:03:16.930> is<00:03:17.049> laid<00:03:17.260> out<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:18.040> encourage

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
kitchen is laid out to encourage

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.509 
kitchen is laid out to encourage
interaction<00:03:20.349> around<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.680> island<00:03:21.069> the

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
interaction around the island the

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.800 
interaction around the island the
kitchen<00:03:21.819> tends<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.090> be<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.239> center<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.569> the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
kitchen tends to be the center of the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.349 
kitchen tends to be the center of the
modern<00:03:23.349> house<00:03:23.530> nowadays<00:03:24.129> so<00:03:24.730> that<00:03:25.120> really

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
modern house nowadays so that really

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.149 
modern house nowadays so that really
becomes<00:03:25.599> a<00:03:25.750> focal<00:03:26.079> point<00:03:26.290> from<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.799> social

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
becomes a focal point from a social

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.500 
becomes a focal point from a social
standpoint<00:03:27.400> as<00:03:27.790> well<00:03:27.819> as<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.060> functional

standpoint as well as a functional
standpoint<00:03:29.099> what<00:03:30.099> we<00:03:30.220> also<00:03:30.459> try<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.819> do<00:03:31.090> is<00:03:31.359> set

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
standpoint what we also try to do is set

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.199 
standpoint what we also try to do is set
the<00:03:31.919> refrigerator<00:03:32.919> to<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.160> side<00:03:33.549> because

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
the refrigerator to the side because

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.930 
the refrigerator to the side because
that<00:03:34.359> tends<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.810> be<00:03:35.049> one<00:03:35.500> of<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.769> more<00:03:36.250> bulky

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
that tends to be one of the more bulky

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.339 
that tends to be one of the more bulky
and<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.480> little<00:03:37.690> bit<00:03:37.780> harder<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.079> integrate

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
and a little bit harder to integrate

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.430 
and a little bit harder to integrate
elements<00:03:39.069> in<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.549> kitchen<00:03:39.910> so<00:03:40.630> helps<00:03:41.230> clean

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
elements in the kitchen so helps clean

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.289 
elements in the kitchen so helps clean
up<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.709> elevation<00:03:42.280> of<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.790> cabinetry

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
up the elevation of that the cabinetry

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.119 
up the elevation of that the cabinetry
but<00:03:44.019> it<00:03:44.079> also<00:03:44.230> allows<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.769> to<00:03:44.799> be<00:03:44.919> very

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
but it also allows it to be very

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.940 
but it also allows it to be very
accessible<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:46.269> other<00:03:46.840> people<00:03:47.230> in<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.769> house

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
accessible to other people in the house

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.440 
accessible to other people in the house
so<00:03:48.310> it's<00:03:48.459> not<00:03:48.609> interfering<00:03:48.970> with<00:03:49.120> people<00:03:49.389> at

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
so it's not interfering with people at

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.430 
so it's not interfering with people at
the<00:03:49.540> sink<00:03:49.810> or<00:03:50.019> at<00:03:50.349> the<00:03:50.440> cooktop<00:03:52.049> one<00:03:53.049> of<00:03:53.200> Joe's

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.009 
the sink or at the cooktop one of Joe's
passions<00:03:54.010> is<00:03:54.190> books<00:03:54.519> and<00:03:54.819> so<00:03:55.450> finding<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.900> way

the<00:04:02.079> beginning<00:04:02.220> again<00:04:03.220> we<00:04:03.370> didn't<00:04:03.609> want<00:04:03.730> to

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
the beginning again we didn't want to

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.939 
the beginning again we didn't want to
dedicate<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.269> huge<00:04:04.660> room<00:04:05.049> or<00:04:05.319> a<00:04:05.349> lot<00:04:05.530> of<00:04:05.560> square

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
dedicate a huge room or a lot of square

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.640 
dedicate a huge room or a lot of square
footage<00:04:06.160> to<00:04:06.549> it<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.120> entryway<00:04:07.720> became<00:04:08.620> a

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
footage to it so the entryway became a

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.879 
footage to it so the entryway became a
way<00:04:08.919> of<00:04:09.129> creating<00:04:09.910> some<00:04:10.060> display<00:04:10.449> space<00:04:10.889> and

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
way of creating some display space and

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.920 
way of creating some display space and
also<00:04:12.040> activating<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:12.910> space<00:04:13.180> by<00:04:13.690> putting

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
also activating the space by putting

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.750 
also activating the space by putting
those<00:04:14.199> that<00:04:14.620> book<00:04:14.829> collection<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.579> the

those that book collection and the
cabinetry<00:04:16.299> in<00:04:16.630> what<00:04:17.019> could<00:04:17.229> otherwise<00:04:17.470> be<00:04:17.620> a
