00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello everyone, I hope the light 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.859
 that arrives from this part does not give 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.410
 too annoying though I didn't have those of 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.280
 settle in a different way then not 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.660
 I hope you don't get too many colors and you 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.660
 I also apologize for the super voice 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.430
 nasal I got very cold but 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.840
 still wanted to shoot a video before 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.609
 leave for london 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.010
 that is, he leaves tomorrow so I hope to 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.930
 be able to load it in time 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.000
 then I wanted to talk to you about strips 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.489
 the epilator for the face first first 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.200
 affected topic a little delicate because 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.510
 he was finding me very well with these 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.370
 depilatory choices that I found 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.620
 quietly at the carrefour 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.110
 the problem is that now I can't find them 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.309
 more and I'm desperately looking for 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.829
 substitutes such as smears times were 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.350
 similar to these these are of the gods p 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.480
 zero of which he talks about shortly just that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.969
 they had the wax on the green it seems to me and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.260
 they were very good they just warmed me up 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.420
 I warmed them for the just against the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.000
 when the radiator was hot 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.640
 snatches flights of dividing skies there 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.570
 we rest on the top 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.549
 of the lips I knew and was placed 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.250
 problem that I had making it more 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.840
 find some other alternative and me 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.990
 I am entrusted to the p zero companies 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.520
 these are the problem with argan oil 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.049
 that is precisely how these are 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.150
 of the debby 0 that I showed you first 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.610
 the problem is that they do not tear anything 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.520
 I did exactly what 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.590
 I did with those first we heat 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.820
 against the radiator to warm it up a 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.960
 little more because with the hands 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.470
 we always make more effort 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.300
 then maybe the shapes you want because anyway 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.430
 this part a bit too much numbers 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.880
 I prefer to shape a little and then pecikar 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.290
 I tear them up and nothing this and no 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.640
 they tear up practically nothing I don't 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.260
 I find I am not well 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.869
 in fact if ascertaining the emo but 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.490
 define them in some way but somehow 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.330
 fortunately this is the last work 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.780
 however, I am not, but I don't know how bad they are 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.240
 if you find yourself well, say so 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.650
 however in the meantime said that these 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.970
 they didn't like the proven ones 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:32.190
 these of the strap I don't know if you have them 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:35.340
 never even try these and how 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.880
 different types are presented with 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.570
 this square leaflet that has it all 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.840
 the wax in the center then to another 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.840
 smaller square in the center of candle 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.590
 the problem is that these are one 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.709
 strip corresponds to both 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.650
 flips because it opens once 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.209
 heated opens on this side and then 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.580
 apply quietly either one 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.430
 complete tear 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.370
 these instead not every strip that you 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.850
 size only corresponds to one side because 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.650
 the wax remains stuck only to the 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:19.260
 printed part and not on the white side 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.980
 so to do both sides you need to 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.650
 then take two from this thing to me 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.750
 it doesn't make you crazy because you have to cut 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.930
 more must be more precise because 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.060
 if not a vas 1 May these instead is 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.430
 already ready 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.620
 other problem seems to take a while 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.160
 around because I can't get from here 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:45.180
 let me see it but this is a strip 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:49.139
 the last one is completely empty 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.329
 this year to wax more I think that in 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.319
 this there is a little bit in this of 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:59.150
 over it 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:02.700
 dinners 3 mm just above the strip of 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.920
 where it could be cut there is 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.290
 very little so moments are not needed 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.489
 even below to remove their 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.889
 eyebrows below here and almost 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.259
 imperceptible here a two three four 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:21.000
 with this you can do waxing 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:22.199
 only 22 times and moreover not 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.090
 they don't tear well at all 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:28.800
 today I tried to do it again with this one 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.250
 because we try again what he has 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.910
 done 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.340
 I have cut out or not before they have 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.580
 heated then the part that is cut me 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.530
 interested or heated some more 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.539
 this time the heated with the hair dryer because 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.000
 precisely the thermo is no longer lit. 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.500
 I warmed him up with the madman or 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.900
 heat a little iphone and this one 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.800
 part came perfect found the 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.660
 best solution 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:56.699
 I do the same thing in this part 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:59.789
 delirium me when i made to open from 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:02.370
 this part on the smooth white part 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.539
 all the vertical lines of 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.990
 waxing 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.460
 so what I applied then here 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.860
 they were just pieces of wax then of 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.349
 here I had to tear up twice then 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.470
 nor due to consume three in total 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:17.460
 streaks so this thing does not me 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.680
 like it for nothing 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.340
 with the addition to which times 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:27.449
 tears other times then the question 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:30.509
 you have some tin and trustworthy waxes of which 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:33.990
 you're sure to have welcomed safe apples 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:35.310
 you could advise someone why not 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.430
 finding more these I don't know 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.430
 sincerely 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.670
 which brand to contact 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.920
 I end here the video dedicated to the purpose 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.900
 to settle the case and fires 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.910
 see you being able to shoot a video 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.740
 then returns to show a little something 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.130
 bought and see you next video 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.130
 Hello
