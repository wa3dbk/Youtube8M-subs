tunnel thing here that I don't know

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.770 
tunnel thing here that I don't know
maybe<00:02:20.670> that'll<00:02:21.030> be<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.240> an<00:02:21.360> instance<00:02:21.630> to

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
maybe that'll be like an instance to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.900 
maybe that'll be like an instance to
another<00:02:22.020> dungeon<00:02:22.320> area<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.860> right<00:02:23.040> here<00:02:23.430> I

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
another dungeon area and right here I

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
just you know circling right there is

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.590 
just you know circling right there is
basically<00:02:29.100> where<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.250> found<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.640> founded<00:02:30.510> on

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
basically where I found it founded on

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.970 
basically where I found it founded on
the<00:02:30.780> first<00:02:31.020> time<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.230> was<00:02:31.440> trying<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.709> make<00:02:31.830> this

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
the first time I was trying to make this

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.980 
the first time I was trying to make this
video<00:02:32.250> but<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.209> whole<00:02:33.360> thing<00:02:33.390> glitched<00:02:33.840> out

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
video but the whole thing glitched out

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.260 
video but the whole thing glitched out
and<00:02:34.200> aired<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.820> couldn't<00:02:35.820> actually<00:02:35.940> get<00:02:36.150> it

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
and aired and couldn't actually get it

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.449 
and aired and couldn't actually get it
done<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:36.980> fortunately<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.040> was<00:02:38.100> able<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.340> get

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
done so fortunately I was able to get

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.240 
done so fortunately I was able to get
this<00:02:38.580> video<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.930> knocked<00:02:40.530> out<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:40.950> here

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
this video of it knocked out and here

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.530 
this video of it knocked out and here
you<00:02:41.310> can<00:02:41.370> see<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.550> nice<00:02:41.760> little<00:02:42.090> landscape

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
you can see the nice little landscape

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.290 
you can see the nice little landscape
obviously<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.230> texture<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.590> not<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:44.300> pretty

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
obviously the texture is not so pretty

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.670 
obviously the texture is not so pretty
in<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.570> background<00:02:45.959> but<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.350> know<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.500> don't

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
in the background but you know you don't

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.229 
in the background but you know you don't
really<00:02:46.770> need<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.459> be<00:02:47.610> you're<00:02:47.760> expected<00:02:48.209> to

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
really need it to be you're expected to

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.720 
really need it to be you're expected to
be<00:02:48.420> because<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.830> pretty<00:02:50.100> in<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.310> background

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
be because the pretty in the background

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.060 
be because the pretty in the background
is<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.239> less<00:02:51.600> pretty<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.170> foreground<00:02:52.920> is

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
is the less pretty the foreground is

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.600 
is the less pretty the foreground is
going<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.340> be<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.810> there's<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.560> some<00:02:56.250> dregs

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
going to be and there's the some dregs

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.850 
going to be and there's the some dregs
or<00:02:56.820> whatever<00:02:57.060> from<00:02:57.470> drugs<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.680> are<00:02:58.769> also

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
high enough level that they go ahead and

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.980 
high enough level that they go ahead and
give<00:03:02.010> me<00:03:02.269> ?<00:03:03.380> for<00:03:04.380> their<00:03:04.500> level<00:03:04.800> using<00:03:05.459> again

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
give me ? for their level using again

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
along and now that's basically in a part

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.400 
along and now that's basically in a part
of<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.750> secret<00:03:11.960> area<00:03:12.410> uh<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:14.360> know<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.480> try<00:03:15.380> to

of the secret area uh you know I try to

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.170 
of the secret area uh you know I try to
go<00:03:15.620> out<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:15.980> see<00:03:16.520> what's<00:03:16.760> going<00:03:16.970> up<00:03:17.060> this

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
go out of see what's going up this

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.940

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
little path you can't automatically hits

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.260 
little path you can't automatically hits
hit<00:03:19.220> detection<00:03:19.340> telling<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:19.910> got<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.150> turn

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
hit detection telling you got to turn

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.880 
hit detection telling you got to turn
back<00:03:20.480> otherwise<00:03:21.140> I<00:03:21.410> think<00:03:21.440> you're<00:03:21.710> going<00:03:21.830> to

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
back otherwise I think you're going to

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.570 
back otherwise I think you're going to
probably<00:03:22.070> auto<00:03:22.340> die<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:25.070> then<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.310> hit<00:03:25.430> some

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
probably auto die and then you hit some

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.340 
probably auto die and then you hit some
ceiling<00:03:26.210> hit<00:03:26.300> detection<00:03:26.420> so<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:26.930> can't<00:03:27.110> jump

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
ceiling hit detection so you can't jump

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.100 
ceiling hit detection so you can't jump
up<00:03:27.530> there<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.830> won't<00:03:27.980> allow<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.900> then<00:03:29.900> it

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
up there it won't allow you and then it

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.410 
up there it won't allow you and then it
just<00:03:30.140> tosses<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.680> right<00:03:30.890> back<00:03:31.040> down<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:32.270> has

just tosses you right back down it has
its<00:03:32.540> cool<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:32.840> will<00:03:32.930> pass<00:03:33.110> away<00:03:33.320> and<00:03:33.530> then<00:03:33.620> once

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
its cool it will pass away and then once

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.290 
its cool it will pass away and then once
you<00:03:34.130> go<00:03:34.220> through<00:03:34.250> that<00:03:34.460> whole<00:03:34.760> little<00:03:34.880> tunnel
