00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:10.770 
if you get a nine venturi the seven

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.310 
if you get a nine venturi the seven
venturi<00:00:13.760> and<00:00:14.760> most<00:00:15.300> likely<00:00:15.480> what's<00:00:15.929> included

always<00:00:25.350> good<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.619> have<00:00:26.180> spare<00:00:27.180> shims<00:00:30.170> glow

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
always good to have spare shims glow

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.350 
always good to have spare shims glow
plug<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:32.220> like<00:00:32.340> they're<00:00:32.489> giving<00:00:32.699> you<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> p3

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
bead got a mid-range and of course

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.700 
bead got a mid-range and of course
you're<00:00:37.260> high<00:00:37.379> in

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.240 

that's<00:00:46.309> nice<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:46.730> smooth<00:00:47.030> Oh

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.090 

not<00:00:51.880> used<00:00:52.060> to<00:00:52.210> that<00:00:52.390> there's<00:00:52.690> a<00:00:53.100> little

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
not used to that there's a little

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.840 
not used to that there's a little
seating<00:00:54.400> washer<00:00:55.620> underneath<00:00:56.620> this<00:00:56.860> so<00:00:57.550> if<00:00:57.730> you

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
seating washer underneath this so if you

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.890 
seating washer underneath this so if you
have<00:00:58.000> one<00:00:58.210> beware<00:00:58.720> of<00:00:58.750> that<00:01:00.540> ensure<00:01:01.540> it's<00:01:01.660> for

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
have one beware of that ensure it's for

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.189 
have one beware of that ensure it's for
a<00:01:01.930> reason<00:01:03.269> carbs<00:01:04.269> really<00:01:04.540> nice<00:01:04.750> and<00:01:04.960> smooth

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
a reason carbs really nice and smooth

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.109 
a reason carbs really nice and smooth
and<00:01:05.290> it<00:01:05.410> goes<00:01:05.590> in<00:01:05.830> well<00:01:06.070> I<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:07.510> that<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:10.090> a

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
and it goes in well I like that like a

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.080 
and it goes in well I like that like a
nice<00:01:10.420> thick<00:01:10.810> boot<00:01:11.140> that's<00:01:11.619> cool

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:29.770 

so<00:01:16.090> again<00:01:16.300> you<00:01:16.420> get<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.630> eight

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.440 

and<00:01:30.740> they<00:01:30.920> opted<00:01:31.220> for<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.430> 2.5<00:01:32.090> which<00:01:32.299> is

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
and they opted for the 2.5 which is

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.899 
and they opted for the 2.5 which is
still<00:01:32.630> better<00:01:32.840> than<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:34.430> slotted

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
still better than the slotted

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.950 
still better than the slotted
screwdriver<00:01:35.450> way<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.200> things<00:01:36.470> I<00:01:37.810> will<00:01:38.810> not

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
screwdriver way of things I will not

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:50.800 
screwdriver way of things I will not
complain<00:01:39.350> on<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:39.710> that's<00:01:39.979> for<00:01:40.190> sure

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.390 

together<00:01:51.810> really<00:01:52.140> well<00:01:53.660> so<00:01:54.660> like<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.050> to

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
together really well so like this to

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.490 
together really well so like this to
initial

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.310 

shims

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
shims

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:19.580 

see<00:02:05.920> where<00:02:06.070> they're<00:02:06.220> at

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.000 

so<00:02:20.190> there<00:02:20.459> are<00:02:20.489> about<00:02:20.700> 20<00:02:21.030> 30<00:02:21.709> point<00:02:22.709> 32

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
so there are about 20 30 point 32

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.150 
so there are about 20 30 point 32
millimeters

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.520 

figure<00:02:27.880> that's<00:02:28.090> about<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.330> two<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.020> copper

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
figure that's about a two and the copper

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:57.170 
figure that's about a two and the copper
should<00:02:29.770> be<00:02:29.920> about<00:02:30.070> a<00:02:30.130> 1<00:02:31.710> yep

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.309

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
a two-millimeter back neric nice little

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
seat stander two rings around the sleeve

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.069 
seat stander two rings around the sleeve
it's<00:03:05.879> a<00:03:05.969> flat<00:03:06.209> top<00:03:06.450> dome<00:03:08.719> looks<00:03:09.719> like<00:03:09.870> it's

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
it's a flat top dome looks like it's

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.640 
it's a flat top dome looks like it's
just<00:03:10.290> really<00:03:10.920> well<00:03:11.250> there's<00:03:11.519> not<00:03:11.640> much<00:03:11.700> slop

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
just really well there's not much slop

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:20.449 
just really well there's not much slop

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.180 

it's<00:03:28.819> got<00:03:29.569> some<00:03:29.750> metal<00:03:29.810> slugs<00:03:30.290> in<00:03:30.500> there<00:03:30.680> for

it's got some metal slugs in there for

it's got some metal slugs in there for

is<00:03:38.390> kind<00:03:38.569> of<00:03:38.660> neat<00:03:38.840> not<00:03:39.470> sure<00:03:39.650> exactly<00:03:40.069> what<00:03:40.400> it

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
is kind of neat not sure exactly what it

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.750 
is kind of neat not sure exactly what it
is<00:03:42.040> possibly<00:03:43.040> hard<00:03:43.340> hardening<00:03:43.940> it<00:03:45.370> no<00:03:46.370> another

is possibly hard hardening it no another

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.250 
is possibly hard hardening it no another
thing<00:03:47.000> probably<00:03:47.300> makes<00:03:47.750> this<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:47.959> little<00:03:48.170> more

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
thing probably makes this a little more

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.020 
thing probably makes this a little more
pricier<00:03:48.770> than<00:03:48.830> what<00:03:49.100> it<00:03:49.190> usually<00:03:49.310> is<00:03:49.610> is<00:03:49.850> that

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
pricier than what it usually is is that

00:03:50.030 --> 00:04:12.309 
pricier than what it usually is is that
there's<00:03:50.810> ceramic<00:03:51.260> bearings<00:03:51.620> in<00:03:51.709> there

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319
