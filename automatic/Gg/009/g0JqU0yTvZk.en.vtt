hi my name is Derek moscone I recently
have<00:00:06.109> purchased<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:08.090> program<00:00:09.090> online<00:00:09.450> called

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
have purchased a program online called

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.370 
have purchased a program online called
the<00:00:10.139> fat<00:00:10.440> loss<00:00:10.769> factor<00:00:11.480> this<00:00:12.480> program<00:00:12.960> is

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
the fat loss factor this program is

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
the fat loss factor this program is
pretty<00:00:14.070> revolutionary<00:00:15.139> considering<00:00:16.139> all<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
pretty revolutionary considering all the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.580 
pretty revolutionary considering all the
millions<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.240> billions<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.810> trillions<00:00:18.900> of

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
programs out there that say by me you'll

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.620 
programs out there that say by me you'll
lose<00:00:22.289> weight<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.760> shake<00:00:23.970> your<00:00:24.119> head<00:00:24.300> when

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
lose weight and you shake your head when

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.529 
lose weight and you shake your head when
three<00:00:24.990> months<00:00:25.230> later<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.920> haven't<00:00:26.310> lost

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
three months later you haven't lost

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.150 
three months later you haven't lost
anywhere<00:00:27.539> near<00:00:27.779> what<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.199> ideally<00:00:28.769> want<00:00:28.800> it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
anywhere near what you ideally want it

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.310 
anywhere near what you ideally want it
to<00:00:29.279> lose<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.550> your<00:00:29.670> head<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.630> problem<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.140> is

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
to lose in your head the problem is is

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.440 
to lose in your head the problem is is
that<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.590> many<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.830> these<00:00:31.949> programs<00:00:32.369> just<00:00:33.270> try

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that so many of these programs just try

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.470 
that so many of these programs just try
to<00:00:33.480> sell<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> quick<00:00:34.530> version<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.239> truth

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
to sell you a quick version of the truth

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.630 
to sell you a quick version of the truth
or<00:00:36.809> they<00:00:37.620> will<00:00:37.739> try<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.950> tell<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.460> their

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
version is the truth and forget about

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.250 
version is the truth and forget about
all<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.280> others<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.690> hard<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.020> tell

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
all the others and it's hard to tell

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.040 
all the others and it's hard to tell
what<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.950> what<00:00:44.340> isn't<00:00:44.730> really<00:00:45.539> going<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.899> help

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
what is what isn't really going to help

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.220 
what is what isn't really going to help
you<00:00:46.260> lose<00:00:46.469> weight<00:00:46.579> well<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.940> think<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.870> might

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
you lose weight well I think I might

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.260 
you lose weight well I think I might
have<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.680> found<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:50.730> really<00:00:51.030> works

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
have just found what really works

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.290 
have just found what really works
because<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.500> space<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.219> month<00:00:53.910> I

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
because in just the space of a month I

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.490 
because in just the space of a month I
have<00:00:54.660> already<00:00:55.590> lost<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:56.219> ten<00:00:56.460> pounds<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
have already lost like ten pounds and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.310 
have already lost like ten pounds and
that<00:00:58.500> wasn't<00:00:58.770> even<00:00:59.160> with<00:00:59.460> me<00:00:59.640> really<00:00:59.910> trying

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
that wasn't even with me really trying

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.049 
that wasn't even with me really trying
you<00:01:01.320> know<00:01:01.350> using<00:01:02.070> what<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.399> found<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.910> fat

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you know using what I found in the fat

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.179 
you know using what I found in the fat
loss<00:01:03.210> factor<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.780> came<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.260> imagine<00:01:04.710> how<00:01:05.010> much

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
loss factor I came and imagine how much

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.950 
loss factor I came and imagine how much
weight<00:01:05.729> I'm<00:01:05.909> gonna<00:01:06.030> lose<00:01:06.299> next<00:01:06.479> month<00:01:06.780> when<00:01:06.900> I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
weight I'm gonna lose next month when I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.200 
weight I'm gonna lose next month when I
go<00:01:07.650> even<00:01:07.920> harder<00:01:08.070> at<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.670> mean<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.119> know

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
you know when you get into the fat loss

you know when you get into the fat loss
factor<00:01:21.810> you're<00:01:22.350> going<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> realize<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.159> it's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and based around fitness that makes

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.190 
and based around fitness that makes
sense<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.210> creative<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.840> keeps<00:01:31.079> you

interested<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.490> anyways<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.390> fat<00:01:33.540> loss

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
interested so anyways on the fat loss

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.990 
interested so anyways on the fat loss
factor<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.409> made<00:01:35.159> by<00:01:35.280> gentleman<00:01:35.610> named<00:01:35.700> dr.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
factor I made by gentleman named dr.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.370 
factor I made by gentleman named dr.
Charles<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:37.619> with<00:01:37.740> associate<00:01:38.220> laureate<00:01:38.640> and

Charles so with associate laureate and
it's<00:01:40.380> really<00:01:40.799> an<00:01:41.189> interesting<00:01:41.630> approach

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
it's really an interesting approach

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.899 
it's really an interesting approach
because<00:01:43.290> first<00:01:43.530> what<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.829> do<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.700> track

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
because first what you do is you track

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.280 
because first what you do is you track
your<00:01:45.060> way<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.270> start<00:01:45.780> out<00:01:45.899> with<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:46.110> weight

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
your way you start out with your weight

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.010 
your way you start out with your weight
that<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.680> create<00:01:46.950> milestones<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:48.030> order<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
that you create milestones in order to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.649 
that you create milestones in order to
see<00:01:49.590> your<00:01:50.280> progress<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.030> what's<00:01:51.390> really<00:01:51.509> cool

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
see your progress and what's really cool

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.980 
see your progress and what's really cool
about<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.560> wheat<00:01:52.799> tracking<00:01:53.630> tool<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.869> they

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
about the wheat tracking tool that they

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.499 
about the wheat tracking tool that they
use<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.710> if<00:01:55.979> you're<00:01:56.159> trying<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.149> say<00:01:57.299> yeah
