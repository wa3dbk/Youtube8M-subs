that mattress which creates a grasping
configuration<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.760> reduces<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> risk<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.810> a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
configuration this reduces the risk of a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.830 
configuration this reduces the risk of a
type<00:02:19.140> 2<00:02:19.470> tear<00:02:20.250> or<00:02:20.580> sawing<00:02:20.940> effect<00:02:21.480> through<00:02:21.810> the

cuff so here we've done that for both of
the<00:02:27.360> trans<00:02:28.320> osseous<00:02:28.890> sutures<00:02:30.350> now<00:02:31.350> we<00:02:31.410> move

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
the trans osseous sutures now we move

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.940 
the trans osseous sutures now we move
ahead<00:02:31.920> with<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.660> tension<00:02:33.660> band<00:02:33.870> portion<00:02:34.830> of

ahead with the tension band portion of
the<00:02:35.040> repair<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:36.540> idea<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.080> tension<00:02:37.440> band

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
the repair the idea of the tension band

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.580 
the repair the idea of the tension band
is<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:37.890> we<00:02:38.520> want<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.970> neutralize<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:40.290> pull

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
is that we want to neutralize the pull

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.790 
is that we want to neutralize the pull
of<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.040> rotator<00:02:41.550> cuff<00:02:41.640> tendon<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.330> create

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
of the rotator cuff tendon and create

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.250 
of the rotator cuff tendon and create
uniform<00:02:43.800> tension<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:44.970> here<00:02:45.180> we've<00:02:45.390> created<00:02:45.990> a

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
uniform tension so here we've created a

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.860 
uniform tension so here we've created a
socket<00:02:46.530> with<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> punch<00:02:47.340> well<00:02:48.150> beyond<00:02:48.600> the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
socket with a punch well beyond the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.400 
socket with a punch well beyond the
footprint<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:51.739> we're<00:02:52.739> going<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.010> introduce<00:02:53.280> a

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
footprint and we're going to introduce a

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.570 
footprint and we're going to introduce a
calcium<00:02:55.760> biocomposite<00:02:57.020> triple<00:02:58.020> loaded

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
calcium biocomposite triple loaded

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.420 
calcium biocomposite triple loaded
rotator<00:02:59.580> cuff<00:02:59.820> anchor<00:03:00.470> we<00:03:01.470> prefer<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.950> triple

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
rotator cuff anchor we prefer the triple

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.260 
rotator cuff anchor we prefer the triple
loaded<00:03:02.760> anchor<00:03:03.120> because<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.110> requires<00:03:04.530> fewer

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
loaded anchor because it requires fewer

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.880 
loaded anchor because it requires fewer
anchors<00:03:06.270> for<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.140> repair<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:10.320> calcium

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
anchors for the repair the calcium

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.000 
anchors for the repair the calcium
biocomposite<00:03:11.489> also<00:03:12.480> improves<00:03:13.230> ultimately

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
biocomposite also improves ultimately

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.640 
biocomposite also improves ultimately
the<00:03:14.540> calcium<00:03:15.540> concentration<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.470> greater

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
the calcium concentration of the greater

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.670 
the calcium concentration of the greater
tuberosity<00:03:17.630> which<00:03:18.630> also<00:03:19.230> improves<00:03:19.590> the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
tuberosity which also improves the

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.330 
tuberosity which also improves the
quality<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.370> rotator<00:03:20.700> cuff<00:03:20.760> footprint

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
quality of the rotator cuff footprint

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.490 
quality of the rotator cuff footprint
