00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:35.279 
that it's just a thing that I think by

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:37.309 
that it's just a thing that I think by
doing<00:05:35.340> good<00:05:35.819> things<00:05:36.090> for<00:05:36.210> other<00:05:36.419> people<00:05:36.509> then

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 
doing good things for other people then

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.920 
doing good things for other people then
generally<00:05:38.219> you<00:05:39.000> know<00:05:39.120> good<00:05:39.389> things<00:05:39.599> kind<00:05:39.870> of

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
generally you know good things kind of

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.830 
generally you know good things kind of
happen<00:05:40.199> to<00:05:40.349> you<00:05:40.529> and<00:05:40.740> vice<00:05:41.190> versa<00:05:41.789> so<00:05:42.240> it's

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
happen to you and vice versa so it's

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.420 
happen to you and vice versa so it's
like<00:05:43.080> I<00:05:43.229> say<00:05:43.469> it<00:05:43.620> sounds<00:05:44.009> a<00:05:44.039> bit<00:05:44.130> sort<00:05:44.400> of

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
like I say it sounds a bit sort of

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.159 
like I say it sounds a bit sort of
cultish<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.120> religion<00:05:45.449> is<00:05:45.539> maybe<00:05:45.810> around

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
cultish and religion is maybe around

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:47.959 
cultish and religion is maybe around
karma<00:05:46.500> but<00:05:47.069> that<00:05:47.219> is<00:05:47.340> just<00:05:47.370> the<00:05:47.580> way<00:05:47.729> that<00:05:47.880> I

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:47.969 
karma but that is just the way that I

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:49.730 
karma but that is just the way that I
kind<00:05:48.150> of<00:05:48.270> like<00:05:48.419> to<00:05:48.449> live<00:05:48.690> my<00:05:48.810> life<00:05:48.840> I<00:05:49.229> just

you<00:06:23.039> know<00:06:23.159> you<00:06:23.219> don't<00:06:23.460> take<00:06:23.940> it<00:06:24.180> you<00:06:24.330> try<00:06:24.779> and

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.939 
give it back to them you know these kind
of<00:06:26.699> things<00:06:26.789> I<00:06:27.240> think<00:06:27.539> are<00:06:28.050> just<00:06:28.199> very<00:06:28.710> basic

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:28.949 
of things I think are just very basic

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.519 
of things I think are just very basic
things<00:06:29.250> that<00:06:29.639> if<00:06:30.000> more<00:06:30.960> people<00:06:31.289> kind<00:06:31.469> of

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:31.529 
things that if more people kind of

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:34.490 
things that if more people kind of
adhered<00:06:31.919> to<00:06:32.009> the<00:06:32.370> world<00:06:32.849> would<00:06:33.120> be<00:06:33.270> just<00:06:34.169> just

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
adhered to the world would be just just

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.079 
adhered to the world would be just just
that<00:06:34.590> little<00:06:34.740> bit<00:06:34.889> better<00:06:35.190> and<00:06:35.490> that's<00:06:35.820> kind

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:36.089 
that little bit better and that's kind

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:37.999 
that little bit better and that's kind
of<00:06:36.149> the<00:06:36.240> code<00:06:36.449> that<00:06:36.479> I<00:06:36.690> live<00:06:36.870> my<00:06:37.020> life<00:06:37.050> by<00:06:37.469> by
