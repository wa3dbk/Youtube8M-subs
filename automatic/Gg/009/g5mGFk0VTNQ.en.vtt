00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 pain the sciences with a big 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.290
 plunge a dive into the ocean but 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.599
 a dip in the past also in 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.370
 our past from vertebrates 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.960
 scientists were able to approach very 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.910
 near a mythical fish 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.990
 the coelacanth there would be only one 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.670
 thousand in the oceans 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.770
 it is a contemporary of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.600
 dinosaurs and it could be I you 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.080
 was saying a missing link of 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.300
 the evolution nicolas chateauneuf a 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.830
 powerful jaw on a body all 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 right out of the dinosaur era 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.329
 with a remnant of lungs on 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.309
 coelacanth is a beautiful animal 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.290
 scientists have long thought 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.770
 that he had disappeared there are 65 million 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.570
 years 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.309
 today they know that a few 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.120
 individuals only buy here along the ribs 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.950
 south africa 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.840
 this is where a French expedition 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.850
 started in the footsteps of the animal 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.649
 legendary living witness of a 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.930
 extraordinary passage that of life 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.910
 aquatic to earthly life this passage 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.640
 which took place there are 370 million 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.440
 of years well we have a distant cousin 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.460
 still alive today first he 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.350
 is of great rarity 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.909
 there is probably less of that to 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.450
 canes in the oceans only two pandas 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.860
 on earth and then he lives to very great 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.770
 depth often has in caves 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.000
 so the dives to reach do not 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.310
 would be achieved in his universe 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.890
 are extremely difficult and very 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.780
 engaged to find the coelacanth he 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.700
 must dive to 120 meters deep 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.220
 in the twilight days ago 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.740
 during the first dive the team has 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.630
 had a huge surprise at the entrance of a 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.720
 cave 3 coelacanth adult of two 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.729
 meters long placid animals which 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.650
 we know practically nothing 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.079
 how to chat style how to breed 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.340
 style what are their habits in 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.110
 the next weeks team is going 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.540
 multiply analyzes and take 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.700
 views including the famous fins 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.290
 articulated coelacanth that foreshadows 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.470
 the feet of the first animals 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.470
 land 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.740
 high resolution cameras at 500 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.479
 second images will allow us to 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.860
 break down the whole movement to 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.690
 different speeds at different swims 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.270
 and like that probably try better 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.070
 understand the first step on earth 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.810
 that took place there are 360 ​​million 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.709
 of years is also even poses the 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.959
 question why is left vacant 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.209
 who they had everything for did not do 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.860
 the output of others the expedition must 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.510
 last six weeks and will be subject to a 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.800
 documentary that will soon be broadcast 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:26.050
 on arte and france 2 the record of this 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.050
 edition our children can they get
