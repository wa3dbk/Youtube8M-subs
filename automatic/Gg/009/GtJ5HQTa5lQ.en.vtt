00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
together to show you how I create one of

my paintings what you're looking at here
is<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.830> series<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.609> little<00:00:18.240> sketches<00:00:18.600> have<00:00:18.990> done

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199

is a series of little sketches have done
smaller<00:00:19.680> sketches<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:21.539> find<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.900> easy<00:00:22.080> to

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
smaller sketches I just find it easy to

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.400 
smaller sketches I just find it easy to
work<00:00:22.619> at<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.920> smaller<00:00:23.250> size<00:00:23.640> but<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:25.170> a

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
work at a smaller size but I have a

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.040 
work at a smaller size but I have a
large<00:00:25.769> canvas<00:00:26.699> if<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.119> like<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.689> have<00:00:27.900> to

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
large canvas if you like that I have to

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
large canvas if you like that I have to
fit<00:00:28.230> them<00:00:28.439> too<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:30.300> about<00:00:30.660> 2/3<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.800> size

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
fit them too and it's about 2/3 the size

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.510 
fit them too and it's about 2/3 the size
of<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.430> normal<00:00:32.579> door<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.480> knew<00:00:34.440> my<00:00:34.620> topic<00:00:35.100> was<00:00:35.280> to

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
of a normal door I knew my topic was to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.660 
of a normal door I knew my topic was to
be<00:00:35.670> birds<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.649> flowers<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.040> plants

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
be birds and flowers and plants

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.100 
be birds and flowers and plants
so<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.690> started<00:00:40.590> by<00:00:40.800> working<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.239> bottom<00:00:42.809> of

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
so I started by working at the bottom of

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.180 
so I started by working at the bottom of
the<00:00:44.270> painting<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.870> cutting<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:46.980> pasting

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the painting and cutting and pasting

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.970 
the painting and cutting and pasting
literally<00:00:48.030> some<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.300> my<00:00:48.570> sketches<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.350> you

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
literally some of my sketches and you

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.310 
literally some of my sketches and you
can<00:00:50.190> see<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.730> sort<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.120> pretty<00:00:51.780> messy<00:00:52.230> at

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
can see it's sort of pretty messy at

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.189 
can see it's sort of pretty messy at
this<00:00:52.500> stage<00:00:52.800> because<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.969> my<00:00:54.690> draft

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
this stage because this is just my draft

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.900 
this stage because this is just my draft
of<00:00:55.530> working<00:00:56.070> out<00:00:56.250> where<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.210> want<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
of working out where I want the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.510 
of working out where I want the
illustrations<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.210> graphics<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.859> position

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
illustrations the graphics to position

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
illustrations the graphics to position
themselves<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.390> show<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.860> large<00:01:05.540> piece

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
themselves and show on this large piece

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.830 
themselves and show on this large piece
of<00:01:06.780> work<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.290> I'm<00:01:07.409> doing<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> I'm<00:01:09.150> just

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
of work that I'm doing so I'm just

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.280 
of work that I'm doing so I'm just
moving<00:01:10.530> up<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.820> drawing<00:01:12.150> side<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.049> now<00:01:13.260> so

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
moving up the drawing side of it now so

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.210 
moving up the drawing side of it now so
that<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.189> see<00:01:14.990> where<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.860> are<00:01:16.890> some

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
that you can see where there are some

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.730 
that you can see where there are some
birds<00:01:17.490> where<00:01:17.970> there<00:01:18.180> are<00:01:18.330> some<00:01:18.659> plants<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
birds where there are some plants and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.910 
birds where there are some plants and
where<00:01:20.400> I've<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.759> used<00:01:21.119> design<00:01:21.720> which<00:01:22.590> in

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
where I've just used design which in

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.179 
where I've just used design which in
this<00:01:23.100> case<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.610> took<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:24.240> curved<00:01:24.990> flowing<00:01:25.950> design

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
this case I took a curved flowing design

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.289 
this case I took a curved flowing design
which<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.330> thought<00:01:27.689> was<00:01:28.140> very<00:01:28.520> suited<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
which I thought was very suited to the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.899 
which I thought was very suited to the
topic<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.810> was<00:01:30.990> doing<00:01:31.409> we're<00:01:32.220> moving<00:01:32.579> up<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
topic I was doing we're moving up the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.530 
topic I was doing we're moving up the
far<00:01:33.180> left<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.070> painting<00:01:35.070> now<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.759> there's

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
far left of the painting now and there's

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.190 
far left of the painting now and there's
going<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.020> larger<00:01:37.710> space<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.610> right

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
going to be a larger space on the right

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.870 
going to be a larger space on the right
at<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.470> top<00:01:40.500> right<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> painting<00:01:41.850> that

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
at the top right of the painting that

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.090 
at the top right of the painting that
will<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.720> sky<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:43.890> or

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
will just be sky if you like or

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.550 
will just be sky if you like or
background<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.270> I've<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.570> positioned<00:01:46.110> three

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
background so I've just positioned three

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.600 
background so I've just positioned three
bird<00:01:47.070> images<00:01:47.670> into<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.479> space<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.710> at<00:01:50.399> this

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
bird images into that space and at this

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.679 
bird images into that space and at this
stage<00:01:50.909> all<00:01:51.299> I'm<00:01:51.840> looking<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.380> do<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:54.149> work

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
stage all I'm looking to do is to work

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.609 
stage all I'm looking to do is to work
out<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.640> images<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.329> positive<00:01:57.840> space<00:01:58.170> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
out the images as the positive space and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.330 
out the images as the positive space and
the<00:01:59.490> background<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.710> shapes<00:02:01.710> happening

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the background that shapes happening

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.539 
the background that shapes happening
behind<00:02:02.850> these<00:02:03.119> positive<00:02:03.719> shapes<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.680> that's

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
behind these positive shapes and that's

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.389 
behind these positive shapes and that's
called<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.149> negative<00:02:06.630> space<00:02:06.990> I've<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.190> got

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
called the negative space I've just got

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.059 
called the negative space I've just got
this<00:02:08.580> large<00:02:08.940> piece<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.420> butchers<00:02:10.140> paper<00:02:10.379> set

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
this large piece of butchers paper set

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.130 
this large piece of butchers paper set
out<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.700> floor

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
out on the floor

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.160 
out on the floor
so<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.070> can<00:02:13.220> get<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.670> good<00:02:13.940> look<00:02:14.000> of<00:02:14.450> how

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
so that I can get a good look of how

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.690 
so that I can get a good look of how
it's<00:02:15.380> all<00:02:15.650> coming<00:02:16.100> together

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
it's all coming together
