lives<00:01:17.880> people<00:01:18.360> have<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:19.080> pretty<00:01:19.350> cool<00:01:19.590> it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
lives people have it's pretty cool it

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.450 
lives people have it's pretty cool it
definitely<00:01:20.970> adds<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.390> lot<00:01:21.540> more<00:01:21.890> depth<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
joust game that already is very odd and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.120 
joust game that already is very odd and
physically<00:01:27.150> violent<00:01:27.799> particularly<00:01:28.799> want<00:01:29.009> to
