can melt soda cans soda cans are very
very<00:00:07.350> thin<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.090> they<00:00:09.090> melt<00:00:09.349> instantly<00:00:10.349> with

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
very thin and they melt instantly with

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.930 
very thin and they melt instantly with
one<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.800> these<00:00:10.889> I'm<00:00:11.099> going<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.250> be<00:00:11.370> showing<00:00:11.610> you

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
one of these I'm going to be showing you

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.039 
one of these I'm going to be showing you
this<00:00:12.570> lens<00:00:12.960> on<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.400> soda<00:00:14.759> can<00:00:15.030> I'm<00:00:15.660> also<00:00:15.870> going

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
this lens on a soda can I'm also going

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.570 
this lens on a soda can I'm also going
to<00:00:16.109> be<00:00:16.230> showing<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.590> this<00:00:16.740> lens<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.130> thicker

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
to be showing you this lens on a thicker

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.779 
to be showing you this lens on a thicker
can<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.300> on<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.900> thicker<00:00:19.650> 1/8<00:00:20.189> inch<00:00:20.460> piece<00:00:20.760> of

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
can and on a thicker 1/8 inch piece of

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.330 
can and on a thicker 1/8 inch piece of
aluminum<00:00:21.619> so<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> first<00:00:22.949> thing<00:00:23.130> we're<00:00:23.250> going

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
aluminum so the first thing we're going

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:51.689 
aluminum so the first thing we're going
to<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.760> find<00:00:23.970> our<00:00:24.210> focal<00:00:24.600> point

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:58.920 

let's<00:00:52.269> say<00:00:52.420> that<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:52.660> can<00:00:52.870> is<00:00:52.899> actually

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.840 

that<00:00:59.560> quick<00:00:59.830> it<00:01:00.010> just<00:01:00.190> gets<00:01:00.370> cut<00:01:00.550> right<00:01:00.730> in

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
that quick it just gets cut right in

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.210 
that quick it just gets cut right in
half<00:01:01.060> and<00:01:01.300> it's<00:01:01.900> burning<00:01:02.410> still<00:01:02.890> it's<00:01:03.070> still

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
half and it's burning still it's still

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.030 
half and it's burning still it's still
melted<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.320> I'm<00:01:05.379> going<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.590> adjust<00:01:05.680> the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
melted so I'm going to adjust the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:31.570 
melted so I'm going to adjust the
aperture<00:01:06.700> on<00:01:07.000> this

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.710 

so<00:01:32.580> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.790> see<00:01:32.940> what<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> Purnell<00:01:33.480> winds

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
so you can see what the Purnell winds

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:48.870 
so you can see what the Purnell winds
did<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.320> can

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.270 

the<00:01:49.390> metal<00:01:49.630> on<00:01:49.720> that<00:01:49.840> can<00:01:50.080> is<00:01:50.230> very<00:01:50.260> thin<00:01:50.680> so<00:01:51.010> it

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
the metal on that can is very thin so it

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.430 
the metal on that can is very thin so it
just<00:01:51.490> takes<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.850> matter<00:01:52.000> of<00:01:52.120> less<00:01:52.720> than<00:01:52.750> 10

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
just takes a matter of less than 10

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.530 
just takes a matter of less than 10
seconds<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:54.010> cut<00:01:54.190> one<00:01:54.340> in<00:01:54.490> half<00:01:54.520> this<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:55.510> a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
seconds to cut one in half this is a

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.360 
seconds to cut one in half this is a
thicker<00:01:55.840> can<00:01:56.200> this<00:01:56.650> is<00:01:56.860> similar<00:01:57.370> to<00:01:57.520> your

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
thicker can this is similar to your

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:47.300 
thicker can this is similar to your
thicker<00:02:00.370> Budweiser<00:02:00.880> bottles

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.880 

this<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.270> rigid<00:02:48.660> aluminum<00:02:48.930> sheet<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:49.860> we

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
this is a rigid aluminum sheet so we

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.620 
this is a rigid aluminum sheet so we
should<00:02:50.190> be<00:02:50.310> able<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.550> get<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.790> good<00:02:50.940> focal<00:02:51.390> point

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
should be able to get a good focal point

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.839 
should be able to get a good focal point
on<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.840> dull<00:02:52.050> side<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.400> one<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.819> I

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
on the dull side this is one that I

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.030 
on the dull side this is one that I
tried<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.209> polish

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:32.150

so<00:04:00.190> this<00:04:00.370> is<00:04:00.490> what<00:04:00.640> we<00:04:00.730> were<00:04:00.850> able<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:01.209> do<00:04:01.420> with

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
so this is what we were able to do with

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.030 
so this is what we were able to do with
the<00:04:01.720> corner<00:04:02.140> of<00:04:02.950> this<00:04:03.220> aluminum<00:04:03.490> sheet<00:04:05.040> sorry

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
the corner of this aluminum sheet sorry

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.059 
the corner of this aluminum sheet sorry
solidifying<00:04:06.700> I<00:04:06.850> guess<00:04:07.440> so<00:04:08.440> you<00:04:08.530> got<00:04:08.770> to<00:04:08.890> see

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
solidifying I guess so you got to see

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.340 
solidifying I guess so you got to see
the<00:04:09.160> power<00:04:09.370> of<00:04:09.640> one<00:04:09.790> of<00:04:09.910> our<00:04:10.060> level<00:04:10.600> 2<00:04:10.900> lenses

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
the power of one of our level 2 lenses

a<00:04:14.470> sheet<00:04:14.740> of<00:04:14.860> aluminum<00:04:15.359> if<00:04:16.359> you<00:04:16.570> do<00:04:16.900> this<00:04:17.109> you

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
a sheet of aluminum if you do this you

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.270 
a sheet of aluminum if you do this you
want<00:04:17.470> to<00:04:17.500> make<00:04:17.560> sure<00:04:17.650> that<00:04:17.950> you<00:04:18.130> don't

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
want to make sure that you don't

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.520 
want to make sure that you don't
actually<00:04:18.820> burn<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.299> metal<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.750> idea<00:04:20.109> there'd

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
actually burn the metal the idea there'd

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.560 
actually burn the metal the idea there'd
be<00:04:20.620> no<00:04:20.829> reason<00:04:21.220> to<00:04:21.310> really<00:04:21.430> burn<00:04:21.730> it<00:04:21.940> when<00:04:22.450> you

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
be no reason to really burn it when you

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.629 
be no reason to really burn it when you
burn<00:04:22.840> stuff<00:04:23.290> like<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.710> you<00:04:23.889> create<00:04:24.280> some

burn stuff like that you create some
very<00:04:24.910> toxic<00:04:25.900> fumes<00:04:26.260> I<00:04:26.530> actually<00:04:26.680> got<00:04:27.010> a<00:04:27.040> whiff

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
very toxic fumes I actually got a whiff

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.810 
very toxic fumes I actually got a whiff
of<00:04:27.400> one<00:04:27.669> and<00:04:27.940> I<00:04:29.370> would<00:04:30.370> not<00:04:30.550> recommend

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
of one and I would not recommend

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.650 
of one and I would not recommend
breathing<00:04:31.540> that<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:33.940> need<00:04:34.120> to<00:04:34.240> find<00:04:34.450> the

breathing that you need to find the
proper<00:04:34.900> temperature<00:04:35.530> if<00:04:35.650> you're<00:04:35.770> using<00:04:35.950> it

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
proper temperature if you're using it

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.250 
proper temperature if you're using it
for<00:04:36.280> now<00:04:36.400> lens<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.940> like<00:04:37.090> recycle<00:04:37.690> metal<00:04:38.020> or

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
for now lens to like recycle metal or

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.400 
for now lens to like recycle metal or
mold<00:04:39.040> stuff<00:04:39.400> to<00:04:39.970> melt<00:04:40.210> it<00:04:40.450> and<00:04:40.660> not<00:04:40.900> burn<00:04:41.230> it

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
mold stuff to melt it and not burn it

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.220 
mold stuff to melt it and not burn it
very<00:04:41.680> thin<00:04:41.980> stuff<00:04:42.340> burns<00:04:42.760> really<00:04:43.180> easily<00:04:43.750> if

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
very thin stuff burns really easily if

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.750 
very thin stuff burns really easily if
you<00:04:44.320> notice<00:04:44.680> what<00:04:44.890> the<00:04:45.010> thicker<00:04:45.250> aluminum

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
you notice what the thicker aluminum

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.540 
you notice what the thicker aluminum
sheet<00:04:46.030> took<00:04:46.600> a<00:04:46.690> long<00:04:46.870> time<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.860> get<00:04:47.980> that<00:04:48.190> going

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
sheet took a long time to get that going

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.310 
sheet took a long time to get that going
thicker<00:04:48.850> materials<00:04:49.570> dissipate<00:04:50.140> the<00:04:50.290> heat

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
thicker materials dissipate the heat

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.300 
thicker materials dissipate the heat
rapidly<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.669> thinner<00:04:52.510> material<00:04:53.310> dissolves

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
rapidly the thinner material dissolves

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.670 
rapidly the thinner material dissolves
pretty<00:04:54.520> quickly<00:04:54.760> so<00:04:55.060> if<00:04:55.180> you<00:04:55.330> do<00:04:55.570> take<00:04:56.440> like<00:04:56.650> a

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
pretty quickly so if you do take like a

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.700 
pretty quickly so if you do take like a
bunch<00:04:56.919> of<00:04:57.070> cans<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:57.639> get<00:04:58.389> them<00:04:58.570> to<00:04:58.990> melt<00:04:59.650> down

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
bunch of cans and get them to melt down

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.670 
bunch of cans and get them to melt down
what<00:05:00.130> you<00:05:00.250> need<00:05:00.400> to<00:05:00.550> do<00:05:00.729> is<00:05:01.080> smash<00:05:02.080> them<00:05:02.410> get

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
what you need to do is smash them get

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.280 
what you need to do is smash them get
them<00:05:02.830> into<00:05:03.100> a<00:05:03.130> dense<00:05:03.550> form<00:05:04.390> before<00:05:04.990> you<00:05:05.110> do

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
them into a dense form before you do

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.020 
them into a dense form before you do
