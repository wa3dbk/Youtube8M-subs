today<00:00:03.679> we're<00:00:03.889> going<00:00:03.980> to<00:00:04.040> take<00:00:04.250> a<00:00:04.279> look<00:00:04.609> at<00:00:04.790> how

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:04.939 
today we're going to take a look at how

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:08.139 
today we're going to take a look at how
to<00:00:05.000> set<00:00:05.359> up<00:00:05.390> the<00:00:05.689> td8<00:00:06.109> module<00:00:06.890> with<00:00:07.609> pentek

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:08.149 
to set up the td8 module with pentek

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.410 
to set up the td8 module with pentek
drums<00:00:08.600> the<00:00:09.350> rolling<00:00:09.950> td8<00:00:10.340> is<00:00:10.699> probably<00:00:11.119> one<00:00:11.389> of

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
drums the rolling td8 is probably one of

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.379 
drums the rolling td8 is probably one of
my<00:00:11.600> favorite<00:00:12.139> modules<00:00:12.670> because<00:00:13.670> it<00:00:13.850> has<00:00:14.029> some

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
my favorite modules because it has some

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.269 
my favorite modules because it has some
of<00:00:14.600> the<00:00:14.900> features<00:00:15.049> of<00:00:15.289> the<00:00:15.529> higher<00:00:15.740> end<00:00:15.980> module

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
of the features of the higher end module

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.270 
of the features of the higher end module
such<00:00:16.820> as<00:00:17.000> the<00:00:17.150> dual<00:00:17.330> zone<00:00:17.660> capabilities<00:00:18.560> it

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:19.280 
such as the dual zone capabilities it

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.590 
such as the dual zone capabilities it
also<00:00:19.550> has<00:00:20.030> an<00:00:20.510> onboard<00:00:20.780> slider<00:00:22.030> like<00:00:23.030> a<00:00:23.090> mixer

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
also has an onboard slider like a mixer

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.660 
also has an onboard slider like a mixer
built<00:00:23.900> on<00:00:24.140> it<00:00:24.320> so<00:00:24.470> you<00:00:24.590> can<00:00:24.740> adjust<00:00:25.100> the<00:00:25.280> volume

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
built on it so you can adjust the volume

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.930 
built on it so you can adjust the volume
of<00:00:25.850> your<00:00:26.000> toms<00:00:26.270> snare<00:00:26.840> symbols<00:00:27.410> etc<00:00:27.940> without

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
of your toms snare symbols etc without

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.880 
of your toms snare symbols etc without
having<00:00:29.240> to<00:00:29.330> go<00:00:29.449> into<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:29.900> software<00:00:30.170> side<00:00:30.740> of

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
having to go into the software side of

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.409 
having to go into the software side of
the<00:00:30.949> module<00:00:31.100> it's<00:00:31.460> right<00:00:31.699> there<00:00:31.940> on<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.119> top

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
the module it's right there on the top

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.510 
the module it's right there on the top
plus<00:00:33.199> the<00:00:33.469> good<00:00:33.649> part<00:00:33.860> about<00:00:33.920> it<00:00:34.219> is<00:00:34.340> it's

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
plus the good part about it is it's

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.270 
plus the good part about it is it's
reasonably<00:00:35.089> priced<00:00:35.769> compared<00:00:36.769> to<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.100> other

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979 
great about the td8 you can install the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.879 
great about the td8 you can install the
V<00:00:52.190> expressions<00:00:52.999> packages<00:00:53.749> and<00:00:53.929> make<00:00:54.739> the

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:54.889 
V expressions packages and make the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:57.669 
V expressions packages and make the
module<00:00:55.339> really<00:00:55.729> seen<00:00:56.089> so<00:00:57.019> let's<00:00:57.199> go<00:00:57.379> ahead<00:00:57.469> and

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679 
module really seen so let's go ahead and

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.649 
module really seen so let's go ahead and
jump<00:00:57.859> into<00:00:58.069> the<00:00:58.280> module<00:00:58.729> and<00:00:58.940> take<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.239> look<00:00:59.539> at

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
jump into the module and take a look at

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.039 
jump into the module and take a look at
the<00:00:59.780> settings<00:01:00.879> to<00:01:01.879> get<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.420> trigger

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
the settings to get to the trigger

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.219 
the settings to get to the trigger
editing<00:01:03.649> area<00:01:03.949> we're<00:01:04.909> going<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:05.089> press<00:01:05.330> setup

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
editing area we're going to press setup

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.670 
editing area we're going to press setup
and<00:01:06.470> then<00:01:07.430> f1<00:01:07.789> which<00:01:08.509> is<00:01:08.689> our<00:01:08.840> trigger<00:01:09.170> area

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
and then f1 which is our trigger area

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.090 
and then f1 which is our trigger area
that<00:01:10.549> shows<00:01:10.850> us<00:01:11.090> our<00:01:11.210> trigger<00:01:11.600> bank<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:12.289> then

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
that shows us our trigger bank and then

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.020 
that shows us our trigger bank and then
as<00:01:13.219> you<00:01:13.369> strike<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:13.880> different<00:01:14.210> pads<00:01:16.030> you'll

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
as you strike and different pads you'll

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.529 
as you strike and different pads you'll
notice<00:01:17.390> that<00:01:17.659> cursor<00:01:18.140> follows<00:01:18.649> them<00:01:18.890> around

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
notice that cursor follows them around

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.709 
notice that cursor follows them around
now<00:01:20.539> we'll<00:01:20.719> start<00:01:20.930> off<00:01:21.170> with<00:01:21.200> our<00:01:21.409> snare<00:01:21.859> drum

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
now we'll start off with our snare drum

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.399 
now we'll start off with our snare drum
you'll<00:01:23.719> notice<00:01:24.079> the<00:01:24.289> trigger<00:01:24.710> type<00:01:25.039> is<00:01:25.399> 12a

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
you'll notice the trigger type is 12a

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.740 
you'll notice the trigger type is 12a
then<00:01:27.409> I'm<00:01:27.560> going<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:27.740> hit<00:01:27.890> f1<00:01:28.579> for<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.270> basic

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
then I'm going to hit f1 for the basic

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.190 
then I'm going to hit f1 for the basic
screen<00:01:30.399> you'll<00:01:31.399> notice<00:01:31.609> that<00:01:32.030> sensitivity<00:01:32.659> is

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
screen you'll notice that sensitivity is

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.459 
screen you'll notice that sensitivity is
six<00:01:33.670> threshold<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:34.880> four<00:01:35.270> it's<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.079> linear

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
six threshold is four it's a linear

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:43.300 
six threshold is four it's a linear
curve<00:01:37.039> and<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:38.240> rim<00:01:38.590> sensitivity<00:01:39.590> is<00:01:39.859> six<00:01:42.310> go

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
curve and the rim sensitivity is six go

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.169 
curve and the rim sensitivity is six go
