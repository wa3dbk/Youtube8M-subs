00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
together but have them make sense

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.789 
together but have them make sense
whether<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.659> through<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> color<00:01:31.229> palette

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
whether it's through the color palette

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.350 
whether it's through the color palette
or<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:32.579> they're<00:01:32.850> things<00:01:33.240> are

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
or just because they're things are

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.030 
or just because they're things are
meaningful<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.869> me<00:01:34.110> right

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.200

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
I can't even think about that

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.350
