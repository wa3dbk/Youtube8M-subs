00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
slow-mo in some way or another this is

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.050 
slow-mo in some way or another this is
the<00:00:11.730> burner<00:00:12.330> with<00:00:12.600> way<00:00:13.110> too<00:00:13.139> much<00:00:13.710> air<00:00:14.100> and<00:00:14.970> I

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:15.060 
the burner with way too much air and I

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.890 
the burner with way too much air and I
wanted<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.420> show<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.840> uh<00:00:17.150> you<00:00:18.150> see<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.660> little

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
wanted to show you uh you see the little

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.600 
wanted to show you uh you see the little
sparkles<00:00:19.560> coming<00:00:19.920> out<00:00:20.040> of<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> lot<00:00:20.580> of

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
sparkles coming out of this a lot of

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.370 
sparkles coming out of this a lot of
these<00:00:20.760> are<00:00:20.939> hitting<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.330> back<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
these are hitting the back of the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.830 
these are hitting the back of the
combustion<00:00:22.800> chamber<00:00:24.169> those<00:00:25.169> are<00:00:25.410> unburned

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
combustion chamber those are unburned

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.240 
combustion chamber those are unburned
atomized<00:00:27.840> pieces<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.710> oil<00:00:29.040> and<00:00:30.919> so<00:00:31.919> we<00:00:32.070> don't

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
atomized pieces of oil and so we don't

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.120 
atomized pieces of oil and so we don't
have<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> complete<00:00:32.970> burn<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.560> lot<00:00:35.100> of

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
have a complete burn there a lot of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.979 
have a complete burn there a lot of
these<00:00:35.280> are<00:00:35.489> not<00:00:35.670> burning<00:00:36.000> completely<00:00:36.720> if<00:00:36.840> you

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
these are not burning completely if you

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.220 
these are not burning completely if you
run<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.530> way<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> while<00:00:38.489> uh<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.269> you

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
run it this way for a while uh and you

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.410 
run it this way for a while uh and you
shut<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.680> off<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.250> thing<00:00:41.460> smokes<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.120> son

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
shut it off the thing smokes like a son

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.900 
shut it off the thing smokes like a son
of<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.570> gun<00:00:42.600> because<00:00:43.230> there's<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.250> lot<00:00:44.429> of<00:00:44.550> oil<00:00:44.760> in

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
of a gun because there's a lot of oil in

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.660 
of a gun because there's a lot of oil in
there<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.300> hasn't<00:00:45.480> burnt<00:00:46.100> it's<00:00:47.100> not<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> very

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
there that hasn't burnt it's not a very

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.189 
there that hasn't burnt it's not a very
hot<00:00:47.940> flame<00:00:48.530> because<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:50.449> the<00:00:51.449> massive<00:00:51.899> amount

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
hot flame because the the massive amount

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.290 
hot flame because the the massive amount
of<00:00:52.260> air<00:00:52.559> put<00:00:52.890> into<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.370> actually<00:00:53.550> cools<00:00:54.030> it

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
of air put into it actually cools it

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.079 
of air put into it actually cools it
down<00:00:54.469> so<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> lot<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:55.890> oil<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.489> does<00:00:56.850> not

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
down so a lot of the oil really does not

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.799 
down so a lot of the oil really does not
burn<00:00:57.949> but<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.129> look<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> streaks<00:01:00.359> and

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
burn but you look for the streaks and

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.229 
burn but you look for the streaks and
you<00:01:00.899> look<00:01:01.109> for<00:01:01.320> those<00:01:01.440> little<00:01:01.649> spots<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.579> you

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
you look for those little spots and you

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.800 
you look for those little spots and you
can<00:01:03.420> kind<00:01:03.749> of<00:01:03.839> tell<00:01:04.820> that<00:01:05.820> that's<00:01:06.120> not<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> good

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
can kind of tell that that's not a good

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.700 
can kind of tell that that's not a good
fire<00:01:08.600> it's<00:01:09.600> never<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> produce<00:01:10.410> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
fire it's never going to produce the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.950 
fire it's never going to produce the
heat<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.100> want<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.700> you're<00:01:12.300> probably<00:01:12.660> going

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
heat you want and you're probably going

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.580 
heat you want and you're probably going
to<00:01:13.080> end<00:01:13.260> up<00:01:13.470> with<00:01:13.830> some<00:01:14.630> unburned<00:01:15.630> oil<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.260> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
to end up with some unburned oil in the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.130 
to end up with some unburned oil in the
combustion<00:01:17.010> chamber<00:01:17.540> okay<00:01:18.540> I'm<00:01:18.660> gonna<00:01:18.840> leave

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
combustion chamber okay I'm gonna leave

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.830 
combustion chamber okay I'm gonna leave
this<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.250> watch<00:01:20.970> these<00:01:21.300> streaks

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
this on so you can watch these streaks

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.340 
this on so you can watch these streaks
and<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.530> like<00:01:22.800> that<00:01:23.360> this<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.570> probably<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
and so on like that this is probably the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.070 
and so on like that this is probably the
most<00:01:25.710> common<00:01:26.430> failure<00:01:26.730> in<00:01:27.090> adjusting<00:01:27.750> burns

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
most common failure in adjusting burns

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.100 
most common failure in adjusting burns
is<00:01:28.530> they<00:01:29.520> adjust<00:01:29.940> with<00:01:30.210> too<00:01:30.390> much<00:01:30.570> air<00:01:30.870> because

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
is they adjust with too much air because

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.280 
is they adjust with too much air because
they're<00:01:31.260> afraid<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.710> getting<00:01:31.950> sick<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:34.170> if

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
they're afraid of getting sick but if

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.920 
they're afraid of getting sick but if
you<00:01:34.440> just<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:35.010> too<00:01:35.160> much<00:01:35.340> air<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.910> are<00:01:36.510> going

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
you just with too much air you are going

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.990 
you just with too much air you are going
to<00:01:36.990> decrease<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.070> efficiency<00:01:38.340> pretty

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
to decrease the efficiency pretty

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.930 
to decrease the efficiency pretty
massively<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.040> you<00:01:41.040> won't<00:01:41.250> completely<00:01:41.760> burn

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
massively and you won't completely burn

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.100 
massively and you won't completely burn
the<00:01:42.120> oil<00:01:43.880> okay<00:01:44.880> next<00:01:45.300> I'm<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.840> show<00:01:46.080> you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the oil okay next I'm going to show you

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.960 
the oil okay next I'm going to show you
by<00:01:46.410> contrast<00:01:47.480> what<00:01:48.480> the<00:01:49.280> flame<00:01:50.280> looks<00:01:50.640> like

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
by contrast what the flame looks like

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.940 
by contrast what the flame looks like
when<00:01:51.980> it's<00:01:52.980> about<00:01:53.940> the<00:01:54.000> right<00:01:54.510> air<00:01:55.320> make<00:01:55.920> sure

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
when it's about the right air make sure

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.760 
when it's about the right air make sure
you<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.460> see<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.120> there's<00:01:57.870> no<00:01:58.050> spark<00:01:58.440> leaves

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
you can see that there's no spark leaves

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.170 
you can see that there's no spark leaves
in<00:01:58.980> it<00:01:59.100> or<00:01:59.220> anything<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.760> that

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
in it or anything like that

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.010 
in it or anything like that
ah<00:02:01.280> lots<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.460> big<00:02:02.640> licks<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.270> flame<00:02:03.600> you're

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
ah lots of big licks of flame you're

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.529 
ah lots of big licks of flame you're
getting<00:02:04.230> a<00:02:04.380> pretty<00:02:04.800> fair<00:02:05.900> combustion<00:02:06.900> with

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
getting a pretty fair combustion with

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.020 
getting a pretty fair combustion with
with<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.720> up<00:02:10.069> reducing<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.459> amount<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.819> hair

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
with it up reducing the amount of hair

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.260 
with it up reducing the amount of hair
into<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.989> burn<00:02:13.760> next<00:02:14.760> we're<00:02:14.850> going<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.030> talk

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
into the burn next we're going to talk

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.990 
into the burn next we're going to talk
about

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
about

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.780 
about
two<00:02:17.330> little<00:02:17.540> air<00:02:18.190> that'll<00:02:19.190> be<00:02:19.340> on<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.610> next

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
two little air that'll be on the next

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.170 
two little air that'll be on the next
one

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.239 

you
