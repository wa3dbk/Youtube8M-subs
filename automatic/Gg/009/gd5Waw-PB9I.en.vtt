00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.940 

we<00:00:03.210> come<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.659> what<00:00:03.840> is<00:00:03.870> arguably<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.620> hardest

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
we come to what is arguably the hardest

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.490 
we come to what is arguably the hardest
joint<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.700> skin<00:00:06.000> properly<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:07.109> shoulder

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
joint to skin properly the shoulder

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.980 
joint to skin properly the shoulder
joint<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:08.760> reason<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.240> this<00:00:09.570> joint<00:00:09.840> is

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
joint the reason is that this joint is

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.740 
joint the reason is that this joint is
articulated<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:10.830> many<00:00:11.040> different<00:00:11.250> ways<00:00:11.750> the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
articulated in many different ways the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.810 
articulated in many different ways the
vertices<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.380> area<00:00:13.980> often<00:00:14.160> respond<00:00:14.700> to

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
vertices in that area often respond to

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.290 
vertices in that area often respond to
three<00:00:15.030> or<00:00:15.150> even<00:00:15.179> four<00:00:15.509> bones<00:00:16.049> simultaneously

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
three or even four bones simultaneously

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.390 
three or even four bones simultaneously
the<00:00:18.300> key<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.750> identifying<00:00:18.960> those<00:00:19.740> bones<00:00:20.100> and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
the key is identifying those bones and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.240 
the key is identifying those bones and
applying<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.270> proper<00:00:21.630> weights<00:00:22.039> there<00:00:23.039> are<00:00:23.130> no

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
skinning as you have learned so far is

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.120 
skinning as you have learned so far is
mostly<00:00:28.650> visual<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.789> bit<00:00:29.910> instinctive

first<00:00:32.130> adjust<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> animation<00:00:33.059> length<00:00:33.570> to

first adjust the animation length to

isn't<00:00:46.620> working<00:00:47.070> too<00:00:47.280> well<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.820> you're<00:00:47.969> about

if<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.700> rotate<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> shoulder<00:01:36.869> and

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
if you just rotate the shoulder and

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.480 
if you just rotate the shoulder and
leave<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.329> clavicle<00:01:39.810> untouched<00:01:40.310> this<00:01:41.310> would

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
leave the clavicle untouched this would

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.620 
leave the clavicle untouched this would
result<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:42.000> bad<00:01:42.210> joint<00:01:42.630> animation<00:01:47.630> before
