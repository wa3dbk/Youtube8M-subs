00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
five nights at Freddy's theory and this

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.100 
five nights at Freddy's theory and this
one<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.690> why<00:00:06.960> foxy<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.099> broken<00:00:08.910> in<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.750> first

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
one is why foxy is broken in the first

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:29.570 
one is why foxy is broken in the first
game<00:00:10.910> so<00:00:11.910> let's<00:00:12.750> talk<00:00:13.019> about<00:00:13.230> that

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.170 

so<00:00:30.690> when<00:00:31.690> you<00:00:31.870> look<00:00:32.349> at<00:00:32.590> foxy<00:00:33.220> from<00:00:33.580> the<00:00:33.850> first

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
so when you look at foxy from the first

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.230 
so when you look at foxy from the first
game<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.870> model<00:00:35.260> of<00:00:35.410> foxy<00:00:36.010> you<00:00:36.550> can<00:00:36.790> see<00:00:37.030> that

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.240 
game the model of foxy you can see that

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.110 
game the model of foxy you can see that
he<00:00:37.360> has<00:00:37.390> holes<00:00:37.750> throughout<00:00:38.590> his<00:00:38.890> body<00:00:39.370> from

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
he has holes throughout his body from

his chest to his arms through his upper

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.100 
his chest to his arms through his upper
legs<00:00:44.560> his<00:00:45.400> lower<00:00:46.090> legs<00:00:46.420> from<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:46.780> knee<00:00:47.080> down

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
legs his lower legs from the knee down

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.880 
legs his lower legs from the knee down
to<00:00:47.950> the<00:00:48.070> foot<00:00:48.430> have<00:00:49.090> nothing<00:00:49.930> on<00:00:50.200> them<00:00:50.650> no

padding nothing why is this well here's
a<00:00:57.430> few<00:00:57.850> reasons<00:00:58.739> first<00:00:59.739> let's<00:01:00.190> take<00:01:00.580> a<00:01:00.909> look<00:01:01.269> at

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
a few reasons first let's take a look at

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.190 
a few reasons first let's take a look at
withered<00:01:01.989> foxy<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.980> the<00:01:03.430> whole<00:01:03.670> event<00:01:04.390> of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.960 

1987<00:01:08.200> with<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.620> second<00:01:09.010> restaurant<00:01:09.490> we<00:01:09.850> have

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
1987 with the second restaurant we have

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.840 
1987 with the second restaurant we have
withered<00:01:10.270> foxy<00:01:10.600> compared<00:01:11.290> to<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.680> original

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
withered foxy compared to the original

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.120 
withered foxy compared to the original
foxy<00:01:12.850> clearly<00:01:13.780> they're<00:01:14.050> different<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.920> new

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
foxy clearly they're different the new

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.420 
foxy clearly they're different the new
foxy<00:01:15.610> is<00:01:15.760> a<00:01:15.790> much<00:01:16.090> shorter<00:01:16.690> more<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:17.800> a<00:01:17.950> human

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
foxy is a much shorter more of a human

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.300 
foxy is a much shorter more of a human
size<00:01:19.120> than<00:01:19.720> much<00:01:20.560> taller

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
size than much taller

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.460 
size than much taller
um<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:23.350> heads<00:01:23.620> are<00:01:24.090> greatly<00:01:25.090> different<00:01:25.600> the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
um the heads are greatly different the

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.219 
um the heads are greatly different the
feet<00:01:27.100> are<00:01:27.510> extremely<00:01:28.510> different<00:01:28.720> and<00:01:29.049> of

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
feet are extremely different and of

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.410 
feet are extremely different and of
course<00:01:29.440> withered<00:01:29.950> foxy<00:01:30.159> is<00:01:30.520> more<00:01:30.790> withered

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
course withered foxy is more withered

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.360 
course withered foxy is more withered
than<00:01:32.430> regular<00:01:33.430> foxy<00:01:34.120> but<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.860> feet<00:01:36.130> really

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
than regular foxy but the feet really

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.690 
than regular foxy but the feet really
get<00:01:36.700> me<00:01:36.940> foxy<00:01:37.930> actually<00:01:38.470> kind<00:01:38.740> of<00:01:38.890> has<00:01:39.010> claws

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
get me foxy actually kind of has claws

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.070 
get me foxy actually kind of has claws
in<00:01:41.370> the<00:01:42.370> withered<00:01:42.640> form<00:01:42.880> but<00:01:43.420> new<00:01:43.600> form<00:01:43.960> he

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080

seem<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.599> be<00:02:19.750> finished<00:02:20.760> why<00:02:21.760> is<00:02:21.819> this<00:02:22.420> why<00:02:22.750> is

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
seem to be finished why is this why is

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.180 
seem to be finished why is this why is
foxy<00:02:23.680> old<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:25.269> broken<00:02:25.840> what<00:02:26.650> happened

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
foxy old and broken what happened

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.960 
foxy old and broken what happened
between<00:02:27.879> the<00:02:28.569> second<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:30.370> first<00:02:30.580> game

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
between the second and the first game

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.970 
between the second and the first game
when<00:02:31.480> after<00:02:32.170> they<00:02:32.319> remodeled<00:02:32.680> the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
when after they remodeled the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
when after they remodeled the
animatronics<00:02:33.640> what<00:02:33.970> happened<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:35.110> foxy<00:02:36.000> well

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
animatronics what happened to foxy well

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.410 
animatronics what happened to foxy well
the<00:02:37.900> biggest<00:02:38.230> theory<00:02:38.830> is<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.910> company

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
the biggest theory is that the company

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.120 
the biggest theory is that the company
just<00:02:40.900> didn't<00:02:41.470> have<00:02:41.620> the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
just didn't have the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.190 
just didn't have the
to<00:02:42.400> finish<00:02:42.880> foxy<00:02:44.520> okay<00:02:45.520> that<00:02:46.270> but<00:02:46.480> foxy<00:02:47.110> is

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
to finish foxy okay that but foxy is

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.640 
to finish foxy okay that but foxy is
clearly<00:02:48.180> very<00:02:49.180> close<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.750> being<00:02:49.900> finished<00:02:50.200> and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
clearly very close to being finished and

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.400 
clearly very close to being finished and
if<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.400> were<00:02:51.580> some<00:02:52.120> sort<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.450> fabric<00:02:52.960> like<00:02:53.110> that

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
if it were some sort of fabric like that

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.820 
if it were some sort of fabric like that

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
it would not have holes like that in it

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.220 
it would not have holes like that in it
it<00:02:56.830> would<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:58.120> would<00:02:58.270> have<00:02:58.450> holes<00:02:58.720> somewhere

it would it would have holes somewhere

it would it would have holes somewhere
else<00:02:59.410> not<00:02:59.770> in<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.580> middle<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.780> fabric

that's<00:03:02.770> not<00:03:03.160> how<00:03:03.750> fabric<00:03:04.750> works<00:03:05.170> when<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.650> put

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
that's not how fabric works when you put

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.580 
that's not how fabric works when you put
it<00:03:06.490> on<00:03:06.610> something<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:07.210> don't<00:03:07.420> just<00:03:07.780> leave<00:03:08.560> a

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
it on something you don't just leave a

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.540 
it on something you don't just leave a
big<00:03:09.010> hole<00:03:09.060> for<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.300> be<00:03:10.450> filled<00:03:10.810> up<00:03:11.080> later<00:03:11.500> on<00:03:11.740> it

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
big hole for to be filled up later on it

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.630 
big hole for to be filled up later on it
would<00:03:12.700> have<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:13.000> be<00:03:13.030> worn<00:03:13.450> out<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:15.040> can't

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
would have to be worn out so that can't

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.710 
would have to be worn out so that can't
be<00:03:15.790> it

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
be it

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.120 
be it
and<00:03:17.220> if<00:03:18.480> foxy<00:03:19.480> caused<00:03:19.960> the<00:03:20.170> bite<00:03:20.320> of<00:03:20.350> 87<00:03:20.560> you

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
and if foxy caused the bite of 87 you

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.510 
and if foxy caused the bite of 87 you
may<00:03:21.280> be<00:03:21.340> asking<00:03:21.820> well<00:03:22.090> when<00:03:22.720> why<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:24.280> could

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
may be asking well when why that could

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.420 
may be asking well when why that could
fit<00:03:24.700> into<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:25.090> what<00:03:25.240> if<00:03:25.330> foxy<00:03:25.720> caused<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.260> if

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
fit into it what if foxy caused it if

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.070 
fit into it what if foxy caused it if
you<00:03:27.430> had<00:03:27.640> an<00:03:27.790> animatronic<00:03:28.120> that<00:03:28.570> killed<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.930> kid

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
you had an animatronic that killed a kid

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.650 
you had an animatronic that killed a kid
you<00:03:29.200> probably<00:03:29.320> wouldn't<00:03:29.830> keep<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.330> okay

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
you probably wouldn't keep it okay

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.800 
you probably wouldn't keep it okay
so<00:03:32.560> bite<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.400> 87<00:03:33.520> can't<00:03:34.390> be<00:03:34.810> it<00:03:35.130> either<00:03:36.450> so<00:03:37.450> what

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
so bite of 87 can't be it either so what

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.100 
so bite of 87 can't be it either so what
is<00:03:38.080> it<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:38.860> mean<00:03:39.400> we<00:03:39.580> know<00:03:39.700> foxy<00:03:40.240> is<00:03:40.330> clearly<00:03:40.870> out

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
is it I mean we know foxy is clearly out

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.370 
is it I mean we know foxy is clearly out
of<00:03:41.250> order<00:03:42.630> right<00:03:44.370> but<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.520> thing<00:03:45.550> is<00:03:46.230> we<00:03:47.230> also

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
of order right but the thing is we also

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.650 
of order right but the thing is we also
have<00:03:47.530> golden<00:03:47.950> Freddy<00:03:48.280> who<00:03:48.850> is<00:03:49.000> out<00:03:49.270> of<00:03:49.300> order

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
have golden Freddy who is out of order

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
have golden Freddy who is out of order
but<00:03:50.350> he<00:03:50.650> isn't<00:03:51.220> kept<00:03:51.640> in<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:52.690> room<00:03:53.200> all<00:03:53.500> to

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
but he isn't kept in a room all to

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.820 
but he isn't kept in a room all to
himself<00:03:53.830> foxy<00:03:54.580> has<00:03:54.670> pirate<00:03:55.060> Cove<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:56.590> why

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
himself foxy has pirate Cove so why

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.670 
himself foxy has pirate Cove so why
would<00:03:57.310> they<00:03:57.460> leave<00:03:57.670> an<00:03:58.000> animatronic<00:03:58.540> in<00:03:59.110> an

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
would they leave an animatronic in an

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.530 
would they leave an animatronic in an
easy<00:04:00.070> to<00:04:00.370> get<00:04:00.880> space<00:04:01.480> that<00:04:02.470> is<00:04:03.120> clearly<00:04:04.120> open

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
easy to get space that is clearly open

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.260 
easy to get space that is clearly open
with<00:04:05.140> just<00:04:05.470> a<00:04:05.590> curtain<00:04:06.040> golden<00:04:06.910> Freddy's

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
with just a curtain golden Freddy's

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.150 
with just a curtain golden Freddy's
probably<00:04:07.750> somewhere<00:04:08.080> in<00:04:08.200> parts<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.620> storage

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
probably somewhere in parts and storage

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.870 
probably somewhere in parts and storage
who<00:04:09.520> knows<00:04:09.760> where<00:04:10.470> but<00:04:11.470> they<00:04:12.400> even<00:04:12.670> have<00:04:12.790> an

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
who knows where but they even have an

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.030 
who knows where but they even have an
endoskeleton<00:04:13.300> parts<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:13.900> storage<00:04:14.260> but<00:04:14.770> not

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
endoskeleton parts and storage but not

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.370

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
sitting out in the open so why is foxy

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.450 
sitting out in the open so why is foxy
there<00:04:20.620> if<00:04:20.830> foxy<00:04:21.340> is<00:04:21.520> broken<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.510> we<00:04:22.950> know<00:04:23.950> foxy

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
there if foxy is broken and we know foxy

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.940 
there if foxy is broken and we know foxy
isn't<00:04:24.820> broken<00:04:25.120> because<00:04:26.050> we<00:04:26.530> have<00:04:26.740> the

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
isn't broken because we have the

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.180 
isn't broken because we have the
animatronics<00:04:27.850> that<00:04:28.090> can<00:04:28.420> move<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:29.410> clearly

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
animatronics that can move and clearly

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.730 
animatronics that can move and clearly
foxy<00:04:30.670> can<00:04:30.820> move<00:04:30.970> foxy<00:04:31.420> runs<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.560> other

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
foxy can move foxy runs the other

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.330 
foxy can move foxy runs the other
animatronics<00:04:33.670> at<00:04:33.910> least<00:04:34.530> don't<00:04:35.530> run<00:04:35.950> they<00:04:36.190> may

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
animatronics at least don't run they may

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.450 
animatronics at least don't run they may
not<00:04:36.490> have<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.820> capability<00:04:37.540> to<00:04:37.570> run<00:04:37.720> but<00:04:38.710> they

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
not have the capability to run but they

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.300 
not have the capability to run but they
run<00:04:41.430> so<00:04:42.430> or<00:04:42.820> they<00:04:43.450> don't<00:04:43.660> run<00:04:43.960> foxy<00:04:44.440> runs<00:04:44.680> so

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
run so or they don't run foxy runs so

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.810 
run so or they don't run foxy runs so
why<00:04:45.670> is<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:48.480> boxes<00:04:49.480> like<00:04:49.660> this

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
why is it that boxes like this

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.140 
why is it that boxes like this
well<00:04:51.780> we<00:04:52.560> don't<00:04:52.740> really<00:04:52.860> know<00:04:53.250> and<00:04:53.550> you

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
well we don't really know and you

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.600 
well we don't really know and you
probably<00:04:54.360> will<00:04:54.810> just<00:04:55.260> saying<00:04:55.500> oh<00:04:55.680> well<00:04:56.010> the

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
probably will just saying oh well the

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.250 
probably will just saying oh well the
child<00:04:56.880> that<00:04:57.150> possessed<00:04:57.540> him<00:04:57.630> is<00:04:57.840> making<00:04:58.170> him

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
child that possessed him is making him

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.340 
child that possessed him is making him
run<00:04:58.550> that<00:04:59.550> can't<00:04:59.850> be<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:00.180> golden<00:05:01.020> Freddy's

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
run that can't be it golden Freddy's

run that can't be it golden Freddy's
possessed<00:05:01.740> but<00:05:01.920> he<00:05:02.040> can't<00:05:02.250> move<00:05:02.460> he's<00:05:03.180> just

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
possessed but he can't move he's just

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.060 
possessed but he can't move he's just
sitting<00:05:03.720> there<00:05:03.750> lifeless<00:05:04.140> and<00:05:04.500> he<00:05:04.650> does<00:05:04.860> have

sitting there lifeless and he does have

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.820 
sitting there lifeless and he does have
an<00:05:05.220> endoskeleton<00:05:05.850> if<00:05:06.270> you<00:05:06.420> look<00:05:06.660> closely<00:05:07.020> he

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
an endoskeleton if you look closely he

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.970 
an endoskeleton if you look closely he
does<00:05:08.070> have<00:05:08.280> an<00:05:08.400> endoskeleton<00:05:08.970> so<00:05:09.780> foxy<00:05:10.380> is<00:05:10.590> not

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
does have an endoskeleton so foxy is not

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.200 
does have an endoskeleton so foxy is not
broken

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
broken

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.350

nothing<00:05:12.870> is<00:05:13.110> physically<00:05:13.860> wrong<00:05:14.190> with<00:05:14.360> foxy

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
nothing is physically wrong with foxy

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.660 
nothing is physically wrong with foxy
