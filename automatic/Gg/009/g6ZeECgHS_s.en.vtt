new<00:02:30.060> guys<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:31.170> know<00:02:31.320> like<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:31.769> other<00:02:32.220> teams

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
new guys you know like like other teams

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.370 
new guys you know like like other teams
might<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.120> we<00:02:33.209> can<00:02:33.390> pick<00:02:33.900> up<00:02:34.019> kind<00:02:34.290> of

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
might have so we can pick up kind of

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.199 
might have so we can pick up kind of
what<00:02:34.530> we<00:02:34.620> left<00:02:34.800> off<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.000> said

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
what we left off and just like I said

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.640 
what we left off and just like I said
before<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.510> hit<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.630> ground<00:02:36.690> on<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.170> how<00:02:37.500> much

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
before I hit the ground on it how much

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.110 
before I hit the ground on it how much
advantage<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.400> because<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.090> a

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
advantage is that because this is a

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.640 
advantage is that because this is a
lockout<00:02:39.510> season<00:02:39.930> teams<00:02:40.230> are<00:02:40.380> going<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.560> have

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
lockout season teams are going to have

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.810 
lockout season teams are going to have
time<00:02:40.800> in<00:02:41.010> training<00:02:41.310> camp<00:02:41.340> practices

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
time in training camp practices

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.070 
time in training camp practices

camp<00:02:45.570> some<00:02:45.750> too<00:02:45.900> weak<00:02:46.080> I<00:02:46.200> mean<00:02:46.410> first<00:02:46.709> games<00:02:46.950> in

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
camp some too weak I mean first games in

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.210 
camp some too weak I mean first games in
two<00:02:47.220> weeks<00:02:47.430> we've<00:02:48.150> got<00:02:48.300> two<00:02:48.510> weeks<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.220> we

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
two weeks we've got two weeks and we

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.930 
two weeks we've got two weeks and we
play<00:02:50.400> for<00:02:50.430> keeps<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:51.630> know<00:02:51.750> what<00:02:51.870> i<00:02:51.930> mean<00:02:52.050> so

play for keeps you know what i mean so
that's<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.060> certain<00:02:54.420> advantage<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:55.050> we<00:02:55.110> have

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
that's a certain advantage that we have

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.790 
that's a certain advantage that we have
to<00:02:55.590> make<00:02:55.769> sure<00:02:55.800> we<00:02:56.130> secure<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:57.230> we<00:02:58.230> just<00:02:58.470> work

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
to make sure we secure and we just work

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.320 
to make sure we secure and we just work
off<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.010> everything<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.670> hopefully<00:03:00.000> we<00:03:00.150> can

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
off of everything and hopefully we can

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.200 
off of everything and hopefully we can
work<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.050> our<00:03:01.110> advantage
