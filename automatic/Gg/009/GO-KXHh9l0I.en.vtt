mass to horn okay so this particular
right<00:01:20.310> horn<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:21.740> 36<00:01:22.740> inches<00:01:23.100> long<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.390> order

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
right horn is 36 inches long so in order

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.690 
right horn is 36 inches long so in order
to<00:01:24.869> get<00:01:25.050> your<00:01:25.260> mass<00:01:25.530> measurements<00:01:26.280> all<00:01:26.400> eight

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
to get your mass measurements all eight

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.300 
to get your mass measurements all eight
mass<00:01:26.970> measurements<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:28.260> take<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> length<00:01:29.040> of

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
mass measurements you take the length of

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.800 
mass measurements you take the length of
the<00:01:29.430> longest<00:01:29.910> horn<00:01:30.300> in<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:31.380> particular<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
the longest horn in this particular of

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.410 
the longest horn in this particular of
RAM<00:01:33.810> that's<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.770> website<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.729> right<00:01:36.090> horn

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
RAM that's on the website the right horn

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.249 
RAM that's on the website the right horn
is<00:01:36.630> 36<00:01:37.290> inches<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.670> left<00:01:38.940> horn<00:01:39.300> is<00:01:39.509> 34<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
is 36 inches and the left horn is 34 and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.880 
is 36 inches and the left horn is 34 and
1/8<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.360> order<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.960> get<00:01:43.290> our<00:01:43.440> mass<00:01:43.680> we're

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
1/8 so in order to get our mass we're

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.380 
1/8 so in order to get our mass we're
going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> take<00:01:44.250> our<00:01:44.369> longest<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.030> which<00:01:45.210> is

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
going to take our longest one which is

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.630 
going to take our longest one which is
36<00:01:45.960> inches<00:01:46.200> we're<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.679> divide<00:01:47.039> that<00:01:47.369> by

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
36 inches we're going to divide that by

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.969 
36 inches we're going to divide that by
4<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.960> divided<00:01:49.470> by<00:01:49.800> 4<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:51.380> gives<00:01:52.380> us<00:01:53.660> 9<00:01:54.979> 18

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
4 so divided by 4 and that gives us 9 18

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.020 
4 so divided by 4 and that gives us 9 18
and<00:01:56.280> 27<00:01:56.990> 36<00:01:57.990> divided<00:01:58.500> by<00:01:58.530> 4<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:58.920> 9<00:01:59.310> inches<00:01:59.789> so

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
and 27 36 divided by 4 is 9 inches so

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.809 
and 27 36 divided by 4 is 9 inches so
from<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.479> base<00:02:00.690> point<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:02.069> the<00:02:02.250> baseline

horn<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:37.250> right<00:03:37.550> horn<00:03:37.880> is<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.120> longest<00:03:38.690> one

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
horn the right horn is the longest one

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.470 
horn the right horn is the longest one
so<00:03:39.080> it's<00:03:39.230> 36<00:03:39.860> so<00:03:40.100> you<00:03:40.160> still<00:03:40.640> are<00:03:40.880> taking<00:03:41.300> your

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
so it's 36 so you still are taking your

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.259 
so it's 36 so you still are taking your
zero<00:03:41.900> your<00:03:42.290> 9<00:03:42.560> you're<00:03:42.980> 18<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.400> you're<00:03:43.640> 27

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
zero your 9 you're 18 and you're 27

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.110 
zero your 9 you're 18 and you're 27
you're<00:03:45.140> dividing<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.800> longest<00:03:46.220> horn<00:03:46.459> by<00:03:46.760> 4

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
you're dividing the longest horn by 4

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.190 
you're dividing the longest horn by 4
that<00:03:47.780> gives<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:48.080> your<00:03:48.200> 4<00:03:48.560> spots<00:03:48.950> on<00:03:49.190> each<00:03:49.640> horn

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
that gives you your 4 spots on each horn

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.720 
that gives you your 4 spots on each horn
okay<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:52.840> deep<00:03:53.840> 3<00:03:54.260> measurement<00:03:54.980> on<00:03:55.190> our<00:03:55.400> left

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730

divide<00:05:26.420> it<00:05:26.750> by<00:05:26.900> four<00:05:27.290> you<00:05:28.250> have<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.490> get<00:05:29.180> the

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
divide it by four you have to get the

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.930 
divide it by four you have to get the
eights<00:05:29.780> get<00:05:30.260> everything<00:05:30.500> exact<00:05:31.190> because<00:05:31.670> if

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
eights get everything exact because if

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.990 
eights get everything exact because if
this<00:05:32.440> measurement<00:05:33.440> starts<00:05:33.800> sliding<00:05:34.490> up<00:05:34.700> if

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
this measurement starts sliding up if

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.510 
this measurement starts sliding up if
all<00:05:35.210> these<00:05:35.420> slide<00:05:35.870> a<00:05:35.900> little<00:05:36.290> this<00:05:36.560> way<00:05:36.830> you're

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
all these slide a little this way you're

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.980 
all these slide a little this way you're
obviously<00:05:37.700> going<00:05:38.000> to<00:05:38.090> get<00:05:38.240> the<00:05:38.390> thicker<00:05:38.660> part

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
obviously going to get the thicker part

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.510 
obviously going to get the thicker part
of<00:05:39.140> the<00:05:39.200> horn<00:05:39.440> and<00:05:39.560> your<00:05:39.710> scores<00:05:40.070> going<00:05:40.310> to<00:05:40.400> go

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
of the horn and your scores going to go

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.980 
of the horn and your scores going to go
up<00:05:40.670> and<00:05:40.850> then<00:05:40.970> when<00:05:41.150> it<00:05:41.240> gets<00:05:41.330> officially

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
up and then when it gets officially

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.510 
up and then when it gets officially
scored<00:05:42.320> you're<00:05:42.470> going<00:05:42.590> to<00:05:42.650> be<00:05:42.770> disappointed

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
scored you're going to be disappointed

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.750 
scored you're going to be disappointed
so<00:05:44.360> make<00:05:45.230> sure<00:05:45.260> you're<00:05:45.620> very<00:05:45.650> exact<00:05:46.430> when<00:05:46.640> you

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
so make sure you're very exact when you

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.850 
so make sure you're very exact when you
find<00:05:47.090> your<00:05:47.420> base<00:05:47.630> and<00:05:47.660> when<00:05:48.140> you<00:05:48.260> measure<00:05:48.530> the

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
find your base and when you measure the

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.520 
find your base and when you measure the
length<00:05:49.040> of<00:05:49.280> your<00:05:49.430> horn<00:05:49.760> one<00:05:50.510> another<00:05:51.140> thing<00:05:51.410> to

length of your horn one another thing to
point<00:05:51.740> out<00:05:51.950> too<00:05:52.310> is<00:05:52.340> if<00:05:52.730> a<00:05:53.240> lot<00:05:53.690> of<00:05:53.720> times<00:05:54.050> the

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
point out too is if a lot of times the

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.050 
point out too is if a lot of times the
the<00:05:54.560> horns<00:05:54.860> are<00:05:55.010> broomed<00:05:55.280> off<00:05:55.580> and<00:05:55.820> you<00:05:55.910> have

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
the horns are broomed off and you have

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.290 
the horns are broomed off and you have
it's<00:05:56.660> not<00:05:56.960> a<00:05:56.990> ninety<00:05:57.830> degree<00:05:57.950> angle<00:05:58.460> you<00:05:58.610> would

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
it's not a ninety degree angle you would

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.360 
it's not a ninety degree angle you would
continue<00:06:00.050> your<00:06:00.320> length<00:06:00.680> of<00:06:00.890> your<00:06:01.100> horn

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
continue your length of your horn

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.450 
continue your length of your horn
measurement<00:06:01.880> around<00:06:02.240> and<00:06:02.800> then<00:06:03.800> it<00:06:04.250> would

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
measurement around and then it would

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.490 
measurement around and then it would
come<00:06:04.760> up<00:06:04.970> like<00:06:05.180> this<00:06:05.420> dotted<00:06:05.720> line<00:06:05.960> to<00:06:06.470> a

come up like this dotted line to a

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.160 
come up like this dotted line to a
ninety<00:06:07.010> degree<00:06:07.160> and<00:06:07.760> that's<00:06:08.450> where<00:06:08.840> you<00:06:09.020> would

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
ninety degree and that's where you would

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.650 
ninety degree and that's where you would
take<00:06:09.410> your<00:06:10.100> tape<00:06:10.430> would<00:06:10.610> come<00:06:10.880> all<00:06:11.150> the<00:06:11.330> way<00:06:11.450> up

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
take your tape would come all the way up

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.570 
take your tape would come all the way up
to<00:06:11.870> this<00:06:12.110> point<00:06:12.470> right<00:06:12.680> here<00:06:12.740> taking

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
to this point right here taking

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.030 
to this point right here taking
advantage<00:06:14.060> of<00:06:14.210> that<00:06:14.360> little<00:06:14.420> tip<00:06:14.990> you<00:06:15.290> would

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
advantage of that little tip you would

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.270 
advantage of that little tip you would
not<00:06:16.280> measure<00:06:16.610> it<00:06:16.880> right<00:06:17.120> here<00:06:17.360> at<00:06:17.450> this<00:06:17.630> point

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
not measure it right here at this point

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.790 
not measure it right here at this point
would<00:06:19.280> not<00:06:19.340> be<00:06:19.580> here<00:06:20.330> it<00:06:21.200> would<00:06:21.320> come<00:06:21.530> all<00:06:21.680> the

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
would not be here it would come all the

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.320 
would not be here it would come all the
way<00:06:21.830> out<00:06:21.920> to<00:06:22.160> here<00:06:22.190> so<00:06:22.520> you<00:06:22.580> actually<00:06:22.820> gain

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
way out to here so you actually gain

way out to here so you actually gain
this<00:06:23.690> bit<00:06:24.440> of<00:06:24.590> distance<00:06:25.070> right<00:06:25.310> there

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
this bit of distance right there
