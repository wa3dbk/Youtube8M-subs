00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
blocks so that's really neat for

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.709 
blocks so that's really neat for
building<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.730> stuff<00:00:32.940> like<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.510> really

helpful<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.640> also<00:00:35.640> when<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.270> break<00:00:36.600> ice<00:00:36.840> it

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
helpful and also when you break ice it

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.860 
helpful and also when you break ice it
doesn't<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:38.160> create<00:00:38.489> water<00:00:38.760> anymore<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.390> it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
doesn't like create water anymore it it

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.959 
doesn't like create water anymore it it
drops<00:00:40.110> an<00:00:40.350> actual<00:00:40.680> ice<00:00:40.860> block<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.430> really

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
drops an actual ice block so really

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.479 
drops an actual ice block so really
helpful<00:00:42.270> also<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:43.050> adds<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.800> new<00:00:43.950> texture<00:00:44.250> for

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
helpful also it adds a new texture for

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.220 
helpful also it adds a new texture for
ice<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.120> see<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:45.450> you're<00:00:46.020> wondering

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you can see and as you might notice that

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.330 
you can see and as you might notice that
the<00:01:15.720> levels<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.290> snow<00:01:16.590> are<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> little<00:01:17.100> bit

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the levels of snow are a little bit

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.370 
the levels of snow are a little bit
different<00:01:17.759> from<00:01:18.060> different<00:01:18.750> from<00:01:19.020> each<00:01:19.259> other

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
different from different from each other

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.260 
different from different from each other
I<00:01:19.710> tried<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:20.490> close<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.060> could

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
I tried to get as close and as I could

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.990 
I tried to get as close and as I could
the<00:01:21.450> best<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.810> could<00:01:22.159> but<00:01:23.159> yeah<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.700> see

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the best I could but yeah as you can see

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.850 
the best I could but yeah as you can see
the<00:01:24.119> levels<00:01:24.450> are<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.780> bit<00:01:24.960> different<00:01:25.380> is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the levels are a little bit different is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.280 
the levels are a little bit different is
I<00:01:26.250> think<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.270> there's<00:01:27.450> three<00:01:27.780> levels<00:01:28.080> as<00:01:28.200> you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
I think that there's three levels as you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.749 
I think that there's three levels as you
can<00:01:28.409> see<00:01:28.560> snow<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:29.040> went<00:01:29.400> up<00:01:29.490> right<00:01:29.700> there

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
can see snow just went up right there

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.550 
can see snow just went up right there
and<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.360> think<00:01:30.540> there's<00:01:30.840> three<00:01:31.140> levels<00:01:31.470> of

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
and I think there's three levels of

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.560 
and I think there's three levels of
lower<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.820> see<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.540> can

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
lower and like as you can see you can

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.270 
lower and like as you can see you can
test<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.990> out<00:01:34.049> yourselves<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.950> might<00:01:35.250> be

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
test it out yourselves and I might be

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.980 
test it out yourselves and I might be
wrong<00:01:35.579> way<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:35.909> there's<00:01:36.060> four<00:01:36.270> maybe<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> don't

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
wrong way but there's four maybe I don't

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.990 
wrong way but there's four maybe I don't
know<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.259> could<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.619> wrong<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.670> lot<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.850> you

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
know I could be wrong but a lot of you

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.429 
know I could be wrong but a lot of you
guys<00:01:39.030> would<00:01:39.240> probably<00:01:39.540> think<00:01:39.659> all<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.049> might

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
guys would probably think all this might

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.889 
guys would probably think all this might
leg<00:01:40.680> your<00:01:40.829> game<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.310> lot<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.880> didn't<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.720> any

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
leg your game up a lot I didn't have any
