00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.959
 friends welcome to a new video of 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.940
 hunting fishing and diving dotcom in this 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.980
 occasion we are going to fish but the a 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.800
 and for this we have the invaluable 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.110
 help from a great expert in this subject 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.790
 that is javier prades I leave you with the one 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.790
 will start to mount the cane thank you 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.700
 for having Ivan pants and we have 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.060
 interest let's try to catch catfish 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.060
 throw 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.580
 then we will need a cane two 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.630
 sections of an action 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.950
 150 200 grams 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.950
 we will start to assemble it 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.000
 of reel you use javi on this occasion 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.910
 we make it a powerful reel with a 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.250
 thread of about 40 and how I see and 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.489
 if it is plaited or not and if there is no place 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.150
 braided a better because it resists more with 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.560
 less diameter 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.560
 then we will pass the rings 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.429
 now we will assemble a sledgehammer that 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.189
 will serve to change vinyl we will 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.399
 a hard knot of the spoon that 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.399
 call 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.090
 we will look for it to run more 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.140
 and in the remainder we cut it 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.990
 we will choose the vinyl that we like the most 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.530
 for example this one then we will try 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.600
 with others and how the sheet bears this 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.790
 unmissable then it will serve us to change 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.790
 whenever we want 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.569
 and with this is finished by fishing 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.700
 of 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.700
 I would listen or be vinyl 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.220
 we will do everything for what 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.440
 today we are in the queue of 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.720
 marsh of the divan that as seen in 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.569
 these images has become a 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.939
 River 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.159
 we have discovered that here they come to 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:42.189
 spawn the catfish as we will see 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.189
 continuation 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.390
 our fishing friends javier and raÃºl 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.670
 they set out to inspect the river that 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.859
 Now what you are going to do is look in 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.310
 the banks that is where the catfish is 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.310
 desolate 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.739
 our friend macana just chopped him 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.689
 to see if you're lucky and you can do 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.170
 with this insurance that seems great 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.170
 size 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.380
 and now what are you doing? 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.380
 he gets tired 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.400
 well we've had the first bite 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.280
 there has been no luck because it has broken us 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.280
 but we'll keep trying 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.970
 as we see our friend Javier 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.420
 tireless does not stop looking at 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.420
 shores 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.430
 today we have not been able to catch any catfish 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:51.580
 but if I can offer you these images 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:55.410
 where you see how the insurance is 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.410
 near the shore to spawn 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.930
 what we are seeing below are 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.440
 the roe of the cigars deposited in 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.440
 the earth 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.340
 the future you deposit thousands of eggs 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.060
 round shape the father of the gas to the 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.060
 Pearls necklases
