00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
see how it performs in different

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.289 
see how it performs in different
lighting<00:01:06.990> conditions<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:08.640> let<00:01:08.820> me<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.090> stand

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
to move the camera so closer to a few

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.899 
to move the camera so closer to a few
things<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.200> get<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.650> see<00:01:25.950> how<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
things just so you get to see how it

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.880 
things just so you get to see how it
performs<00:01:27.299> when<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:27.750> closed<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.290> now<00:01:28.500> I'm

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
performs when it's closed up now I'm

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.490 
performs when it's closed up now I'm
going<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.130> collapse<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.700> little<00:01:30.119> worm

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
going to collapse this little worm

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.289 
going to collapse this little worm
tripod<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.890> excuse<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.369> jokes<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:32.970> some<00:01:33.119> get

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
tripod so excuse the jokes just some get

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.780 
tripod so excuse the jokes just some get
things<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.600> little<00:01:33.750> bit<00:01:33.990> closer<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.740> let's<00:01:35.610> see

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
things a little bit closer so let's see

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
things a little bit closer so let's see
how<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.180> works

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
how this works

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.770 
how this works
in<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.229> sort<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.500> more<00:01:37.560> dimly<00:01:38.280> lit<00:01:38.579> situation<00:01:39.570> so

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
in a sort of more dimly lit situation so

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.780 
in a sort of more dimly lit situation so
this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.049> quite<00:01:40.290> close<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.070> little<00:01:41.460> Lego

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
this is quite close to the little Lego

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.990 
this is quite close to the little Lego
minifigs<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.130> at<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.220> moment<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:44.880> not

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
minifigs and at the moment it's not

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.969 
minifigs and at the moment it's not
focusing<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.899> them<00:01:46.020> let's<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> tap<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.829> focus

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
focusing on them let's do a tap to focus

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.690 
focusing on them let's do a tap to focus
and<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.240> force<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.899> focus<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.560> these<00:01:49.770> so

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
and we can force it to focus on these so

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.160 
and we can force it to focus on these so
it<00:01:50.790> didn't<00:01:51.060> pick<00:01:51.180> up<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.570> got<00:01:51.750> nice<00:01:51.990> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
it didn't pick up that we got nice and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.670 
it didn't pick up that we got nice and
close<00:01:52.380> let's<00:01:52.710> move<00:01:53.009> further<00:01:53.460> away<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:55.350> again

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
close let's move further away and again

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.920 
close let's move further away and again
is<00:01:56.430> you're<00:01:56.610> going<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.790> auto<00:01:57.000> focus<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.780> these

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
is you're going to auto focus on these

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.230 
is you're going to auto focus on these
it's<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.860> we're<00:01:59.009> forced<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.549> focus<00:02:00.030> just

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
it's not so we're forced to focus just

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.230 
it's not so we're forced to focus just
by<00:02:01.110> tapping<00:02:01.409> again<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.189> screen<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.909> then

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
by tapping again on the screen and then

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.819 
by tapping again on the screen and then
let's<00:02:03.390> have<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.570> look<00:02:03.780> up<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.409> top<00:02:04.590> shelf

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
let's have a look up on the top shelf

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.249 
let's have a look up on the top shelf
here<00:02:05.130> these<00:02:05.280> are<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.520> demos<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.240> use<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.750> quite

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
here these are the demos I use in quite

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.529 
here these are the demos I use in quite
a<00:02:07.290> lot<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.500> my<00:02:07.649> videos<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.280> again<00:02:08.910> we<00:02:09.119> perform

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
a lot of my videos and again we perform

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.540 
a lot of my videos and again we perform
a<00:02:09.660> tap<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.050> focus<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:10.709> focus<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.400> one

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
a tap to focus so we focus on the one

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.720 
a tap to focus so we focus on the one
nearest<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.180> us

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
nearest to us

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.119 
nearest to us
and<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:14.110> should<00:02:14.440> push<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.830> one<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
and that should push the one in the

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.770 
and that should push the one in the
background<00:02:15.310> our<00:02:15.730> focus<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.300> then<00:02:16.390> we<00:02:16.510> attack

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
background our focus and then we attack

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.270 
background our focus and then we attack
to<00:02:16.959> focus<00:02:17.349> on<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.739> one<00:02:17.860> in<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.099> background

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
to focus on the one in the background

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.360 
to focus on the one in the background
and<00:02:18.840> again<00:02:19.840> this<00:02:20.230> forces<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:20.920> iPhone<00:02:21.340> to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
and again this forces the iPhone to

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.390 
and again this forces the iPhone to
refocus<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.599> very<00:02:23.230> slightly<00:02:23.709> throw<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.159> one

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
refocus and very slightly throw the one

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.970 
refocus and very slightly throw the one
nearest<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.299> us<00:02:25.330> out<00:02:25.690> of<00:02:25.930> focus<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:27.400> let's<00:02:27.970> move

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
nearest to us out of focus so let's move

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.820 
nearest to us out of focus so let's move
back<00:02:29.980> little<00:02:30.790> bit<00:02:30.940> further<00:02:31.209> in<00:02:31.480> my<00:02:31.530> studio<00:02:32.530> and

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
back little bit further in my studio and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.509 
back little bit further in my studio and
I'm<00:02:33.370> going<00:02:33.519> to<00:02:33.610> actually<00:02:33.910> turn<00:02:34.750> this<00:02:35.519> studio

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
I'm going to actually turn this studio

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.020 
I'm going to actually turn this studio
light<00:02:36.849> off<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:37.410> we've<00:02:38.410> got<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.650> lot<00:02:39.099> sort<00:02:39.910> of

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
light off so we've got a lot sort of

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.990 
light off so we've got a lot sort of
lower<00:02:40.450> light<00:02:40.840> situation<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.709> here<00:02:41.950> now<00:02:42.190> so<00:02:42.819> now

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
lower light situation in here now so now

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.080 
lower light situation in here now so now
we're<00:02:43.180> really<00:02:43.480> only<00:02:44.140> working<00:02:44.829> with<00:02:45.129> an

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
we're really only working with an

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.630 
we're really only working with an
overhead<00:02:46.959> light<00:02:47.019> very<00:02:47.560> dim<00:02:47.860> light<00:02:48.099> actually

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
overhead light very dim light actually

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.660 
overhead light very dim light actually
so<00:02:49.269> we<00:02:49.420> can<00:02:49.540> get<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.870> see<00:02:50.140> how<00:02:51.129> this<00:02:51.310> actually

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
so we can get to see how this actually

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.690 
so we can get to see how this actually
performs<00:02:52.150> in<00:02:52.299> a<00:02:52.480> lot<00:02:52.750> lower<00:02:53.079> light<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:54.430> we're

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
performs in a lot lower light and we're

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.160 
performs in a lot lower light and we're
going<00:02:54.819> to<00:02:54.849> go<00:02:55.030> in<00:02:55.269> close<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.810> some<00:02:55.989> of<00:02:56.019> these

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
going to go in close to some of these

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.589 
going to go in close to some of these
bits<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.620> pieces<00:02:56.799> just<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:57.879> see<00:02:58.150> how<00:02:58.420> this

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
bits and pieces just to see how this

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.750 
bits and pieces just to see how this
works<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.400> again<00:03:00.400> we<00:03:01.060> will<00:03:01.269> tap<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.750> focus<00:03:02.170> and

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
works so again we will tap to focus and

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.030 
works so again we will tap to focus and
focus<00:03:03.760> in<00:03:03.910> on<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.299> memory<00:03:04.599> card<00:03:04.629> there<00:03:05.109> and<00:03:05.319> we

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
focus in on the memory card there and we

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.160 
focus in on the memory card there and we
also<00:03:06.250> got<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.790> nother<00:03:07.420> button<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:07.900> we<00:03:07.989> can

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
also got a nother button that we can

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.670 
also got a nother button that we can
push<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.470> take<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.069> photo<00:03:09.720> whilst<00:03:10.720> we're<00:03:11.260> video

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
push to take a photo whilst we're video

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.800 
push to take a photo whilst we're video
recording<00:03:12.340> so<00:03:12.970> we<00:03:13.180> get<00:03:13.359> to<00:03:13.480> see<00:03:13.660> if<00:03:13.750> that

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
recording so we get to see if that

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.599 
recording so we get to see if that
actually<00:03:13.870> disturbs<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.890> video<00:03:15.160> recording

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
actually disturbs the video recording

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.449 
actually disturbs the video recording
I've<00:03:15.670> taken<00:03:15.910> three<00:03:16.269> photos<00:03:16.900> there<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.459> that's

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
I've taken three photos there and that's

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.089 
I've taken three photos there and that's
during<00:03:19.090> video<00:03:19.510> capture<00:03:20.290> as<00:03:20.560> far<00:03:20.799> as<00:03:20.919> I<00:03:21.040> know

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
during video capture as far as I know

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.680 
during video capture as far as I know
that's<00:03:21.579> what<00:03:21.760> it's<00:03:21.910> just<00:03:22.090> done<00:03:22.239> I<00:03:22.269> didn't<00:03:22.599> even

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
that's what it's just done I didn't even

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.960 
that's what it's just done I didn't even
know<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:22.840> feature<00:03:23.230> existed<00:03:23.829> so<00:03:24.609> we<00:03:24.669> go<00:03:24.790> back

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
know that feature existed so we go back

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.449 
know that feature existed so we go back
over<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.239> this<00:03:25.419> area<00:03:25.480> here<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.290> again<00:03:27.069> this<00:03:27.280> is

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
over to this area here and again this is

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.580 
over to this area here and again this is
primarily<00:03:28.120> natural<00:03:28.359> lighting<00:03:28.810> coming<00:03:29.230> in<00:03:29.380> now

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
primarily natural lighting coming in now

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.890 
primarily natural lighting coming in now
so<00:03:29.889> not<00:03:30.489> brilliant<00:03:30.760> lighting<00:03:31.359> and<00:03:31.569> then<00:03:31.780> the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
so not brilliant lighting and then the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.110 
so not brilliant lighting and then the
darkest<00:03:32.440> shelf<00:03:32.739> which<00:03:33.430> is<00:03:33.579> this<00:03:33.700> one<00:03:33.940> down

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
darkest shelf which is this one down

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.170 
darkest shelf which is this one down
here<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:35.079> you're<00:03:35.290> just<00:03:35.500> really<00:03:35.829> quickly<00:03:36.310> to

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
here and you're just really quickly to

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.000 
here and you're just really quickly to
those<00:03:37.329> different<00:03:37.810> lighting<00:03:38.019> conditions<00:03:38.230> and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
those different lighting conditions and

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.250 
those different lighting conditions and
back<00:03:39.970> up<00:03:40.150> again<00:03:40.269> so<00:03:40.480> something<00:03:40.900> with<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.079> bit

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
back up again so something with a bit

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.680 
back up again so something with a bit
more<00:03:41.290> lighting<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.549> again<00:03:43.389> we're<00:03:43.540> going

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
more lighting and again we're going

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.870 
more lighting and again we're going

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
then see how close this would actually

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.199 
then see how close this would actually
focus<00:03:49.209> to<00:03:49.540> this<00:03:50.079> little<00:03:50.440> Lego<00:03:50.769> minifig<00:03:51.310> very

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
very close focus that's probably round

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.509 
very close focus that's probably round
about<00:03:55.209> two<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.690> three<00:03:55.930> inches<00:03:56.200> away<00:03:56.349> so<00:03:57.129> very

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
about two to three inches away so very

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.369 
about two to three inches away so very
very<00:03:57.730> good<00:03:57.940> indeed<00:03:58.299> and<00:03:58.480> as<00:03:58.569> we<00:03:58.690> pull<00:03:58.959> out<00:03:59.139> just

a little bit surprised that as we come

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.819 
a little bit surprised that as we come
back<00:04:02.799> it's<00:04:03.280> not<00:04:04.019> autofocusing<00:04:05.019> we<00:04:05.560> don't<00:04:05.739> have
