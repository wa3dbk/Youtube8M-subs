00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
born by the time he's my age most likely

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.900 
born by the time he's my age most likely
if<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.880> trends<00:01:41.180> continue<00:01:41.300> even<00:01:41.870> as<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.410> most

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
if the trends continue even as the most

conservative projections of United
Nations<00:01:45.760> project<00:01:46.760> we<00:01:47.240> would<00:01:47.420> be<00:01:47.570> using<00:01:47.600> twice

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
Nations project we would be using twice

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.380 
Nations project we would be using twice
the<00:01:48.800> plans<00:01:49.040> capacity<00:01:49.640> that's<00:01:49.940> physically

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
the plans capacity that's physically

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.180 
the plans capacity that's physically
possible<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:51.080> that's<00:01:51.290> our<00:01:51.410> collective<00:01:51.890> dream

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
possible and that's our collective dream

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.980 
possible and that's our collective dream
so<00:01:52.730> we<00:01:52.850> always<00:01:53.060> talk<00:01:53.270> about<00:01:53.300> always<00:01:53.660> about

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
so we always talk about always about

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.810 
so we always talk about always about
future<00:01:54.350> generations<00:01:54.980> it's<00:01:55.280> no<00:01:55.430> longer<00:01:55.610> about

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
future generations it's no longer about

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.840 
future generations it's no longer about
future<00:01:56.120> generations

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
future generations

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.480 
future generations
but<00:01:57.000> even<00:01:57.420> my<00:01:57.869> life<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.560> my<00:01:58.740> son's<00:01:59.009> life<00:01:59.250> so

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
but even my life it's my son's life so

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.999 
but even my life it's my son's life so
it<00:01:59.580> becomes<00:01:59.880> very<00:02:00.439> specific<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.590> then<00:02:01.860> done

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
it becomes very specific and then done

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.830 
it becomes very specific and then done
very<00:02:02.220> fast<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.850> think<00:02:03.060> that's<00:02:03.240> what<00:02:03.689> we're

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
very fast and I think that's what we're

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.020 
very fast and I think that's what we're
trying<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.740> bring<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.280> people's<00:02:05.610> attention

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
trying to bring to people's attention

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.419 
trying to bring to people's attention
and<00:02:06.150> we<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.509> use<00:02:06.840> business<00:02:07.320> tools<00:02:07.590> we<00:02:08.399> have

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
and we can use business tools we have

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.300 
and we can use business tools we have
dealt<00:02:09.000> with<00:02:09.149> much<00:02:09.450> longer<00:02:10.259> term<00:02:10.530> problems

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
dealt with much longer term problems

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.059 
dealt with much longer term problems
before<00:02:11.580> but<00:02:12.540> somehow<00:02:12.780> we<00:02:12.930> think<00:02:13.319> or<00:02:13.530> resource

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
before but somehow we think or resource

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.760 
before but somehow we think or resource
about<00:02:14.400> long-term<00:02:14.670> future<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:16.110> we<00:02:16.440> can

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
about long-term future but we can

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.979 
about long-term future but we can
succeed<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.640> it's<00:02:17.760> not<00:02:17.790> about<00:02:17.970> looking<00:02:18.840> at

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
succeed so it's not about looking at

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.630 
succeed so it's not about looking at
doing<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.650> errors<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.430> rather

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
doing this and errors it's rather

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.729 
doing this and errors it's rather

about<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.160> but<00:02:23.730> actually<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.390> takes<00:02:24.630> such

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
about it but actually it takes such

about it but actually it takes such
simple<00:02:25.350> steps<00:02:26.250> like<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.640> say<00:02:26.819> how<00:02:27.090> many
