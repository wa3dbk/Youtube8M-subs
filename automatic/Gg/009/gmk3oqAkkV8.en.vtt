00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.760
 and there, guys, okay, not max again 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.000
 here with you today I'm going to talk about a 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.950
 subject that may have already entered several 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.689
 times in the life of a lot of music 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.070
 mainly the military 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:31.009
 What's the motivation? 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.969
 what here I do not even know the motivation 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:37.540
 It's what inspires you to change, right? 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.430
 if you can stay motivated 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.850
 inspired to leave aside the part of the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.910
 lack of motivation is not you getting mean 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.640
 do you think the program will give you time 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.340
 problem that you are not being good 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.650
 developing if you really 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.410
 keep you inspired and focused 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.989
 You will succeed, will you continue? 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.890
 learning evolution is coming to 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.229
 few this seems obvious right now but sometimes 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.240
 this part is misunderstood 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.649
 let's take a look at this as it would look 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.659
 that's badly explained 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.399
 a long time ago from my colleague 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.409
 arrived and said so on the internet 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.930
 Dude, I love the way you touch me. 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.150
 I think it's really cool I really wanted to have 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.720
 this discipline you have to sit down and 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.909
 study but I can not 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.710
 So I ended up talking to him, right? 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.020
 talking a few things giving some 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.240
 touches but then I stopped and went to think 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.030
 the guy has nothing to do with discipline 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.940
 and if the question of motivation I do not 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.549
 was forcing me to sit and play type 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.590
 You have to touch her all the time in the face that is 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.170
 the will that you have for your motivation 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.810
 of you to sit your inspiration 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.560
 You sit there, will you practice or will you? 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.140
 is going to play this is something the guy 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.060
 comes from within you is not the fact of 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.520
 You arrive at you and now I have 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.580
 to sit have to be listening to this 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.670
 Is not this bina for me a motivation? 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.830
 and that's what I explained to the great 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.530
 question for this is you find the 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.810
 next what inspires you 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.390
 There are people who do not even think about 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.490
 So obvious I take in case is the music 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.880
 But it is so obvious that the person 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.580
 think but if you really have 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.030
 that afternoon scheme motivated notice 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.010
 Shandong little wise afternoon side let's 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.220
 to think more or less let's reason 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.420
 in the following way what really 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.080
 inspire there 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.730
 in fact for everyone in charge 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.760
 Overall is the song 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.910
 but we feel more motivated and 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.530
 inspired when we start to see 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.450
 that our accountability is being 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.040
 better that it 's a way to play more 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.500
 needs faster when we see the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.650
 improvement is we have an improvement or to 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.769
 A lot of people are motivated to play 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.860
 band is going up on stage 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:08.540
 So what do you have to do? 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:11.600
 you can find senta do 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.440
 ask yourself what else you 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.630
 put on the touching part when you are 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.390
 playing avoid what you like the most 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.880
 Do you want to play faster, do you want to? 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.890
 do you want to compare Russia? 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.500
 other guitarist what you want to do 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.750
 this question for yourself makes a 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.799
 Interiorization asks the question for you 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:37.040
 yourself and your results and see which will be 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:41.150
 the answer to think of the response of this 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.400
 question and shallon will make you see the 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.760
 there right choice about what you want 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.700
 and stay focused on what you 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:54.410
 You really need to study if you 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.060
 keep focused you will arrive at 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.569
 ideal you present 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:04.220
 sure as now that you should 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.989
 practice what you should practice and 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.959
 practice still has a music school 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.520
 doing private lessons playing a 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.239
 band 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:17.419
 are different actions and each action will have 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:20.480
 a different consequence you want 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.280
 there after you saw the response 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.639
 question you asked yourself 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.000
 you have to reveal what it feels like 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.910
 What should you take to have more to do? 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.669
 with the choice you made 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.310
 after you've found the answer to your 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:40.790
 question is you need to keep 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.530
 focused on this because because day to day 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.590
 You will have other tasks to do. 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.020
 Do you have a working shield in that? 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.630
 you have to accomplish and other things 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.240
 that leave this part aside 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.610
 so what you have to do is keep 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.490
 focus and do not let other things 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.380
 will be more important the so important 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.020
 with the desire that you have to 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.110
 you realize sometimes the lack of 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.350
 motivation joke motivation can be 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.210
 given the following when we see that 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.280
 the ideal that we are here we will arrive 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.390
 It's far from where we are at 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.380
 time 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:22.940
 maybe this time it's time for you 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:26.270
 reassessing your goal is to evaluate your 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.750
 way of studying and the attention you need 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.380
 be changed to the focus you have always is 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.030
 good you re-evaluate your goal 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.960
 have some time not that you have a 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:41.230
 place but change the way you arrive and 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.150
 try to keep yourself motivated and 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.330
 enthusiastic look to see your 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.370
 little progress on the right day 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.610
 only small improvements are the 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:54.220
 little steps you go up 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:58.030
 grandson in search of his goal to come back 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.010
 to build this arrival then the 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.090
 three for marriage 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.569
 This look to son in soccer today 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.929
 second 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:12.309
 make the right choices the third 

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:17.069
