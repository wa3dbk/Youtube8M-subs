00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
probably should use a little soap on it

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.689 
probably should use a little soap on it
but<00:04:30.930> this<00:04:31.530> doesn't<00:04:31.889> happen<00:04:31.979> usually<00:04:32.310> when<00:04:32.610> you

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
but this doesn't happen usually when you

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.360 
but this doesn't happen usually when you
go<00:04:32.880> to<00:04:32.940> wipe<00:04:33.330> air<00:04:33.570> down<00:04:33.750> off<00:04:33.840> your<00:04:33.870> face<00:04:34.370> it

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
go to wipe air down off your face it

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.129 
go to wipe air down off your face it
smears<00:04:35.669> all<00:04:35.850> over<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.120> place<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.600> it<00:04:36.990> just

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
smears all over the place and it just

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.450 
smears all over the place and it just
blends<00:04:37.500> into<00:04:37.650> your<00:04:37.710> skin<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.130> then<00:04:38.250> you<00:04:38.310> have

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
blends into your skin and then you have

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.159 
blends into your skin and then you have
it<00:04:38.550> on<00:04:38.639> your<00:04:38.759> face<00:04:38.970> or<00:04:39.270> whatever<00:04:39.479> for<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.870> week

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
it on your face or whatever for a week

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.219 
it on your face or whatever for a week
or<00:04:40.349> so<00:04:40.530> so<00:04:41.130> I'm<00:04:41.430> really<00:04:41.880> really<00:04:42.479> excited<00:04:42.720> about

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
or so so I'm really really excited about

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:43.749 
or so so I'm really really excited about
that

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
that

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.580 
that
so<00:04:44.759> maybe<00:04:45.120> there's<00:04:45.419> less<00:04:45.630> staining<00:04:46.229> with<00:04:46.410> this

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
so maybe there's less staining with this

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.800 
so maybe there's less staining with this
dye<00:04:46.800> but<00:04:47.490> we'll<00:04:47.669> see<00:04:47.970> I'm<00:04:48.300> gonna<00:04:48.539> leave<00:04:48.690> this

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
dye but we'll see I'm gonna leave this

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.070 
dye but we'll see I'm gonna leave this
on<00:04:49.020> for<00:04:49.050> about<00:04:50.449> I'll<00:04:51.449> go<00:04:51.599> with<00:04:51.750> three<00:04:51.960> hours

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
on for about I'll go with three hours

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.460 
on for about I'll go with three hours
this<00:04:52.410> time<00:04:53.270> just<00:04:54.270> because<00:04:54.599> that's<00:04:55.020> probably<00:04:55.320> -

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
this time just because that's probably -

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.409 
this time just because that's probably -
hi<00:04:55.710> my<00:04:55.889> son<00:04:56.099> might<00:04:56.280> take<00:04:56.430> his<00:04:56.550> nap<00:04:56.759> maybe<00:04:57.000> if

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
hi my son might take his nap maybe if

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.420 
hi my son might take his nap maybe if
I'm<00:04:57.599> lucky<00:04:57.630> I'll<00:04:58.110> get<00:04:58.229> three<00:04:58.470> hours<00:04:58.740> but<00:04:59.340> if

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
I'm lucky I'll get three hours but if

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.969 
I'm lucky I'll get three hours but if
not<00:04:59.580> I<00:04:59.910> might<00:05:00.539> go<00:05:00.690> longer<00:05:00.870> if<00:05:01.650> I<00:05:01.770> don't<00:05:01.889> have

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
not I might go longer if I don't have

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.499 
not I might go longer if I don't have
the<00:05:02.070> time<00:05:02.250> to<00:05:02.280> rinse<00:05:02.460> it<00:05:02.550> out<00:05:02.669> which<00:05:03.210> going

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
the time to rinse it out which going

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:04.790 
the time to rinse it out which going
longer<00:05:03.690> isn't<00:05:04.050> bad<00:05:04.169> especially<00:05:04.320> what's<00:05:04.680> this

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
longer isn't bad especially what's this

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.839 
longer isn't bad especially what's this
stuff<00:05:05.009> having<00:05:05.310> conditioner<00:05:05.729> in<00:05:05.820> it<00:05:06.590> so<00:05:07.849> that's

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
stuff having conditioner in it so that's

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.890 
stuff having conditioner in it so that's
my<00:05:09.320> application<00:05:10.400> impression<00:05:11.400> and<00:05:11.639> I<00:05:12.599> actually

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.370 
does not look violets to me it looks
fuchsia<00:05:16.949> but<00:05:17.699> I'm<00:05:18.180> not<00:05:18.449> mad<00:05:18.630> at<00:05:18.659> anything<00:05:18.990> here

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380
