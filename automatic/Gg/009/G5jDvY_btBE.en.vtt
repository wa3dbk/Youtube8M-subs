that there's a cost attached to
everything<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.070> even<00:00:23.310> if<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.490> think<00:00:23.730> you're

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
everything and even if you think you're

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
along the way somewhere along the line

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.700 
along the way somewhere along the line
when<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.239> get<00:00:36.420> something<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.409> didn't

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
when you get something that you didn't

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.310 
when you get something that you didn't
pay<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:37.890> somebody<00:00:38.850> else<00:00:39.180> did<00:00:39.479> so<00:00:39.960> while<00:00:40.140> you

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
create things from the ether right weird

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.380 
create things from the ether right weird
mere<00:00:46.620> human<00:00:46.979> beings<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.580> not<00:00:47.940> only<00:00:48.059> that

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
mere human beings and not only that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.410 
mere human beings and not only that
resources<00:00:49.290> that<00:00:49.650> we<00:00:49.739> value<00:00:49.949> are<00:00:50.460> scarce<00:00:51.089> you

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
put these two things together you come

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.609 
put these two things together you come
up<00:00:53.790> with<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.970> concept<00:00:54.479> of<00:00:54.629> there's<00:00:55.049> no<00:00:55.290> free

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:55.619

there's no such thing as a free lunch
and<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.970> whole<00:01:21.120> concept<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.690> free<00:01:21.870> lunch<00:01:22.080> that

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290

and the whole concept of free lunch that
we<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.590> described<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.310> really<00:01:24.240> easily

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
we just described is really easily

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.990 
we just described is really easily
applied<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.200> economics<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:26.100> mean<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.670> part<00:01:26.880> of

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
applied to economics I mean it's part of

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.520 
applied to economics I mean it's part of
economic<00:01:27.480> theory<00:01:27.690> there's<00:01:27.960> scarcity

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
economic theory there's scarcity

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.800 
economic theory there's scarcity
economists<00:01:29.490> love<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.910> talk<00:01:30.090> about<00:01:30.240> scarcity

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
economists love to talk about scarcity

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.110

oh<00:01:31.020> yeah<00:01:31.200> there's<00:01:31.470> costs<00:01:32.370> there's<00:01:32.610> direct

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
oh yeah there's costs there's direct

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.450 
oh yeah there's costs there's direct
cost<00:01:33.450> there's<00:01:33.860> opportunity<00:01:34.860> costs<00:01:35.280> there's

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
cost there's opportunity costs there's

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.790 
cost there's opportunity costs there's
all<00:01:35.790> these<00:01:36.060> different<00:01:36.450> kind<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.930> economic

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
all these different kind of economic

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.220 
all these different kind of economic
theories<00:01:38.580> just<00:01:38.610> wrapped<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.510> this<00:01:39.600> idea<00:01:40.050> of

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
theories just wrapped up in this idea of

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.660 
theories just wrapped up in this idea of
there's<00:01:40.740> no<00:01:40.890> such<00:01:41.070> thing<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.430> free<00:01:41.640> lunch

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
acronym which I don't even know if I can

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.520 
acronym which I don't even know if I can
spit<00:03:00.530> this<00:03:00.650> thing<00:03:00.859> out<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.189> let's<00:03:01.370> see<00:03:01.519> t<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.720> and

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
we rebuild it we should be funneling

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.210 
we rebuild it we should be funneling
money<00:03:26.329> to<00:03:26.510> it<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:27.260> would<00:03:27.470> say<00:03:27.650> yeah<00:03:27.859> that's<00:03:28.069> a

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.759 
money to it it would say yeah that's a
good<00:03:28.340> idea<00:03:28.489> but<00:03:29.060> who's<00:03:29.750> gonna<00:03:29.930> pay<00:03:30.199> for<00:03:30.230> it

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
good idea but who's gonna pay for it
