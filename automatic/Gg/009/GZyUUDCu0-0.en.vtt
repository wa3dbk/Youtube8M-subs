00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:35.159 
bit I'm not sure you know we'd like to

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.419 
bit I'm not sure you know we'd like to
have<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.609> little<00:00:36.230> longevity<00:00:37.230> on<00:00:37.829> one<00:00:38.249> of<00:00:38.339> these

00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:38.429 
have a little longevity on one of these

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:40.099 
have a little longevity on one of these
but<00:00:38.789> it's<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.269> kind<00:00:39.449> of<00:00:39.510> how<00:00:39.600> it's<00:00:39.749> gone<00:00:39.929> out

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:40.109 
but it's just kind of how it's gone out

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:42.319 
but it's just kind of how it's gone out
there<00:00:40.289> and<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:40.620> part<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.859> the<00:00:40.949> game<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.370> so

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
there and it's part of the game and so

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.549 
there and it's part of the game and so
kids<00:00:42.569> are<00:00:42.690> resilient<00:00:42.809> they<00:00:43.350> always<00:00:43.530> just

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
question marks but felt a lot more

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.380 
question marks but felt a lot more
comfortable<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.789> it<00:01:20.939> where<00:01:21.180> we're<00:01:21.359> at

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
comfortable with it where we're at

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.480 
comfortable with it where we're at
position<00:01:22.049> wise<00:01:22.170> depth<00:01:22.649> chart<00:01:22.890> wise<00:01:23.100> this

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
position wise depth chart wise this

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.980 
position wise depth chart wise this
spring<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:23.969> did<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> previous<00:01:24.390> spring<00:01:24.689> so

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
spring and I did the previous spring so

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.569 
spring and I did the previous spring so
feels<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.770> we're<00:01:25.890> making<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.159> right

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
feels like we're making the right right

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.300 
feels like we're making the right right
steps<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.180> see<00:01:28.170> there's<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> lot<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.560> emphasis<00:01:29.039> in

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
steps I see there's a lot of emphasis in

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.520 
steps I see there's a lot of emphasis in
the<00:01:29.399> spring<00:01:29.759> about<00:01:30.320> turnovers<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.439> penalties

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the spring about turnovers and penalties

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.349 
the spring about turnovers and penalties
how<00:01:32.100> did<00:01:32.250> things<00:01:32.399> go<00:01:32.579> as<00:01:32.700> far<00:01:32.850> as<00:01:32.939> s<00:01:33.060> concern

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
how did things go as far as s concern

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.200 
how did things go as far as s concern
that's<00:01:33.960> good<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.350> continue<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.219> try<00:01:36.030> new

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
that's good we continue to try new

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.599 
that's good we continue to try new
methods<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.929> eradicate<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> turnovers<00:01:38.399> and

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
methods to eradicate the turnovers and

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:39.170 
methods to eradicate the turnovers and
penalties

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
penalties

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.120 
penalties
so<00:01:39.480> we'll<00:01:39.630> see<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:39.870> it<00:01:39.990> works<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.440> that's<00:01:40.950> been

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
so we'll see if it works but that's been

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.470 
so we'll see if it works but that's been
a<00:01:41.160> heavy<00:01:41.340> emphasis<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.940> think<00:01:42.150> our<00:01:42.240> team<00:01:42.420> is

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
a heavy emphasis I think our team is

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.910 
a heavy emphasis I think our team is
finally<00:01:42.750> growing<00:01:43.050> up<00:01:43.260> enough<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.560> where<00:01:43.710> they

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
finally growing up enough to where they

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.410 
finally growing up enough to where they
can<00:01:43.980> put<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.550> on<00:01:44.610> their<00:01:44.730> own<00:01:44.790> shoulders<00:01:45.240> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
can put it on their own shoulders and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.780 
can put it on their own shoulders and
handle<00:01:45.660> that<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:47.040> make<00:01:47.250> strides<00:01:47.550> there

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
handle that so we make strides there

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.790 
handle that so we make strides there
will<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.150> good<00:01:48.270> shape<00:01:48.380> Davis<00:01:49.380> Webb<00:01:49.590> had

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
will be in good shape Davis Webb had

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.590

looks<00:02:03.420> good<00:02:04.040> usually<00:02:05.040> when<00:02:05.190> you<00:02:05.280> got<00:02:05.430> to

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
looks good usually when you got to

controversy<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:07.710> that's<00:02:07.890> not<00:02:08.070> really<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
controversy but that's not really the

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.400 
controversy but that's not really the
case<00:02:08.880> right<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.479> just<00:02:09.630> got<00:02:09.810> two<00:02:09.990> talented

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
case right you just got two talented

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.170 
case right you just got two talented
quarterbacks<00:02:10.860> that's<00:02:11.250> how<00:02:11.400> we<00:02:11.430> feel<00:02:11.790> both

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
quarterbacks that's how we feel both

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.610 
quarterbacks that's how we feel both
guys<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.780> played<00:02:12.930> exceptionally<00:02:13.230> well

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
guys that have played exceptionally well

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.840 
guys that have played exceptionally well
at<00:02:13.709> times<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.100> both<00:02:14.220> guys<00:02:14.430> who<00:02:14.610> have<00:02:14.730> to

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
at times and both guys who have to

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.390 
at times and both guys who have to
improve<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.830> protecting<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.860> football<00:02:17.250> and

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
improve on protecting the football and

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.460 
improve on protecting the football and
so<00:02:17.580> we<00:02:17.790> felt<00:02:18.030> like<00:02:18.120> we<00:02:18.300> made<00:02:18.510> those<00:02:18.750> those

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
so we felt like we made those those

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.990 
so we felt like we made those those
strides<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:20.070> spring<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.520> we<00:02:20.610> feel<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:20.820> we

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
strides of spring and we feel like we

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.580 
strides of spring and we feel like we
can<00:02:21.090> win<00:02:21.239> with<00:02:21.300> either<00:02:21.570> guy<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.470> think

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
can win with either guy and so I think

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.810 
can win with either guy and so I think
it's<00:02:22.770> great<00:02:22.950> for<00:02:23.190> them<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.370> compete<00:02:23.670> all

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
it's great for them to compete all

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.640 
it's great for them to compete all
