in my opinion the original just can't be

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.340

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
it is is a story great not so much I

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.459 
it is is a story great not so much I
thought<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> story<00:00:36.870> could<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.140> been<00:00:37.260> better

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
thought the story could have been better

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.830 
thought the story could have been better
I<00:00:37.590> mean<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.100> 20<00:00:38.280> years<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.940> felt<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.780> know

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
I mean in 20 years I felt like you know

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.540 
I mean in 20 years I felt like you know
the<00:00:40.020> story<00:00:40.260> could<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.500> been<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> little<00:00:40.950> well

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the story could have been a little well

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.950 
the story could have been a little well
written<00:00:41.879> than<00:00:42.090> what<00:00:42.270> we<00:00:42.420> had<00:00:42.629> here<00:00:42.780> but

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
written than what we had here but

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.720 
written than what we had here but
nonetheless<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.559> still<00:00:43.590> great<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.460> see<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
nonetheless it's still great to see the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.060 
nonetheless it's still great to see the
boys<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.239> kind<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.719> felt<00:00:45.930> like<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:47.039> know

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
boys I kind of felt like the you know

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.340 
boys I kind of felt like the you know
Jim<00:00:47.399> Carrey's<00:00:47.700> uh<00:00:47.899> character<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.050> overacting

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
Jim Carrey's uh character was overacting

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.439 
Jim Carrey's uh character was overacting
a<00:00:49.680> little<00:00:49.920> bit<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.550> my<00:00:50.670> opinion<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.180> little<00:00:51.270> bit

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
a little bit in my opinion a little bit

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.850 
a little bit in my opinion a little bit
too<00:00:51.570> much<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.320> think<00:00:52.500> one<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> main

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
too much and I think one of the main

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.740 
too much and I think one of the main
reasons<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.340> because<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:54.210> know<00:00:54.329> he<00:00:54.449> hasn't

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
reasons is because you know he hasn't

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.630 
reasons is because you know he hasn't
done<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> sequel<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.620> 20<00:00:56.129> years<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.489> know<00:00:56.550> I

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
done the sequel in 20 years you know I

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.189 
done the sequel in 20 years you know I
mean<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.030> they<00:00:57.210> made<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> film<00:00:57.780> back<00:00:57.930> and

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
mean so if they made the film back and

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.040 
mean so if they made the film back and
let's<00:00:58.320> say<00:00:58.440> 96<00:00:58.920> 97<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.640> thought<00:01:00.300> at<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.840> time

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
let's say 96 97 I thought at that time

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.000 
let's say 96 97 I thought at that time
he<00:01:01.199> would<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.350> probably<00:01:01.559> fall<00:01:01.829> into

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
he would have probably fall into

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.590 
he would have probably fall into
character<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> little<00:01:02.730> more<00:01:02.879> at<00:01:03.059> ease<00:01:03.570> than

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
character a little more at ease than

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.479 
character a little more at ease than
what<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.379> here<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:04.680> nonetheless<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.339> I

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
what we have here but nonetheless like I

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.039 
what we have here but nonetheless like I
