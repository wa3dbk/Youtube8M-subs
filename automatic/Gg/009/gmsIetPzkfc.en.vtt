to<00:00:29.849> fry<00:00:30.210> B<00:00:30.410> it's<00:00:31.410> really<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> campaign<00:00:32.160> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
to fry B it's really a campaign of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.959 
to fry B it's really a campaign of
simple<00:00:33.060> traveling<00:00:34.050> stories<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:35.309> slightly

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
simple traveling stories for slightly

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:55.669 
simple traveling stories for slightly
unexpected<00:00:36.149> reasons<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:54.109> think<00:00:55.109> the<00:00:55.350> idea

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
unexpected reasons I think the idea

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.680 
unexpected reasons I think the idea
really<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.190> show<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:57.030> faster<00:00:57.420> than<00:00:57.510> rail

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
really is to show it's faster than rail

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.630 
really is to show it's faster than rail
faster<00:00:58.140> than<00:00:58.320> Road<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.890> they<00:00:59.250> wanted<00:00:59.460> to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
faster than Road and they wanted to

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.790 
faster than Road and they wanted to
somehow<00:00:59.850> capture<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.510> visually<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.410> it's

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
somehow capture that visually and it's

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.600 
somehow capture that visually and it's
just<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.370> smooth<00:01:03.230> effortless<00:01:04.230> no<00:01:04.890> journey<00:01:05.190> from

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
just a smooth effortless no journey from

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.150 
just a smooth effortless no journey from
one<00:01:06.090> place<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.570> next<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:07.500> always<00:01:07.770> had<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
one place to the next we always had the

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.310 
one place to the next we always had the
idea<00:01:08.190> but<00:01:08.940> when<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.240> brought<00:01:09.450> some<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:10.020> board

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
idea but when we brought some on board

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.750 
idea but when we brought some on board
he<00:01:10.560> said<00:01:10.800> that<00:01:10.980> it<00:01:11.070> should<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.370> a<00:01:11.400> lot<00:01:11.610> more

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
he said that it should be a lot more

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.390 
he said that it should be a lot more
choreographed<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.690> each<00:01:13.200> movements<00:01:14.040> builds

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
choreographed so each movements builds

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.390 
choreographed so each movements builds
into<00:01:14.520> one<00:01:14.760> another<00:01:15.350> but<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.410> want<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.770> that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
into one another but we want that that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.700 
into one another but we want that that
