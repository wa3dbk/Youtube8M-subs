1969 firebird project called rowdy we

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.759 
1969 firebird project called rowdy we
decided<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.340> attack<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.969> rear<00:00:12.360> axle<00:00:12.900> brakes

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
decided to attack the rear axle brakes

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.880 
decided to attack the rear axle brakes
and<00:00:14.160> wheels<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.969> tires<00:00:15.179> on<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.690> project<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
and wheels and tires on this project the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.109 
and wheels and tires on this project the
wheels<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.279> tires<00:00:17.550> were<00:00:17.850> kind<00:00:18.060> of

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
wheels and tires were kind of

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.540 
wheels and tires were kind of
predetermined<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:19.500> owner<00:00:19.680> had<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> set<00:00:20.430> of

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
predetermined the owner had a set of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.740 
predetermined the owner had a set of
Boyd's<00:00:21.320> junkyard<00:00:22.320> dog<00:00:23.119> 17-inch<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.330> 18-inch

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
Boyd's junkyard dog 17-inch and 18-inch

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.140 
Boyd's junkyard dog 17-inch and 18-inch
wheels<00:00:24.980> that<00:00:25.980> he<00:00:26.070> wanted<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.430> use<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.910> car

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
wheels that he wanted to use on this car

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.070 
wheels that he wanted to use on this car
so<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.710> had<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.980> measure<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.939> rear<00:00:30.359> axle<00:00:30.869> width

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
so we had to measure the rear axle width

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.770 
so we had to measure the rear axle width
with<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.769> wheels<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:33.090> kind<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.450> come<00:00:33.660> up

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
with the wheels on it to kind of come up

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.139 
with the wheels on it to kind of come up
with<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.020> proper<00:00:34.170> width<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.430> rear<00:00:35.610> axle

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
with the proper width of the rear axle

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.970 
with the proper width of the rear axle
so<00:00:36.360> everything<00:00:36.660> would<00:00:36.750> fit<00:00:36.989> under<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> car<00:00:37.680> in

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
so everything would fit under the car in

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.700 
so everything would fit under the car in
this<00:00:38.430> case<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:39.300> decided<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.870> order<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.230> slightly

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
this case we decided to order a slightly

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.360 
this case we decided to order a slightly
narrowed<00:00:41.340> rear<00:00:41.550> axle<00:00:42.210> assembly<00:00:42.719> from<00:00:42.930> curry

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
narrowed rear axle assembly from curry

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.830 
narrowed rear axle assembly from curry
normally<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.879> would<00:00:45.030> put<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> suspension

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
normally we would put the suspension

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.600 
normally we would put the suspension
together<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.590> measure<00:00:46.860> what<00:00:47.219> we<00:00:47.340> needed

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
together and then measure what we needed

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.270 
together and then measure what we needed
and<00:00:47.940> order<00:00:48.570> wheels<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.710> were<00:00:49.800> custom<00:00:50.039> made

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
and order wheels that were custom made

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.610 
and order wheels that were custom made
for<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> car<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.780> case<00:00:52.050> these

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
for the car but in this case these

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.049 
for the car but in this case these
wheels<00:00:52.920> aren't<00:00:53.160> really<00:00:53.399> available<00:00:53.879> anymore

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
wheels aren't really available anymore

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.540 
wheels aren't really available anymore
and<00:00:54.510> he<00:00:54.840> already<00:00:55.020> had<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> set<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.949> it's

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
and he already had the set and it's

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.979 
and he already had the set and it's
really<00:00:56.760> not<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.000> big<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.449> deal<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.840> have

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
really not that big of a deal to have

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.950 
really not that big of a deal to have
curry<00:00:58.320> make<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> rear<00:00:59.609> axle<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.270> any<00:01:00.750> with

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
curry make you a rear axle in any with

curry make you a rear axle in any with
you<00:01:01.109> want<00:01:01.579> once<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:02.730> had<00:01:02.879> our<00:01:03.000> wheels<00:01:03.210> mocked

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
you want once we had our wheels mocked

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.390 
you want once we had our wheels mocked
up<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> original<00:01:04.619> axle<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.280> got<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
up on the original axle and got a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.010 
up on the original axle and got a
measurement<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.090> what<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.420> thought<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.780> needed

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
measurement of what we thought we needed

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.490 
measurement of what we thought we needed
as<00:01:07.500> far<00:01:07.740> as<00:01:07.920> clearance<00:01:08.400> wise<00:01:08.840> we<00:01:09.840> removed<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
as far as clearance wise we removed the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.620 
as far as clearance wise we removed the
stock<00:01:10.740> axle<00:01:11.220> assembly<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.479> matter

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
stock axle assembly it's just a matter

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.870 
stock axle assembly it's just a matter
of<00:01:12.780> unbolting<00:01:13.439> everything<00:01:13.920> loosening<00:01:14.580> up<00:01:14.700> all

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
of unbolting everything loosening up all

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.090 
of unbolting everything loosening up all
the<00:01:15.000> u-bolts<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.930> were<00:01:16.049> able<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.350> use<00:01:17.070> a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the u-bolts we were able to use a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.219 
the u-bolts we were able to use a
transmission<00:01:18.060> jack<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.540> jack<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.110> rear

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
axle housing turn the whole thing

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.420 
axle housing turn the whole thing
sideways<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.650> kind<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.920> work<00:01:23.310> it

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
sideways and then just kind of work it

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.250 
sideways and then just kind of work it
out<00:01:23.580> from<00:01:23.820> underneath<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.270> car

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.860 

we<00:01:29.260> decided<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:29.800> go<00:01:29.950> with<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.310> curry<00:01:30.700> 9<00:01:31.150> +<00:01:31.600> rear

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
we decided to go with a curry 9 + rear

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.980 
we decided to go with a curry 9 + rear
axle<00:01:32.290> assembly<00:01:32.830> now<00:01:33.490> this<00:01:33.700> is<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.880> Ford<00:01:34.540> 9-inch

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
axle assembly now this is a Ford 9-inch

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.350 
axle assembly now this is a Ford 9-inch
style<00:01:35.320> design<00:01:35.770> but<00:01:36.280> it<00:01:36.400> consists<00:01:36.940> of<00:01:37.000> all<00:01:37.150> new

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
style design but it consists of all new

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.320 
style design but it consists of all new
parts<00:01:37.570> curry<00:01:38.500> manufactures<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.610> housings<00:01:40.090> to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
parts curry manufactures the housings to

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.270 
parts curry manufactures the housings to
whatever<00:01:40.690> width<00:01:40.930> you<00:01:41.020> want<00:01:41.080> in-house<00:01:41.770> we

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
whatever width you want in-house we

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.969 
whatever width you want in-house we
ordered<00:01:42.550> ours<00:01:43.110> unpainted<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:44.470> unassembled

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
ordered ours unpainted and unassembled

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.850 
ordered ours unpainted and unassembled
so<00:01:45.790> we<00:01:46.000> could<00:01:46.180> do<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.360> finish<00:01:46.630> work<00:01:46.840> on<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.260> but

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
so we could do the finish work on it but

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.710 
so we could do the finish work on it but
curry<00:01:48.280> traditionally<00:01:48.910> builds<00:01:49.240> these<00:01:49.390> with

two-piece hub and rotor combo which is

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.110 
two-piece hub and rotor combo which is
nice<00:04:42.010> because<00:04:42.250> it's<00:04:42.550> a<00:04:42.639> little<00:04:42.790> bit<00:04:42.880> lighter

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
nice because it's a little bit lighter

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.719 
nice because it's a little bit lighter
than<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.540> original<00:04:43.990> plus<00:04:44.800> it<00:04:45.130> keeps<00:04:45.430> some<00:04:45.700> of

the heat out of the hub from the rotor

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.710 
the heat out of the hub from the rotor
it<00:04:48.490> doesn't<00:04:48.790> transmit<00:04:49.120> a<00:04:49.300> lot<00:04:49.419> of<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.570> heat

it doesn't transmit a lot of the heat

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.440 
it doesn't transmit a lot of the heat
through<00:04:50.080> so<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:50.950> hub<00:04:51.100> just<00:04:51.460> slips<00:04:51.729> on<00:04:51.970> and

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
through so the hub just slips on and

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.600 
through so the hub just slips on and
locks<00:04:52.810> down<00:04:53.050> with<00:04:53.260> a<00:04:53.290> traditional<00:04:53.500> style<00:04:54.010> hub
