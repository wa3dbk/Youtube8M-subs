00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.059
 to the last part to the sixth part of the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.770
 series better aim shoot kill today 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.150
 with all the extras and tips not so 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.400
 properly fitted to the other topics 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.990
 have a quick draw for the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.340
 guess has gone yesterday the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.830
 Winners were actually determined 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.150
 so far all have reported up on 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.650
 the main winner who has yet 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.269
 not reported means when the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.260
 so far not within a week 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.489
 then I will just report that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.399
 give away the headset again 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.149
 I'm sorry but not for everyone 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.790
 have won 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.829
 I can comfort you after that 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.180
 holiday so that 500 will be special too 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.890
 to be a little raffle 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.690
 yes, you can join in any case 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.219
 and try your luck again 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.739
 every case went well with yesterday 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.660
 the livestream and the many thanks for 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.460
 the people who were there also thanks to the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.110
 who just went along and yes 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.059
 Let's start the best if yes 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.440
 are a few tips in any case so 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.390
 Let's get to the first tip 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.710
 output device here we have tv 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.420
 against pc monitor 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.339
 I highly recommend you to the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.439
 monitor to play because televisions have 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.159
 usually a response time of 150 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.409
 millisecond 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.560
 that means the console or even 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.290
 yes also the pc needs 150 milliseconds 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.150
 until the picture is displayed on the TV 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.320
 is the monitor sees that 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.790
 very different from there are the five 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.259
 milliseconds so usually there 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.570
 even those who only have a 2 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.070
 milliseconds reaction time sounds 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.600
 Of course not much but the black 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.979
 It's just a game where it is sometimes 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.990
 which arrives in hundredths of a second 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.869
 if your opponent looks around the corner and it 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.159
 comes to be so mona yes that is 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.570
 in any case noticeable and you will 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.500
 to fight a lot more weapons 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.420
 win 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.790
 that's why i can only warm you 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.130
 recommend that we come then already 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.939
 the second tip to the vibration of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.130
 controller 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.470
 you know that yes a grenade flies 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.320
 black ops exploded in your direction 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.369
 and by the nice controller 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.659
 vibrate it comes naturally as before 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.280
 if the grenade really next to one 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.590
 of course exploding then is fun 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.000
 but of course it is quite whole 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.680
 nice animations what a little bit 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.689
 that also clarifies the problem 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.219
 is that you usually when you have the 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.719
 grenade kills or a range 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.860
 is however in any case close 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.429
 and most of the time you are already on the ball 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.560
 on 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.170
 and I'll tell you honestly for a long time 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.569
 visibility always minimizes when 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.069
 shoot and vibrate 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.840
 controllers forgave your shot 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.489
 a bit and go in the long term 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.060
 you flute the definitive packages 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.349
 that's the best way to do that 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.639
 you can not go wrong as well 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.650
 which bothers me, for example, animal 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:30.060
 Personally, if you want a round too 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.549
 he has finished playing the controller 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.959
 at the table and all at once she comes 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.159
 the last kill cam the whole table 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.299
 I start to vibrate, I startle 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.590
 me there as always what else I fall yes 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.540
 almost from my chair here 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.040
 and yes I am doing to anyway 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.239
 but that's really me too 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.409
 already noticed that the shot 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.780
 I can spoil you the minimal 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.459
 really only recommend 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.049
 Tip number three of the game sound 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.819
 I can only recommend doing that 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.109
 game sound not too loud because sometimes 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.349
 I have that then I have the sound like that 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:57.239
 set a bit loud and then 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.680
 is it about the map find no and on 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.569
 once customer opponents around the corner and the 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.500
 it starts to sound so loud that I am 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.700
 at once startling as many 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.980
 controller almost out of hand 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.859
 So in any case, ask first totally 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.239
 shocked and yes so more works 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.969
 shocking and that's why it really is 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.260
 better the sound a little quieter 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.940
 Do you actually hear the opponents? 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.989
 most of the time I think with the 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.840
 This is relative anyway 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.790
 difficult to guide so yes tip 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.829
 Number 3 makes the games games 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.930
 quieter we come to tip 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.459
 number five these are the controllers 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.349
 Aufsetzer There are two different ones 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.090
 Towards once there are all these 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.079
 normal here I also have the picture 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.019
 displayed 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.040
 there is this normal one 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.379
 controller also sets the one too 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.359
 Surprise the old one over there like that 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.680
 You can say that just summarizes it 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.299
 Slightly prevent it from slipping off 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.689
 There are different versions 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.239
 then there are these fps freaks too 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:51.049
 I also got some from 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.370
 both of them and have nothing 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.569
 but later you have noticed for a long time 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.949
 see that the things a bit 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.659
 what minimal do the make of course 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:59.639
 do not achieve exactly but just with 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.229
 For example, you have these fpf freaks 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.909
 you just can do it a bit 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.470
 sensitive so a bit more sensitive 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.030
 easy with those with the controller 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.280
 sticks are just around this 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.439
 leverage makes sure you get that one 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.959
 bit of a bit more simple 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.609
 You can control where you count now me 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.019
 can only recommend that makes it 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.639
 with the slip is that great that he 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.829
 Do not slip off as often as you think 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.090
 So , too 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.379
 if you have the first time oh nonsense 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.729
 that brings nothing so immediately 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.110
 I'm not better now but up 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.889
 For a long time you will definitely be less 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.870
 slip down 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.909
 and also this little accuracy bonus 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.780
 really brings what you can 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:32.090
 try the things are really 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.550
 relatively cheap i can get the bottom too 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.650
 link times 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.930
 and yes i can only recommend that 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.490
 next tip has been appreciated 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.020
 that they are all weapons once 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.990
 try and all weapons times plays 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.780
 many people are playing a bit like that 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.159
 her 23 weapons because of me the pwm smc 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.770
 and the sniper and then they are one 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.990
 bit stuck in your goal 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.150
 I had to be so flexible 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.930
 it is better if you really stay 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.240
 all weapons a little bit 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.069
 each one plays dynamically varied 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.849
 Weapon also has her strength and her 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:03.740
 weaknesses 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.639
 all of which are indeed relatively balanced 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.990
 That's why I really can 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.610
 only recommend you play with all 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.810
 Weapons you come then in total 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.490
 it's better because you're so kind 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.659
 easy to gain experience 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.139
 how to handle the different weapons 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:13.729
 deal 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.440
 Also, imagine you have 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.210
 somehow it's a big killstreak 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.500
 are also relatively far and on one 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.060
 you have no more ammo because here 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.740
 scavenger or looter not there 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.909
 then you can just do something 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.800
 record and if you really 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:27.469
 then practiced salt around with other weapons 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.090
 it is not a problem so i can 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:31.430
 really only recommend you so you have 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.710
 just a good chance with it then 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.969
 to continue what mode I am for 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.259
 can recommend too is too 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.940
 sharpshooter is the name of where I believe 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.889
 always every 30 seconds or whatever 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.449
 change weapons also works great 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.400
 if it is just as much a party game 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.719
 I really can only recommend so with 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.110
 all arms a bit too 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:47.029
 play 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.099
 The next two tips are about it 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:51.219
 with the various target settings 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:54.110
 from the xbox 360 and the playstation 3 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.940
 we start with the xbox 360 I think 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.819
 a really cool settings you 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.520
 just goes presses the xbox button goes 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:04.550
 then on profiles and foreplay 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.639
 attitude and then you have that 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.839
 car in the normal and for this car 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.219
 center and the car is centering 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:11.449
 actually always at the beginning and there 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:14.659
 Just imagine that's just what 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.770
 instant improves your euro 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:16.909
 pattern as it could sometimes 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.279
 try it is against you 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:20.569
 The wall was the magazine makes empty 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:23.000
 this centered and balled 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:25.129
 again he just means that 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.779
 xbox because that's just trying 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:27.689
 The crosshairs always in the middle 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:29.459
 to center 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:31.979
 and to pull and thereby have the 

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:33.419
 simple better goal effect at the 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.949
 Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a playstation 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:36.659
 outdoor center function she has 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.789
 of course, this auto aim function 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:41.519
 but yes this year by default as well 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:43.860
 but what can recommend what to me 

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:45.329
 For example, it helped a lot that you 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.459
 that just makes you do it 

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:49.139
 just auto aiming out like this and 

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:51.629
 will see that gets really blatant 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.249
 Hard because you do not know how we do 

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:54.749
 that actually helps right in 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:55.860
 fight this year and so it is me 

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:57.239
 Personally just noticed 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.399
 really gamble without a week 

00:06:57.239 --> 00:07:01.559
 auto aim and if you go back then 

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:04.110
 car and then I say to you, then it's 

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:05.669
 So it's much easier 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.469
 the aiming you are quite differently told 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:08.819
 how much heavier and more complicated 

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:11.369
 aiming at once becomes like this 

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:12.899
 I really can only help 

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:15.929
 is like one like it like so ne art 

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:17.399
 training so people that 's it now 

00:07:15.929 --> 00:07:19.860
 actually already so far with the 

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:21.599
 video with the last part of the series 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.369
 better aim shoot kill 

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:26.489
 I hope you liked it I have 

00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:28.949
 Get a lot of good feedback from 

00:07:26.489 --> 00:07:30.629
 the subscribers I hope was the one 

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:32.189
 or help other video a bit 

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:34.379
 It will be the next one soon 

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:36.479
 come to small mini tips come 

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:37.800
 now only if tomorrow morning holiday worth 

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:40.050
 but still upload to the videos 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.039
 I have not been here yet 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.259
 I still have to do some videos 

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:44.279
 before I turn on vacation 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.349
 which can upload 

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:50.329
 and yes I hope you have it first 

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:50.329
