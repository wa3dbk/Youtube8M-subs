problems<00:01:01.070> if<00:01:01.610> you've<00:01:01.790> ever<00:01:01.940> been<00:01:02.120> in<00:01:02.270> a<00:01:02.329> zoo

and<00:01:02.930> you've<00:01:03.469> been<00:01:03.620> hit<00:01:03.829> by<00:01:03.860> let's<00:01:04.850> say<00:01:05.089> seven

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
and you've been hit by let's say seven

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.840 
and you've been hit by let's say seven
pieces<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.899> feces<00:01:06.560> you'll<00:01:07.190> notice<00:01:07.550> the<00:01:07.670> next

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
pieces of feces you'll notice the next

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.840 
pieces of feces you'll notice the next
time<00:01:08.030> you'll<00:01:08.210> hit<00:01:08.300> your<00:01:08.360> hit<00:01:08.630> by<00:01:08.780> 14<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:09.850> then

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
time you'll hit your hit by 14 and then

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.529 
time you'll hit your hit by 14 and then
21<00:01:12.009> so<00:01:13.009> we're<00:01:13.160> doing<00:01:13.280> math<00:01:13.610> tables<00:01:13.910> my<00:01:14.240> friend

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
21 so we're doing math tables my friend

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.920 
21 so we're doing math tables my friend
I<00:01:14.720> see<00:01:15.399> what's<00:01:16.399> with<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.759> face<00:01:17.060> eating<00:01:17.450> is<00:01:17.570> it

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
I see what's with the face eating is it

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.290 
I see what's with the face eating is it
is<00:01:18.080> it<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:18.289> one-time<00:01:18.800> thing<00:01:18.860> for<00:01:19.610> chimpanzees

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
is it a one-time thing for chimpanzees

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.270 
is it a one-time thing for chimpanzees
or<00:01:20.570> is<00:01:20.720> it<00:01:20.930> something<00:01:21.410> that's<00:01:21.680> on<00:01:21.800> your<00:01:21.950> minds

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
or is it something that's on your minds

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.930 
or is it something that's on your minds
all<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.430> time

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
all the time

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.700 
all the time
well<00:01:23.149> we<00:01:23.479> actually<00:01:23.869> think<00:01:24.050> about<00:01:24.170> it<00:01:24.350> quite<00:01:24.680> a

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
well we actually think about it quite a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.160 
well we actually think about it quite a
bit<00:01:24.830> you<00:01:25.700> see<00:01:25.850> it's<00:01:25.970> quite<00:01:26.060> easy<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.660> eat<00:01:26.960> the

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
bit you see it's quite easy to eat the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.230 
bit you see it's quite easy to eat the
face<00:01:27.380> of<00:01:27.679> a<00:01:27.740> human<00:01:27.950> it's<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.729> most<00:01:28.910> vulnerable

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
face of a human it's the most vulnerable

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.210 
face of a human it's the most vulnerable
part<00:01:29.750> of<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:29.959> human<00:01:30.289> being<00:01:30.500> is<00:01:30.830> that<00:01:30.890> what<00:01:31.130> the

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
part of a human being is that what the

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.460 
part of a human being is that what the
appeal<00:01:31.429> is<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.819> vulnerability<00:01:32.229> fleshy<00:01:33.229> and

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
appeal is the vulnerability fleshy and

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.430 
appeal is the vulnerability fleshy and
weak<00:01:34.069> and<00:01:34.399> flabby<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:35.509> jelly

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
weak and flabby and jelly

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.680 
weak and flabby and jelly
we<00:01:36.709> just<00:01:36.950> pluck<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:37.429> off<00:01:37.580> like<00:01:38.060> right<00:01:38.240> now<00:01:38.360> if

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
we just pluck it off like right now if

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.779 
we just pluck it off like right now if
you<00:01:38.899> would<00:01:39.080> let<00:01:39.319> me<00:01:39.349> it<00:01:39.890> would<00:01:40.160> take<00:01:40.310> me<00:01:40.429> under

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
you would let me it would take me under

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.339 
you would let me it would take me under
10<00:01:40.970> seconds<00:01:41.330> to<00:01:41.450> remove<00:01:41.720> your<00:01:41.840> face<00:01:42.050> and<00:01:42.259> eat

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:42.349 
10 seconds to remove your face and eat

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:45.249 
10 seconds to remove your face and eat
it<00:01:42.500> I'm<00:01:42.679> not<00:01:42.920> going<00:01:43.099> to<00:01:43.250> let<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:43.490> do<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:44.259> now

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
it I'm not going to let you do that now

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.900 
it I'm not going to let you do that now

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
you seem to have a great contempt for

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.600 
you seem to have a great contempt for
humankind<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:48.229> hope<00:01:48.800> I've<00:01:48.979> made<00:01:49.160> that<00:01:49.310> clear

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
humankind I hope I've made that clear

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.100 
humankind I hope I've made that clear
well<00:01:49.910> yeah<00:01:50.090> but<00:01:50.270> just<00:01:50.420> by<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:50.750> fact<00:01:50.959> that<00:01:50.990> you

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
well yeah but just by the fact that you

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.070 
well yeah but just by the fact that you
shared<00:01:51.310> 98.7<00:01:52.310> percent<00:01:52.340> of<00:01:52.849> DNA<00:01:53.509> with<00:01:53.750> human

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
shared 98.7 percent of DNA with human

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.359 
shared 98.7 percent of DNA with human
beings<00:01:54.349> you<00:01:54.500> don't<00:01:54.830> feel<00:01:54.950> any<00:01:55.130> sort<00:01:55.340> of

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
beings you don't feel any sort of

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.279 
beings you don't feel any sort of
kinship<00:01:55.819> to<00:01:56.000> people<00:01:56.270> at<00:01:56.360> all<00:01:56.479> know<00:01:56.840> that<00:01:57.020> point

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
kinship to people at all know that point

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.410 
kinship to people at all know that point
three<00:01:57.560> percent<00:01:58.009> is<00:01:58.160> very<00:01:58.399> very<00:01:58.789> important

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
three percent is very very important
