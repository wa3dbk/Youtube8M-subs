beginning steps for creating one of
these<00:00:16.199> rare<00:00:16.650> machines<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:21.080> started<00:00:22.080> on<00:00:22.170> bikes

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
these rare machines I started on bikes

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.540 
these rare machines I started on bikes
when<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.890> was<00:00:22.980> 15<00:00:24.800> once<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.920> started<00:00:26.340> working

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
when I was 15 once I started working

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.880 
when I was 15 once I started working
around<00:00:26.939> them<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.300> that's<00:00:28.019> what<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.320> realized<00:00:28.740> no

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
around them I that's what I realized no

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.769 
around them I that's what I realized no
that's<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.220> want<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> do<00:00:29.640> ever<00:00:30.390> since<00:00:30.660> I

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
that's what I want to do ever since I

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.269 
that's what I want to do ever since I
had<00:00:30.929> been<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.349> industry<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.070> best

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
had been in this industry the best

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.330 
had been in this industry the best
position<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.450> RB<00:00:33.809> position<00:00:34.230> dale<00:00:35.070> and

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
position was the RB position dale and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.250 
position was the RB position dale and
the<00:00:35.370> team<00:00:35.670> take<00:00:36.030> time<00:00:36.300> planning<00:00:36.930> what<00:00:37.110> would

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the team take time planning what would

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.780 
the team take time planning what would
really<00:00:37.440> make<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.890> statement<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.670> of

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
really make this statement for one of

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.139 
really make this statement for one of
their<00:00:38.969> extreme<00:00:39.719> choppers<00:00:40.700> they<00:00:41.700> think<00:00:41.940> about

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
their extreme choppers they think about

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.569 
their extreme choppers they think about
calling<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.570> one<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.809> bone<00:00:43.140> person<00:00:43.649> oh<00:00:43.890> yeah

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
calling this one the bone person oh yeah

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.010 
calling this one the bone person oh yeah
that's<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.450> good<00:00:50.420> enough<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> boardroom

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
that's a good enough of the boardroom

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.200 
that's a good enough of the boardroom
it's<00:00:52.559> time<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> vengeance<00:00:53.579> team<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.030> do

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it's time for the vengeance team to do

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.160 
it's time for the vengeance team to do
if<00:00:54.390> they<00:00:54.539> do<00:00:54.780> bad<00:00:55.370> bikes<00:00:56.660> are<00:00:57.660> trained<00:00:58.020> we're

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
if they do bad bikes are trained we're

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.060 
if they do bad bikes are trained we're
gonna<00:00:58.260> put<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> bike<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.399> S&amp;S<00:00:59.850> 113

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
gonna put in the bike the S&amp;S 113

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.020 
gonna put in the bike the S&amp;S 113

that's<00:01:03.539> what<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:03.750> need<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.989> get<00:01:04.110> started<00:01:04.290> so

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that's what we need to get started so

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.970 
that's what we need to get started so
let's<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.070> over<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.549> get<00:01:05.700> going

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:22.090 

I<00:01:11.070> applied<00:01:11.940> this<00:01:12.090> back

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.710 

we're<00:01:22.550> gonna<00:01:22.670> pull<00:01:22.909> tension<00:01:23.210> on<00:01:23.480> the<00:01:23.570> belt

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
we're gonna pull tension on the belt

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.540 
we're gonna pull tension on the belt
right<00:01:23.960> now<00:01:24.140> we've<00:01:24.710> worked<00:01:24.890> in<00:01:25.070> place<00:01:25.250> that<00:01:25.430> way

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
right now we've worked in place that way

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:40.770 
right now we've worked in place that way
nothing<00:01:25.729> move<00:01:26.030> our<00:01:26.300> firewall<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.229> belt

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.850 

technical<00:01:41.780> thing<00:01:41.960> right<00:01:42.140> here<00:01:42.229> duct<00:01:42.470> tape<00:01:42.680> in

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
technical thing right here duct tape in

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.469 
technical thing right here duct tape in
the<00:01:42.920> hose<00:01:43.240> will<00:01:44.240> use<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.600> not<00:01:44.750> offender<00:01:45.200> with

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
the hose will use the not offender with

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.850 
the hose will use the not offender with
turn<00:01:47.479> all<00:01:47.630> them<00:01:47.780> up<00:01:47.900> and<00:01:48.110> put<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.350> will<00:01:48.500> up<00:01:48.710> in

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
turn all them up and put the will up in

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.139 
turn all them up and put the will up in
here<00:01:49.070> so<00:01:49.310> that<00:01:49.340> we<00:01:49.549> could<00:01:49.700> measure<00:01:49.909> the

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
here so that we could measure the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.190 
here so that we could measure the
spacers<00:01:50.630> for<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.560> back<00:01:51.740> tire<00:01:52.720> take<00:01:53.720> this<00:01:53.899> wire

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
spacers for the back tire take this wire

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.430 
spacers for the back tire take this wire
or<00:01:55.130> piece<00:01:55.340> of<00:01:55.369> screen<00:01:55.990> just<00:01:56.990> go<00:01:57.080> down<00:01:57.259> the

wheel right there and you measure the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.210 
wheel right there and you measure the
distance<00:02:08.450> in<00:02:08.840> here<00:02:09.050> for<00:02:09.200> your<00:02:09.320> spacer<00:02:09.770> just

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
distance in here for your spacer just

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.160 
distance in here for your spacer just
stick<00:02:10.520> your<00:02:10.670> caliper<00:02:11.150> on<00:02:11.240> outer<00:02:11.450> ring<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:12.050> your
