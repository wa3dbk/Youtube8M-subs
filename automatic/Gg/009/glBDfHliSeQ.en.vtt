00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hello friends, we warmly welcome 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.589
 again with ribbed potentes and 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.269
 I do not disappoint you no 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.910
 I was on the christkindlmarkt with 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.620
 my better half and this one 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.320
 vegetarian and wanted the flammkuchen 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.539
 food and there was no vegetarian 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.970
 Flammkuchen only with ham pieces and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.500
 I would like to say that if mine 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.240
 girlfriend flammkuchen wants to get then 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.670
 They also franken and vegetarian 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.470
 We'll do that together today 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.800
 Let's stay two different versions 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.630
 once pretty close to the original and at 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.880
 the other soft little special 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.399
 can you become a look maybe 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.350
 he yes we need cake for us 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.140
 once the dough and once the pad 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.469
 for the dough we need more I have 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.870
 here spelled wholegrain bread had this time 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.160
 no longer taken their own because it is rather 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.860
 has to go a little faster and 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.230
 Although very fine today would like to see 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.120
 I have an olive oil salt and yeast 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.239
 I do not need more for the dough 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.320
 Now come on top of desktop then do it 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:12.470
 we put a feta cheese on one side 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:18.530
 pepper organic lemon onions leek 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:21.600
 onions saudis anni and 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.909
 fresh preparation of the original 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.619
 Alsatian actually stays only at 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.090
 I've made a couple and 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.570
 I like a mixture of these 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.009
 Three mentioned better and we catch 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.810
 right now full on, I already am the 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.650
 Camera then you see something so far 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.079
 do the dough and that's what we take 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.470
 you always know with me in the kitchen 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:49.500
 Approximately four to 500 grams 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.970
 from that a good pinch of salt that 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.610
 means in my case now one 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.990
 significantly heaped tablespoons and then 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.790
 another two to three tablespoons 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.790
 olive oil 100 milliliters of water on circa 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.799
 500 grams of flour you know that too 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.960
 I mean the yeast, you might think so 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.670
 big bank video already seen in 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.160
 the warm water is pure brussels 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.490
 that simply has the reason 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.070
 that I'm not wonderful 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.370
 can be interactive without me afterwards 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.250
 lump the whole thing comes in there and 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.900
 Now the dough is called by hand 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.730
 Knead until he does not have any more people like that 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.510
 So here's a good ten 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.490
 minutes around and you already noticed how 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.500
 the paper pond now a beautiful 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.820
 homogeneous almost dry dough 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.080
 is no longer stuck in the fingers 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.340
 I'll show you the channel right 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.800
 nice even take out the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.670
 bowl is sparkling clean I want you 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.570
 but now a bit 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.510
 edit and when he finishes editing 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.430
 then I will be back soon 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.100

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:02.090
 enough talk you see the dough 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:07.070
 wonderful out of the pot for now 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.870
 Therefore towel over it and the dough 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.180
 Just let it go just like that 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.240
 long as it takes now we come 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.680
 for topping i have the little trick 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.470
 for you and it is always so 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.120
 a little stupid if so cream or 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.680
 spoon from the mug spoon 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.030
 after that you have to cut most of them 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.930
 The green dot comes as a small tip 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.970
 inform today 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.280
 you take the sharp one in the back 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.040
 Over the bowl I hope that sees 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.950
 Everything beautiful about the shots and 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:43.700
 even if it does not come that way now 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:45.710
 Just charge the rear of the camera or 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.130
 which one 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.300
 works however only if you that 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.460

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.210

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.740
 Now we have to do it all, of course 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.350
 to season yet 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:04.150
 So there comes a good portion of salt I 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.150
 would say one tablespoon salt were 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:12.350
