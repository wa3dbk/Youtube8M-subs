00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
why they get out in transition I think

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.550 
why they get out in transition I think
Doug<00:01:19.830> cause<00:01:20.700> done<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> terrific<00:01:21.479> job<00:01:21.750> he's<00:01:22.320> kind

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
Doug cause done a terrific job he's kind

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.340 
Doug cause done a terrific job he's kind
of<00:01:22.680> giving<00:01:22.890> them<00:01:23.009> their<00:01:23.189> identity<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:25.200> know

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
of giving them their identity you know

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.130 
of giving them their identity you know
they<00:01:25.530> figured<00:01:25.950> out<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:27.210> they<00:01:27.570> keep<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
they figured out that if they keep the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.560 
they figured out that if they keep the
fin<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.740> get<00:01:28.950> multiple<00:01:29.400> stops<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.210> turn<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
fin and get multiple stops and turn the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.569 
fin and get multiple stops and turn the
ball<00:01:30.750> over<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:31.200> they<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.470> run<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.460> other

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
ball over then they can run the other

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.999 
ball over then they can run the other
team<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.939> making<00:01:33.119> shots<00:01:33.540> then<00:01:34.049> they<00:01:34.500> can't<00:01:34.770> run

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
team is making shots then they can't run

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.399 
team is making shots then they can't run
and<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.909> he's<00:01:36.119> kind<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:36.810> know<00:01:37.259> exactly

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and so he's kind of they know exactly

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.230 
and so he's kind of they know exactly
who<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:37.979> are<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.280> who<00:01:38.340> they<00:01:38.430> want<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.790> and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
who they are and who they want to be and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.490 
who they are and who they want to be and
