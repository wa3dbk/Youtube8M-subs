full gate so the only reason why you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.410 
full gate so the only reason why you
should<00:01:13.470> get<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.950> two<00:01:14.130> sets<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:15.090> these

two just the tower
yes<00:01:18.150> that's<00:01:18.420> mostly<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.409> should<00:01:19.680> be<00:01:21.320> yeah

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
yes that's mostly what it should be yeah

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.210 
yeah like so like the main main reason
why<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.090> really<00:02:39.810> get<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.350> second<00:02:40.739> set<00:02:40.950> its

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
why you really get the second set its

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.059 
why you really get the second set its
what<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.580> extra<00:02:42.150> towel<00:02:42.799> because<00:02:43.799> that's

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
what the extra towel because that's

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.309 
what the extra towel because that's
mostly<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.519> only<00:02:44.850> decent<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.630> that's<00:02:45.930> it's

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
mostly the only decent so that's it's

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.770 
mostly the only decent so that's it's
not<00:02:46.560> but<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.100> reason<00:02:47.430> why<00:02:47.610> these<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.540> don't

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
not but the reason why these I don't

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.440 
not but the reason why these I don't
think<00:02:49.049> it<00:02:49.500> serves<00:02:49.830> two<00:02:50.100> dates<00:02:50.370> together<00:02:50.730> on<00:02:51.180> I

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
think it serves two dates together on I

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.170 
think it serves two dates together on I
saw<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.410> video<00:02:52.980> what<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.280> design<00:02:53.730> always

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
saw the video what the design always

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.960 
saw the video what the design always
think<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.019> saying<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.190> makes<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.700> bigger

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
think and saying that it makes a bigger

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.910 
think and saying that it makes a bigger
gate<00:02:57.329> it<00:02:57.510> doesn't<00:02:57.870> make<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.989> full<00:02:58.380> gate

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
gate it doesn't make a full gate

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.030 
gate it doesn't make a full gate
so<00:02:59.280> these<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.359> saw<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.660> video<00:03:01.049> like<00:03:01.470> this<00:03:01.799> thing

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
so these I saw the video like this thing

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.910 
so these I saw the video like this thing
like<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:02.609> that<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:03.000> guy<00:03:03.299> like<00:03:03.780> toward<00:03:04.680> me<00:03:04.890> like

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
like this that a guy like toward me like

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.699 
like this that a guy like toward me like
you<00:03:05.670> make<00:03:05.880> me<00:03:06.000> forget<00:03:06.480> getting<00:03:07.109> the<00:03:07.290> two<00:03:07.440> gates

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
you make me forget getting the two gates

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.280 
you make me forget getting the two gates
but<00:03:08.220> actually<00:03:08.790> lay<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.120> design<00:03:09.630> say<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:09.989> make

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
but actually lay the design say you make

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.539 
but actually lay the design say you make
a<00:03:10.320> big<00:03:10.680> oh<00:03:10.920> um<00:03:11.220> bad<00:03:11.730> or<00:03:12.060> gate<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.950> doesn't

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
a big oh um bad or gate so it doesn't

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.310 
a big oh um bad or gate so it doesn't
really<00:03:14.670> say<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.030> made<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.510> full<00:03:15.750> gate<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.230> I

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
really say you made the full gate so I

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.660 
really say you made the full gate so I
think<00:03:16.380> he<00:03:16.739> was<00:03:16.829> wound<00:03:17.130> Oh<00:03:17.549> dad<00:03:18.269> so<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:19.670> was

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
think he was wound Oh dad so that was

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.229 
think he was wound Oh dad so that was
really<00:03:20.880> just<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.680> little<00:03:22.680> info<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.850> should
