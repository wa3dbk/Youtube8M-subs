00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.410
 in congo it should do the appropriate immune 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.269
 politician wants to start from this 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.710
 statement to make a reflection 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.540
 here we say that they are more and more 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.389
 convinced that the world I live in has 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.660
 incredibly pizza and that consistency 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.090
 it is not so widespread it is difficult not 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.910
 having heard the change once this 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.470
 affirmation leaked from anyone 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.279
 exponent of the Italian political scene 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:35.100
 and for me it is difficult between 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.540
 pines of anger cannot be done 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.420
 a statement like that 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.329
 the fact of joint evil where they passed 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.250
 characters like gerry scotti images 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.379
 not to mention now mara carfagna 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.910
 and then how do you criticize and say 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.739
 that the comedian should be a comedian 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.180
 not the politician with the greatest suffering 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.649
 averages the journey that has absolutely 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.690
 represented everything from the first of the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.000
 class ii g 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.410
 and I am I am not of a native boredom 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.500
 they are in charge of the facts 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.310
 by making a speech of malonia I make them 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.210
 I would n't want to be lethal I would like to be 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.250
 captivating and able to capture 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.520
 the attention of the versions to be able to 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.620
 to express something in my eyes 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.050
 it is absolutely so 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.210
 don't be absolutely honest a 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.530
 another negative aspect of this type of 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.590
 attack against cricket with 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.150
 people and therefore perhaps believe it towards the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.830
 5 star movement is the fact that 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.900
 they don't even think they are paired at the moment 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.940
 expert represents a great period 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.250
 instead these and I urge everyone to be 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.920
 absolutely critical towards any 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.270
 what can happen but the same and 13 of 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.610
 rose considered the facts 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.320
 and the facts are that in the present all the 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.000
 political forces right at the center 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.320
 left they do nothing but 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.690
 chat that you don't do at all 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.010
 nothing against the citizens 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.110
 politics could not be more 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.340
 distant from various needs 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.600
 of people 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.640
 in this video I would also like to talk about 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.160
 example of an electoral law a country 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.840
 the law is civil and not a democratic country 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.280
 election as far as the head of the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.070
 state has repeatedly asked to 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.930
 change 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.700
 reasons of inadequacy of that 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.399
 current can not be changed to two minutes 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.990
 from the vote because it is obvious that the meaning 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.240
 of the new law will be nothing but 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.130
 interpret the polls they give from here 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.650
 shortly the outcome of the polls 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.140
 so if we start from the porcellum that 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.360
 what he called it porcello 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.580
 made ie calderoli which was made for 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.980
 to pivot the mighty get win 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.570
 without being able to govern it is being born 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.160
 around this law that beyond 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.560
 of the official declarations of the 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.930
 started the same principle what 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.420
 we are doing a cell tear there 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.610
 a law that does so by following the 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.730
 surveys that should be repeated for 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.820
 force the grand coalition to prevent 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.720
 to bersani now renzi or to who will win the 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.850
 primary will run my first 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.340
 a left which today is given in 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.110
 advantage of having the strength to govern 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.630
 with its own project 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.460
 this design has nothing to do with that 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.650
 with the request of the citizens of a 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.970
 electoral law that gives them back 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.670
 possibility of electing parliamentarians 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.070
 but it is exactly the opposite there is a 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.340
 law that tries to bring in i 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.380
 palaces and the final decision on 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.420
 government that will come out of the elections more 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.930
 important of the last 30 years in 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.050
 Italy 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.390
 if so, any threshold whatsoever 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.430
 proposal for constitutional constitutions 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.880
 or pollsters or professor would be 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.640
 wrong I don't know exactly that 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.070
 I could say that 42.5 percent but I know 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.490
 that the concept already exists that a law exists 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.620
 a number with the comma has reached 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.420
 through occupations and reasoning 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.850
 di palazzo makes us understand that it is not one 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.710
 healthy law is a law that already comes with 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.810
 a 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.900
 but the problem is simple in this 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.760
 country does not do things clearly 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.490
 to have as objective that the 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.070
 citizen votes and decides to win 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.830
 like it or not like that is not you 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.510
 do to predetermine governments with 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.060
 risk then short term wrong 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.280
 and unimaginably brings it into question with the 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.260
 there would be no old porcella law 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.090
 was definitely changing something 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.320
 we must begin to participate 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.240
 actively hill 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.920
 you have to be for yourself and me for this 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.650
 point of view to invite to the 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.900
 5 star movement does not just want the 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.310
 votes of the citizens' versions 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.830
 want citizens participate 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.540
 active in the field of life can be 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.100
 subscribers to other parties be 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.140
 the criminal record can safely 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.760
 participate in the tables which is not all 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.700
 roses and flowers because my name is work 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.710
 it is also animatedly discussed and necessary 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.910
 confronting people but is the only one 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.010
 way to change things 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.300
 if you are there man for example I recommend you 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.300
 to visit this 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.130
 Hello
