00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.690
 last Thursday you do not even dream of visitos 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.000
 true lies and had harsh 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.760
 words for your former club mate 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.770
 of the comedy 'Pedro ruminot never 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.600
 we were friends not like a relationship like 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.869
 beyond seeing us in the channel when 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.189
 there was recording and in a couple of meetings 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.609
 quite unpleasant that I have commented 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.609
 ever 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.050
 Alejandra owner participated in one of 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.090
 jury of the comedy club and the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.220
 seem for the statements given the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.110
 past judge got his true 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.120
 experience was not the best 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.730
 in fact that the comedy club 'does not 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.650
 it came out as you expected it to be what 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.330
 expected and that was the functioning of the 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.210
 product I expected 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.210
 a job where creatively you 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.449
 will work together where there was a 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.010
 communion of people who join 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.839
 create ideas to propose ideas and make them 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.390
 where I learned from things that I did not 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:07.350
 I knew from the others that if it's okay and 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.000
 where I could contribute with my style 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.950
 to do comedy and with my sense of 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.320
 humor and I think none of those things 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.750
 it ended up being fulfilled if it was Pedro 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.130
 ruminot who divides the group because in 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.750
 this last time has been seen in 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.159
 posts and so many controversies with the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.799
 comedy structure 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.950
 let us remember the healing in the trini clouds 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.780
 alison mandel and natalia valdebenito 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.980
 where everyone agrees on the bad environment 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.240
 labor 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.240
 I believe that the environment are never better 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:43.520
 in a state of clear conflict no no 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.470
 there is nothing new under the sun you are 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.480
 working are many heads is a 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.460
 content program there are people who 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.160
 have to discuss ideas that he has to 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.870
 put on the table in your head then 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.310
 maybe that also helps you to 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.980
 complicates a little more the labor relation 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.020
 We went in search of Pedro Ruminot for 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.240
 ask him what he thought the harsh 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.890
 statements from his former partner 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.170
 team jari owns why not 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:14.310
 I do not want to polemicize with Alejandra 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.790
 to see me in that time for more than 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.030
 two years two or three master directors 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.950
 of the program that time doing something of 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.830
 memory I have the same mails 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.239
 and the announcer a prize in mega or towards 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.980
 the locution of the program in the dunes of 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.440
 the morning on the network 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.060
 recorded a series I was wrong I had 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.060
 like a job on the radio 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.000
 who come to us and calls us has 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.730
 excuses that have not sent support 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.850
 and that is partly a matter of fact the 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.850
 door 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.800
 and then it came up my 37 worked and it was 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.340
 as today I could do is that also the 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.900
 couple that is already ready but as well as 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.810
 here I had to work or nobody did not 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.160
 I would like 09 the truth that I do not know if 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.270
 I wanted to but I really could not 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.550
 because I had shown 4 work 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.980
 behave 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.870
 because I decided to always wrapped in 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.600
 controversial and the truth that a lot of me 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.730
 for many years exercising the role of 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:27.540
 be boss and the people were the drop your boss 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:31.470
 I'm sorry but I had to be boss in 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.690
 some moment of her was not her friend not 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.510
 it was his compadre and his team or his 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.819
 co-worker I was the boss but 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.370
 How heavy Rubinos inside the club 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.920
 the comedy 'and they will play against so many 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.780
 controversial and I know Pedro I am friend 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.390
 Peter has a person that every time 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.430
 someone laporta idea in accepting them 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.260
 he went around and even published them 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.370
 that are much better if I think it is 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.530
 qari owns what she is doing 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.599
 it is simply generating conflict after its 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.190
 exit no no I actually is that neither 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.440
 they went on the air a lot of night in that 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.480
 moment equality the different program 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.849
 as it proves like it changes every year 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.390
 very much generates it as it always was 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.640
 as as difficult as well as then 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.500
 has a strong character that is not a 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.019
 a life that says I do not want happened to 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.410
 take us down or owner do not pass it to 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.410
 take me 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.400
 they leave you and rubbing with it but it can be 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.360
 things but finally have to see 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.250
 always has to do with with a 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.870
 management logic work and has 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.490
 good idea but maybe they were not verbal 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.960
 you pass your hand I think that also what 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.250
 he knows if he also catches where she 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.990
 works much better is like in the 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.940
 places keep more like in your style 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.520
 cachai I think that everyone has their 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.259
 space on the other hand his companion 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.440
 Fabricio Copa No and Rodrigo Salinas 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:52.479
 endorse a full in terms 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.440
 they pointed out that maybe because of their position of 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:05:02.310
 boss who played against also a 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:04.840
 thing is how to direct and something else 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.060
 now pedro cast then now the 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.470
 picture the actions of aleccionar I think that 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.060
 the program has nothing anti female 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.849
 but they have been like contexts 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.539
 nefarious in sant dice where has happened 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.800
 this 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.389
 I tell you that it has been quite a context 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.069
 nefarious and the truth is that it is nominated 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.830
 as the turning point of these 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:22.300
 costs and nefarious contexts that I do not 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.770
 we have nefarious contact but I do not say 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.849
 that there were exactly 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.439
 pedroches 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.449
 as moments where things had 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:31.419
 other other senses I was looking for 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.039
 other things the plain truth you have 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.959
 what to see rather like pedro contreras 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.699
 director at that time had as a 

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:38.770
 good creative director that you are like 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.199
 what does it have to do with your assumption 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.839
 Your position in your workplace more 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.589
 who consummated his role as a person if I 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:46.589
 I would have thrown the rock 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.719
 but I like better I like and 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.840
 Africa 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:57.029
 jean philippe crettÃ³n 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.790
 and if I ran the club would bring 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:00.710
 pop nachito 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.680
 he will go through this program as in the 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.500
 2014 will remain Pedro Ruminot the 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.620
 break point within this team 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.620
 of work
