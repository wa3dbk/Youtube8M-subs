00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.239 
you can tap up there and it'll bring it
up<00:01:47.810> settings<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.409> also<00:01:48.649> right<00:01:48.829> there<00:01:48.979> which<00:01:49.219> is

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
up settings is also right there which is

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:52.840 
up settings is also right there which is
extra<00:01:49.999> convenient<00:01:51.100> so<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.219> sim<00:01:52.429> is<00:01:52.579> really

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
extra convenient so the sim is really

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.889 
extra convenient so the sim is really
well<00:01:53.149> thought<00:01:53.359> out<00:01:53.420> it's<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:55.149> 219<00:01:56.149> Noah<00:01:56.479> sent<00:01:56.780> to

well thought out it's a 219 Noah sent to
99<00:01:57.289> it<00:01:57.499> so<00:01:57.649> it's<00:01:57.859> 129<00:01:58.429> what<00:01:58.729> we<00:01:58.850> know<00:01:58.909> right<00:01:58.999> now

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
99 it so it's 129 what we know right now
