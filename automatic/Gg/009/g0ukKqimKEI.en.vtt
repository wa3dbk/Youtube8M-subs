doing case after case this happened to
us<00:00:35.250> as<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:35.760> become<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.420> coordinated<00:00:37.290> team<00:00:37.559> and

us as we become a coordinated team and
to<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> point<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.690> know<00:00:39.899> you've

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
to the point that you know you've

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.930 
to the point that you know you've
advanced<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.340> procedure<00:00:41.670> when<00:00:41.820> you

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
advanced in this procedure when you

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.310 
advanced in this procedure when you
don't<00:00:42.120> really<00:00:42.210> even<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.899> talk<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.230> each

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
don't really even have to talk to each

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.200 
don't really even have to talk to each
other<00:00:43.530> during<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> surgery<00:00:44.190> because<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.700> she

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
other during the surgery because you she

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.580 
other during the surgery because you she
knows<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.690> next<00:00:45.960> move<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.530> know

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
knows what my next move is and I know

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.560 
knows what my next move is and I know
where<00:00:46.800> her<00:00:46.920> next<00:00:47.160> move<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.329> work

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
where her next move is and so you work

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.470 
where her next move is and so you work
through<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> procedure<00:00:49.969> knowing<00:00:50.969> where<00:00:51.390> you

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
through the procedure knowing where you

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.670 
through the procedure knowing where you
want<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.719> go

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.450 

the<00:00:56.280> robot<00:00:56.960> can<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:57.990> misinterpreted<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:59.250> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the robot can be misinterpreted that it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.280 
the robot can be misinterpreted that it
somehow<00:00:59.700> does<00:01:00.300> things<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.870> its<00:01:01.020> own<00:01:01.110> as<00:01:01.230> a

extension of the surgeon the tool for
the<00:01:05.640> surgeon<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:08.520> abdomen<00:01:09.480> is<00:01:09.600> insulated<00:01:10.530> as

the surgeon the abdomen is insulated as
a<00:01:10.650> term<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.340> blow<00:01:11.550> it<00:01:11.580> up<00:01:11.730> with<00:01:11.910> carbon

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
a term so we blow it up with carbon

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.090 
a term so we blow it up with carbon
dioxide<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.840> create<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> positive<00:01:13.890> pressure

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
dioxide to create a positive pressure

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.860 
dioxide to create a positive pressure
that<00:01:14.460> creates<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> working<00:01:15.300> space<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.780> we

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
that creates the working space that we

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.180 
that creates the working space that we
need<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.230> the<00:01:16.350> procedure<00:01:18.620> our<00:01:19.620> approach<00:01:19.920> is

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
need to do the procedure our approach is

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.570 
need to do the procedure our approach is
a<00:01:20.600> peritoneal<00:01:21.600> approach<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.920> prostate<00:01:23.490> is

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
a peritoneal approach in the prostate is

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.880 
a peritoneal approach in the prostate is
located<00:01:24.030> retroperitoneal<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.290> translation

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
located retroperitoneal so translation

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.430 
located retroperitoneal so translation
is<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:27.120> we<00:01:27.750> put<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> instruments

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
is that the we put the instruments

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.230 
is that the we put the instruments
inside<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.070> cavity<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.610> surrounds<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
inside the cavity that surrounds the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.580 
inside the cavity that surrounds the
bowels<00:01:30.690> and<00:01:30.869> have<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.080> go<00:01:31.170> through<00:01:31.440> that

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
bowels and have to go through that

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.050 
bowels and have to go through that
cavity<00:01:31.860> into<00:01:32.160> another<00:01:32.400> cavity<00:01:32.880> where<00:01:33.030> the

cavity into another cavity where the
prostate<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.010> have<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.660> open<00:01:36.660> up<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
prostate is so we have to open up the

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.219 
prostate is so we have to open up the
the<00:01:37.560> perineum<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:39.180> develop<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:39.780> area<00:01:39.840> where

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the perineum and develop the area where

the perineum and develop the area where
the<00:01:40.320> prostate<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.950> that's<00:01:41.580> kind<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.910> first

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
the prostate is that's kind of the first

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.210 
the prostate is that's kind of the first
part<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> surgery<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.080> it<00:01:43.290> expose<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
part of the surgery is it expose the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.560 
part of the surgery is it expose the
prostate<00:01:44.640> before<00:01:44.940> you<00:01:45.030> get<00:01:45.150> into<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
prostate before you get into it

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.140 
prostate before you get into it
the<00:01:45.990> advantage<00:01:46.650> of<00:01:46.830> this<00:01:47.040> procedure<00:01:47.760> for

controlling blood loss one is this this
gas<00:01:50.910> pressure<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.350> positive<00:01:52.740> pressure

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
gas pressure it's a positive pressure

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.280 
gas pressure it's a positive pressure
that<00:01:53.550> suppresses<00:01:53.970> bleeding<00:01:54.570> from<00:01:54.840> venous

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that suppresses bleeding from venous

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.020 
that suppresses bleeding from venous
channels<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:56.250> such<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> little<00:01:56.820> higher

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
channels it's such a little higher

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.090 
channels it's such a little higher
pressure<00:01:57.360> than<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.080> venous<00:01:58.500> channel<00:01:58.830> so<00:01:59.009> you

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
pressure than the venous channel so you

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.680 
pressure than the venous channel so you
don't<00:01:59.250> get<00:01:59.400> a<00:01:59.460> lot<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.730> oozing<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.300> might<00:02:00.480> see

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
don't get a lot of oozing you might see

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.960 
don't get a lot of oozing you might see
in<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.810> open<00:02:01.140> procedure<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:02.160> then<00:02:02.580> we're

under<00:02:03.180> manta<00:02:03.450> fication<00:02:03.720> so<00:02:04.140> we<00:02:04.260> have<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.650> have

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
under manta fication so we have to have

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.120 
under manta fication so we have to have
a<00:02:05.450> clean<00:02:06.450> non<00:02:07.230> bleeding<00:02:07.650> field<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.010> do<00:02:08.100> the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
bleeding as we go very precisely so you

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.410 
bleeding as we go very precisely so you
try<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.600> prevent<00:02:13.230> problems<00:02:13.500> bleeding<00:02:14.489> by<00:02:14.670> just

controlling it as you go and that's

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.410 
controlling it as you go and that's

in that Brosky meaning you had a flat
screen<00:03:47.220> like<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.430> TV<00:03:47.820> so<00:03:48.300> you<00:03:48.360> didn't<00:03:48.510> have

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
screen like a TV so you didn't have

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.450 
screen like a TV so you didn't have
depth<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.990> field<00:03:49.230> so<00:03:49.860> you<00:03:49.890> couldn't<00:03:50.250> see

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
depth of field so you couldn't see

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.130 
depth of field so you couldn't see
structures<00:03:50.910> as<00:03:51.060> well<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.480> couldn't<00:03:51.720> see<00:03:51.900> the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.930 
instruments as well or the angles of the
instruments<00:03:54.690> it's<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.910> huge<00:03:57.110> jump<00:03:58.110> in<00:03:58.320> the

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.920 
instruments it's a huge jump in the
visualization<00:03:59.940> that<00:03:59.970> enabled<00:04:00.600> us<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.690> do

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
visualization that enabled us to do

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.530 
visualization that enabled us to do
these<00:04:01.080> procedures<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.890> in<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.400> more<00:04:02.610> accurate

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
these procedures and in a more accurate

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.490 
these procedures and in a more accurate
and<00:04:03.780> precise<00:04:04.110> way<00:04:05.750> then<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.870> procedure<00:04:07.170> is

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
and precise way then the procedure is

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.830 
and precise way then the procedure is
placed<00:04:08.070> in<00:04:08.160> a<00:04:08.220> small<00:04:08.340> bag<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.730> some<00:04:09.540> patients

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
placed in a small bag and some patients

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.690 
placed in a small bag and some patients
have<00:04:09.930> had<00:04:09.990> concern<00:04:10.380> about<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:10.740> could<00:04:11.610> you

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
have had concern about that could you

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.940 
have had concern about that could you
spill<00:04:11.940> tumor<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.390> such<00:04:12.570> so<00:04:12.900> as<00:04:13.560> soon<00:04:13.770> as<00:04:13.890> the

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
spill tumor and such so as soon as the

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.120 
spill tumor and such so as soon as the
prostates<00:04:14.400> detached<00:04:15.380> free<00:04:16.380> we<00:04:16.620> put<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:16.890> in<00:04:17.010> a

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
prostates detached free we put it in a

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.760 
prostates detached free we put it in a
plastic<00:04:17.400> bag<00:04:17.670> that's<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.180> sturdy<00:04:18.600> bag<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.140> then

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
plastic bag that's a sturdy bag and then

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.320 
plastic bag that's a sturdy bag and then
it's<00:04:19.920> removed<00:04:20.280> through<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.850> patient's<00:04:21.180> belly

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
it's removed through the patient's belly

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.360 
it's removed through the patient's belly
button<00:04:21.660> there's<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:22.080> prostate

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
button there's a prostate

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.890 
button there's a prostate
we<00:04:23.820> were<00:04:23.910> spared<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.300> nerves<00:04:24.540> and<00:04:24.810> that's

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
we were spared the nerves and that's

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.780 
we were spared the nerves and that's
what<00:04:25.110> they'll<00:04:25.320> check<00:04:25.669> very<00:04:26.669> good<00:04:28.639> so<00:04:29.639> now

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
what they'll check very good so now

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.270 
what they'll check very good so now
we're<00:04:29.970> gonna<00:04:30.139> take<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.320> specimen<00:04:31.800> over<00:04:31.919> to

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
we're gonna take the specimen over to

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.730 
we're gonna take the specimen over to
pathologists<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.330> look<00:04:33.960> at<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.199> margins<00:04:34.620> of

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
pathologists and look at the margins of

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.230 
pathologists and look at the margins of
the<00:04:34.800> prostate<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.400> make<00:04:35.550> sure<00:04:35.699> we<00:04:35.850> got<00:04:35.970> around

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
the prostate to make sure we got around

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.450 
the prostate to make sure we got around
the<00:04:36.389> cancer<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.770> everything<00:04:38.100> looks<00:04:38.280> good

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
the cancer and everything looks good

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.820 
the cancer and everything looks good
then<00:04:38.699> we'll<00:04:38.880> close<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.270> patient<00:04:39.600> up<00:04:39.830> younger

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
then we'll close the patient up younger

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.290 
then we'll close the patient up younger
patients<00:04:41.280> where<00:04:41.400> we<00:04:41.430> do<00:04:41.669> a<00:04:41.699> really<00:04:42.000> close

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
patients where we do a really close

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.939 
patients where we do a really close
nerve-sparing<00:04:42.600> procedure<00:04:42.990> we<00:04:43.710> have<00:04:43.740> to

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
nerve-sparing procedure we have to

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.350 
nerve-sparing procedure we have to
really<00:04:44.190> check<00:04:44.400> our<00:04:44.520> margins<00:04:44.940> to<00:04:45.030> make<00:04:45.180> sure

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
really check our margins to make sure

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.659 
really check our margins to make sure
that<00:04:45.630> we've<00:04:45.840> gotten<00:04:46.380> around<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.710> cancer<00:04:47.070> and

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
that we've gotten around the cancer and

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.030 
that we've gotten around the cancer and
so<00:04:48.150> we've<00:04:48.690> developed<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.440> well<00:04:49.979> the

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
so we've developed the well the

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.320 
so we've developed the well the
technique<00:04:50.310> we<00:04:50.460> use<00:04:50.639> is<00:04:50.820> we<00:04:50.910> have<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.120> remove

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
technique we use is we have to remove

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.879 
technique we use is we have to remove
the<00:04:51.510> prostate<00:04:51.690> at<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.020> time<00:04:52.199> of<00:04:52.320> surgery<00:04:52.530> take

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
the prostate at the time of surgery take

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.430 
the prostate at the time of surgery take
to<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:53.070> pathologist<00:04:53.699> we<00:04:54.270> call<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:54.930> margins

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
to the pathologist we call the margins

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.280 
to the pathologist we call the margins
that<00:04:55.590> are<00:04:55.770> at<00:04:56.160> risk<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:56.820> he<00:04:57.360> real<00:04:57.840> time<00:04:58.080> we'll

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
that are at risk and he real time we'll

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.500 
that are at risk and he real time we'll
get<00:04:58.500> us<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.830> report<00:04:59.160> here<00:04:59.400> in<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.550> room<00:04:59.729> and<00:05:00.389> if

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
get us a report here in the room and if

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.270 
get us a report here in the room and if
he<00:05:00.570> had<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:00.720> positive<00:05:00.960> margin<00:05:01.530> then<00:05:01.889> we<00:05:02.100> have

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
he had a positive margin then we have

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.770 
he had a positive margin then we have
the<00:05:02.460> options<00:05:02.790> here<00:05:02.880> to<00:05:03.030> take<00:05:03.180> more<00:05:03.360> tissue<00:05:03.600> and

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
the options here to take more tissue and

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.940 
the options here to take more tissue and
try<00:05:03.900> to<00:05:03.960> clear<00:05:04.229> the<00:05:04.350> margin<00:05:04.620> and<00:05:04.740> while<00:05:04.830> the

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
try to clear the margin and while the

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.710 
try to clear the margin and while the
patient's<00:05:05.280> asleep<00:05:05.610> instead<00:05:06.240> of<00:05:06.360> finding<00:05:06.630> out

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
patient's asleep instead of finding out

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.750 
patient's asleep instead of finding out
two<00:05:06.870> days<00:05:07.020> later<00:05:07.320> so<00:05:08.190> it<00:05:08.340> gives<00:05:08.490> us<00:05:08.639> an

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
two days later so it gives us an

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.640 
two days later so it gives us an
advantage<00:05:08.850> and<00:05:09.360> younger<00:05:09.660> patients<00:05:10.080> we're

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
advantage and younger patients we're

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.530 
advantage and younger patients we're
looking<00:05:10.889> at<00:05:10.979> about<00:05:11.070> 15<00:05:11.669> minutes<00:05:12.090> actually

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
looking at about 15 minutes actually

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.480 
looking at about 15 minutes actually
they're<00:05:13.229> really<00:05:13.410> really<00:05:13.770> good<00:05:13.919> about<00:05:14.100> calling

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
they're really really good about calling

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.129 
they're really really good about calling
us<00:05:14.700> back<00:05:14.880> so<00:05:15.120> they<00:05:15.210> really<00:05:15.510> have<00:05:15.780> to<00:05:15.900> wait

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
us back so they really have to wait

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:43.619 
us back so they really have to wait
while<00:05:16.800> we're<00:05:17.010> doing<00:05:17.130> this

you<00:06:43.990> do<00:06:44.139> this<00:06:44.319> surgery<00:06:44.590> you<00:06:44.800> have<00:06:44.889> to<00:06:45.009> totally

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
you do this surgery you have to totally

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.559 
you do this surgery you have to totally
remove<00:06:45.460> the<00:06:45.639> prostate<00:06:46.090> so<00:06:46.120> you<00:06:46.300> literally

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:46.569 
remove the prostate so you literally

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:48.330 
remove the prostate so you literally
disconnect<00:06:47.409> the<00:06:47.530> bladder<00:06:47.770> from<00:06:48.009> the<00:06:48.159> prostate

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340

bladder and urinal disconnected and you

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.920 
bladder and urinal disconnected and you
have<00:06:56.500> to<00:06:56.620> hook<00:06:56.949> that<00:06:57.159> back<00:06:57.340> up<00:06:57.659> at<00:06:58.659> the<00:06:58.719> end<00:06:58.810> of

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
have to hook that back up at the end of

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.110 
have to hook that back up at the end of
the<00:06:58.990> procedure<00:06:59.259> and<00:07:00.159> that<00:07:00.190> again<00:07:00.639> is<00:07:00.699> a<00:07:00.819> plus

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
the procedure and that again is a plus

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.879 
the procedure and that again is a plus
for<00:07:01.150> the<00:07:01.900> robot<00:07:02.199> because<00:07:02.440> of<00:07:02.770> the

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889 
for the robot because of the

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.709 
for the robot because of the
visualization<00:07:03.250> we<00:07:03.610> need<00:07:03.729> a<00:07:03.789> very<00:07:04.090> accurate

00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:04.719 
visualization we need a very accurate

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:06.779 
visualization we need a very accurate
and<00:07:05.259> esta<00:07:05.560> Moses<00:07:05.860> and<00:07:06.099> the<00:07:06.219> quicker<00:07:06.430> and<00:07:06.729> that

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:06.789 
and esta Moses and the quicker and that

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:08.189 
and esta Moses and the quicker and that
enables<00:07:07.180> to<00:07:07.240> get<00:07:07.419> the<00:07:07.479> catheters<00:07:07.870> out<00:07:07.930> quicker

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199 
enables to get the catheters out quicker

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:10.860 
enables to get the catheters out quicker
in<00:07:08.680> five<00:07:08.979> to<00:07:09.130> seven<00:07:09.430> days<00:07:09.460> instead<00:07:10.270> for<00:07:10.719> used

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:10.870 
in five to seven days instead for used

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.019 
in five to seven days instead for used
to<00:07:10.960> leave<00:07:11.229> them<00:07:11.349> two<00:07:11.469> to<00:07:11.590> three<00:07:11.770> weeks<00:07:12.029> now

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:13.029 
to leave them two to three weeks now

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:14.740 
to leave them two to three weeks now
it's<00:07:13.210> snow

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:14.750 
it's snow

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.020 
it's snow
initially<00:07:15.650> one<00:07:15.890> of<00:07:15.980> the<00:07:16.070> criticisms<00:07:16.400> of<00:07:16.970> the

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.030 
initially one of the criticisms of the

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.570 
initially one of the criticisms of the
robotic<00:07:17.780> approach<00:07:17.990> was<00:07:18.320> it<00:07:18.710> was<00:07:18.830> longer<00:07:19.070> cost

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:19.580 
robotic approach was it was longer cost

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.850 
robotic approach was it was longer cost
more<00:07:19.850> and<00:07:19.970> longer<00:07:20.090> you<00:07:20.840> know<00:07:20.900> and<00:07:21.260> that<00:07:21.770> was

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:21.860 
more and longer you know and that was

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.190 
more and longer you know and that was
true<00:07:22.100> early<00:07:22.580> on<00:07:22.760> but<00:07:23.000> as<00:07:23.210> as<00:07:23.450> you<00:07:23.810> mature<00:07:23.990> and

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:24.200 
true early on but as as you mature and

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.440 
true early on but as as you mature and
the<00:07:24.290> procedure<00:07:24.620> and<00:07:24.890> do<00:07:25.310> more<00:07:25.580> of<00:07:25.640> them<00:07:25.820> your

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:26.450 
the procedure and do more of them your

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.230 
the procedure and do more of them your
time<00:07:26.660> steadily<00:07:27.260> come<00:07:27.740> down<00:07:27.950> and<00:07:28.670> to<00:07:28.940> the<00:07:29.060> point

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 
time steadily come down and to the point

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.330 
time steadily come down and to the point
now<00:07:29.360> the<00:07:29.420> operative<00:07:30.080> times<00:07:30.440> are<00:07:30.740> really<00:07:31.100> the

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:31.340 
now the operative times are really the

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.180 
now the operative times are really the
same<00:07:31.580> or<00:07:32.060> even<00:07:32.300> a<00:07:32.450> little<00:07:32.570> quicker<00:07:33.010> than<00:07:34.010> the

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.190 
same or even a little quicker than the

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.240 
same or even a little quicker than the
open<00:07:34.550> route<00:07:34.730> and<00:07:35.330> when<00:07:35.480> we<00:07:35.570> do<00:07:35.690> it<00:07:35.870> so<00:07:36.250> so

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:37.250 
open route and when we do it so so

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.550 
open route and when we do it so so
that's<00:07:37.430> evolved<00:07:38.110> because<00:07:39.110> of<00:07:39.230> surgical

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560 
that's evolved because of surgical

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.800 
that's evolved because of surgical
experience<00:07:39.680> that<00:07:40.460> we<00:07:41.060> can<00:07:41.210> do<00:07:41.300> them<00:07:41.450> quicker

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:41.810 
experience that we can do them quicker

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.670 
experience that we can do them quicker
but<00:07:42.740> with<00:07:42.890> higher<00:07:43.040> quality<00:07:43.810> so<00:07:44.810> that's<00:07:45.440> been<00:07:45.650> a

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 
but with higher quality so that's been a

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.540 
but with higher quality so that's been a
byproduct<00:07:46.100> of<00:07:46.430> the<00:07:47.060> experience
