pin<00:00:44.149> cellos<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.329> become<00:00:45.629> more<00:00:46.430> elevated

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
pin cellos have become more elevated

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.490 
pin cellos have become more elevated
with<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> cello<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.510> does<00:00:48.719> change<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.230> sound

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
with the cello it does change the sound

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.130 
with the cello it does change the sound
of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> cello<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> little<00:00:50.700> drier<00:00:51.020> perhaps<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
of the cello to a little drier perhaps a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.799 
of the cello to a little drier perhaps a
little<00:00:52.260> thinner<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.489> eventually<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.420> think<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
little thinner but eventually I think of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.660 
little thinner but eventually I think of
more<00:00:54.960> projecting<00:00:55.410> sound<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.489> there<00:00:56.610> are

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
more projecting sound and there are

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.340 
more projecting sound and there are
certain<00:00:56.940> other<00:00:57.030> advantages<00:00:57.690> number<00:00:58.050> one<00:00:58.230> of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
certain other advantages number one of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.209 
certain other advantages number one of
course<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.270> ability<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> bow<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.890> live

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
course is the ability of the bow to live

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.759 
course is the ability of the bow to live
or<00:01:02.489> spring<00:01:03.019> more<00:01:04.019> easily<00:01:04.290> by<00:01:04.439> using<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
or spring more easily by using the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.340 
or spring more easily by using the
weight<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.210> arm<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.570> also<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
weight of the arm and also the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.710 
weight of the arm and also the
accessibility<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> upper<00:01:08.520> positions<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
accessibility of the upper positions the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.200 
accessibility of the upper positions the
hands<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.200> fill<00:01:10.590> pretty<00:01:11.549> much<00:01:11.700> straight<00:01:12.090> in

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
hands can fill pretty much straight in

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.000 
hands can fill pretty much straight in
front<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.630> want<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.049> piano<00:01:13.260> keyboard

they<00:01:14.400> also<00:01:14.760> exert<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.630> downward<00:01:16.380> weight<00:01:17.100> of

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
they also exert the downward weight of

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.340 
they also exert the downward weight of
the<00:01:17.460> arm<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> upper<00:01:18.600> positions<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.170> course

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the arm on the upper positions of course

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.320 
the arm on the upper positions of course
one<00:01:19.560> doesn't<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.400> problem<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.210> law

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
one doesn't have that problem the law

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.780 
one doesn't have that problem the law
presumes<00:01:21.689> because<00:01:22.049> there's<00:01:22.320> some

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
presumes because there's some

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.039 
presumes because there's some
possibility<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.820> squeezing<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.570> thumb<00:01:24.810> but

possibility of squeezing the thumb but
up<00:01:25.200> here<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.590> course<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:26.009> all<00:01:26.750> vertical

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
up here of course it's all vertical

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.649 
at the tip into a more accessible
position<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.520> you'll<00:01:41.909> notice<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.240> if<00:01:42.540> I

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
position and you'll notice that if I

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.870 
position and you'll notice that if I
change<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.140> angle<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.590> cello<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.670> more

easier<00:01:56.249> and<00:01:56.520> much<00:01:56.789> more<00:01:56.999> relaxed<00:01:57.569> they<00:01:57.869> would

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
easier and much more relaxed they would

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.319 
easier and much more relaxed they would
play<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.039> tip<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.600> D<00:02:00.990> strings

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
play on the tip on the a and D strings

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.789 
play on the tip on the a and D strings
but<00:02:03.329> what's<00:02:03.509> important<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.170> terms<00:02:04.319> of<00:02:04.560> finding

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
but what's important in terms of finding

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.219 
but what's important in terms of finding
the<00:02:04.950> right<00:02:05.159> angle<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:06.420> comfort<00:02:06.959> and<00:02:07.079> security

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the right angle is comfort and security

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.710 
the right angle is comfort and security
with<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.950> legs<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.489> knees<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.090> do<00:02:09.479> want<00:02:09.660> to

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
with the legs and knees you do want to

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.990 
with the legs and knees you do want to
grip<00:02:09.929> your<00:02:09.959> cello<00:02:10.349> with<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.370> knees<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:11.970> that

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
grip your cello with the knees so that

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.089 
grip your cello with the knees so that
it's<00:02:12.299> stable<00:02:13.069> and<00:02:14.450> for<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.569> reason<00:02:15.629> I<00:02:16.290> many

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
it's stable and for that reason I many

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.890 
it's stable and for that reason I many
times<00:02:17.190> will<00:02:17.640> start<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.150> find<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.629> correct

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
times will start to find a correct

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.539 
times will start to find a correct
position<00:02:19.140> for<00:02:19.440> whatever<00:02:20.010> chair<00:02:20.370> I'm<00:02:20.519> sitting

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
position for whatever chair I'm sitting

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.330 
position for whatever chair I'm sitting
on<00:02:20.910> by<00:02:21.090> tricking<00:02:21.450> each<00:02:21.540> other<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.110> knees

on by tricking each other the knees

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.500 
on by tricking each other the knees
finding<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.430> comfortable<00:02:23.760> place<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.360> then

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
finding a comfortable place and then

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.470 
finding a comfortable place and then
lowering<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.110> MPM<00:02:25.610> in<00:02:26.610> order<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:27.000> support<00:02:27.329> the

lowering the MPM in order to support the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.309 
lowering the MPM in order to support the
cello<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.530> am<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.959> cellist<00:02:30.959> who<00:02:31.049> is<00:02:31.140> more

comfortable on lower chairs because when

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.520 
comfortable on lower chairs because when

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
you sit on a lower chair your knees seem

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.550 
you sit on a lower chair your knees seem
to<00:02:37.680> stick<00:02:37.920> out<00:02:38.099> farther<00:02:38.879> and<00:02:39.269> I<00:02:39.480> can<00:02:39.690> get<00:02:39.900> more

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
to stick out farther and I can get more

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.380 
to stick out farther and I can get more
of<00:02:40.620> an<00:02:40.739> angle<00:02:41.190> here<00:02:41.459> with<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.030> childhood

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
of an angle here with the childhood

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.000 
of an angle here with the childhood
cello<00:02:42.599> could<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.900> higher<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.170> can<00:02:43.530> still<00:02:43.769> grab

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
cello could be higher I can still grab

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.280 
cello could be higher I can still grab
it<00:02:44.190> with<00:02:44.730> my<00:02:44.910> knees<00:02:45.090> let's<00:02:45.629> see<00:02:45.780> if<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:45.959> take<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
it with my knees let's see if I take the

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.009 
it with my knees let's see if I take the
pillow<00:02:46.590> underneath<00:02:47.519> or<00:02:48.209> even<00:02:48.420> if<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.599> begin<00:02:48.870> to

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
pillow underneath or even if I begin to

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.330 
pillow underneath or even if I begin to
stand<00:02:49.260> up<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:50.489> knee<00:02:50.700> point<00:02:51.060> here<00:02:52.340> starts

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
stand up that the knee point here starts

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.190 
stand up that the knee point here starts
to<00:02:53.459> go<00:02:53.640> this<00:02:53.849> way<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.829> if<00:02:55.829> I'm<00:02:56.040> going<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.489> higher

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
to go this way so if I'm going to higher

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.470 
to go this way so if I'm going to higher
chair<00:02:58.200> like<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:58.620> my<00:02:59.609> knees<00:02:59.819> don't<00:03:00.000> stick<00:03:00.329> out

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
chair like this my knees don't stick out

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.930 
chair like this my knees don't stick out
quite<00:03:00.660> as<00:03:00.900> far<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.370> can't<00:03:02.639> get<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.910> angle

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
quite as far and I can't get the angle

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.059 
quite as far and I can't get the angle
of<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.599> cello<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.109> I<00:03:04.200> used<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.590> have<00:03:04.799> to<00:03:04.920> have

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
of the cello that I used to have to have

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.759 
of the cello that I used to have to have
it<00:03:05.160> more<00:03:05.340> vertical<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.419> so<00:03:06.989> then<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.590> makes

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
it more vertical and so then that makes

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.229 
it more vertical and so then that makes
me<00:03:07.950> more<00:03:08.160> uncomfortable<00:03:08.280> because<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:09.000> don't

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
me more uncomfortable because I don't

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.420 
me more uncomfortable because I don't
have<00:03:09.450> this<00:03:10.290> advantage<00:03:10.799> anymore<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.370> don't

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
have this advantage anymore and I don't

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.940 
have this advantage anymore and I don't
have<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.049> accessibility<00:03:13.049> of<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> upper

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
have the accessibility of the upper

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.339 
have the accessibility of the upper
position<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:14.579> I<00:03:14.609> prefer<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.569> find<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.200> lower

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
position so I prefer to find the lower

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.580 
position so I prefer to find the lower
chair<00:03:16.739> and<00:03:16.980> once<00:03:17.190> again<00:03:17.630> when<00:03:18.630> we<00:03:19.349> talk<00:03:19.560> about

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
chair and once again when we talk about

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.990 
chair and once again when we talk about
a<00:03:20.250> bending<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.599> lawn<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.579> this<00:03:23.579> by<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.819> way

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
a bending and a lawn and this by the way

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.110 
a bending and a lawn and this by the way
is<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.299> stall<00:03:24.599> hammer<00:03:24.930> variety<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:26.639> comes

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
is the stall hammer variety that comes

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.339 
is the stall hammer variety that comes
out<00:03:27.359> straight<00:03:27.720> use<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.440> straight<00:03:30.049> like<00:03:31.049> this

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
out straight use it straight like this

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.250 
out straight use it straight like this
or<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:33.060> can<00:03:33.239> pull<00:03:33.419> it<00:03:33.510> all<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.780> way<00:03:33.930> out<00:03:34.079> and

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
or you can pull it all the way out and

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.400 
or you can pull it all the way out and
slips<00:03:34.980> down<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.489> become<00:03:35.819> a<00:03:36.389> bent<00:03:36.900> pin<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:39.410> prefer

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
slips down to become a bent pin I prefer

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.729 
slips down to become a bent pin I prefer
the<00:03:41.069> angle<00:03:41.959> because<00:03:42.959> of<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.109> reasons<00:03:43.650> I

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
the angle because of the reasons I

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.520 
the angle because of the reasons I
mentioned<00:03:43.950> football<00:03:44.549> left

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
mentioned football left

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.930 
mentioned football left
accessibility<00:03:46.190> but<00:03:46.310> it's<00:03:46.460> important<00:03:46.910> to

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
accessibility but it's important to

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.730 
accessibility but it's important to
remember<00:03:47.180> that<00:03:47.330> it's<00:03:48.020> not<00:03:48.110> just<00:03:48.260> about

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
remember that it's not just about

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.920 
remember that it's not just about
putting<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.160> cello<00:03:49.400> up<00:03:49.670> high<00:03:49.910> if<00:03:50.420> I<00:03:50.570> put<00:03:50.810> the

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
putting the cello up high if I put the

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.980 
putting the cello up high if I put the
cello<00:03:51.170> up<00:03:51.380> too<00:03:51.590> high

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
cello up too high

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.750 
cello up too high
it<00:03:53.990> comes<00:03:54.530> out<00:03:54.800> of<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.040> range<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.370> my<00:03:55.550> knees

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
it comes out of the range of my knees

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.440 
it comes out of the range of my knees
this<00:03:56.570> comes<00:03:56.930> too<00:03:57.440> high<00:03:57.650> this<00:03:58.520> becomes<00:03:59.000> a

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
this comes too high this becomes a

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.199 
this comes too high this becomes a
little<00:03:59.930> bit<00:04:00.080> out<00:04:00.350> of<00:04:00.380> range<00:04:00.860> back<00:04:01.310> here<00:04:01.730> and

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
little bit out of range back here and

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.060 
little bit out of range back here and
also<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.750> upper<00:04:02.870> positions<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:03.590> have<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:03.890> reach

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
also the upper positions I have to reach

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.250 
also the upper positions I have to reach
up<00:04:04.100> higher<00:04:04.490> in<00:04:04.730> order<00:04:04.940> to<00:04:05.060> press<00:04:05.300> them<00:04:05.510> so<00:04:06.110> the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
up higher in order to press them so the

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.080 
up higher in order to press them so the
idea<00:04:06.709> is<00:04:07.010> not<00:04:07.310> going<00:04:07.520> to<00:04:07.580> make<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:07.820> cello

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
idea is not going to make the cello

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.080 
idea is not going to make the cello
higher<00:04:08.600> more<00:04:09.140> like<00:04:09.320> this<00:04:09.590> for<00:04:09.890> example<00:04:10.340> but

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
higher more like this for example but

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.070 
higher more like this for example but
simply<00:04:11.630> to<00:04:11.660> get<00:04:12.020> the<00:04:12.290> angle<00:04:13.010> of<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.340> cello

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
simply to get the angle of the cello

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.069 
simply to get the angle of the cello
change<00:04:15.400> from<00:04:16.400> being<00:04:16.670> more<00:04:16.880> vertical<00:04:17.420> to<00:04:17.900> more

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
change from being more vertical to more

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.740 
change from being more vertical to more
horizontal<00:04:18.769> so<00:04:19.400> find<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.359> right<00:04:20.540> position

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
horizontal so find the right position

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.500 
horizontal so find the right position
whether<00:04:21.440> it<00:04:21.590> is<00:04:21.709> straight<00:04:22.070> or<00:04:22.310> bent<00:04:22.460> in<00:04:22.760> that

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
whether it is straight or bent in that

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.450 
whether it is straight or bent in that
you<00:04:23.690> can<00:04:23.870> get<00:04:24.080> your<00:04:24.650> knees<00:04:24.890> on<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.220> cello

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
you can get your knees on the cello

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.909 
you can get your knees on the cello
securely<00:04:25.970> but<00:04:26.540> also<00:04:26.960> find<00:04:27.260> a<00:04:27.380> position<00:04:27.800> that

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
securely but also find a position that

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.280 
securely but also find a position that
is<00:04:28.070> enough<00:04:28.370> angle<00:04:28.730> you<00:04:29.600> can<00:04:29.810> play<00:04:29.960> comfortably

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
is enough angle you can play comfortably

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.310 
is enough angle you can play comfortably
on<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.919> tip<00:04:31.340> of<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.730> bow<00:04:31.910> without<00:04:32.750> raising

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
on the tip of the bow without raising

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.620 
on the tip of the bow without raising
your<00:04:33.500> arm<00:04:33.620> very<00:04:33.680> high<00:04:34.220> without<00:04:35.180> feeling

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
your arm very high without feeling

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.630 
your arm very high without feeling
you're<00:04:35.780> reaching<00:04:36.140> this<00:04:36.260> way<00:04:36.500> and<00:04:36.770> so<00:04:37.340> that<00:04:37.520> the

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
you're reaching this way and so that the

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.820 
you're reaching this way and so that the
upper<00:04:37.820> positions<00:04:38.390> feel<00:04:38.690> as<00:04:38.930> accessible<00:04:39.620> and

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
upper positions feel as accessible and

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.110 
upper positions feel as accessible and
as<00:04:40.250> comfortable<00:04:40.730> as<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.390> lower<00:04:41.570> positions
