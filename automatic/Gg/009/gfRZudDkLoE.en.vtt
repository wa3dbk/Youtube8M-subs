00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:03.460
 hi there, this is a flix specifically for may 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.180
 school poker stars 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.810
 see the fourth part of the distribution series 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.310
 of the day 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.420
 where I tell you how to make an opponent 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.929
 bluff 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.059
 at the table for six people big 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.480
 blind 25 cents those finding stus king 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.470
 variegated 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.380
 in this hand we understand very 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.859
 strong hand 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.409
 and here I probably did not get an opponent 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.089
 since decided to provoke him on 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.439
 bluff 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.859
 see what happened 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.100
 I found a raisom button answered 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.990
 mustache aggressive player on small 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.740
 the blind did add up 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.800
 and I decided to make 4 b 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.950
 because 100 scaroni want to be alone on 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.300
 You are the one loaves since the distribution 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.600
 and survive and rival to the maximum 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.950
 considering how widely it requires 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.310
 he replied 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.730
 since the opponent responded to 4 combat with 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.650
 I think his hand is weaker than mine 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.930
 steam pockets 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.160
 in general, we are pretty good against this 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.850
 range 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.930
 yelling yet I would not have thought would have started preflop 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.780
 and in the photo we can say nat eldest 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.730
 couple with older Klitschko 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.890
 the first thing I started to think how to get 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.390
 to the maximum 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.590
 I made a small bid about a third 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.300
 bank 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.950
 yes, the opportunity to answer 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.910
 not only a chair but also hands weaker 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.730
 and in such situations, the Duma is better to put 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.439
 few 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.119
 to provoke him on pants or coke 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.119
 slovenia 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.560
 in the photo he answered and I decided that in his 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.359
 very weak hand range 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:43.359
 so on the turn I and others whom 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.420
 on the price of the distribution now think better 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.750
 it would be more flop 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.020
 accordingly, the bank would be more simple 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.300
 and the money would be less and then on 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.220
 a religious matter play us like 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.550
 although I can now faked m 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.460
 but I decided that he might have hands 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.530
 let's say there are 10 pocket tens 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.929
 maybe even sad thing like that 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.689
 or even 9 10 suited 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.790
 although in most cases he will have 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.789
 okay 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:16.729
 and I'm still not sure which solution 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.729
 the game is better cola and its online 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:26.919
 but in this case the opponent decided 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:28.529
 turn ballet is nothing but 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:29.899
 pocket data
