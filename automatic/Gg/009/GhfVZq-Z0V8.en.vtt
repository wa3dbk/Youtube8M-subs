00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.110 

at<00:00:03.480> first<00:00:03.870> and<00:00:04.140> then<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:04.950> it<00:00:05.220> like<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.520> have<00:00:05.880> to

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
at first and then is it like I have to

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.290 
at first and then is it like I have to
do<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.890> well<00:00:07.890> it<00:00:07.950> depends<00:00:08.280> upon<00:00:08.370> weeds<00:00:08.880> is

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
do that well it depends upon weeds is

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.440 
do that well it depends upon weeds is
striving<00:00:10.370> see<00:00:11.370> how<00:00:11.460> happy<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.850> sled<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.120> on<00:00:12.270> me

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
striving see how happy the sled is on me

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.180 
striving see how happy the sled is on me
but<00:00:12.600> if<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.720> tend<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.960> step<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.830> take<00:00:14.010> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
but if you tend to step in and take the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.460 
but if you tend to step in and take the
strike<00:00:14.460> then<00:00:17.990> maybe<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.140> will<00:00:19.259> make<00:00:19.439> no

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
strike then maybe it will make no

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.859 
strike then maybe it will make no
difference<00:00:19.919> so<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.179> to<00:00:21.359> be<00:00:21.449> able<00:00:21.599> to

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
difference so you can have to be able to

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.779 
difference so you can have to be able to
judge<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:23.249> he's<00:00:23.460> doing<00:00:23.609> that

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
judge that but he's doing that

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.279 
judge that but he's doing that
stationary<00:00:24.329> someone<00:00:24.810> should<00:00:24.929> have<00:00:25.050> some<00:00:25.259> idea

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
stationary someone should have some idea

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.479 
stationary someone should have some idea
of<00:00:25.999> where<00:00:26.999> you've<00:00:27.210> gotta<00:00:27.359> stand<00:00:27.659> ok<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
of where you've gotta stand ok this is a

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.579 
of where you've gotta stand ok this is a
spatial<00:00:30.089> awareness<00:00:30.210> exercise<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.109> strike<00:00:31.409> out

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
spatial awareness exercise to strike out

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.040 
spatial awareness exercise to strike out
towards<00:00:31.890> me<00:00:31.919> just<00:00:32.009> leave<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.400> here<00:00:32.550> yeah

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
towards me just leave in here yeah

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.189 
towards me just leave in here yeah
that's<00:00:34.050> where<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.560> dangerous<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.160> me<00:00:36.199> if

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
that's where it's dangerous for me if

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:38.510 
that's where it's dangerous for me if
I'm<00:00:37.440> standing<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.980> either<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.489> be

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
I'm standing and either can that be

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:48.410 
I'm standing and either can that be
dangerous<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.030> me<00:00:46.879> who<00:00:47.879> thinks<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.269> is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
dangerous for me who thinks this is

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.360 
dangerous for me who thinks this is
dangerous<00:00:48.629> come<00:00:49.019> with<00:00:49.199> my<00:00:49.320> finger<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.890> who

this hand just if I can't get this to

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.920 
this hand just if I can't get this to
happen<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:46.000> doesn't<00:02:46.390> matter<00:02:46.540> because<00:02:46.690> I'm

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
just going to go to go around if I can't

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.520 
just going to go to go around if I can't
bring<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.820> elbow<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.150> me<00:02:49.420> then<00:02:50.019> I'll<00:02:50.170> don't

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
bring the elbow to me then I'll don't

00:02:50.530 --> 00:03:12.559 
bring the elbow to me then I'll don't
bring<00:02:50.680> myself<00:02:51.370> to

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.960 

and<00:03:13.569> then<00:03:13.750> you<00:03:13.870> can't<00:03:14.140> give<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:14.980> you're<00:03:15.849> going

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
and then you can't give it you're going

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.539 
and then you can't give it you're going
to<00:03:16.060> get<00:03:16.180> something<00:03:16.690> so<00:03:17.110> here<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:17.920> might<00:03:18.190> even<00:03:18.370> go

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
to get something so here I might even go

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.960 
to get something so here I might even go
back<00:03:19.420> this<00:03:20.079> might<00:03:20.319> be<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.769> good<00:03:21.519> idea

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
back this might be a good idea

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.729 
back this might be a good idea
I'm<00:03:22.180> an<00:03:22.329> anomaly<00:03:22.540> with<00:03:22.810> an<00:03:22.930> operation<00:03:23.500> on<00:03:23.590> and

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
I'm an anomaly with an operation on and

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.530 
I'm an anomaly with an operation on and
again<00:03:23.950> this<00:03:24.459> is<00:03:24.640> not<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:24.819> static<00:03:25.090> thing<00:03:25.269> it

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
again this is not a static thing it

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.640 
again this is not a static thing it
doesn't<00:03:25.690> check<00:03:25.959> here<00:03:26.200> in<00:03:26.349> stop<00:03:27.930> okay<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.500> has

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
doesn't check here in stop okay this has

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.559 
doesn't check here in stop okay this has
told<00:03:29.890> me<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.040> lot<00:03:30.280> of<00:03:30.340> customers<00:03:31.090> they<00:03:31.389> let<00:03:31.480> me

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
told me a lot of customers they let me

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.319 
told me a lot of customers they let me
