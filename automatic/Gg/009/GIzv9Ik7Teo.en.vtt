00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello welcome to atlas 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.649
 I do not show any kitchen today 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.150
 Moroccan recipe but dedicated to it 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.550
 I still give you something out of the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.349
 oriental kitchen and that is what I show 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.030
 today how to prepare filled 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.390
 cheers apple is about 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.070
 oriental dumplings 100% 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.170
 Vegetarians are the origin of this 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.760
 court is not yet clear but 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.490
 My guess is that the fried ones 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.439
 dumplings originating from Egypt and from there 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.599
 spread out into the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.219
 other parts of north africa as well as in the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.200
 Middle and middle east 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.329
 but also in germany is lost 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.010
 now frequently encountered and offers 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.500
 at snack stands a vegetarian 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.660
 alternative to the fast food dishes 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.760
 and you can also enjoy this tasty dish 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.039
 itself super fast and fresh 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.200
 prepare at home and which ingredients 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.370
 I need you to show them for that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.370
 now immediately in connection 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.020
 it takes just under a kilo 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.180
 Chickpeas I have one night 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.760
 long soaked in water four 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.020
 leek onions two normal onions 3 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.210
 garlic cloves a small bunch 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.290
 Coriander a well heaped teaspoon 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:17.750
 Coriander powder lure something crooked 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:24.110
 all teaspoons salt 1 heaped 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:26.830
 teaspoon caraway and three tablespoons 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.830
 sesame 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.840
 First, I cut the ingredients in 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.850
 rough pieces so i better serve them 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.200
 Mixer can chop for leave 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.820
 it is basically enough if the 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.220
 chickpeas soaked in water only 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.409
 they do not have to be cooked and 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.479
 If you like it fast you can chickpeas 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.040
 take the dose there already vorgart 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.399
 you can also be used immediately 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.399
 become 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.140
 the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.650
 after I have the ingredients small 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.450
 cut very small real in 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.670
 Mix with the chickpeas in one 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.530
 Blender until you are almost touched 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.269
 So no rough pieces in the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.230
 otherwise they will not let each other 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.760
 good before 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.290
 I'll add the spices first 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.480
 So here they are 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.489
 Chickpeas nicely disguised as one 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.920
 can see and in this mass I give 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.819
 Now add the spices and knead everything 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.819
 very good 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.049
 after kneading, I shape them 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.310
 small ones and then press that 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.140
 slightly flat 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.180
 But you can also do it around in such a way 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.950
 which shape and then in 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.950
 Fry plenty of oil 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.590
 the 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.590
 because 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.359
 is run often with a meaning 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.459
 served fine sesame paste and how to 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.680
 to ready I'll tell you now 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.350
 I'll give you six tablespoons for that 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.419
 Natural yoghurt in a bowl for ten 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.190
 tablespoon of sesame paste a pressed 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.500
 garlic clove and a bit 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.180
 add lemon juice and listen to everything 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.180
 good by a whisk 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.160
 it arises as you can see one 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.960
 broad consistency to this I give now 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.820
 Still a good shot water pulled 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.820
 to make it a little more fluid 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.500
 if the falafel can be baked 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.030

 Arab beat pro together with 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.130

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.750
