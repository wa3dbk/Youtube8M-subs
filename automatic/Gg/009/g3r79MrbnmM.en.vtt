00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.350 

the<00:00:10.889> antibiotic<00:00:11.639> concept<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.570> complex<00:00:13.049> one

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
the antibiotic concept is a complex one

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.620 
the antibiotic concept is a complex one
there<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.599> certainly<00:00:16.109> evidence<00:00:16.670> that<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:18.240> some

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
there is certainly evidence that in some

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.980 
there is certainly evidence that in some
circumstances<00:00:19.820> some<00:00:20.820> IBS<00:00:21.300> patients<00:00:21.330> will

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
circumstances some IBS patients will

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.900 
circumstances some IBS patients will
improve<00:00:22.289> at<00:00:22.500> least<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.920> short-term<00:00:23.250> with

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
improve at least in the short-term with

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.150 
improve at least in the short-term with
antibiotic<00:00:24.480> therapy<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.529> response<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.039> not

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
antibiotic therapy the response is not

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.919 
antibiotic therapy the response is not
dramatic<00:00:26.310> now<00:00:27.269> if<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.800> accept<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.929> there's

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
dramatic now if you accept that there's

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.870 
dramatic now if you accept that there's
some<00:00:31.140> action<00:00:32.009> there<00:00:32.160> are<00:00:32.219> some<00:00:32.430> activity

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
some action there are some activity

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.680 
some action there are some activity
there<00:00:33.170> what<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.410> doing<00:00:35.360> some<00:00:36.360> would<00:00:36.510> say

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
there what is it doing some would say

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.970 
there what is it doing some would say
that<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.170> back<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.350> your<00:00:37.559> local<00:00:37.739> growth

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
that this is back to your local growth

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.220 
that this is back to your local growth
in<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.160> small<00:00:38.399> intestine<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.180> would<00:00:39.809> contend

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
in the small intestine I would contend

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.720 
in the small intestine I would contend
that<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:41.309> number<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.579> IBS<00:00:41.940> patients<00:00:41.969> who<00:00:42.540> have

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
that the number of IBS patients who have

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.279 
that the number of IBS patients who have
truly<00:00:44.730> verified<00:00:45.329> bacterial<00:00:45.780> overgrowth<00:00:45.840> is

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
truly verified bacterial overgrowth is

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.799 
truly verified bacterial overgrowth is
probably<00:00:46.590> rather<00:00:46.800> small<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.120> still<00:00:48.629> an

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
probably rather small but it's still an

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:49.310 
probably rather small but it's still an
issue

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
issue

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.840 
issue
so<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> may<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.129> small<00:00:50.399> group<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.670> patients

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
so the may be a small group of patients

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.910 
so the may be a small group of patients
who<00:00:51.239> truly<00:00:51.870> back<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.170> your<00:00:52.260> local<00:00:52.440> growth<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
who truly back to your local growth and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.799 
who truly back to your local growth and
they<00:00:53.699> would<00:00:53.879> certainly<00:00:54.090> benefit<00:00:54.570> meant

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
they would certainly benefit meant

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.810 
they would certainly benefit meant
violence<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.920> would<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.489> see<00:00:56.640> that

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
violence but I would like to see that

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.020 
violence but I would like to see that
program<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:59.010> I'd<00:00:59.160> also<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.730> see

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
program and I'd also like to see

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.330 
program and I'd also like to see
follow-up<00:01:00.750> data<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.230> show<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> response

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
follow-up data to show that the response

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.359 
follow-up data to show that the response
correlates<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.000> improving<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> overgrowth

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
correlates with improving the overgrowth

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.130 
correlates with improving the overgrowth
whether<00:01:05.369> they<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.119> call<00:01:06.330> those<00:01:06.510> IVF<00:01:06.960> is

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
whether they you can call those IVF is

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.700 
whether they you can call those IVF is
another<00:01:07.380> question<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.510> some<00:01:09.710> early

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
another question is this some early

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.820 
another question is this some early
stage<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.340> more<00:01:12.439> classical<00:01:13.439> multimers

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
stage of a more classical multimers

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.710 
stage of a more classical multimers
disorder<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.430> sooth<00:01:14.670> obstruction<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.509> don't

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
disorder like sooth obstruction we don't

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.510 
disorder like sooth obstruction we don't
know<00:01:15.810> yet<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.200> could<00:01:16.380> be<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.130> certainly<00:01:17.310> I

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
know yet it could be but certainly I

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.580 
know yet it could be but certainly I
think<00:01:17.549> that's<00:01:17.880> an<00:01:17.970> appealing<00:01:18.330> concept<00:01:18.750> so

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
think that's an appealing concept so

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.190 
think that's an appealing concept so
then<00:01:19.770> we're<00:01:19.950> left<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.689> all<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> people<00:01:22.110> who

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
then we're left with all the people who

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.520 
then we're left with all the people who
respond<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.790> would<00:01:24.060> contend<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.750> at

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
respond and I would contend that at

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.929 
respond and I would contend that at
least<00:01:25.710> some<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.220> response<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.759> not

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
least some of that response is not

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.340 
least some of that response is not
actually<00:01:27.240> raised<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.570> fact<00:01:27.720> your<00:01:27.869> growth<00:01:28.259> is

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
actually raised in fact your growth is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.230 
actually raised in fact your growth is
probably<00:01:28.590> related<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.220> changes<00:01:30.119> you're

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
probably related to changes you're

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.160 
probably related to changes you're
making<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.409> flora<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> colon<00:01:33.170> because

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
making in the flora in the colon because

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.200 
making in the flora in the colon because
we<00:01:34.470> know<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.340> colonic<00:01:35.579> Flora's<00:01:36.000> first

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
we know that the colonic Flora's first

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.390 
we know that the colonic Flora's first
of<00:01:36.329> all<00:01:36.420> much<00:01:36.630> more<00:01:36.840> abundant<00:01:37.220> secondly<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
of all much more abundant secondly the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.130 
of all much more abundant secondly the
changes<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> flora<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.689> lead<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.990> more

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
changes in the flora can lead to more

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.069 
changes in the flora can lead to more
gas<00:01:40.829> production<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.820> lead<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.570> changes<00:01:42.600> in

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
gas production can lead to changes in

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.929 
gas production can lead to changes in
student<00:01:43.290> form<00:01:43.680> etc<00:01:43.799> etc<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.670> makes<00:01:44.850> sense

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
student form etc etc so it makes sense

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.359 
student form etc etc so it makes sense
we'd<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.329> disrupted<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:47.220> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
we'd be disrupted and we get you you

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.929 
we'd be disrupted and we get you you
make<00:01:47.520> us<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.820> dramatic<00:01:47.939> improvements<00:01:48.570> I

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
make us in dramatic improvements I

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.899 
make us in dramatic improvements I
regard<00:01:50.939> antibiotic<00:01:51.780> therapy<00:01:52.100> in<00:01:53.100> this

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
regard antibiotic therapy in this

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.270 
regard antibiotic therapy in this
scenario<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:56.420> shotgun<00:01:57.420> therapy

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
scenario as shotgun therapy

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.300 
scenario as shotgun therapy
and<00:01:58.850> I<00:01:59.980> would<00:02:00.980> like<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.610> use<00:02:02.450> probes<00:02:03.080> that<00:02:03.590> are

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
and I would like to use probes that are

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.820 
and I would like to use probes that are
much<00:02:04.670> more<00:02:04.970> subtle<00:02:05.270> than<00:02:06.170> it<00:02:06.320> directed

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
much more subtle than it directed

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.690 
much more subtle than it directed
against<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.220> specific<00:02:07.490> organisms<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.869> are

against the specific organisms that are

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.850 
against the specific organisms that are
causing<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.759> problem<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:12.410> replace

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
causing the problem and that replace

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.040 
causing the problem and that replace
them<00:02:13.130> with<00:02:13.640> organisms<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.750> are<00:02:14.900> more
