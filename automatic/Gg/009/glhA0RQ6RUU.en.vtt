00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.430
 but 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.600
 hello to all guys and welcome this 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.180
 very first tutorial a tutorial 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.590
 quite short focused on the farm 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.480
 of snow 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.550
 now I want to clarify immediately 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.250
 that this method is not mine 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.460
 invention is already widely used and me 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.850
 especially I saw him do it from upstairs 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.010
 realpower 1 youtuber I think you know 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.200
 all because of the type 120 thousand steps 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.200
 written and I saw it in the series 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.950
 minecraft ita and I decided to bring it back 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.960
 in the form of tutorials because many of 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.210
 you probably won't know how 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.370
 pick up the snow here I am here 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.960
 I'll probably get caught, too 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.600
 Captain, of course, I didn't know 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.610
 actually I was surprised 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 so let's start right away 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.199
 now as you can see I did this 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.740
 small pier and here is fine he made one 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.049
 small thing of small of my creation 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.210
 and why I did this because because 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.180
 create the snow steps you need to stay in 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.180
 a porthole but cold that like the ocean in 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.740
 this case and it is not possible to create in 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.300
 hot purple like the desert if you 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.220
 try creating a snowman 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.909
 Nebbiolo hot if I'm not mistaken it suffers 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.180
 they damage and die 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.650
 now what do you do to have a make 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:35.010
 infinite this what I'm doing 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.760
 me this here is a small alleyway of 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.100
 an invention 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.200
 in short, it is not one of which I am alone 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.390
 four wooden blocks with glass 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.340
 which allows me to enter more 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.070
 depth to be able to take even 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.229
 of the snowballs then how 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.570
 the snowman works on his 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.670
 passage as you can see generates 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.610
 of the snow keeping it locked in this 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.150
 point it will be possible to take snow 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.619
 to infinity because the snowman 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.570
 we will continue to create it we will not have to 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.630
 do nothing but hold the button 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.689
 left 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.020
 and each time the snow regenerates 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.900
 this is the fastest process I have 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.610
 I know to recover some snow like 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.530
 you can see we're catching one 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:23.080
 astronomical quantities and nothing this is 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.150
 the tutorial on how to have to do it by 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.849
 snow and in practically infinite i 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.069
 dropper snowmen have the le 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.110
 snowballs and we won't have to 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.069
 other than putting them in the inventory a 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.170
 blocks and we will thus have snow on snow snow 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.480
 on snow balls on balls 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.670
 yes i know i am ugly said so and so 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.680
 nothing this was a very small one 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.030
 tutorial as you can see I do not think 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.540
 will then be longer than I know how much i 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.880
 34 minutes I don't think and nothing 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.769
 the fastest method this takes a 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.660
 snowman obviously I hope that 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.360
 you all know how to seacraft a puppet of 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.079
 snow in case I show you here 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.450
 immediately are two blocks of snow plus the 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.549
 pumpkin head above and when the 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.829
 snowman will move as you can 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.410
 see it will leave snow that snow then 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.900
 you are going to break with with a ball 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.880
 a simple shovel nothing of that and nothing 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.609
 you can stay here until the ball does not 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.150
 you know route will recover infinite 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:27.160
 practically of snow it is very simple not 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.950
 it's nothing complicated it's something 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.840
 they can all do and I told you 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:38.590
 mind you that the puppet is 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.049
 in a cold biome because if you try to 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.459
 you will try to create them in a hot blog 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:48.519
 like the desert the puppet will die and yes 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.609
 you will find yourself in the snow but you will recover yes 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.959
 and no what you spent to create it 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.030
 when you create this between alley of 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.400
 I advise to put in the point where there 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.000
 I'm not creative now it's true 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.459
 what we are saying when you when 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.170
 you will believe this alley I recommend 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:12.370
 not to put any kind of wool 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.410
 material that splits easily with 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.540
 a shovel put some pil 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.959
 fresh maybe or this new one 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.850
 land type material exists and nothing I do 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.530
 I have also dwelt this too much 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.160
 tutorial wanted to be a tutorial 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.980
 simple a short tutorial tutorial 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.950
 coincided where I showed them how 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.630
 create as you create blocks of 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.910
 in the infinite as one takes the 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.890
 in the infinite and so on 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.020
 so if you liked this video 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.900
 left I like commented subscribe 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.100
 if you did not like it because you are not 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.500
 watching 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.390
 this guys said I probably 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.430
 I will also do tutorial closer 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.770
 challenging that this is really one 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.630
 bazzecola e niente 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.490
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.200
 I hope the most interesting right 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.060
 I hope I don't get insults at the fact 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.950
 which was known today is unfortunately in 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.600
 minecraft are not a rope and some 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.550
 things I like to discover the real plan 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.740
 having said that we jump together with the new 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.300
 crazy snow and we'll see each other at a 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.520
 next video, please remember 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.520
 I like the inscription of hi guys
