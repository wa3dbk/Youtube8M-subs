okay guys I'm going to show you the

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.879 
okay guys I'm going to show you the
famous<00:00:05.910> no-name<00:00:06.660> nod<00:00:06.930> or<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.290> Bristol<00:00:07.710> knot

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:07.889 
famous no-name nod or the Bristol knot

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:12.380 
famous no-name nod or the Bristol knot
which<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.849> used<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.840> tie<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:11.090> liter<00:00:12.090> of

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:12.390 
which is used to tie a liter of

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.429 
which is used to tie a liter of
monofilament<00:00:13.290> line<00:00:13.920> single<00:00:14.640> single<00:00:15.540> line<00:00:15.750> on

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 
monofilament line single single line on

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.620 
monofilament line single single line on
to<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:18.380> double<00:00:19.380> line<00:00:19.560> loop<00:00:19.919> it's<00:00:20.669> very<00:00:20.939> simple

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
to a double line loop it's very simple

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.319 
to a double line loop it's very simple
you<00:00:22.289> push<00:00:22.589> put<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.429> line<00:00:23.609> through<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.089> loop

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:24.329 
you push put the line through the loop

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.870 
you push put the line through the loop
pull<00:00:24.539> off<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.169> few<00:00:25.589> six<00:00:26.400> seven<00:00:26.669> eight<00:00:26.789> nine

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
pull off a few six seven eight nine

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.649 
pull off a few six seven eight nine
inches<00:00:27.390> or<00:00:27.569> so<00:00:27.749> and<00:00:28.579> here's<00:00:29.579> the<00:00:29.730> key<00:00:29.909> you<00:00:30.480> got

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:30.659 
inches or so and here's the key you got

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.630 
inches or so and here's the key you got
to<00:00:30.810> sort<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.140> keep<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.679> little<00:00:32.009> loop

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
to sort of keep this little loop

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.700 
to sort of keep this little loop
separated<00:00:33.360> here<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.899> can<00:00:34.050> put<00:00:34.200> your<00:00:34.350> finger

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
separated here you can put your finger

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.889 
separated here you can put your finger
through<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.010> or<00:00:35.730> pinch<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.149> off<00:00:36.269> but<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.719> see

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
through it or pinch it off but you see

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.080 
through it or pinch it off but you see
how<00:00:37.109> this<00:00:37.559> loop<00:00:37.859> is<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:38.640> keep<00:00:38.910> it

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
how this loop is on here just keep it

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.759 
how this loop is on here just keep it
and<00:00:39.329> then<00:00:39.809> you're<00:00:40.019> going<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.739> wrap<00:00:42.769> the

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
and then you're going to just wrap the

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:49.130 
and then you're going to just wrap the
line<00:00:44.010> around<00:00:44.989> four<00:00:45.989> or<00:00:46.079> five<00:00:46.260> times<00:00:47.929> okay<00:00:48.929> and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
line around four or five times okay and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.229 
line around four or five times okay and
then<00:00:49.649> put<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.039> back<00:00:50.070> through<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.820> loop<00:00:51.179> that

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
then put it back through this loop that

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.770 
then put it back through this loop that
you<00:00:51.690> made<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.079> beginning<00:00:52.399> okay<00:00:53.629> keep<00:00:54.629> it

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
you made at the beginning okay keep it

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.910 
you made at the beginning okay keep it
out<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:55.829> sort<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.190> pull<00:00:56.429> it<00:00:56.550> down<00:00:57.920> okay

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
out and then sort of pull it down okay

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.389 
out and then sort of pull it down okay
once<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.820> get<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.059> down<00:01:00.179> a<00:01:00.239> little<00:01:00.420> tight

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
once you get it down a little tight

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.080 
once you get it down a little tight
moisten<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.519> get<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> grip<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.100> pull<00:01:06.060> it

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
moisten it get a grip on it and pull it

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.140 
moisten it get a grip on it and pull it
down<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.660> see<00:01:10.160> makes<00:01:11.160> a<00:01:11.310> very<00:01:11.790> nice

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
down and you can see makes a very nice

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.480 
down and you can see makes a very nice
little<00:01:12.600> knot<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:16.770> know<00:01:16.920> you've<00:01:17.100> tied<00:01:17.340> it

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
little knot and you know you've tied it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.780 
little knot and you know you've tied it
right<00:01:17.670> when<00:01:17.940> this<00:01:18.450> tag<00:01:18.840> end<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.790> 90

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
right when this tag end here is 90

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.020 
right when this tag end here is 90
degrees<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.480> knot<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:23.250> then<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.790> clip

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
degrees to the knot and then just clip

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.090 
degrees to the knot and then just clip
this<00:01:24.210> off

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.260 

and<00:01:31.409> there<00:01:32.409> you<00:01:32.560> go<00:01:32.740> this<00:01:33.310> is<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.520> Bristol<00:01:34.090> not

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
and there you go this is the Bristol not

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.450 
and there you go this is the Bristol not
or<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.780> no<00:01:34.990> name<00:01:35.229> not<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:35.770> see<00:01:35.950> how<00:01:36.070> quick<00:01:36.310> it
