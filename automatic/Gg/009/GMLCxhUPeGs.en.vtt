00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.969
 You can easily help each one 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.190
 pack pampers with action logo will 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:19.110
 a vaccine dose against tetanus at 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.110
 newborn donated a unicef 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.290
 that is very important because tetanus is 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.150
 in newborns in developing countries 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.520
 still a big problem every year 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.900
 The 58,000 children die from this 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.900
 terrible infectious disease 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.019
 which was nice for me this time 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.210
 that I only have it and I have it with me 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.000
 He was able to watch as he did all over 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.309
 other world has responded and hope that 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.659
 he also meant that he was in something 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.659
 own life can take with it 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.110
 I'm in Miami three months ago 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.879
 were vaccinated against tetanus in one 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.340
 real hospital the real circle too 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.840
 see how the people here in laos themselves 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.840
 get vaccinated against tetanus 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.100
 So at the moment it is unfortunately still so 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.610
 that every nine minutes a child 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.610
 newborn destined 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.940
 in third world countries to put the 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.410
 Most children just against the dirty 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.450
 unhygienic conditions during the 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.190
 And that's why we're here 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.430
 women just before birth 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.430
 immunize 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.110
 it was actually me today 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.400
 partly on the sham of the girl 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.650
 Some people could actually watch 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.840
 now the third time because it needs 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.729
 Three vaccinations for an unborn child 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.070
 That's why it's important to protect 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.090
 that these women are of childbearing age 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.090
 to be protected 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.550
 Of course that was nice to see that 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.890
 although the whole health circumstances 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.600
 where people live here easy 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.800
 watch how much joy and traditions 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.970
 they just have and that I'm there 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.970
 that could be nice 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.630
 since 2006 the beginning of the community 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.060
 we have action from pampers and unicef 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.970
 already in eight countries besides tetanus 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.560
 Newborn eliminated and this year 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.560
 hopefully there will be nine countries left 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.750
 a great thing to see how much 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.680
 was achieved and how good which 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.680
 direction that everything goes 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.030
