awesome and sent me some more eggs to
try<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:11.280> I'm<00:00:11.550> going<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.700> tip<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.150> few<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.450> these

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
try so I'm going to tip a few of these

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.990 
try so I'm going to tip a few of these
in<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:13.139> little<00:00:13.410> pot<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:14.160> these<00:00:14.280> eggs<00:00:14.580> another

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
in a little pot so these eggs another

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.560 
in a little pot so these eggs another
tip<00:00:15.240> into<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.719> tub<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:17.640> tub<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.029> situated

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
tip into the tub and the tub is situated

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.359 
tip into the tub and the tub is situated
under<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> drainpipe<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.590> basically<00:00:20.039> all<00:00:20.250> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
under a drainpipe so basically all the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.400 
under a drainpipe so basically all the
rainwater<00:00:20.850> goes<00:00:21.330> along<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> garage<00:00:22.020> tips

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
rainwater goes along the garage tips

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.340 
rainwater goes along the garage tips
into<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.949> drain<00:00:23.460> pipe<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.970> down<00:00:24.390> into<00:00:25.199> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
into the drain pipe and down into the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.670 
into the drain pipe and down into the
tub<00:00:25.650> now<00:00:26.160> I'm<00:00:26.279> trying<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.730> simulate<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.680> natural

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
tub now I'm trying to simulate a natural

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.160 
tub now I'm trying to simulate a natural
way<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.130> these<00:00:29.340> eggs<00:00:29.730> will<00:00:29.910> hatch<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
way that these eggs will hatch so in the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.889 
way that these eggs will hatch so in the
wild<00:00:31.500> they<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.830> out<00:00:32.030> just<00:00:33.030> completely<00:00:33.660> dried

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
wild they be out just completely dried

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:34.940 
wild they be out just completely dried
out<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.230> they'll<00:00:34.320> wait<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.770> rain<00:00:34.920> to

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
out and they'll wait for the rain to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.010 
out and they'll wait for the rain to
come<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.550> there<00:00:35.730> must<00:00:35.850> be<00:00:36.000> enough<00:00:36.420> water<00:00:36.690> that

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
come and there must be enough water that

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.479 
come and there must be enough water that
they<00:00:37.170> know<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.410> they<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.890> live<00:00:38.190> and

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
they know that they can live and

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.990 
they know that they can live and
reproduce<00:00:39.320> for<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.680> little<00:00:41.399> while<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.910> they

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
reproduce for a little while so they

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.840 
reproduce for a little while so they
need<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.300> enough<00:00:42.750> water<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.260> there<00:00:43.500> I'm

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
need to have enough water in there I'm

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.729 
need to have enough water in there I'm
hoping<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.090> works<00:00:45.300> once<00:00:45.870> there's<00:00:46.530> enough

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
hoping this works once there's enough

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:47.060 
hoping this works once there's enough
water

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
water

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.680 
water
I<00:00:47.160> will<00:00:47.340> obviously<00:00:47.640> bring<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.390> actually

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
I will obviously bring in to actually

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.750 
I will obviously bring in to actually
warm<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:49.980> traps<00:00:50.309> eggs<00:00:50.489> are<00:00:50.640> really

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
warm it up but traps eggs are really

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.150 
warm it up but traps eggs are really
Hardy<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.390> actually<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:51.960> withstand<00:00:52.559> being

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
Hardy and actually can withstand being

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.150 
Hardy and actually can withstand being
really<00:00:53.579> cold<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.090> really<00:00:54.149> hot<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.440> hopefully

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
really cold and really hot so hopefully

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.130 
really cold and really hot so hopefully
this<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.030> start<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.840> will<00:00:57.870> all

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
this is just the start and it will all

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.720 
this is just the start and it will all
go<00:00:58.559> correctly<00:00:59.570> this<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.719> now<00:01:00.840> filled<00:01:01.109> up<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
go correctly this is now filled up and

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.109 
go correctly this is now filled up and
it's<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.789> lovely<00:01:03.180> tint<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.989> yellow<00:01:04.760> grouse

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
it's a lovely tint of the yellow grouse

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.270 
it's a lovely tint of the yellow grouse
so<00:01:06.780> now<00:01:06.990> I'm<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.439> put<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.650> underneath<00:01:07.950> a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
so now I'm going to put it underneath a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.899 
so now I'm going to put it underneath a
lamp<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.720> hopefully<00:01:10.170> hear<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.740> water<00:01:10.950> now

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
lamp and hopefully hear the water now

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.550 
lamp and hopefully hear the water now

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.230 
we're gonna wait and hope that for the
first<00:01:13.860> time<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> history<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.090> this

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
first time in the history of this

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.710 
first time in the history of this
channel<00:01:15.750> something<00:01:16.380> actually<00:01:16.650> hatches

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
channel something actually hatches

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:26.780

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.780 
okay guys so it's nearly 3:00 a.m. and I
couldn't<00:01:29.799> sleep<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.310> I<00:01:30.369> was<00:01:30.460> like<00:01:30.580> do<00:01:30.729> you

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
couldn't sleep and I was like do you

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.130 
couldn't sleep and I was like do you
know<00:01:30.880> why<00:01:30.970> I<00:01:31.000> haven't<00:01:31.150> checked<00:01:31.420> today<00:01:31.689> the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
know why I haven't checked today the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.550 
know why I haven't checked today the
tryouts<00:01:32.560> I<00:01:32.890> just<00:01:33.670> put<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.090> light<00:01:34.270> on<00:01:34.299> and<00:01:34.810> I

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
tryouts I just put the light on and I

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.460 
tryouts I just put the light on and I
have<00:01:36.009> seen<00:01:36.280> one<00:01:36.610> hatch<00:01:36.909> and<00:01:37.450> I'm<00:01:38.170> really

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
have seen one hatch and I'm really

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.930 
have seen one hatch and I'm really
hoping<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:38.830> is<00:01:38.920> actually<00:01:39.250> a<00:01:39.310> trial<00:01:39.610> because

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
hoping it is actually a trial because

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.539 
hoping it is actually a trial because
obviously<00:01:40.720> this<00:01:41.470> is<00:01:41.530> wearing<00:01:41.890> water<00:01:42.070> it<00:01:42.280> came

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
obviously this is wearing water it came

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.430 
obviously this is wearing water it came
through<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.880> drain<00:01:43.149> it<00:01:43.360> could<00:01:43.600> be<00:01:43.750> some<00:01:43.990> sort

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
through the drain it could be some sort

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.469 
through the drain it could be some sort
of<00:01:44.560> leash<00:01:44.770> but<00:01:45.280> I'm<00:01:45.369> pretty<00:01:45.640> short<00:01:45.970> as<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.119> trout

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
of leash but I'm pretty short as a trout

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:47.969 
of leash but I'm pretty short as a trout
so<00:01:46.630> I'm<00:01:46.690> gonna<00:01:46.810> try<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.080> get<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:47.289> in<00:01:47.380> focus<00:01:47.619> for

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
so I'm gonna try to get it in focus for

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.330 
so I'm gonna try to get it in focus for
you<00:01:48.039> guys<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:50.110> it<00:01:50.200> is<00:01:52.860> I'm<00:01:53.860> pretty<00:01:54.190> sure

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
you guys here it is I'm pretty sure

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.880
