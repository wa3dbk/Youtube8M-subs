about the destiny beta on xbox one guys
when<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.600> compare<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> playstation<00:01:29.220> 4

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
when I compare it to the playstation 4

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.450 
when I compare it to the playstation 4
version<00:01:29.490> there<00:01:30.060> are<00:01:30.210> some<00:01:30.510> differences<00:01:30.990> it

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
version there are some differences it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.430 
version there are some differences it
sort<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.550> feels<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:33.120> the<00:01:33.270> xbox<00:01:33.690> one<00:01:33.990> version

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
sort of feels like the xbox one version

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.130 
sort of feels like the xbox one version
has<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.890> tiny<00:01:35.430> frame<00:01:35.940> rate<00:01:36.180> problem<00:01:36.660> once<00:01:36.870> in<00:01:37.050> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
has a tiny frame rate problem once in a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.410 
has a tiny frame rate problem once in a
while<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:38.190> then<00:01:38.370> there's<00:01:38.580> moments<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.390> I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
while but then there's moments that I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.320 
while but then there's moments that I
feel<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.410> actually<00:01:40.980> faster<00:01:41.340> than<00:01:41.940> the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
feel like it's actually faster than the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.690 
feel like it's actually faster than the
playstation<00:01:43.020> 4<00:01:43.290> version<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:44.010> I<00:01:44.370> don't<00:01:44.550> know

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
playstation 4 version and I don't know

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.640 
playstation 4 version and I don't know
if<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.420> controller<00:01:46.020> that's<00:01:46.350> what

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
if it's just the controller that's what

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.890 
if it's just the controller that's what
I'm<00:01:46.770> suspecting<00:01:47.520> I'm<00:01:47.730> guessing<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
I'm suspecting I'm guessing that the

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.930 
I'm suspecting I'm guessing that the
xbox<00:01:49.350> one<00:01:49.620> controller<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.550> set<00:01:50.790> up

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
xbox one controller is just set up

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.270 
xbox one controller is just set up
better<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.480> shooters<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.080> it<00:01:52.200> feels<00:01:52.530> better

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
better for shooters and it feels better

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.610 
better for shooters and it feels better
but<00:01:53.940> I<00:01:54.000> don't<00:01:54.300> know<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.990> feels<00:01:55.410> more

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
but I don't know it just feels more

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.670 
but I don't know it just feels more
responsive<00:01:56.610> when<00:01:57.240> i'm<00:01:57.390> using<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> xbox<00:01:58.380> one

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
responsive when i'm using the xbox one

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.130 
responsive when i'm using the xbox one
controller<00:01:59.220> so<00:01:59.670> i'm<00:01:59.790> guessing<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.360> might<00:02:00.900> be

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
controller so i'm guessing that might be

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.290 
controller so i'm guessing that might be
why<00:02:01.410> it<00:02:01.470> feels<00:02:01.830> faster<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:02.730> I<00:02:02.760> don't<00:02:03.060> have<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
why it feels faster but I don't have a

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.870 
why it feels faster but I don't have a
frames<00:02:03.660> per<00:02:03.930> second<00:02:04.380> counter<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:04.920> my<00:02:05.070> xbox<00:02:05.400> one

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
frames per second counter on my xbox one

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.630 
frames per second counter on my xbox one
so<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.930> possible<00:02:07.230> that<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.950> frame<00:02:08.220> rate<00:02:08.429> is

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
so it is possible that the frame rate is

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.450 
so it is possible that the frame rate is
higher<00:02:09.090> than<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.560> playstation<00:02:11.190> 4

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
higher than it is on the playstation 4

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.580 
higher than it is on the playstation 4
version<00:02:11.490> or<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.210> an<00:02:12.330> unlocked<00:02:12.870> 30<00:02:13.260> frames

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
version or it's an unlocked 30 frames

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.330 
version or it's an unlocked 30 frames
per<00:02:13.710> second

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
per second

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.509 
per second
at<00:02:14.540> 900p<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:16.500> either<00:02:16.620> way<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.069> game<00:02:17.280> does

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
at 900p but either way the game does

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.600 
at 900p but either way the game does
feel<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:18.030> bit<00:02:18.060> faster<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.620> xbox<00:02:20.069> one<00:02:20.370> but

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
feel a bit faster on the xbox one but

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.300 
feel a bit faster on the xbox one but
not<00:02:20.910> by<00:02:21.150> much<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:22.200> graphics<00:02:22.500> look<00:02:23.040> almost

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
not by much the graphics look almost

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.119 
not by much the graphics look almost
exactly<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.180> same<00:02:24.330> as<00:02:24.810> they<00:02:25.050> should<00:02:25.349> at<00:02:25.530> 900p

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
exactly the same as they should at 900p

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.390 
exactly the same as they should at 900p
and<00:02:26.489> 1080p<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.330> PlayStation<00:02:28.050> 4<00:02:28.319> beta<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
and 1080p the PlayStation 4 beta the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.759 
and 1080p the PlayStation 4 beta the
reflections<00:02:30.180> off<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.840> water<00:02:31.110> or<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.470> bit

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
reflections off the water or a bit

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.339 
reflections off the water or a bit
better<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.370> definitely<00:02:33.030> does<00:02:33.420> look<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.959> tiny

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
better it definitely does look a tiny

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.039 
better it definitely does look a tiny
bit<00:02:34.650> better<00:02:34.860> on<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.280> PlayStation<00:02:35.940> 4<00:02:36.209> but<00:02:36.900> not

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
bit better on the PlayStation 4 but not

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.170 
bit better on the PlayStation 4 but not
by<00:02:37.290> much<00:02:37.500> at<00:02:37.739> all<00:02:37.890> but<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.519> do<00:02:38.640> see<00:02:39.060> that

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180
