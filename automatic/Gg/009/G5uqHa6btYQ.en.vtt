I<00:00:30.940> do<00:00:31.029> not<00:00:31.449> want<00:00:31.779> that<00:00:31.930> because<00:00:32.739> it's<00:00:33.010> scary

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
I do not want that because it's scary

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.189 
I do not want that because it's scary
they<00:00:33.670> could<00:00:33.820> be<00:00:33.940> really<00:00:34.180> pricey<00:00:34.480> so<00:00:34.809> why<00:00:35.020> not

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
they could be really pricey so why not

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.270 
they could be really pricey so why not
just<00:00:35.379> make<00:00:35.470> it<00:00:35.769> yourself

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
just make it yourself

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.640 
just make it yourself
so<00:00:36.610> I<00:00:36.670> decided<00:00:37.030> to<00:00:37.180> compile<00:00:37.780> a<00:00:37.809> few<00:00:38.350> shirt

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
so I decided to compile a few shirt

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.890 
so I decided to compile a few shirt
designs<00:00:39.040> that<00:00:39.280> I<00:00:39.400> think<00:00:39.640> I've<00:00:39.760> seen<00:00:40.059> on<00:00:40.300> tumblr

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
designs that I think I've seen on tumblr

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.020 
designs that I think I've seen on tumblr
but<00:00:41.470> with<00:00:41.680> the<00:00:41.830> twist<00:00:42.190> I<00:00:42.460> didn't<00:00:42.699> want<00:00:42.850> to<00:00:42.910> make

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
but with the twist I didn't want to make

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
but with the twist I didn't want to make
them<00:00:43.180> too<00:00:43.360> common<00:00:43.930> like<00:00:44.199> the<00:00:44.410> sideways<00:00:45.219> of

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
them too common like the sideways of

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.600 
them too common like the sideways of
pineapple<00:00:47.050> or<00:00:47.290> like<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.860> sleep<00:00:48.370> all<00:00:48.579> day

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
pineapple or like the sleep all day

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.250 
pineapple or like the sleep all day
you'd<00:00:49.059> all<00:00:49.210> say<00:00:49.390> something<00:00:49.450> like<00:00:49.989> that

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
you'd all say something like that

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.139 
you'd all say something like that
because<00:00:50.890> you've<00:00:51.610> probably<00:00:51.760> already<00:00:52.000> seen

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
because you've probably already seen

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.729 
because you've probably already seen
them<00:00:52.480> so<00:00:52.690> I<00:00:52.719> thought<00:00:52.930> I'd<00:00:53.050> bring<00:00:53.200> in<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.469> little

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
them so I thought I'd bring in a little

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.770 
them so I thought I'd bring in a little
bit<00:00:53.829> of<00:00:54.010> different<00:00:54.399> mixes<00:00:54.820> into<00:00:55.270> the<00:00:55.390> designs

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
bit of different mixes into the designs

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.900 
bit of different mixes into the designs
