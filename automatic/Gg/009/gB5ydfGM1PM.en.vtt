00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.380
 Good evening everyone like you can see the youtube 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:15.690
 I'm good at betting 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:19.080
 This week will be the preparation for the Flower Cup Hanshin Grand Prix Spring Stakes. 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:26.310
 I did it last week 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:28.330
 It wasn't a very pleasant dividend, so Gon is aiming to win the game 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.890
 I think I want to go 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.220
 There are 4 high prizes this week, so from a race with some confidence 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.260
 Anticipation 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:44.250
 I would like to offer free buyouts etc. 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.800
 So let's make betting easier this week 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:54.850
 Easy easy easy easy 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:58.010
 The 29th Flower Cup Nakayama Shiba 1800 m which has been done easy easy 3 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:02.050
 It becomes a race of 3-year-old mare 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:09.550
 This race is one of the most popular 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:13.690
 In particular, the horse that win has become less than 3.9 times within 3.9 times the past 10 years that the 4412 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:19.700
 It is a place that is at stake in most betting ticket 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:21.250
 Yes Another good running condition is the horse that the previous run has won 5 million conditions 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.580
 is 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:29.600
 So I don't know if it's going to be the most popular this time, but for now my favorite is 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:36.700
 dear my darling 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:40.360
 Mirko de Muro Jockey is also very good at this Nakayama Shiba 1800m 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:46.430
 It is unusual that this is to be done now, De Muro Tou wants to be malformed 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:52.500
 There are around 40 pars in the annual length that I think these two people need to check 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:56.320
 Of course the most popular rosette may be more popular 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.880
 Please be sure to put this in the betting ticket 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:05.200
 Knot formal that seems to be interesting after 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:13.250
 Although I'm losing to Ria Mai Darling at all, I'm losing at Wakamatsu Shosho 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:19.250
 I bought a horse race to flee from the previous name of the previous take of the fairy stakes . 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.680
 Basically there are many remaining results before Zhongshan 1800 meters course, so horse racing similar to the previous race 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.780
 if you can 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.780
 I wonder if this horse has enough chance 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.980
 Similarly, 5 million conditions of the previous run are at home 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.020
 Well that day one horse racing is done that day 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.290
 Is the sample 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.290
 like 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:43.860
 This is four of them so far 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.020
 Though we attached triangle to village's flurry 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.920
 It's a bar for a lifetime! 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:57.850
 I don't think it's a big hole but I think it's the first in a frame 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.750
 The rest of the one dog is Ya white elegance and Do not want to decide depending on the frame order 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.460
 Filter cloth, etc. baby 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:11.740
 Of course there are also horses that seem quite interesting 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:13.940
 As outer frame becomes somewhat disadvantageous, and whether we want to choose while looking at frame order now 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.720
 I am 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.350
 Yes Let's have a quick break this week 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.370
 Yes The 63rd Hanshin Grand Prize 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:28.440
 Hanshin Shiba 3000m fact 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:35.670
 Though it is this race that popular horse is strong 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:38.130
 The most popular consecutive pair ratio is very high and the previous run is g 1 and this is the second most popular year 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.750
 The horse that became a horse 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.580
 Continuous ratio 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:49.920
 By always to say to come to within 100% 3 pieces 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:55.980
 I think that I want to aim, but I do not know this popularity a little 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:59.090
 Because the ship has lost too much before , the lovely a will become more popular 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.960
 It might put away 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.450
 In the children of King Kamehameha 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.810
 To much 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:12.780
 If you do not want to aim aggressively if it is the most popular 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:15.480
 On the contrary , even children of King Kamehameha are easier to aim at 2 km lighter Suzuka Devias 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:21.109
 I do not think 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:25.789
 My personal favorite is Suzuka in the day 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:29.009
 Well you have to buy a fulove ride last impact karen milotic to your opponent 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:34.510
 I think I should not 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:37.260
 Well, it's a big hole and it might be good to aim at denim andelby or so 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.260
 I am 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:47.150
 Well really but Goldship is the best 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:54.530
 It no doubt will become the key to this race again 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:57.110
 We think that we should buy Stay Gold of children peace of mind bush 1300m best 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.230
 You have won 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:06.960
 Well maybe it might be the best course 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:08.960
 Because it has two axes of Goldship Suzukadeviasu 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.560
 Thinking about anything 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.190
 is 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:18.230
 Yes i wonder 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:24.770
 Let's go now 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:26.770
 Yes came the 64th spring stakes Nakayama Shiba 1800m fact 3 years old 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:34.090
 It will be a race 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:40.400
 The most popular of the reality of this race the past 10 years results also also Dema this time that the 4321 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:44.490
 I think that if you let it flow from Anon Platinum, there is almost no doubt 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:48.960
 Just because the rough it is very often in this race string 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:52.120
 As much as possible v If it is interesting even if it is bought widely 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:58.690
 I'm also aiming for dressmaking and it's just a major 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:06:03.070
 If you hold down to Kobe cafe Mainel Schwalier water sultan, of course it will be real 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.600
 Until around here Hen Well, even though I'm Steele beruf black after Bas buy 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.190
 Keep and 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.700
 I wonder if I can pick it up a little 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:17.300
 I am 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:20.990
 These days there are often a lot of big results in a few boxes here 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:23.840
 Trying to buy a wide box 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:30.949
 Even if I try to aim at something 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:33.669
 I have thought that any good dividend can be taken but enough from platinum mon's Well basically 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:33.669
 I wonder 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:44.969
 Although this week by saying yes I have done and crispy because there was no little time 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:47.020
 Well , I think that there might be such a collection as well 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:54.310
 I also elucidated 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:59.600
 If you are concerned, I have issued a free e-mail magazine from my site under this video 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:05.360
 So we thought that If you give me a registered towards the there 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:08.249
 Please expect a good dividend this week 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.909
 Thank you for being over 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:10.909
 yeah
