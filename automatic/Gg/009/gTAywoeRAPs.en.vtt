laptop keeping it cool the secondary
reason<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:38.119> ergonomic<00:01:39.119> obviously<00:01:40.049> laptops

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
reason is ergonomic obviously laptops

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.840 
reason is ergonomic obviously laptops
are<00:01:41.430> our<00:01:42.000> flat<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.630> hands<00:01:43.020> are<00:01:43.430> in<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.579> flat

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
are our flat your hands are in a flat

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.100 
are our flat your hands are in a flat
position<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.509> better<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.840> them<00:01:46.049> an

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
position it's better to have them an

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.160 
position it's better to have them an
incline<00:01:46.590> position<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.280> laptop<00:01:48.180> stands<00:01:48.659> also

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
incline position so laptop stands also

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.310 
incline position so laptop stands also
inclined<00:01:49.710> your<00:01:49.920> laptop<00:01:50.570> so<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:51.990> I

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
inclined your laptop so if I can just I

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.630 
inclined your laptop so if I can just I
don't<00:01:52.829> know<00:01:52.890> if<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.340> well<00:01:53.610> from

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
don't know if you can see it well from

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.219 
don't know if you can see it well from
this<00:01:54.060> angle<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:54.899> see<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.170> not

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
this angle here but you can see it's not

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.350 
this angle here but you can see it's not
about<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.439> ten<00:01:55.680> percent<00:01:55.909> incline<00:01:56.909> here<00:01:57.210> that

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
about a ten percent incline here that

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.910 
about a ten percent incline here that
will<00:01:57.450> raise<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.659> notebook<00:01:59.060> so<00:02:00.350> this<00:02:01.350> stand<00:02:01.680> it

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
will raise the notebook so this stand it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130 
will raise the notebook so this stand it
does<00:02:02.219> those<00:02:02.579> those<00:02:03.060> two<00:02:03.299> things<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.810> gets<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140
