00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.120
 in german supermarkets you can find them in 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.490
 abundance the most valuable 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.889
 food resources of humans in 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.620
 plastic packs the business with the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.250
 Bottlenose water is booming market leader 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.689
 nestlé pure life and 63 other brands 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.550
 the group sells worldwide for 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.769
 Example in South Africa 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.380
 But where does the water come from? 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.750
 know that nestlé here fills in a 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.719
 place where there is less and less 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.850
 poorest continent in the world many 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.590
 people in africa still have 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.840
 no access to clean drinking water 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.300
 or sanitary facilities 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.570
 although the united nations are water too 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.340
 have declared a human right 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.850
 not far from pretoria lies the source 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.920
 be from don club 2011 economically 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.760
 used by nestlé 282,000 liters of water 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.360
 are bottled daily in bottles and 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.330
 transported 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.809
 Packed under blue plan it says 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.140
 now 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.550
 pure life but here can be pure 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.550
 nobody can afford to live 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.120
 two men come from the nestlé factory 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.780
 on 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.850
 They tell that they see you there 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.650
 explains one of the bottles 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.400
 We may already have damaged reality 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.800
 take it with you 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.580
 but they themselves have no fluency 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.090
 water at home 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.570
 It was not far over at the end of the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.570
 tunnels 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.420
 There is only a stone's throw from the factory 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.200
 away, they live in the midst of rats 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:52.670
 garbage and toilets without water connection 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.670
 like the whole settlement 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.530
 He also works in the mästle water 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.580
 spend the shift begins in the morning 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.190
 six and lasts twelve hours 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.820
 At noon there is a 15 minute break 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.220
 canteen 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.560
 they do not have the food we need 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.990
 bring your own but you can free 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:21.960
 get it at scan and just drink it 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.300
 two bottles of half a liter each 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.650
 water a day 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.390
 Of course I could do that at work 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.570
 but often I drink one of the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:36.030
 both bottles open for the kids too 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:39.030
 home in the store it is for you 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.730
 priceless and so they drink like 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.050
 other champagne the same water 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.770
 that a few hundred meters away 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.910
 flows under her native soil 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.800
 bottled by the Swiss big business 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.080
 How can it be that close to people 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.490
 live at a source and even from 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.700
 water are cut off 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.230
 it is said in the relevant ministry 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.930
 wool with the allocation of water 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.100
 licenses to private corporations, the 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.470
 promote growth 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.940
 we want to know if nestlé in the 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.110
 Last two years ever 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.880
 was controlled 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.880
 since then they take out of water there 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.760
 not yet, because you know your license 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.530
 for the water is pretty new 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.070
 There are others approved earlier 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.870
 were 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:28.640
 We have to take care of that first 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.530
 honestly we do not even know if 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:37.700
 you even with the pumping of the 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:40.760
 resource started the license 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.220
 for the pure life water is still running 20 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.960
 years not unlikely so that 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.610
 the people here at least for so long 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.400
 she has to wait for it too 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.360
 finally free access to clean 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.360
 get drinking water 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.200
 at the same time the government forgives 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.329
 South Africa's always new water licenses 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.629
 also to other industries 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.510
 the pharma chorios leads us to the 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.560
 outskirts of carolina a 30,000 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.620
 inhabitant community 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.569
 there we can see the result in large parts 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.269
 of the groundwater are from the sewage 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.340
 a mine contaminates the chemical broth 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.009
 the drinking water supply flows directly 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.590
 The city charged with aluminum manganese 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:24.590
 iron and drive like that 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.630
 I measure now in the ph value of the water 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:42.040
 for drinking water he should not be under 55 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:44.490
 lay 3736 this is pure as directly from 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.490
 a battery 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.979
 there we have mining companies the 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.690
 then come and contaminate the water 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.479
 come bottled water manufacturer the 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.180
 say we want the best water it is 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.940
 there are still people left for us 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.389
 Supermarket of the city we will find 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.060
 There is still clean water 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:08.699
 pure life of nestlé touted as 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.800
 motto you can trust the water you love 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.710
 so trust can become obvious 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.690
 trying to capitalize on that 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.920
 the public water is no longer safe 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.350
 is 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.270
 the drinking water companies believe that the company is big 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.910
 would not be interested in that 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.220
 the situation changes he leads us to 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.460
 a mosque free of charge 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.260
 Water is distributed to the poor 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.950
 this is one of two places where it is 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.770
 water gives 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:40.270
 over 12,000 people that burdened 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:43.660
 do not want to drink tap water and 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:47.110
 So you came mostly children partly 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.140
 about miles to queue for something 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:53.340
 clean water like at a gas station 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.340
 of life 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.830
 the expensive water from the supermarket 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.380
 their families can not afford 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:08.450
 Often, their parents are unemployed or on 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:10.520
 AIDS makes the tap water 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.240
 you see this with us here in the face 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.230
 I get rash 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.210
 Everyone gets sick of it 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.830
 we constantly get diarrhea 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.130
 can not drink the tap water 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:28.490
 it is unhealthy all children get her 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:30.490
 water back here at lorenz the nestlé 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.960
 Worker without own water connection 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.160
 from a waterhole he drags so 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.100
 can endure much 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.250
 In your hut his children are thirsty 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:43.090
 He has one more please and leaves her for 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.090
 translate us 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:50.150
 he suggests if possibly the nestlé 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.250
 company water could donate or whether it 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.020
 It would be possible for the community 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.390
 maybe a line with the clean one 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.610
 water from the factory here lord over 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.740
 he could not live it properly 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.110
 that the government is lee the license 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.960
 for the good water she has given 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.950
 only have this one here 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.960
 sometimes they can not do that 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.370
 Drink because there are problems with the stomach 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.380
 power and digestion 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.380
 that's why it does not make him happy 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.789
 through the tunnel it goes back to the 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:22.889
 other side of the highway here 

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:25.620
 a small faucet not far from 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:28.020
 the next spoon factory of the group 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:31.169
 Gives a generous amount of drops for 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:33.449
 3000 people in the background the factory 

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:37.979
 for hundreds of millions of liters of pure 

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:40.740
 life lorenz has the nestlé worker 

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:42.720
 today night shift twelve hours to 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:47.840
 in the next morning he will be there again 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.840
 bottling in bottles that clubs live
