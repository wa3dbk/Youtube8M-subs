00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:15.320
 derbies he missed only one 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.140
 this 23 february 1962 the as nancy lorraine 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.289
 came to fight his saint symphorien 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.740
 fc put him was suffering carlo 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.990
 molinari 80 years old today is fine 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.289
 the former boss of the vice champions of 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.060
 la France 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.340
 twice winner of the cup of 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.410
 france and a league cup and 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.910
 especially very happy with good health 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.969
 found from his club 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.339
 also proud of these garnet that have taken over 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.409
 colors going back to league 2 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:45.530
 just before the meeting that will be played 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:47.929
 Tuesday, September 24 sold out he has 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.789
 played for us at home in his 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.710
 club headquarters office 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.899
 we remind him that a certain claude 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.069
 you deny founding father of red and 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.440
 white had suggested in 1990 at a 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:03.019
 televised debate in which he participated 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.049
 merge teams from both cities a 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:09.190
 provocative we ask him if the 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.260
 question always arose in 2013 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.310
 hamon had contained diversity 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.720
 in quotation marks against but his thoughts 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.530
 it would rather be the marriage of the carp 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.410
 and rabbit 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.510
 that being said i think my I believe 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.820
 I never thought good of claude kuni to 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.660
 a certain time who thought because 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.040
 that precisely in his distant vision 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.800
 he was a little visionary counted 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.909
 to spot proposed this and think that the 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.380
 football on 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.409
 we could have afforded you too 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.479
 everyone's personal in his corner 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.359
 to be competitive but there is so much 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.469
 of differences on Thursday between which 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.149
 are they precisely the differences 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.260
 according to your preference already this is the 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.930
 mentality is the interest 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.310
 major when the mosellans for the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.830
 football is no longer a city of 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.870
 soccer as it feels I want 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.490
 would do nancy trial but 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.040
 the numbers are there if you want 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.940
 the enthusiast and how could anyone 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.950
 say the influx of affluences the 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.160
 culture and to more football culture to 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.040
 put that announced so nancy has a lot of 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.330
 also deserves naked in a time the day 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.660
 you will have done that 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.880
 this great club that some of the Rhine 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.620
 certainly my trial would no longer be 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.440
 the club of people and every time 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.260
 that it happened elsewhere elsewhere 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.800
 mergers it's not often a 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.300
 success 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.160
 is there still a fragrance 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.840
 especially around his comfortable 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.460
 but it's sure that the perfume 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.190
 particular it is found especially in 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.520
 the region and in the audience for us in 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.540
 as a leader I would not say that 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.650
 it's a match like any other 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.990
 that would be lying somewhere but I 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.510
 can say that what can be said that 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.720
 it's a match that has a flavor 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.580
 particular as far as you 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.040
 to keep in the same division what 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.720
 is this the case this year 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.870
 right out of the calendar I think 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.180
 people are flocking to the schedule for 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.970
 know the date of the derby and we see it 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.570
 obviously to our questions since 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.700
 today to this day all the places 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.510
 are sold 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.269
 play I would say box office so no 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.970
 of seats sold that day it proves 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.180
 that there is an obvious interest for this 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:32.680
 match that somewhere 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:35.050
 and how diets the opportunity 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.640
 for our audience 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.590
 2 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.800
 to meet the public no it's a 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.110
 in conditions I would say for the 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.170
 less particular of 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.790
 chauvinism is really a match 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.440
 particular does it change anything 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.819
 thing to play it want to senate on 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.890
 would obviously prefer that it be in 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.379
 league 1 that's for sure but anyway 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.959
 considering the value of league 2 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.690
 I think today League 2 is 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.250
 composed of clubs for the least there are 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.700
 has almost 15 who have made careers 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:11.760
 in league 1 and when we see clubs 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:14.500
 like lens brest auxerre I do not know 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.389
 revoke or evoked the blue the 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.630
 winners of auxerre so these are 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:22.210
 clubs that have prestige and it's a 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.729
 very very beautiful league 2 this article published 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.030
 in our columns in 2003 you talk about it 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.950
 of a business football ten years later 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.380
 in hindsight what do you have that look 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:37.780
 throw yourself on football today 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:39.850
 in general in general good question and 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.010
 the answer is not necessarily obvious 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.760
 is easy because in fact this is n 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.039
 more the same football 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.400
 it has nothing to do today 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:51.130
 football is this kind of companies 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.370
 anonymous for the most part you have to 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.560
 fewer and fewer two shareholders who 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.800
 are really the leaders of the 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.750
 club 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.100
 you have pension funds or 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.010
 qatari you have some 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.880
 Russian billionaires who come 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.980
 invest 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.990
 it's not at all the same football and 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.690
 we have football we have football 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.150
 known and who was based our but 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.060
 definitely on I would say the commitment 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.860
 to help people present that the 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.900
 presidents dom in general 7 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.909
 first of all we were very long 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.379
 the association there are a dozen 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:30.080
 of years that we are companies 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.470
 anonymous so it's more the same 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.570
 soccer 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.800
 it's more the same spirit it's more the 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:40.250
 same out of play it's like 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.979
 society in general everything has changed a 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.229
 picture taken in the 80s ah yes we 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.449
 is older bones 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:50.270
 so that's the 60s and 70s 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:52.039
 oh yes what to dream carlo molinari for 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.800
 for his club in it's in those years 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.169
 there, what happened when 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.939
 we were 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.879
 young leaders we came to 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:03.129
 my team of with my friends what we 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:06.879
 arrives and especially in 1967 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:09.099
 it is to place the SMS for ten years 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:09.580
 in league 1 finally in first division at 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:12.069
 the time 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.379
 and then that was something 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:17.050
 what largely successful since one is 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:20.469
 stayed 35 years we liked that was the 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:23.020
 first wants two of my friends of mine 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:26.800
 same as the metz played 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.389
 quite often to oyo first division 2nd 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.430
 division that goes up and down the 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:32.710
 almost every two years 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.960
 had thought if we managed to stabilize and 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.379
 stabilize the club for ten years 1st 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.509
 division 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:40.150
 we will have received something fabulous 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:42.430
 so we dream especially about that and then 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.979
 to do so if roll a club that 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:49.900
 had become very much appreciated 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:51.789
 France after with the 80s 90 which 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.800
 have been years where the club 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:55.960
 really had settled in the 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.020
 What the elite and that you are 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.509
 the most proud today I'm pretty 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.670
 proud of that because indeed 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:06.130
 today the sms is respected 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:08.740
 I have reasons there it becomes a whole 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:12.090
 little bit more anonymous but 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.090
 I hope it will bounce
