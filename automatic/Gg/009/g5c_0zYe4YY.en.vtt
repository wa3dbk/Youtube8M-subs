something that maybe spur on future
potential<00:00:37.020> engineers<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:38.100> think<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> cool

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
potential engineers I think the cool

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.910 
potential engineers I think the cool
thing<00:00:39.450> about<00:00:39.480> tinker<00:00:39.840> well<00:00:39.989> box<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.590> it

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
thing about tinker well box was that it

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.440 
thing about tinker well box was that it
introduced<00:00:41.309> me<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.640> different<00:00:42.360> way<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
introduced me to a different way of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.000 
introduced me to a different way of
looking<00:00:42.660> at<00:00:42.899> engineering<00:00:43.410> instead<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.829> being

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
looking at engineering instead of being

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.889 
looking at engineering instead of being
a<00:00:44.100> means<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.329> an<00:00:45.420> end

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
a means to an end

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.840 
a means to an end
it<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.379> kind<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> way<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.399> fun<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
it was kind of a way to have fun and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.540 
it was kind of a way to have fun and
explore<00:00:48.420> different<00:00:48.989> ideas<00:00:49.800> there's<00:00:50.190> also<00:00:50.370> an

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
explore different ideas there's also an

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.700 
explore different ideas there's also an
event<00:00:50.640> mode<00:00:51.059> where<00:00:51.420> students<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.500> players

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
event mode where students and players

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.810 
event mode where students and players
can<00:00:52.800> go<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.399> build<00:00:53.550> their<00:00:53.789> own

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
can go in and build their own

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.369 
can go in and build their own
contraptions<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.690> they<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:54.989> share<00:00:55.230> them

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
contraptions and they can share them

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.470 
contraptions and they can share them
around<00:00:55.590> with<00:00:55.800> their<00:00:55.949> friends<00:00:56.129> make<00:00:56.940> changes

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
around with their friends make changes

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.299 
around with their friends make changes
and<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:58.079> lot<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.739> being<00:00:59.010> creative

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
and a lot of it is just being creative

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.029 
and a lot of it is just being creative
and<00:00:59.640> learning<00:01:00.059> physics<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.140> real<00:01:01.500> world<00:01:01.710> type

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
and learning physics and real world type

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.850 
and learning physics and real world type
of<00:01:02.219> mechanical<00:01:02.910> devices<00:01:02.960> it's<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.260> lot<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.530> fun

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
of mechanical devices it's a lot of fun

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.010 
of mechanical devices it's a lot of fun
and<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.850> like<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> game<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.659> play

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and it's like a game that you can play

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.990 
and it's like a game that you can play
so<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.740> don't<00:01:08.010> exactly<00:01:08.250> notice<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
so you don't exactly notice but the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.950 
so you don't exactly notice but the
whole<00:01:09.150> time<00:01:09.390> you're<00:01:09.600> learning<00:01:09.720> about

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
whole time you're learning about

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.320 
whole time you're learning about
engineering<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.950> key<00:01:11.340> concepts<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
engineering and key concepts it's a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.910 
engineering and key concepts it's a
really<00:01:12.540> fun<00:01:12.720> way<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.930> invent<00:01:13.380> my<00:01:13.500> own<00:01:13.530> things

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
really fun way to invent my own things

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.380 
really fun way to invent my own things
and<00:01:14.130> showed<00:01:14.490> them<00:01:14.610> all<00:01:14.729> my<00:01:14.880> friends<00:01:15.180> at<00:01:15.270> school

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
and showed them all my friends at school

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.999 
and showed them all my friends at school
I've<00:01:15.810> had<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> thinker<00:01:16.320> box<00:01:16.500> because<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
I've had a thinker box because it's a

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.249 
I've had a thinker box because it's a
fun<00:01:17.189> way<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.369> try<00:01:17.729> out<00:01:17.930> kind<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.020> fun

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
fun way to try out kind of fun

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.960 
fun way to try out kind of fun
mechanisms<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.100> see<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.640> get<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
mechanisms and see if you can get you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.940 
mechanisms and see if you can get you
know<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.570> physics<00:01:21.900> concepts<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.530> work<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
know little physics concepts to work and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.710 
know little physics concepts to work and
you<00:01:23.250> could<00:01:23.400> also<00:01:23.520> send<00:01:23.850> them<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.210> friends
