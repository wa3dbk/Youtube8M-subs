 do this makeup this other more 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.239
 Professional make-up artist is called to be 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.059
 robert me but the doll itself is of 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.399
 Ã¡lex well then the account that what 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.530
 I bought online and they send 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.420
 all 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.020
 internationally they send everything 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.910
 the world 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.380
 buy some of the pigments that 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.670
 they want in this for example is the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.840
 Android color and it's kind of like 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.899
 pink look at this so beautiful 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.320
 it's kind of pink and this is 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:27.189
 can use as a lipstick how to blush 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.979
 as a shadow as we want 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:32.479
 basically you are super super 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.539
 extremely pigmented I like it 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.899
 much this of the pascua then another color 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.899
 that I bought in the pigments is 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:44.659
 electron and electrons as a kind 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.119
 of gold but this happens a thing of what 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.450
 that you gilded as you can see here 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.929
 This is when one applies it to 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.719
 hands for example to is a little bit of the 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.909
 gold is very very metallic 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.840
 I like it a lot also this is the 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:07.860
 phenomenon that is a silver then there 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.920
 it is on this side also silver 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.550
 and we have the three pigments to me 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.490
 love this brand the truth is that it is 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.220
 there are no disappointments the bands are 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.500
 beautiful lipsticks are all this 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.210
 extremely pigmented this by 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.290
 example is a blush and it is in color 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:31.110
 tweet and is that we will be you blush the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.959
 packages are divine also from here 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.510
 we have the color and as they see it there 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.140
 is going to look on your skin is quite 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.180
 intense you can create the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.130
 depth the intensity of the color that 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.670
 want then this is the place in tui 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.380
 and then I have the one of the watercolors 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.720
 that they have this is a quartet 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.690
 you are the fundamental father 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.350
 inception shorts and this one that is a 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.590
 pigment like the pink but in this 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.060
 case is the color 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.110
 buddle then there is the one of 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.890
 fundamentals and comes with a 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.099
 little mirror and my mess over there and this 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.959
 is one of the pallets that descends 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.180
 very precious then there is this one of 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.769
 the pencils for you if you already know 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.470
 I had shown before that it is one of my 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.569
 favorites and it's the color bow that is a 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.700
 beige 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.430
 to delineate what is the advancement of 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.530
 back then there is everything is fine 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.260
 embedded in the super nice super cellar 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.959
 sure after they had this set that is 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.170
 a promotion you probably open it 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:43.099
 and you will find yourself with some eyelashes 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.230
 beautiful beautiful fake does not achieve 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.329
 use them in some photoshop 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.280
 let's see what we create what 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:53.660
 we invented with them and then later when 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.959
 we open the box we have inside one of 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.470
 your products without troubles and products of 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.060
 logo that is the precision and that is a 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.620
 pencil 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.760
 this is the color 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.370
 and it is a delineator of the most precise 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.750
 to apply to apply what is in the 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.220
 then I'm not going to open it 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.840
 because I still do not want to use it and 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.380
 I do not want productions of that though 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.410
 these products do not dry up so fast 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.510
 for example the yen gel for example to 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.050
 compared to the mac you can 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.380
 Leave open for months and do not dry 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.910
 good for months out there 12 months but a 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.979
 comparison with that of max dries 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.289
 immediately the alligator to keep it 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.710
 closed and before I forget this 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:42.710
 little box there is also something and this is a 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.960
 cylinder that I have made is a very little thing 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.630
 small but that will change the 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.350
 life this returns 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:54.140
 any powder in cream then by 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.300
 example for if you have a shadow that you 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.530
 love for example if I want that 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.050
 become a delineator 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.630
 I simply wet the brush 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.270
 overshoot over the dust and I have left 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.040
 my color eyeliner who wants everything 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.740
 this liquid is very essential to have 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.550
 the kit or makeup and then for 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.520
 finish I bought the hair hydra that is 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.850
 your first to make up and this can 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.410
 place in the eyes today obviously because 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.330
 on the face you can also use 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.190
 in the eyes and there's no need to 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.720
 apply nothing else on the face that's very 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.390
 useful when one has a lot of time 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.970
 prepare the skin this is one thing that 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.969
 is evolving the market comes with 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.479
 this spoon 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:40.180
 that does not remove it from there but inside it is 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:43.270
 like a jelly 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.520
 it's a weird thing it 's one then obviously 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.280
 with the spatula he turns it over and that 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.560
 convert with a few crystallites and already that 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.520
 Do not apply it on the skin and it lasts 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.130
 base for hours and hours and hours outside of 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.289
 that hydrates you then there are these 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.110
 I highly recommend the products 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:04.090
 mark and mask and well you're 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.669

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.699
