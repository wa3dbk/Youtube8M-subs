00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.520 
background is going to be out-of-focus
quite<00:01:22.770> similar<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.549> HTC<00:01:23.729> One<00:01:24.450> m8<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
quite similar to the HTC One m8 but the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.920 
quite similar to the HTC One m8 but the
m8<00:01:25.920> creates<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.490> much<00:01:26.729> more<00:01:26.759> blurry<00:01:27.360> background

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
m8 creates a much more blurry background

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.899 
m8 creates a much more blurry background
compared<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.799> because<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.460> has<00:01:29.579> two

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
compared to this because it has two

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.880 
compared to this because it has two
cameras<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.600> back<00:01:30.750> surprisingly<00:01:31.619> the
