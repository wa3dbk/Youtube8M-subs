00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
the tablet and thinking capabilities of

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.070 
the tablet and thinking capabilities of
windows<00:00:08.010> presentation<00:00:08.220> foundation<00:00:08.929> so<00:00:09.929> if<00:00:09.990> we

windows presentation foundation so if we

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.290 
windows presentation foundation so if we
click<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.500> inside<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:10.889> editing<00:00:11.370> modes<00:00:11.639> you'll

click the inside of editing modes you'll
see<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.780> one<00:00:13.019> liners<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:14.250> able<00:00:14.490> to

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
see that this one liners and is able to

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.359 
see that this one liners and is able to
create<00:00:14.880> an<00:00:15.690> ink<00:00:16.170> environment<00:00:16.859> where<00:00:17.070> i<00:00:17.100> can

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
create an ink environment where i can

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.370 
create an ink environment where i can
write<00:00:18.109> basic<00:00:19.109> txt<00:00:20.300> so<00:00:21.300> what<00:00:21.510> about<00:00:21.600> if<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:21.990> have

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
write basic txt so what about if we have

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.410 
write basic txt so what about if we have
another<00:00:22.680> line<00:00:22.949> here<00:00:22.980> was<00:00:23.550> erased<00:00:23.880> by<00:00:24.090> stroke

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
another line here was erased by stroke

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.080 
another line here was erased by stroke
this<00:00:24.810> enables<00:00:25.289> me<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.500> actually<00:00:26.090> erase

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
this enables me to actually erase

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.609 
this enables me to actually erase
individual<00:00:27.900> parts<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.560> an<00:00:28.680> image<00:00:28.920> i<00:00:30.470> can<00:00:31.470> do

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
individual parts of an image i can do

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.240 
back in over the top of the image so
what<00:00:45.300> about<00:00:45.390> gestures<00:00:45.719> here<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.770> go<00:00:46.800> down

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
what about gestures here we can go down

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.740 
what about gestures here we can go down
right<00:00:48.000> let<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.239> let's<00:00:51.239> bring<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.570> all

right let up and let's bring this all
together<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.500> let's<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.829> look<00:00:52.890> at<00:00:53.129> this

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
together so let's have a look at this

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.910 
together so let's have a look at this
Victor<00:00:53.610> example<00:00:54.149> here<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.170> zoom<00:00:55.379> right<00:00:55.739> in

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
Victor example here I can zoom right in

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.459 
Victor example here I can zoom right in
on<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.219> text<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> smooth<00:00:58.170> lines

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
on the text you can see the smooth lines

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.819 
on the text you can see the smooth lines
and<00:00:59.120> the<00:01:00.120> clarity<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> image<00:01:01.079> zoom<00:01:01.620> out

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
and the clarity of the image zoom out

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.189 
and the clarity of the image zoom out
put<00:01:02.699> my<00:01:02.820> gestures<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.390> rotate<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
put my gestures and rotate it to the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.789 
put my gestures and rotate it to the
right<00:01:04.350> flick<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.979> off<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> screen<00:01:06.680> so<00:01:07.680> what

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
right flick it off the screen so what

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.250 
right flick it off the screen so what
about<00:01:07.890> recognition<00:01:08.780> we<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> look<00:01:10.140> at

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
about recognition we have a look at

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.320 
about recognition we have a look at
shape<00:01:10.500> recognition<00:01:10.830> you're<00:01:11.820> acting<00:01:11.970> draws

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
shape recognition you're acting draws

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.300 
shape recognition you're acting draws
some<00:01:12.540> shapes<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.740> platform<00:01:14.220> will

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
some shapes and the platform will

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.609 
some shapes and the platform will
identify<00:01:14.490> those<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.330> move<00:01:15.479> these<00:01:15.659> around

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.859 

there<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.710> go<00:01:20.240> what<00:01:21.240> about<00:01:21.329> character

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
there we go what about character

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.620 
there we go what about character
recognition<00:01:22.049> some<00:01:22.799> lower<00:01:22.979> case<00:01:23.250> letters<00:01:23.640> with

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
recognition some lower case letters with

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.490 
recognition some lower case letters with
a<00:01:24.899> at<00:01:25.679> an<00:01:25.860> end<00:01:26.130> signal<00:01:27.200> capital<00:01:28.200> letters

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
a at an end signal capital letters

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.240 
a at an end signal capital letters
digits<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:31.350> platform<00:01:31.799> will<00:01:31.890> detect

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
digits and the platform will detect

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.270 
digits and the platform will detect
these<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.240> turn<00:01:33.420> those<00:01:33.600> into<00:01:33.780> text<00:01:34.289> so<00:01:35.100> how

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
these and to turn those into text so how

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.069 
these and to turn those into text so how
could<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.520> use<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.149> a<00:01:36.210> business<00:01:36.539> example

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
could you use this in a business example

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.660 
could you use this in a business example
well<00:01:37.409> let's<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.679> a<00:01:37.710> look<00:01:37.890> at<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.069> form<00:01:38.399> here

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
well let's have a look at this form here

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.149 
well let's have a look at this form here
you'll<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:39.539> a<00:01:39.689> victor<00:01:40.110> scaled<00:01:40.380> form<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.039> we

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
you'll see a victor scaled form so we

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.550 
you'll see a victor scaled form so we
can<00:01:41.310> zoom<00:01:41.340> right<00:01:41.789> in<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.090> right<00:01:42.539> out<00:01:42.750> we<00:01:43.350> get<00:01:43.530> a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
can zoom right in and right out we get a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.350 
can zoom right in and right out we get a
little<00:01:43.679> scroll<00:01:44.369> bar<00:01:44.520> here<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> right<00:01:45.119> to

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
little scroll bar here on the right to

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.149 
little scroll bar here on the right to
look<00:01:45.509> through<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> form<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:47.039> do

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
look through the form then I can do

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.919 
look through the form then I can do
things<00:01:47.369> such<00:01:47.549> as<00:01:47.610> ink<00:01:48.000> inside<00:01:48.179> of<00:01:48.539> this<00:01:48.630> form

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
things such as ink inside of this form

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.169 
things such as ink inside of this form
so<00:01:49.020> i<00:01:49.170> put<00:01:49.830> my<00:01:49.950> name<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:50.490> my<00:01:50.939> department

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
so i put my name in there my department

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.730 
so i put my name in there my department
in<00:01:54.179> my<00:01:54.420> ID<00:01:54.569> number

in my ID number

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.130 
in my ID number
the<00:01:57.369> platform<00:01:57.640> will<00:01:57.939> recognize<00:01:58.420> their<00:01:58.689> texts

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
the platform will recognize their texts

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.859 
the platform will recognize their texts
and<00:01:59.290> turn<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.829> them<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.270> type<00:02:01.270> texts<00:02:01.659> that<00:02:01.780> we

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
and turn to them to type texts that we

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.860 
and turn to them to type texts that we
could<00:02:02.020> submit<00:02:02.290> save<00:02:02.829> our<00:02:03.070> XML

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
could submit save our XML

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.020 
could submit save our XML
it's<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.080> look<00:02:05.290> at<00:02:05.410> reading<00:02:05.800> well<00:02:06.640> if<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:06.850> had<00:02:07.000> a
