if<00:00:05.299> you<00:00:05.509> took<00:00:05.720> each<00:00:06.020> one<00:00:06.049> of<00:00:06.380> the<00:00:06.500> tracks<00:00:06.800> and

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
if you took each one of the tracks and

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:08.980 
if you took each one of the tracks and
you<00:00:07.130> separated<00:00:07.850> it<00:00:07.910> out<00:00:08.029> into<00:00:08.299> smaller<00:00:08.690> pieces

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
you separated it out into smaller pieces

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.810 
you separated it out into smaller pieces
you'd<00:00:09.740> have<00:00:09.889> these<00:00:10.040> tiny<00:00:10.309> little<00:00:10.430> pieces

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
you'd have these tiny little pieces

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.680 
you'd have these tiny little pieces
called<00:00:11.270> sectors<00:00:11.840> each<00:00:12.110> sector<00:00:12.920> on<00:00:13.010> a<00:00:13.070> drive<00:00:13.340> is

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
called sectors each sector on a drive is

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.599 
called sectors each sector on a drive is
512<00:00:14.690> bytes<00:00:15.020> not<00:00:15.559> a<00:00:15.590> lot<00:00:15.770> of<00:00:15.889> information<00:00:16.160> is

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
512 bytes not a lot of information is

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.000 
512 bytes not a lot of information is
stored<00:00:16.850> on<00:00:17.029> a<00:00:17.090> sector<00:00:17.449> and<00:00:17.779> you<00:00:18.470> can<00:00:18.650> see<00:00:18.830> it's

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
stored on a sector and you can see it's

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.460 
stored on a sector and you can see it's
also<00:00:19.189> a<00:00:19.450> geometric<00:00:20.450> type<00:00:20.750> of<00:00:20.930> problem<00:00:21.320> because

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
also a geometric type of problem because

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.740 
also a geometric type of problem because
if<00:00:21.740> you're<00:00:21.890> on<00:00:21.920> the<00:00:22.070> outside<00:00:22.100> ring<00:00:22.970> you'll<00:00:23.600> be

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
if you're on the outside ring you'll be

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.510 
if you're on the outside ring you'll be
able<00:00:23.930> to<00:00:24.020> have<00:00:24.140> more<00:00:24.350> sectors<00:00:24.860> on<00:00:25.039> the<00:00:25.130> outside

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
able to have more sectors on the outside

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.760 
able to have more sectors on the outside
ring<00:00:25.760> than<00:00:26.000> you<00:00:26.090> have<00:00:26.270> on<00:00:26.450> the<00:00:26.570> inside<00:00:26.619> so<00:00:27.619> it's

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
ring than you have on the inside so it's

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.800 
ring than you have on the inside so it's
not<00:00:27.890> like<00:00:28.100> cutting<00:00:28.340> a<00:00:28.550> pie<00:00:28.789> you<00:00:29.150> really<00:00:29.630> have<00:00:29.780> a

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
not like cutting a pie you really have a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.660 
not like cutting a pie you really have a
different<00:00:30.260> number<00:00:30.560> depending<00:00:30.980> on<00:00:31.130> where<00:00:31.520> you

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
different number depending on where you

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.660 
different number depending on where you
are<00:00:31.699> on<00:00:32.149> which<00:00:32.419> track<00:00:32.809> on<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.289> drive<00:00:33.670> also

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
are on which track on the drive also

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.459 
are on which track on the drive also
keep<00:00:34.910> in<00:00:35.090> mind<00:00:35.120> that<00:00:35.480> you<00:00:35.690> could<00:00:35.870> fit<00:00:36.109> on<00:00:36.350> these

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
keep in mind that you could fit on these

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.520 
keep in mind that you could fit on these
larger<00:00:37.100> hard<00:00:37.640> drives<00:00:37.969> you<00:00:38.420> can<00:00:38.569> have<00:00:38.809> a<00:00:38.989> lot<00:00:39.499> of

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
larger hard drives you can have a lot of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.919 
larger hard drives you can have a lot of
sectors<00:00:40.100> you're<00:00:40.280> gonna<00:00:40.399> have<00:00:40.550> a<00:00:40.730> millions<00:00:41.659> of

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:41.929

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
sectors on a drive and you get into a

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.059 
sectors on a drive and you get into a
logistical<00:00:44.780> problem<00:00:44.839> of<00:00:45.379> how<00:00:45.859> is<00:00:45.920> the

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
on the file system but it's just a way

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.580 
on the file system but it's just a way
that<00:01:31.460> I<00:01:31.640> can<00:01:31.880> now<00:01:32.090> group<00:01:32.780> together<00:01:33.320> the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
that I can now group together the

that I can now group together the
different<00:01:33.740> sectors<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:34.490> now<00:01:34.700> it's<00:01:34.850> easier<00:01:35.119> to

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
different sectors and now it's easier to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.370 
different sectors and now it's easier to
keep<00:01:35.359> track<00:01:35.630> of<00:01:35.810> them<00:01:35.899> because<00:01:36.170> there<00:01:36.350> are

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
keep track of them because there are

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.560 
keep track of them because there are
fewer<00:01:36.920> number<00:01:37.310> of<00:01:37.460> clusters<00:01:37.909> because<00:01:38.299> I've

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
fewer number of clusters because I've

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.569

taken all those millions of sectors and

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.039 
taken all those millions of sectors and
now<00:01:40.670> got<00:01:41.179> them<00:01:41.329> into<00:01:41.479> something<00:01:41.689> that's<00:01:41.960> a

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
on this hard drive and so there's a lot

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.730 
on this hard drive and so there's a lot
of<00:02:16.160> great<00:02:16.430> information<00:02:17.030> but<00:02:17.060> obviously

of great information but obviously

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.040 
of great information but obviously
that's<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.160> pretty<00:02:18.400> important<00:02:19.060> boot<00:02:19.600> record

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
that's a pretty important boot record

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.630 
that's a pretty important boot record

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
that one sector on your hard drive

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.580 
that one sector on your hard drive
contains<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.660> lot<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:22.960> important<00:02:23.470> information

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
contains a lot of important information

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.980 
contains a lot of important information
and<00:02:24.070> without<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.460> MBR<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.690> wouldn't<00:02:25.930> know

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
and without the MBR you wouldn't know

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.630 
and without the MBR you wouldn't know
how<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.140> start<00:02:26.410> operating<00:02:26.800> systems<00:02:27.280> on<00:02:27.460> this

your<00:02:32.230> system<00:02:32.620> doesn't<00:02:32.860> boot<00:02:33.160> that's<00:02:33.430> why<00:02:33.640> and

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
your system doesn't boot that's why and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.970 
your system doesn't boot that's why and
usually<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.390> have<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.690> rewrite<00:02:35.290> your<00:02:35.350> Master

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980

there<00:03:18.220> was<00:03:18.370> also<00:03:18.550> an<00:03:18.970> adjunct<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:19.810> called

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
there was also an adjunct to that called

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.400 
there was also an adjunct to that called
a<00:03:20.380> T<00:03:20.740> attachment<00:03:21.550> with<00:03:21.730> packet<00:03:22.270> interface<00:03:22.570> we

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
a T attachment with packet interface we

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.810 
a T attachment with packet interface we
did<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:23.800> so<00:03:23.980> we<00:03:24.100> could<00:03:24.250> plug<00:03:24.430> in<00:03:24.640> other

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
did that so we could plug in other

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.760 
did that so we could plug in other
devices<00:03:25.300> that<00:03:25.480> weren't<00:03:25.900> necessarily<00:03:26.410> hard

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
devices that weren't necessarily hard

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.610 
devices that weren't necessarily hard
drives<00:03:27.100> those<00:03:27.760> SATA<00:03:28.360> and<00:03:28.510> pata<00:03:28.900> interfaces

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
drives those SATA and pata interfaces

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.080 
drives those SATA and pata interfaces
were<00:03:29.740> really<00:03:30.040> designed<00:03:30.370> for<00:03:30.430> hard<00:03:30.700> drives<00:03:30.910> but

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
were really designed for hard drives but

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.390 
were really designed for hard drives but
we<00:03:31.180> also<00:03:31.330> had<00:03:31.510> things<00:03:31.660> like<00:03:31.780> CD<00:03:32.230> ROMs<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.890> DVD

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
we also had things like CD ROMs and DVD

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.130 
we also had things like CD ROMs and DVD
roms<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:33.940> we<00:03:34.420> were<00:03:34.540> able<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.810> take<00:03:34.990> advantage

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
roms and we were able to take advantage

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.190 
roms and we were able to take advantage
of<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:35.770> by<00:03:36.250> using<00:03:36.430> a<00:03:36.700> similar<00:03:37.150> interface<00:03:37.660> but

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
of that by using a similar interface but

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.780 
of that by using a similar interface but
a<00:03:38.230> different<00:03:38.680> type<00:03:38.860> of<00:03:38.890> protocol<00:03:39.490> and<00:03:39.610> use

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
a different type of protocol and use

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.330 
a different type of protocol and use
called<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.360> T<00:03:40.660> attachment<00:03:41.380> with<00:03:41.530> packet

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
called a T attachment with packet

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.040 
called a T attachment with packet
interface<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:43.210> we<00:03:43.270> were<00:03:43.360> able<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.570> plug<00:03:43.840> in

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
interface and we were able to plug in

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.040 
interface and we were able to plug in
our<00:03:44.230> cd-rom<00:03:44.920> drives<00:03:45.250> using<00:03:45.970> really<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.840> same

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
our cd-rom drives using really the same

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.740 
our cd-rom drives using really the same
drive<00:03:47.320> controllers<00:03:47.920> as<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.580> pata<00:03:48.850> but<00:03:49.480> we<00:03:49.600> were

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
drive controllers as a pata but we were

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.750 
drive controllers as a pata but we were
now<00:03:49.900> able<00:03:50.140> to<00:03:50.200> plug<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:50.530> right<00:03:50.680> in<00:03:50.860> and<00:03:50.890> use<00:03:51.610> it

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
now able to plug it right in and use it

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.090 
now able to plug it right in and use it
as<00:03:51.940> if<00:03:52.120> it<00:03:52.270> was<00:03:52.480> sort<00:03:53.020> of<00:03:53.080> like<00:03:53.140> accessing<00:03:53.890> a

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
as if it was sort of like accessing a

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.530 
as if it was sort of like accessing a
hard<00:03:54.310> drive<00:03:54.520> except<00:03:54.880> it<00:03:55.000> was<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.120> completely

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
hard drive except it was a completely

hard drive except it was a completely
different<00:03:55.660> type<00:03:56.140> of<00:03:56.170> piece<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:56.590> equipment

different type of piece of equipment

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.310 
different type of piece of equipment
there<00:03:57.910> is<00:03:57.970> also<00:03:58.300> something<00:03:59.200> called

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
there is also something called

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.070 
there is also something called
integrated<00:04:00.130> Drive<00:04:00.340> electronics<00:04:00.840> this<00:04:01.840> is

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
integrated Drive electronics this is

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.620 
integrated Drive electronics this is
what<00:04:02.290> we<00:04:02.590> originally<00:04:03.190> called<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:04.060> pata

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
what we originally called the pata

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.840 
what we originally called the pata
format<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.410> was<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.650> original<00:04:06.430> standard

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
format it was a original standard

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.210 
format it was a original standard
created<00:04:07.270> by<00:04:07.390> Western<00:04:07.840> Digital<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:08.530> when<00:04:09.040> we

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
created by Western Digital and when we

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.250 
created by Western Digital and when we
updated<00:04:09.760> that<00:04:10.090> original<00:04:10.720> standard<00:04:11.140> is

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
updated that original standard is

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.840 
updated that original standard is
something<00:04:11.560> newer<00:04:11.770> it<00:04:12.100> was<00:04:12.460> more<00:04:12.670> of<00:04:12.730> the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
something newer it was more of the

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.210 
something newer it was more of the
generic<00:04:13.270> parallel<00:04:13.750> ATA<00:04:14.200> attachment<00:04:14.890> is<00:04:15.010> what

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
generic parallel ATA attachment is what

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.250 
generic parallel ATA attachment is what
we<00:04:15.370> called<00:04:15.640> that<00:04:15.880> so<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:16.150> may<00:04:16.270> here<00:04:16.450> IDE<00:04:16.870> and

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
we called that so you may here IDE and

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.640 
we called that so you may here IDE and
ATA<00:04:18.220> used<00:04:19.000> in<00:04:19.239> similar<00:04:19.660> forms<00:04:20.080> in<00:04:20.230> fact<00:04:20.440> on

older drives it actually may be marked

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.130 
older drives it actually may be marked
IDE<00:04:23.620> or<00:04:23.980> ata<00:04:24.760> it's<00:04:25.360> really<00:04:25.690> referring<00:04:26.020> to

exactly the same thing and although it's

on here because you might see it

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.260 
on here because you might see it
something<00:04:35.919> called<00:04:36.099> scuzzy<00:04:36.580> which<00:04:36.909> is<00:04:37.089> the

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
something called scuzzy which is the

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.959 
something called scuzzy which is the
small<00:04:37.539> computer<00:04:38.020> systems<00:04:38.499> interface<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:39.759> use

of<00:04:40.179> scuzzy<00:04:40.629> is<00:04:40.839> dwindling<00:04:41.379> away<00:04:42.099> now<00:04:42.429> that

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:42.459 
of scuzzy is dwindling away now that

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:44.669 
of scuzzy is dwindling away now that
SATA<00:04:42.999> has<00:04:43.300> really<00:04:43.599> become<00:04:43.779> one<00:04:44.529> of<00:04:44.559> the

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
our systems it has a different type of

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
formatting uses different interfaces

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.409 
formatting uses different interfaces
just<00:05:14.680> like<00:05:14.800> all<00:05:14.979> of<00:05:15.129> these<00:05:15.279> do<00:05:15.520> but<00:05:16.029> something

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
just like all of these do but something

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:17.519 
just like all of these do but something
else<00:05:16.509> that<00:05:16.749> you're<00:05:16.899> gonna<00:05:17.020> see<00:05:17.289> when<00:05:17.409> you

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:17.529 
else that you're gonna see when you

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:19.760 
else that you're gonna see when you
start<00:05:17.589> plugging<00:05:17.949> in<00:05:18.219> different<00:05:18.520> hard<00:05:18.699> drives

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
start plugging in different hard drives

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.139 
start plugging in different hard drives
of<00:05:20.770> course<00:05:21.099> there's<00:05:21.309> not<00:05:21.430> just<00:05:21.490> hard<00:05:21.909> drives

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:22.149 
of course there's not just hard drives

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:23.790 
of course there's not just hard drives
to<00:05:22.360> think<00:05:22.569> about<00:05:22.779> these<00:05:22.990> days<00:05:23.229> there's<00:05:23.499> other

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
to think about these days there's other

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.859 
to think about these days there's other
types<00:05:24.069> of<00:05:24.279> media<00:05:24.639> that<00:05:24.699> use<00:05:25.149> light<00:05:25.449> they<00:05:25.719> use

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:25.869 
types of media that use light they use

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:27.749 
types of media that use light they use
lasers<00:05:26.349> and<00:05:26.529> these<00:05:26.649> optical<00:05:27.129> formats<00:05:27.550> are

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
lasers and these optical formats are

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.579 
lasers and these optical formats are
important<00:05:28.180> as<00:05:28.300> well<00:05:28.509> one<00:05:29.199> that's<00:05:29.349> been<00:05:29.559> around

is<00:06:18.999> this<00:06:19.269> DVD<00:06:19.839> format<00:06:20.349> but<00:06:20.919> there<00:06:21.099> is<00:06:21.249> a<00:06:21.279> new

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:21.699 
is this DVD format but there is a new

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:23.219 
is this DVD format but there is a new
format<00:06:22.119> on<00:06:22.389> the<00:06:22.419> block<00:06:22.719> and<00:06:22.990> that<00:06:23.050> is<00:06:23.199> a

blu-ray<00:06:23.649> disc<00:06:23.919> and<00:06:24.159> you<00:06:24.339> can<00:06:24.490> see<00:06:24.729> obviously

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 
blu-ray disc and you can see obviously

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:28.589 
blu-ray disc and you can see obviously
much<00:06:26.319> bigger<00:06:26.649> than<00:06:26.979> the<00:06:27.129> CD<00:06:27.399> or<00:06:27.699> the<00:06:27.729> DVD<00:06:28.180> on<00:06:28.539> a

on that single media they all look very

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:39.569 
on that single media they all look very

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:39.579 
similar this is a blu-ray disc they all

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:41.909 
similar this is a blu-ray disc they all
look<00:06:39.819> about<00:06:40.089> the<00:06:40.240> same<00:06:40.479> size<00:06:40.719> but<00:06:41.139> obviously

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 
look about the same size but obviously

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:43.829 
look about the same size but obviously
very<00:06:42.309> different<00:06:42.639> in<00:06:42.969> the<00:06:43.089> way<00:06:43.240> that<00:06:43.269> data<00:06:43.569> is

00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:43.839 
very different in the way that data is

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:45.360 
very different in the way that data is
stored<00:06:43.990> very<00:06:44.620> different

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.040 
stored very different
matze<00:06:45.580> and<00:06:45.850> how<00:06:45.970> we<00:06:46.030> are<00:06:46.479> able<00:06:46.750> to<00:06:46.840> take<00:06:46.990> that
