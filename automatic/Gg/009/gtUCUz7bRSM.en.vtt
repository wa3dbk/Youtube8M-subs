the other beginners out there an idea on
how<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.830> make<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.730> I'm<00:00:21.630> pretty<00:00:21.900> sure<00:00:22.140> that

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
how to make it and I'm pretty sure that

how to make it and I'm pretty sure that
you<00:00:22.439> could<00:00:22.640> give<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.760> your<00:00:23.850> own<00:00:23.910> twist<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
you could give it your own twist and

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.550 
you could give it your own twist and
make<00:00:25.260> different<00:00:25.650> versions<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.670> angel<00:00:27.560> so

time I buy online at global sugar
art.com<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:50.300> usually<00:00:51.300> they<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.600> 25%<00:00:52.430> off

art.com and usually they have a 25% off
price<00:00:54.600> there<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.559> cheaper<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.980> buy<00:00:56.100> there

price there so it's cheaper to buy there
so<00:00:57.300> I'll<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:58.350> using<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:59.640> white<00:00:59.850> fondant<00:01:00.329> and

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
so I'll be using the white fondant and

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.579 
so I'll be using the white fondant and
when<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> get<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.149> little<00:01:03.449> lazy<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.840> also<00:01:04.080> buy<00:01:04.350> gum

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
when I get a little lazy I also buy gum

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.420

paste<00:01:05.240> to<00:01:06.240> me<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.600> more<00:01:07.220> predictable<00:01:08.220> I

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
paste to me it's more predictable I

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.620 
paste to me it's more predictable I
think<00:01:08.640> that's<00:01:08.790> that's<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> best<00:01:09.360> word<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
think that's that's the best word to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.350 
think that's that's the best word to
describe<00:01:10.159> store-bought<00:01:11.210> fondant<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.299> gum

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.609 
describe store-bought fondant and gum
paste<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:13.380> more<00:01:13.680> predictable<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:15.409> it<00:01:16.409> won't

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
paste it's more predictable and it won't

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.260 
paste it's more predictable and it won't
give<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.280> occasional<00:01:17.790> bumps<00:01:18.150> you're

and we're going to do it this way
because<00:02:11.110> I<00:02:11.260> would<00:02:11.650> want<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.730> wings<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.360> set<00:02:13.660> on

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
because I would want the wings to set on

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.290 
because I would want the wings to set on
a<00:02:14.820> curve<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.580> when<00:02:18.790> we're<00:02:19.030> ready<00:02:19.210> to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
a curve so that when we're ready to

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.790 
a curve so that when we're ready to
assemble<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.050> whole<00:02:20.200> thing<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:22.630> will<00:02:23.320> already

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
assemble the whole thing it will already

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.110 
assemble the whole thing it will already
have<00:02:24.160> dried<00:02:24.820> on<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.780> curve<00:02:26.100> now<00:02:27.100> some<00:02:27.850> of<00:02:27.880> you

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
have dried on that curve now some of you

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.430 
have dried on that curve now some of you
might<00:02:28.300> think<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.660> know<00:02:28.750> where<00:02:29.050> are<00:02:29.170> we<00:02:29.290> going

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
might think you know where are we going

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.780 
might think you know where are we going
to<00:02:29.530> get<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:30.630> pattern<00:02:31.630> for<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.080> wings<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.790> can

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
to get a pattern for the wings you can

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.640 
to get a pattern for the wings you can
do<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.030> two<00:02:34.209> ways<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.600> can<00:02:34.690> either<00:02:34.840> buy<00:02:35.230> a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
do it two ways you can either buy a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.460 
do it two ways you can either buy a
cookie<00:02:36.400> cutter<00:02:36.670> in<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.540> exact<00:02:37.870> same<00:02:38.140> size

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
cookie cutter in the exact same size

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.620 
cookie cutter in the exact same size
that<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.370> would<00:02:39.520> want<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.030> good<00:02:40.240> luck<00:02:40.450> with

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
that you would want and good luck with

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.060 
that you would want and good luck with
that<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:41.250> tried<00:02:42.250> looking<00:02:43.090> online<00:02:43.540> for<00:02:44.170> that<00:02:44.739> but

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
that I tried looking online for that but

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.610 
that I tried looking online for that but
it<00:02:45.760> really<00:02:45.820> costs<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.690> whole<00:02:46.870> lot<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.140> think<00:02:47.530> it

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
it really costs a whole lot I think it

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.930 
it really costs a whole lot I think it
was<00:02:47.709> like<00:02:48.330> $25<00:02:49.330> for<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:51.250> cutter<00:02:51.489> and<00:02:51.610> the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
was like $25 for the cutter and the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.290 
was like $25 for the cutter and the
Vayner<00:02:52.680> which<00:02:53.680> is<00:02:53.800> to<00:02:53.920> give<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:55.000> give<00:02:55.180> the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
Vayner which is to give to give the

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.280 
Vayner which is to give to give the
wings<00:02:56.670> texture<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:58.300> let<00:02:58.450> me<00:02:58.540> just<00:02:58.690> go<00:02:58.930> back<00:02:59.110> and

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
wings texture so let me just go back and

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.790 
wings texture so let me just go back and
show<00:02:59.440> you<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.830> angel<00:03:00.370> again<00:03:01.110> I'm<00:03:02.110> hoping<00:03:02.620> that

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
show you the angel again I'm hoping that

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.140 
show you the angel again I'm hoping that
you<00:03:02.890> can<00:03:03.040> see<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.400> there<00:03:03.610> are<00:03:05.370> slight<00:03:06.370> marks

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
you can see that there are slight marks

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.050 
you can see that there are slight marks
on<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.890> wings<00:03:09.070> just<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.430> give<00:03:09.580> it<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:10.030> know

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
on the wings just to give it you know

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.350 
on the wings just to give it you know
feathery<00:03:10.540> look<00:03:11.520> so<00:03:12.520> in<00:03:12.670> order<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.970> get<00:03:13.239> that

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
feathery look so in order to get that

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.270 
feathery look so in order to get that
what<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.390> did<00:03:16.720> is<00:03:16.989> you<00:03:17.590> might<00:03:17.739> find<00:03:17.920> this<00:03:18.070> quite

you go have my small template for the

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.130 
you go have my small template for the

wings and for those of you who don't
want<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.440> buy<00:03:54.360> cutters<00:03:55.360> like<00:03:55.660> me<00:03:56.110> because<00:03:56.380> this

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
want to buy cutters like me because this

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.289 
want to buy cutters like me because this
is<00:03:56.560> more<00:03:57.040> like<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.250> one-time<00:03:57.640> thing<00:03:57.700> for<00:03:58.209> me

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
next week this is I think this will be a

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.090 
next week this is I think this will be a
an<00:04:05.680> easy<00:04:06.010> way<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.280> go<00:04:06.570> so<00:04:07.590> it's<00:04:08.590> a<00:04:08.709> bad<00:04:08.890> day<00:04:09.070> for

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
an easy way to go so it's a bad day for

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.610 
an easy way to go so it's a bad day for
me<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.459> break<00:04:09.730> my<00:04:09.790> cutter<00:04:10.269> but<00:04:10.600> just<00:04:11.320> make<00:04:11.500> sure

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
me to break my cutter but just make sure

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.350 
me to break my cutter but just make sure
that<00:04:11.799> your<00:04:12.010> cutter<00:04:12.430> is<00:04:12.610> clean<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.150> you<00:04:13.180> only

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
that your cutter is clean and you only

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.839

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
use it for food and use the sharp part

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:23.620 
use it for food and use the sharp part
to<00:04:18.849> trace<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.570> wing

showing you the shape of the wing and
you<00:04:55.900> can<00:04:56.020> pretty<00:04:56.229> much<00:04:56.319> tap<00:04:56.770> on<00:04:56.979> the<00:04:57.099> side

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
you can pretty much tap on the side

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.879 
you can pretty much tap on the side
sorry<00:05:00.159> it's<00:05:00.340> just<00:05:00.400> my<00:05:00.639> son's<00:05:00.909> pulling<00:05:01.599> on<00:05:01.720> the

sorry it's just my son's pulling on the
camera<00:05:02.889> stand<00:05:03.159> so<00:05:03.940> push<00:05:04.210> on<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.479> side<00:05:04.690> just<00:05:04.930> to

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
camera stand so push on the side just to

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:13.800 
camera stand so push on the side just to
give<00:05:05.289> it<00:05:05.319> a<00:05:06.240> smoother<00:05:07.240> edge<00:05:12.599> you're<00:05:13.599> going<00:05:13.750> to

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
give it a smoother edge you're going to

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.689 
give it a smoother edge you're going to
create<00:05:13.960> a<00:05:14.259> mirror<00:05:14.620> image<00:05:14.860> of<00:05:15.159> this<00:05:15.370> and

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
create a mirror image of this and

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:23.690 
create a mirror image of this and
they're<00:05:16.509> going<00:05:16.599> to<00:05:16.690> look<00:05:16.840> like<00:05:16.990> this
