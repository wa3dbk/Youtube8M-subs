Bishop g4
wow<00:02:18.930> what<00:02:19.409> a<00:02:19.470> pin<00:02:19.769> black<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.459> threatening<00:02:21.239> and

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
wow what a pin black is threatening and

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.390 
wow what a pin black is threatening and
producing<00:02:21.870> double<00:02:22.140> ponds<00:02:22.379> and<00:02:22.650> whites

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
producing double ponds and whites

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.789 
producing double ponds and whites
position<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.239> at<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.510> same<00:02:24.659> time<00:02:24.900> why<00:02:25.650> it's

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
position and at the same time why it's

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.289 
position and at the same time why it's
not<00:02:25.920> going<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.129> be<00:02:26.250> able<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.640> capture<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:27.090> pond

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
not going to be able to capture the pond

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.170 
not going to be able to capture the pond
because<00:02:27.599> if<00:02:27.810> white<00:02:28.049> captures<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.680> pawn<00:02:29.180> black

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
because if white captures the pawn black

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.890 
because if white captures the pawn black
can<00:02:30.569> capture<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.440> rook<00:02:31.620> on<00:02:31.829> h1<00:02:32.459> right<00:02:33.739> okay<00:02:34.739> so

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
can capture the rook on h1 right okay so

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.289 
can capture the rook on h1 right okay so
instead<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:37.230> capturing<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.099> bishop<00:02:38.549> if<00:02:38.700> he

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
instead of capturing the bishop if he

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.899 
instead of capturing the bishop if he
goes<00:02:39.450> Bishop<00:02:39.840> e2<00:02:40.019> it<00:02:40.470> will<00:02:40.680> simply<00:02:41.370> transpose

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
goes Bishop e2 it will simply transpose

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:48.770 
goes Bishop e2 it will simply transpose

going<00:03:07.409> to<00:03:07.500> transpose<00:03:08.220> or<00:03:08.459> just<00:03:08.760> actually<00:03:09.030> the

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
going to transpose or just actually the

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.119 
going to transpose or just actually the
main<00:03:09.510> line<00:03:09.690> so<00:03:09.840> we're<00:03:09.959> going<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.109> just<00:03:10.829> look<00:03:11.010> at

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
main line so we're going to just look at

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.649 
main line so we're going to just look at
the<00:03:11.250> main<00:03:11.370> line<00:03:11.579> and<00:03:11.700> see<00:03:11.849> what<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.090> ideas<00:03:12.450> are

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
the main line and see what the ideas are

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.000 
the main line and see what the ideas are
behind<00:03:13.079> clean<00:03:13.379> h5

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
behind clean h5

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.009 
behind clean h5
so<00:03:15.079> after<00:03:16.079> Knight<00:03:16.230> c3<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.799> go<00:03:16.950> Queen<00:03:17.220> h5<00:03:18.019> white

and

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.590 
and
okay<00:03:33.390> if<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:33.990> castles<00:03:34.610> going<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.700> be<00:03:35.850> pretty

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
okay if you castles going to be pretty

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.050 
okay if you castles going to be pretty
much<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.960> same<00:03:37.170> if<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:38.040> place<00:03:38.220> h3<00:03:38.730> but<00:03:38.910> if<00:03:38.970> he

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
much the same if you place h3 but if he

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.730 
much the same if you place h3 but if he
doesn't<00:03:39.240> play<00:03:39.450> h3<00:03:39.840> for<00:03:40.020> example<00:03:40.410> if<00:03:40.470> we<00:03:40.590> go<00:03:40.620> to

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
doesn't play h3 for example if we go to

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.610 
doesn't play h3 for example if we go to
do<00:03:40.920> four<00:03:41.130> here<00:03:41.430> we<00:03:42.180> have<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.840> second<00:03:43.230> thematic

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
do four here we have the second thematic

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.240 
do four here we have the second thematic
idea

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
idea

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.580 
idea
look<00:03:44.910> at<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.210> pressure<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:45.930> we<00:03:46.080> have<00:03:46.320> so<00:03:46.560> a

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
look at that pressure that we have so a

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.040 
look at that pressure that we have so a
five<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.100> something<00:03:47.460> to<00:03:47.670> move<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.630> look<00:03:48.810> for

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
five is something to move to look for

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.570 
five is something to move to look for
all<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:50.070> time

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
all the time

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.460 
all the time
look<00:03:51.390> at<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.660> pressure<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.170> we<00:03:52.290> have

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
look at that pressure that we have

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.940 
look at that pressure that we have
towards<00:03:52.740> the<00:03:52.920> Queen<00:03:53.160> one<00:03:53.370> d1<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:54.860> if<00:03:55.860> you

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
towards the Queen one d1 so if you

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.890 
towards the Queen one d1 so if you
pushes<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.430> pawn<00:03:56.610> that's<00:03:56.970> absolutely

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
pushes the pawn that's absolutely

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.170 
pushes the pawn that's absolutely
harmless<00:03:58.140> we<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:58.860> keep<00:03:59.340> developing<00:04:00.030> our

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
harmless we can keep developing our

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.600 
harmless we can keep developing our
pieces<00:04:00.480> going<00:04:01.020> that<00:04:01.170> go<00:04:01.350> Knight<00:04:01.560> f6<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:02.310> idea

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
pieces going that go Knight f6 the idea

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.330 
pieces going that go Knight f6 the idea
of<00:04:02.700> like<00:04:03.510> efore<00:04:04.500> Bishop<00:04:04.950> d6<00:04:05.900> pointing<00:04:06.900> towards

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
of like efore Bishop d6 pointing towards

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.460 
of like efore Bishop d6 pointing towards
h2<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.700> if<00:04:08.790> your<00:04:08.940> point<00:04:09.180> place<00:04:09.390> h3<00:04:09.930> we<00:04:10.320> can

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
h2 and if your point place h3 we can

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.470 
h2 and if your point place h3 we can
sacrifice<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.130> bishop<00:04:11.250> on<00:04:11.550> h3<00:04:11.790> at<00:04:12.210> the<00:04:12.330> right

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
sacrifice the bishop on h3 at the right

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.560 
sacrifice the bishop on h3 at the right
moment<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.960> attack<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:16.500> second<00:04:16.890> idea<00:04:17.010> of

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
moment to attack so the second idea of

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.700 
moment to attack so the second idea of
this<00:04:18.570> position<00:04:19.200> is<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.680> have<00:04:20.270> b5<00:04:21.270> inserted<00:04:21.870> not

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
this position is to have b5 inserted not

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.650 
this position is to have b5 inserted not
only<00:04:22.980> to<00:04:23.100> pressure<00:04:23.370> King<00:04:23.730> side<00:04:23.970> but<00:04:24.180> also<00:04:24.360> your

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
only to pressure King side but also your

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.110 
only to pressure King side but also your
pressuring<00:04:25.200> Center<00:04:26.070> maybe<00:04:26.760> at<00:04:26.910> this<00:04:27.030> point

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
pressuring Center maybe at this point

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.660 
pressuring Center maybe at this point
game<00:04:27.660> your<00:04:27.840> points<00:04:28.230> filling<00:04:28.680> all<00:04:28.830> DC<00:04:29.100> and

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
game your points filling all DC and

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.520 
game your points filling all DC and
stuff<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.660> know<00:04:30.750> because<00:04:30.930> you're<00:04:31.290> just
