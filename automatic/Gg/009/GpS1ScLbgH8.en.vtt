it<00:01:57.299> down<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:58.200> throws<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.710> rock<00:01:58.979> which<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.490> thought

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
it down it throws a rock which I thought

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.109 
it down it throws a rock which I thought
was<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> really<00:01:59.969> cool<00:02:00.329> function<00:02:01.549> his<00:02:02.549> left<00:02:02.880> arm

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
was a really cool function his left arm

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.700 
was a really cool function his left arm
is<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.360> arm<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.659> does<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.960> his<00:02:04.079> right<00:02:04.259> arm<00:02:04.500> is

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
is the arm that does it his right arm is

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.399 
is the arm that does it his right arm is
however<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.759> want<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.060> pose<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.990> but<00:02:07.320> it

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
however you want to pose it but it

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.249 
however you want to pose it but it
doesn't<00:02:07.710> flick<00:02:08.069> anything<00:02:08.399> either<00:02:08.550> but<00:02:09.330> his

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
doesn't flick anything either but his

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.660 
doesn't flick anything either but his
hand<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.560> big<00:02:10.770> enough<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.039> put<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.520> another

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
hand is big enough to put in another

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.059 
hand is big enough to put in another
rock<00:02:12.060> monster<00:02:12.480> or

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
rock monster or

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.559 
rock monster or
power<00:02:13.519> minor<00:02:13.819> if<00:02:13.969> you<00:02:14.030> want<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.239> throw<00:02:14.390> them

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
power minor if you want to throw them

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.729 
power minor if you want to throw them
but<00:02:14.810> it's<00:02:14.930> supposed<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.349> be<00:02:15.439> filling<00:02:15.709> the

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
but it's supposed to be filling the

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.679 
but it's supposed to be filling the
boulder<00:02:16.129> so<00:02:16.700> if<00:02:16.849> you<00:02:16.939> want<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.150> throw<00:02:17.299> power

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
boulder so if you want to throw power

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.989 
boulder so if you want to throw power
miners<00:02:18.109> or<00:02:18.290> other<00:02:18.980> rock<00:02:19.249> monsters<00:02:19.609> around<00:02:19.819> you

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:19.999 
miners or other rock monsters around you

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:21.789 
miners or other rock monsters around you
can<00:02:20.209> but<00:02:20.450> that's<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.870> really<00:02:21.079> cool<00:02:21.230> function<00:02:21.499> I

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
can but that's a really cool function I

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.050 
can but that's a really cool function I
like<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.129> way<00:02:22.249> it<00:02:22.370> looks<00:02:22.549> he<00:02:22.670> looks<00:02:22.700> pretty

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
like the way it looks he looks pretty

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.750 
like the way it looks he looks pretty
tough<00:02:23.299> and<00:02:23.569> muscular<00:02:24.049> and<00:02:24.200> beefy<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:25.310> he's<00:02:25.730> a

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
tough and muscular and beefy so he's a

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.459 
tough and muscular and beefy so he's a
really<00:02:26.209> good<00:02:26.359> minifigure<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:26.810> like<00:02:27.019> him<00:02:27.230> it's

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:27.469 
really good minifigure I like him it's

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.170 
really good minifigure I like him it's
something<00:02:28.099> new<00:02:28.400> like<00:02:28.639> doesn't<00:02:28.909> ever<00:02:28.999> done

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
something new like doesn't ever done

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.500 
something new like doesn't ever done
before<00:02:29.299> and<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.569> like<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.989> but<00:02:31.090> on<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
before and I like it but on to the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.839 
before and I like it but on to the
vehicle<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.739> vehicle<00:02:33.769> is<00:02:34.219> very<00:02:34.250> cool-looking

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
vehicle the vehicle is very cool-looking

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.659 
vehicle the vehicle is very cool-looking
I<00:02:35.329> love<00:02:35.689> it<00:02:35.870> um<00:02:36.549> right<00:02:37.549> here<00:02:37.760> you've<00:02:37.939> got<00:02:38.650> four

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:39.669 
I love it um right here you've got four

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.459 
I love it um right here you've got four
rotating<00:02:40.669> blades<00:02:41.090> at<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.299> bottom<00:02:41.689> and<00:02:42.200> you've

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:42.469 
rotating blades at the bottom and you've

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.129 
rotating blades at the bottom and you've
got<00:02:42.709> four<00:02:43.040> bigger<00:02:43.370> blades<00:02:44.030> at<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.299> top<00:02:44.510> on

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:45.139 
got four bigger blades at the top on

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:49.030 
got four bigger blades at the top on
each<00:02:45.859> side<00:02:46.219> that<00:02:46.359> rotate<00:02:47.359> and<00:02:47.680> when<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.799> push

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
each side that rotate and when you push

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.909 
each side that rotate and when you push
the<00:02:49.219> vehicle<00:02:49.340> forward<00:02:49.969> they<00:02:50.209> all<00:02:50.389> rotate<00:02:50.989> but

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:51.919 
the vehicle forward they all rotate but

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.659 
the vehicle forward they all rotate but
there's<00:02:52.519> no<00:02:52.730> mechanism<00:02:53.139> inside<00:02:54.139> or<00:02:54.669> anywhere

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:55.669 
there's no mechanism inside or anywhere

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.429 
there's no mechanism inside or anywhere
that<00:02:55.819> makes<00:02:56.030> them<00:02:56.239> move<00:02:56.419> it<00:02:56.780> all<00:02:56.989> relies<00:02:57.379> on

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
that makes them move it all relies on

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.309 
that makes them move it all relies on
the<00:02:57.709> rotation<00:02:58.189> of<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.370> tires<00:02:58.989> these<00:02:59.989> blades

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
the rotation of the tires these blades

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.099 
the rotation of the tires these blades
rub<00:03:00.709> off<00:03:00.889> the<00:03:01.189> tire<00:03:01.609> and<00:03:01.939> cause<00:03:02.480> these<00:03:02.750> two<00:03:02.959> to

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
rub off the tire and cause these two to

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.920 
rub off the tire and cause these two to
spin<00:03:03.409> same<00:03:04.219> with<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.400> other<00:03:04.519> side<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:05.150> then

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
spin same with the other side and then

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.209 
spin same with the other side and then
the<00:03:06.230> grooves<00:03:06.680> on<00:03:06.889> the<00:03:06.980> tire<00:03:08.349> move<00:03:09.349> the<00:03:09.739> points

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
the grooves on the tire move the points

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:11.979 
the grooves on the tire move the points
on<00:03:10.370> these<00:03:10.730> blades<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.299> cause<00:03:11.510> these<00:03:11.780> to

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
on these blades and cause these to

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.740 
on these blades and cause these to
rotate<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:13.099> there's<00:03:13.250> no<00:03:13.459> real<00:03:13.819> like<00:03:14.150> function

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
rotate so there's no real like function

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.030 
rotate so there's no real like function
that<00:03:14.840> makes<00:03:15.079> them<00:03:15.230> move<00:03:15.409> except<00:03:15.799> for<00:03:15.980> the

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
that makes them move except for the

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.009 
that makes them move except for the
rotation<00:03:16.489> of<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.639> tires<00:03:16.879> which<00:03:17.659> I<00:03:17.810> thought

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
rotation of the tires which I thought

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.110 
rotation of the tires which I thought
was<00:03:18.139> a<00:03:18.169> little<00:03:18.290> bit<00:03:18.500> lazy<00:03:18.769> of<00:03:19.040> Lego<00:03:19.280> but

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
was a little bit lazy of Lego but

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.059 
was a little bit lazy of Lego but
nonetheless<00:03:20.569> it's<00:03:21.049> still<00:03:21.109> a<00:03:21.259> cool<00:03:21.500> function<00:03:21.979> I

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
nonetheless it's still a cool function I

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.439 
nonetheless it's still a cool function I
like<00:03:22.280> it<00:03:22.489> it<00:03:22.579> doesn't<00:03:22.729> take<00:03:22.879> away<00:03:23.030> from<00:03:23.239> the

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
like it it doesn't take away from the

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:27.490 
like it it doesn't take away from the
vehicle<00:03:24.069> but<00:03:25.069> on<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:26.090> side<00:03:26.329> here<00:03:26.689> it<00:03:27.169> comes

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
vehicle but on the side here it comes

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.580 
vehicle but on the side here it comes
with<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:27.919> safe<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.669> it<00:03:29.569> has<00:03:29.750> two<00:03:30.049> crystals

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
with a safe and it has two crystals

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.330 
with a safe and it has two crystals
inside<00:03:30.919> of<00:03:31.099> it<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:32.439> up<00:03:33.439> above<00:03:33.799> you<00:03:34.040> have<00:03:34.310> a

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
inside of it and up above you have a

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.119 
inside of it and up above you have a
shovel<00:03:34.579> holder<00:03:35.389> and<00:03:36.049> on<00:03:36.199> the<00:03:36.319> other<00:03:36.470> side<00:03:36.799> you

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
shovel holder and on the other side you

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.149 
shovel holder and on the other side you
have<00:03:37.159> a<00:03:37.400> pickaxe<00:03:37.879> holder<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.079> then<00:03:39.949> on<00:03:40.069> the

have a pickaxe holder and then on the

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.920 
have a pickaxe holder and then on the
back<00:03:40.340> here<00:03:40.609> these<00:03:40.759> things<00:03:41.000> fold<00:03:41.389> up<00:03:41.569> and<00:03:41.750> down
