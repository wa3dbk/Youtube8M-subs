00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.160
 the white fly is an insect in order 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.760
 hemiptera with 2 biotypes benizzi 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.010
 would end and belize would end up the insect is 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.830
 and attacks underneath the 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.940
 leaves suck the sap leaving the plant 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.860
 weakened 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.010
 besides weakening it the white fly 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.949
 can transmit viruses inject toxins 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.230
 fruits produced by their high 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.970
 reproduction capacity in its large 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.890
 power of destruction 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.989
 the whitefly considered one of the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.600
 major pests in the world today. 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.060
 world's agriculture are 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.899
 cotton quest 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.480
 melon beans and tomatoes and the insect attacks 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.969
 more than 700 species of plants 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.640
 currently present in practically 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.730
 all Brazilian states by virtue of 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.460
 the favorable climate high temperatures and 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.640
 dry climate the insect is responsible for 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.899
 losses in excess of 10 billion reais 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.990
 for agriculture 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.240
 according to data from the White Fly 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.250
 It is one of the more pests that damage has 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.010
 caused the bean culture in the 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.830
 South America for its toxic action 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.680
 and more so by the transmission of 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.729
 virus golden bean mosaic the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.369
 of gnv causing strong crop failures 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.409
 the growth of the golden mosaic in 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.290
 certain areas of brazil in recent years 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.009
 It was attributed to the rapid expansion of 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.990
 soybean crop because it is the main 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.450
 host for both food and 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.450
 for the multiplication of the white search 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.540
 the population of the whitefly is dependent 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.240
 of climatic variables being low as 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.850
 during the dry season. 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.659
 population level of this insect increases. 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.000
 due to high temperatures 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.210
 these insects are usually reproduced by 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.790
 Asexual are there for them and me 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.060
 that the newborn fixes if the tissue 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.850
 foliar remains practically immobile 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.489
 sucking the sap from the plant to the 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.310
 adult insect emergency 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.459
 the cycle in the whitefly varies according to 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.140
 such as temperature and host plant 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.660
 several researchers state that the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.120
 the white population is higher in search 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.630
 end of the hot season when rains 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.420
 are not very strong or when the 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.480
 harvesting of certain crops which favors 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.319
 the migration of the insect but tends to 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.470
 decrease after the long cold periods 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.030
 gold mosaic virus has affected 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.260
 decisively the fall in productivity 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.400
 of beans with losses ranging from 40% to 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.799
 100% 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.420
 besides seriously affecting the quality 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.600
 of grains 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.390
 such losses depend on the age of the plant 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.120
 at the time of the inauguration of the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.190
 tolerance of the cultivar and possibly 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.860
 of virus strains 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.209
 the first symptoms of the disease appear 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:17.810
 under field conditions between 14 and 17 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.030
 days after planting in the presence of high 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.720
 number of whiteflies carrying 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.720
 virus 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.090
 although the clearer symptoms appear 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.570
 when the plants have three or more 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.230
 four tri sheets veneers from 25 to 30 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.570
 days 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.510
 in cases involving a bright yellow type 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.730
 of golden mosaic where the young leaves 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.220
 can stick together 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.470
 generally with little reduction in the 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.870
 sheet size 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.359
 among the control measures is that the 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.940
 use of varieties with tolerance to 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.739
 golden mosaic virus choice 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.230
 periods and regions with lower 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.989
 probability of occurrence of the music 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.840
 white weed disposal in 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.859
 areas close to farming and control 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:08.500
 chemical treatment via seed treatment and 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:08.500
 conversations with systemic insecticides
