00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:55.490 

it<00:01:57.650> wouldn't<00:01:58.010> start<00:01:58.220> like<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.670> Warner<00:01:59.119> stop

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.810 

the<00:02:56.070> gear<00:02:56.370> ain't<00:02:56.640> loud<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.360> quite<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.820> metal

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
the gear ain't loud is quite the metal

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
dollars for the gear I think that I

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.500 
dollars for the gear I think that I
think<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:12.560> eflite<00:03:13.560> tried<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.220> with<00:03:14.510> the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
think that eflite tried it with the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.920 
think that eflite tried it with the
metal<00:03:15.870> gear<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.670> made<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.820> as<00:03:17.940> an<00:03:18.150> option<00:03:18.360> for

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
metal gear and made it as an option for

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.600 
metal gear and made it as an option for
the<00:03:19.820> for<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.850> consumer<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:22.280> make<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> choice

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
the for the consumer to make a choice

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:31.040 
the for the consumer to make a choice
that<00:03:23.670> they<00:03:23.910> want<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.300> use<00:03:24.450> metal<00:03:24.930> gear<00:03:25.200> or<00:03:30.050> the

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
that they want to use metal gear or the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.229 
that they want to use metal gear or the
plastic<00:03:31.500> gear<00:03:31.680> that<00:03:31.830> comes<00:03:32.070> stock<00:03:32.459> if<00:03:33.060> they

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
plastic gear that comes stock if they

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.120 
plastic gear that comes stock if they
would<00:03:33.450> have<00:03:33.540> used<00:03:33.570> a<00:03:33.840> metal<00:03:34.050> gear<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.709> would

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
would have used a metal gear it would

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.780 
would have used a metal gear it would
have<00:03:35.280> been<00:03:38.420> it<00:03:39.420> would<00:03:39.540> have<00:03:39.600> been<00:03:40.580> right<00:03:41.580> at

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
have been it would have been right at

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.890 
have been it would have been right at
three<00:03:42.120> hundred<00:03:42.270> dollars<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:44.390> I<00:03:47.780> think<00:03:48.780> they

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
three hundred dollars and I think they

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.740 
three hundred dollars and I think they
just<00:03:48.930> made<00:03:49.320> where<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:50.010> can<00:03:50.130> be<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.310> choice<00:03:50.750> for

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
just made where it can be a choice for

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.290 
just made where it can be a choice for
the<00:03:51.810> consumer<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:53.030> pick<00:03:54.030> up<00:03:55.010> pick<00:03:56.010> up<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.610> cost

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
the consumer to pick up pick up the cost

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.890 
the consumer to pick up pick up the cost
on<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:58.280> if<00:03:59.280> they<00:03:59.549> wanted<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:02.450> purchase<00:04:03.450> this

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
on that if they wanted to purchase this

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.740 
on that if they wanted to purchase this
gear<00:04:05.450> so<00:04:06.860> I'm<00:04:07.860> glad<00:04:08.250> they<00:04:09.140> had<00:04:10.140> this<00:04:10.440> gear<00:04:10.830> as<00:04:11.040> a

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
gear so I'm glad they had this gear as a

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:19.520 
gear so I'm glad they had this gear as a
secondary<00:04:14.150> as<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.510> secondary<00:04:16.669> choice<00:04:18.530> the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
secondary as a secondary choice the
