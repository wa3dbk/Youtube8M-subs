00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.509
 5 

00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:06.129
 block their control presented just a year ago at the Geneva show 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.420
 then tested on more than 7000 France the electric car of Bolloré after 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.000
 his first road trips to the public first in brittany several projects 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.729
 that we were able to take it in hand 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:18.989
 it is also vincendeau lopez denmark who introduced the vehicle 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.589
 he even took the wheel for turbo 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.710
 and it's a marvel of designers have not been able in France 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.099
 to advance the battery that finally allows to have the first electric car 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.050
 with enough autonomy of French it's something 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.930
 exceptional in the French mention 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.930
 and with a volley 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.240
 compared to that 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.110
 your electric car the apple care innoveox on several points he has 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.290
 was originally designed around an electric motor which explains its 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.020
 particular architecture 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.129
 the lawyer around the place for his passengers and in the trunk 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.500
 not bad for a car that is only three meters long then she can 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.700
 to go much further than others 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.230
 it allows today to donate 100 km a little more than a month 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.510
 it achieves a speed of 225 km 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.300
 and there accelerations it is quite spectacular we have the ideal car 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.440
 on the round neck in the second 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.560
 and when we know that motorists are only 50 km per day on average 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.190
 urban cycle the challenger is at hand 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.600
 the result is in any case in line with expectations and perhaps even more 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.950
 with an acceleration from 0 to 60 km in 6 seconds 3 of products most 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.250
 red fire sedans 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.660
 on the advice of an expert with nicolas prost he is interested in the subject and has 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.660
 wished and if health ars before its launch 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.410
 those cars that me 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.090
 which is very everything is spent driving so predicting and very 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.930
 exploitable digitally online parking 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.790
 so it's certainly but the car is more than ever young 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.050
 conductors 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.620
 public relations operation and successful but need to go further and 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.890
 convince a builder now 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.030
 goal is to develop the homeland 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.450
 with a car manufacturer cf 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.090
 only maybe 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.410
 in any case the future is played here in Brittany near quimperlé albert lookout 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.030
 gabéric m the bolloré group made a fortune in the carpet and then the movies 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.479
 plastics and wires 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.760
 that's how he managed to control energy storage and create with 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:19.700
 using df 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.729
 Basque society to manufacture batteries 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:26.239
 150 million euros they have also be invested to build a 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.239
 new factory by the end of 2010 the secret here it is the battery 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.219
 lithium metal polymer technology that the bolloré group is the only one to 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.219
 master it took close to 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.569
 logical the bolloré group is the only one to master it took almost fifteen 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.830
 years of research to develop this product for the recipe and the staff 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.139
 is created here are the characteristics 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.649
 compared to lead batteries 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:55.209
 it's three times smaller for that it takes that young and in what 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.709
 regards their reliability 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.700
 and because of the regime allow to operate for ten years in September 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.069
 in vain despite his pole performances scored 240 kilos of batteries 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.030
 in the vehicle 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.100
 the weight still passes handicap 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.139
 but at baxter ap on is confident 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.439
 we can work on the design of the packaging 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.670
 reduce its size hold against m as a whole by the power to himself 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.129
 realize that a victory 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.430
 it is no longer necessary to pray for the success of the burqa 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.280
 from the salon of geneva requests a flow from manufacturers 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.330
 including renault which has expressed its intention to produce cars 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.299
 electrical 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.400
 go in every three years to find out if you will have failed her 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.749
 bet of a clean French car
