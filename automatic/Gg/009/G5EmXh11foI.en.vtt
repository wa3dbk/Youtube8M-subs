00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 the one that happens kids how are we 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.060
 welcome to the hon crafter show 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:11.599
 minecraft and good today I bring you a 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.599
 special a special let 's go is that 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:18.090
 this already says in itself what 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.090
 special that is and good 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.240
 that is the beginning of a new series 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.350
 which consists of I look for constructions 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.660
 epics and then I put them to download 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.630
 and well, here is the first 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.920
 episode an epic epic action not what 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.150
 next a good dream hotel of the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.030
 dream has escaped the dream 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.860
 directly it 's a fucking hotel 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.860
 huge as you can check 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.550
 and well let's comment a little bit how 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.460
 is built and you can see that 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.140
 is not cured the next super q 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.480
 very strange 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.309
 let's go here in plan d 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.340
 of staying here not and good 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.040
 is that you can lose I was before 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.140
 before I started recording I was 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.659
 going around here 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.100
 look this is my neighbor from the room 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.100
 across the street good 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.850
 son of six neighbors borghi 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.760
 and it's so big that you 're 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.590
 there was even the video 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.600
 now I trace them seeing a little bit 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.680
 varied as it is being given to me 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.500
 as well 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.490
 but 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.490
 but ethical 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.590
 it's a construction let's go 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.540
 from what I have seen it also stands out in 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.270
 the shape of the arches of the windows 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.200
 and how it's decorated inside is something 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.200
 a little unusual 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:00.299
 uses a lot of crystal effects with 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.299
 the water as you can see you keep 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.130
 well nothing I have not said anything in the 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.900
 walls that is very curious to do well 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.410
 then it's supposed to be there 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.540
 of the water obviously 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:18.370
 if this does as if it were a 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.610
 Spa does not make the effect is the win 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.540
 and I 've already lost, in fact, I've already 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.190
 lost by the map 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.980
 and 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.780
 I do not know here how useful you can be 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.420
 find this since it's done in a 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.450
 flat map it would be good if those 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.430
 play some hunger games' here and I think that 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.290
 he puts traps and 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.420
 and then another tells your friends 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.020
 I know 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.720
 ideas you already know that there is a lot is that 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.900
 is that he has been seeing it and I say uy 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.930
 I have this 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:02.540
 and here is white 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.540
 to the library obviously 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.290
 on top of the disc is everything 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.400
 it is very well vital 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.700
 and good nothing more than commenting garden 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.590
 It's cool and I'm already loading something but yes 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.590
 I would like to comment a little on the roof 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:36.020
 what from above is a pass 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.020
 and that sphere gives a perfect touch 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.380
 and very symmetric the truth I fix 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.850
 from here it is very symmetrical 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.190
 It is exactly the same 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.830
 and that's what I like most about 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.530
 all 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.069
 and well I hope you liked this 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.900
 first chapter 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.219
 the download link I leave it in the 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:06.489
 description together with the one that has done 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:06.489
 what we're worth, let's go 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.440
 my mother is super handsome one since she 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.540
 he has repeated 500 times 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.850
 and finally 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.120
 leave the boy's link that he has made 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.120
 this 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.880
 and the download link 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.450
 a little more end I hope that I have 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.140
 liked 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.140
 See you later
