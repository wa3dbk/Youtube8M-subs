00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.990
 now welcome to the green of the 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.470
 ministers will speak another application 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:31.730
 We can replace your camera in your 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:34.820
 in the morning and this app is a 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.970
 application that is unfortunately paid or 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.060
 is not because it had a friction in the 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:46.060
 a passage through the various 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.300
 options to show how complete 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.930
 automatic 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:01:00.079
 nothing is there that we have here we have the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:01:06.909
 options that have the function of several 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:15.009
 options brings the front camera and then 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:15.009
 settings remained unsaid 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:24.289
 then we'll have a picture and let the 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.299
 see below an image of the map and I 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.859
 will demonstrate this photo was taken from 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.420
 social knowledge automatically 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:39.079
 recognition through 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:41.420
 facebook for example zoom in and 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:46.369
 save to the card does not live on the phone 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:58.789
 at this moment it is the centaur after sounds 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:02:04.039
 I'll send the smell that the structure 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:07.609
 stay there to come back here we have 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.819
 these options in which we have a control of the 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.430
 white balance or automatic 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.989
 saying we are for example 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.569
 I did not show the turkey plot with 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.180
 alan per cent and has one that 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.430
 It's in the air, or we do not have the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.700
 we have the exhibition - today - how much 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.129
 we can alternate the different levels of 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.500
 exposure and also put the iso 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.719
 automatic time 100 200 400 and 800 no 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.230
 we have more time only 800 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:42.609
 Then I focus because it's from here that 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:47.739
 what was here that it is here 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:49.870
 then we will have tomorrow 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.090
 framing of sofia emblems put 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.220
 Tuesday sexual rules 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.799
 inscriptions to the square, for example, and 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.909
 we have here to have an ace 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:06.189
 subdividing renal part and hoping to fall 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:07.750
 then we have here for you took only us 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:11.189
 we can do it because it's a step in 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.840
 horizon we found a photograph of the 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.150
 tv for example speaks so is a landscape 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.049
 we have, for example, the sea in sight and 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:24.340
 we should not facilitate the framework 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:26.949
 and stabilization is that everything is 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.510
 here to switch to the machine for 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:31.829
 machine for the front camera 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.549
 in this case was the rear camera 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.609
 watch it out 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.489
 then we have here the molds ie will 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:42.129
 a normal fault is that for a screen 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.150
 we have enough any yes I take one 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.540
 photography 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.859
 then we have here enough so it is 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.199
 We can take a picture for 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.699
 example 55 seconds or whatever is 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:54.040
 I take a break 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:56.139
 we have to put more or less in this 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.159
 If it is in 5 seconds, we can 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.290
 take a picture 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:03.970
 just press once at 35 seconds 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.979
 will make an acquisition later we have 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.259
 image stabilization and then we have 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:11.439
 to work here 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:14.019
 normal is that switching to video mode is 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:17.829
 we created the turkey later in the gallery 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:20.529
 We still have a few options years back. 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.990
 Back home is information on the 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:25.630
 photo has not been submitted 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.790
 by the sata and the person who shot 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.190
 then French so we do not show up here 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.400
 let's have here also mixed 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.530
 we do not have the colors and everything we have is 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.510
 in training turned back after still 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.300
 by the chef here or shared 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:45.580
 photography for application to the cloud 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:47.980
 the morning that is the company that developed 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.200
 facebook software to see it to 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.660
 or more picasa and only are prefects because 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.220
 we have another and I will go through all the 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.490
 applications that you liked nothing 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.700
 to make into a one share 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.130
 then we still have several chances to 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.040
 make a transformation in photography is 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.630
 that put effects transform cut 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.520
 dad 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:17.910
 we have here and not one of the options 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:17.910
 filters that are textures 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:28.840
 I hope to put also animations 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:33.430
 movie where I make animations frames of 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.950
 which are small engines to pay 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.630
 we pay here appears in the picture the 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:43.470
 sign just sign multiple photos 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:46.120
 so on the way to build if so 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:52.300
 we can sign several sources I will pay 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:54.640
 for example these to a normal 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.950
 signing after we have here everything is not 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.900
 I everything works shows all 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.950
 photos and videos together here only 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.660
 the video is at 1.332 if you put up thousand 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.980
 three hundred and thirty-two photos and five 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.600
 videos with whom he had lived processes 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.600
 included 12345 costa 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:20.500
 all I can talk more 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.910
 and that's it, I can not go any further 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.740
 so you do not have anything else 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.810
 but as you can see is because the team 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.620
 It was quite complete for you to have 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:33.220
 another way to give FIFA 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.410
 with the application comes native to your 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.810
 love of our operating system is the 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.540
 santana 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:42.150
 I have been one more video of cimi with 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.840
 conversion of the worst at IMF command and 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.840
 to the next
