well but if you get a wood shaft like
the<00:00:48.110> one<00:00:48.230> that<00:00:48.379> I<00:00:48.410> have<00:00:48.620> on<00:00:48.769> the<00:00:48.860> cue<00:00:49.040> here

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
the one that I have on the cue here

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:50.799 
the one that I have on the cue here
you've<00:00:49.850> got<00:00:50.000> to<00:00:50.089> be<00:00:50.180> very<00:00:50.299> careful<00:00:50.600> because

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
it's very easy for it to get nicked I

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.420 
it's very easy for it to get nicked I
recommend<00:00:53.570> for<00:00:53.930> example<00:00:54.350> that<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:54.920> place<00:00:55.190> the

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.259 
I see people set their cue like this and
then<00:01:00.080> their<00:01:00.260> fall<00:01:00.470> on<00:01:00.619> the<00:01:00.799> floor

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
then their fall on the floor

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.609

in the in the cover sometimes you can
take<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.260> knob<00:01:33.770> off<00:01:34.010> and<00:01:34.760> that<00:01:35.240> will<00:01:35.360> create

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
take the knob off and that will create

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.270 
take the knob off and that will create
the<00:01:35.659> hole<00:01:35.990> put<00:01:36.500> two<00:01:36.680> or<00:01:36.710> three<00:01:36.800> inches<00:01:37.130> of

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
the hole put two or three inches of

the hole put two or three inches of
water<00:01:37.310> in<00:01:37.700> there<00:01:37.850> get<00:01:38.060> it<00:01:38.150> boiling<00:01:38.510> hot<00:01:38.690> and

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
water in there get it boiling hot and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.590 
water in there get it boiling hot and
let<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.560> steam<00:01:39.800> hit<00:01:40.159> right<00:01:40.370> on<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.610> Nick<00:01:40.820> and

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
let the steam hit right on the Nick and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.500 
let the steam hit right on the Nick and
for<00:01:41.930> about<00:01:42.080> 30<00:01:42.350> seconds<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.010> then<00:01:43.360> check<00:01:44.360> it

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
for about 30 seconds and then check it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.450 
for about 30 seconds and then check it
with<00:01:44.630> some<00:01:44.810> sandpaper<00:01:45.170> see<00:01:45.620> if<00:01:45.680> it's<00:01:45.830> okay<00:01:46.220> and

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
with some sandpaper see if it's okay and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.960 
with some sandpaper see if it's okay and
maybe<00:01:47.120> try<00:01:47.330> it<00:01:47.479> again<00:01:47.600> but<00:01:48.610> for<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.670> lot<00:01:49.820> of

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
maybe try it again but for a lot of

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.430 
maybe try it again but for a lot of
people<00:01:50.270> these<00:01:50.390> Nick's<00:01:50.750> become<00:01:51.140> a<00:01:51.170> real
