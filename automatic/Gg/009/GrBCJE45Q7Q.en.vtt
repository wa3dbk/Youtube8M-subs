 it's very simple look good you 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.500
 put false eyelashes and I will need 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.500
 fossils and then an express glue 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.870
 fossils and tweezers 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.290
 I will take the fossils using 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.840
 tweezers 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:50.760
 I gently remove them from their 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:53.129
 packaging and I will check if the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.899
 inches they are a good length like 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:01.230
 a mannequin so I do not pose 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.430
 provisionally to check and yes 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.640
 it's the right length 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.260
 I can then paste them like this 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.060
 she will never be good I 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.810
 listen to it a little bit with 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:19.340
 scissors I take my school and I apply 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:26.189
 a tiny amount on the edge 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:32.720
 sewn then I place them well at 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:36.409
 middle and I support both ends 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.170
 gently I do not pose at the level of the eyelashes 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.329
 to have in the middle of the eye and then 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.869
 I can lightly on both 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.470
 ends to do it well stuck on 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.180
 skin anger is always a little 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.700
 white but once dry 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.780
 she will be transparent so invisible 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:03.880
 once posed I continue with the other 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:06.789
 sylla I apply the glue 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.789
 and I go again I could at 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.099
 middle of the eye and when the glue and 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.069
 dominic fully transparent and 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.260
 to dry them and that's the look of the fossils 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.580
 and an option if we still want 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.620
 strengthen the 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.770
 the look we can put some mascara 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.770
 black
