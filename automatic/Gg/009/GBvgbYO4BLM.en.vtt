00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.690 

anyways<00:02:54.620> let's<00:02:54.800> try<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.040> Frank

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
anyways let's try the Frank

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.330 
anyways let's try the Frank
maybe<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.330> Frank<00:02:56.630> will<00:02:56.780> at<00:02:56.930> least<00:02:57.110> at<00:02:58.010> least

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
maybe the Frank will at least at least

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.690 
maybe the Frank will at least at least
be<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.640> little<00:02:59.090> more<00:02:59.240> rewarding<00:03:00.460> just<00:03:01.460> by<00:03:01.670> a

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
be a little more rewarding just by a

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.340 
be a little more rewarding just by a
scale<00:03:02.090> comparison<00:03:02.570> there<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:02.780> have<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.080> bean

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
scale comparison there you have the bean

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.200 
scale comparison there you have the bean
and<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.830> Frank<00:03:04.190> if<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:04.610> full-sized

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
and the Frank if that is a full-sized

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.440 
and the Frank if that is a full-sized
hotdog<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:06.410> can<00:03:06.530> see<00:03:06.680> that<00:03:06.830> scaling<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.610> not

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
hotdog you can see that scaling is not

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.080 
hotdog you can see that scaling is not
quite<00:03:08.750> accurate<00:03:08.990> but<00:03:09.550> it's<00:03:10.550> bubblegum<00:03:10.880> we're

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
quite accurate but it's bubblegum we're

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.540 
quite accurate but it's bubblegum we're
not<00:03:11.210> gonna<00:03:11.300> be<00:03:11.420> very<00:03:11.480> nit<00:03:11.870> picking<00:03:12.110> of<00:03:12.350> it

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
not gonna be very nit picking of it

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.340
