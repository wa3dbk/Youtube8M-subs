00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.300 
go over a lot of that however what I do
want<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> show<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.930> hit<00:01:46.110> 0<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:47.159> go

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
want to show you is if you hit 0 to go

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.030 
want to show you is if you hit 0 to go
to<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.549> cameras<00:01:47.970> view<00:01:48.240> point<00:01:48.560> then<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.860> can

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
to the cameras view point then you can

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.420 
to the cameras view point then you can
hit<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.490> hold<00:01:50.670> down<00:01:50.820> shift<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.509> hit<00:01:52.470> F<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
hit and hold down shift and hit F and

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.780 
hit and hold down shift and hit F and
you<00:01:53.810> can<00:01:54.810> move<00:01:55.170> around<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.680> camera<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
you can move around the camera and the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.520 
you can move around the camera and the
way<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.630> just<00:01:57.750> by<00:01:58.079> moving<00:01:58.350> your

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
way you do that is just by moving your

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.730 
way you do that is just by moving your
mouse<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:59.100> down<00:01:59.700> left<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.509> right<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:01.140> pan<00:02:01.439> and

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
mouse up down left and right to pan and

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.370 
mouse up down left and right to pan and
it's<00:02:02.250> kind<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.520> slow<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:02.790> be<00:02:03.090> patient<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.659> then

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
it's kind of slow so be patient and then

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.350 
it's kind of slow so be patient and then
if<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.649> hold<00:02:04.920> down<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.250> scroll<00:02:05.759> wheel<00:02:05.969> button

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
if you hold down the scroll wheel button

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.229 
if you hold down the scroll wheel button
just<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.960> move<00:02:07.110> around<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.799> 3d<00:02:08.310> if<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
just like to move around in 3d if you

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.240 
just like to move around in 3d if you
hold<00:02:09.539> down<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.780> scroll<00:02:10.110> button

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
hold down the scroll button

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.300 
hold down the scroll button
and<00:02:11.340> move<00:02:11.700> it'll<00:02:12.090> dolly<00:02:12.440> up<00:02:13.440> down<00:02:13.740> left<00:02:14.130> and

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
and move it'll dolly up down left and

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.880 
and move it'll dolly up down left and
right<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.900> that's<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.110> easiest<00:02:16.380> way<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.650> get

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
right and that's the easiest way to get

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.050 
right and that's the easiest way to get
around<00:02:16.950> or<00:02:17.880> if<00:02:18.450> you're<00:02:18.660> used<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.200> say<00:02:19.680> like<00:02:19.890> a

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
around or if you're used to say like a

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.400 
around or if you're used to say like a
first-person<00:02:21.060> shooter<00:02:21.600> game<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:22.080> can<00:02:22.230> use

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
first-person shooter game you can use

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.330 
first-person shooter game you can use
the<00:02:22.620> WASD<00:02:23.070> keys<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.180> move<00:02:25.130> make<00:02:26.130> sure<00:02:26.250> you're

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
the WASD keys to move make sure you're

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.040 
the WASD keys to move make sure you're
holding<00:02:26.430> down<00:02:26.700> make<00:02:27.600> sure<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.810> press<00:02:27.990> shift

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
holding down make sure you press shift

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.440 
holding down make sure you press shift
and<00:02:28.560> then<00:02:28.650> F<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.190> select<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:29.790> mode<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:30.240> move

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
and then F to select this mode to move

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.860 
and then F to select this mode to move
but<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.200> can<00:02:31.410> use<00:02:31.560> WASD<00:02:32.180> but<00:02:33.180> be<00:02:33.360> careful

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
but you can use WASD but be careful

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.540 
but you can use WASD but be careful
because<00:02:34.459> it's<00:02:35.459> not<00:02:35.790> like<00:02:37.040> it's<00:02:38.040> not<00:02:38.250> like<00:02:38.430> you

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
because it's not like it's not like you

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.930 
because it's not like it's not like you
think

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
think

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.390 
think
it<00:02:39.540> doesn't<00:02:39.990> necessarily<00:02:40.230> move<00:02:40.830> while<00:02:41.310> you're

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
it doesn't necessarily move while you're

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.400 
it doesn't necessarily move while you're
holding<00:02:41.580> down<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.330> then<00:02:42.480> stop<00:02:42.900> when<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.260> let

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
holding down and then stop when you let

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.190 
holding down and then stop when you let
it<00:02:43.470> up<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:44.190> just<00:02:44.370> accelerates<00:02:45.209> more<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:46.050> more

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
it up it just accelerates more the more

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.570 
it up it just accelerates more the more
you<00:02:46.260> hold<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.650> down<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.040> it's<00:02:47.160> kind<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.430> hard

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
you hold it down and it's kind of hard

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.460 
you hold it down and it's kind of hard
to<00:02:47.640> control<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.300> actually<00:02:48.660> prefer<00:02:49.170> just

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
to control so I actually prefer just

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.270 
to control so I actually prefer just
using<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.920> mouse<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:51.290> panning<00:02:52.290> holding<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
using the mouse and panning holding the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.940 
using the mouse and panning holding the
scroll<00:02:53.580> wheel<00:02:53.820> it's<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.900> pan<00:02:55.170> up-down

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
scroll wheel it's a pan up-down

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.350 
scroll wheel it's a pan up-down
left-right<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.459> just<00:02:56.580> move<00:02:56.730> your<00:02:56.850> mouse<00:02:57.030> and

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
left-right and just move your mouse and

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.280 
left-right and just move your mouse and
then<00:02:58.730> up<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.970> down<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.630> then<00:03:00.840> if<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.050> let<00:03:01.260> go

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
then up and down and then if you let go

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.110 
then up and down and then if you let go
the<00:03:01.470> scroll<00:03:01.830> wheel<00:03:01.950> it'll<00:03:02.220> look<00:03:02.489> around<00:03:02.880> and

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
the scroll wheel it'll look around and

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.180 
the scroll wheel it'll look around and
you<00:03:03.209> can<00:03:03.360> change<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.810> scene<00:03:04.080> now<00:03:04.800> if<00:03:05.010> you're

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
you can change the scene now if you're

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.550 
you can change the scene now if you're
working<00:03:05.400> on<00:03:05.610> animation<00:03:06.300> or<00:03:06.600> picture<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.260> any
