00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.789
 since animal welfare is tested for those motorcyclists including two 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.000
 the sought after airbag best safety systems for the neck 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.829
 The protection systems were tested in two halves of crash-test situations 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.439
 because of an intersection and drop at 50 kilometers per hour and one 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.439
 Single accident because the driver slips away 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.510
 300 kilometers per hour 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.320
 as another we have the everyday use of the objects 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.199
 tested 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.869
 and individual loads such as the load on the back or 

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:40.670
 deliberately 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.390
 the motor he way that is a tour to eat and an integrated awakens 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.239
 could most convince the St 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.719
 the elite time is fine fast enough the scope is extreme 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.710
 big star is born 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.230
 over the neck 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.970
 and he was good at almost all the criteria that the x he is standing for 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:01.810
 jacket 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.530
 unfortunately could not convincing in all criteria the triggering time 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.670
 Langers takes half a second that is just too long in the accident 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.110
 and the protection does not come in time 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.770
 In the test we were able to find out all the innovative protection system for the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.780
 motorcyclist 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.440
 because the actual benefit 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.370
 if a protective function 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.980
 mainly in the field of moderate accidents, the Chamber 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.620
 Reduce accident severity 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.940
 because the smallest system he matured one hundred percent 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.540
 they still have weaknesses 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.270
 For example, keep your bags on their seats too long 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.660
 or limitations of comfort 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.280
 Based on the test results, the ADAC demands faster from the manufacturers 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.740
 trigger times of active systems 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.150
 as well as a carpentry tripping over food should be gone 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.560
 then the head area in case of severe accidents the Drost injury 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.020
 second place 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.490
 For the manufacturers here required to offer more protection in the field of breast 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.590
 The future potential of the Ehrbeck protective systems in the motorcycle sector is good 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.270
 only in everyday use, there are still some weaknesses here are the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.740
 Manufacturer requested to improve
