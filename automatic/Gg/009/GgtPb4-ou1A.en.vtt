00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
I and then I had this flash of reality

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.160 
I and then I had this flash of reality
wait<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.489> minute

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170

Newton's<00:02:38.170> law<00:02:38.409> is<00:02:38.470> equal<00:02:38.769> an<00:02:39.420> equal<00:02:40.420> force<00:02:41.400> you

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
Newton's law is equal an equal force you

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.039 
Newton's law is equal an equal force you
know<00:02:42.549> equal<00:02:42.879> force<00:02:43.120> be<00:02:43.299> equal<00:02:43.659> for<00:02:43.810> whatever

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.869 
know equal force be equal for whatever
that<00:02:44.319> thing<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.530> everything<00:02:45.250> is<00:02:45.370> equal

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
that thing is everything is equal

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.610 
that thing is everything is equal
and<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.359> realize<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.900> but<00:02:47.049> it<00:02:47.200> went<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.500> a

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
and I realize it but it went in a

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.780 
and I realize it but it went in a
dropkick<00:02:47.859> when<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.280> go<00:02:48.340> up<00:02:48.489> in<00:02:48.579> the<00:02:48.639> air<00:02:48.760> like

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
dropkick when you go up in the air like

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.750 
dropkick when you go up in the air like
that<00:02:48.940> any<00:02:49.840> force<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:50.470> push<00:02:50.769> is<00:02:51.220> hardly<00:02:51.639> any

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
that any force you push is hardly any

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.300 
that any force you push is hardly any
force<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.239> all<00:02:52.389> the<00:02:52.900> reality<00:02:53.440> is<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.829> dropkick
