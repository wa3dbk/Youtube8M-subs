00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
science fiction ish and really exact

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.100 
science fiction ish and really exact
scientific<00:01:20.330> consistency<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.509> really<00:01:21.780> not<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
scientific consistency is really not the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.810 
scientific consistency is really not the
point<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.710> kino's<00:01:22.979> journey<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.759> a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
point in kino's journey this is a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.630 
point in kino's journey this is a
philosophical<00:01:24.090> anime<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.310> point<00:01:26.490> is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
philosophical anime and so the point is

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.819 
philosophical anime and so the point is
more<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> make<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.090> think<00:01:27.479> than<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.439> try<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
more to make you think than to try to

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.850 
more to make you think than to try to
create<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.909> complete<00:01:30.689> world<00:01:31.110> which<00:01:31.530> has<00:01:31.560> they

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
development throughout it now it was

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.569 
development throughout it now it was
made<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.479> early<00:01:36.750> 2000s<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.829> budgets<00:01:38.369> were

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
made in the early 2000s so budgets were

colors muted greens and browns a lot of
earth<00:02:10.200> tones<00:02:10.500> actually<00:02:11.069> but<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.550> general

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
earth tones actually but in general

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.150 
earth tones actually but in general
colors<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.620> aren't<00:02:13.830> as

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.800 
colors that aren't as
right<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.550> typical<00:02:15.000> anime<00:02:15.420> which<00:02:15.570> again<00:02:15.750> is

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
right a typical anime which again is

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.620 
right a typical anime which again is
nice<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:16.500> bit<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:16.770> relief<00:02:17.300> also<00:02:18.300> the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
nice and bit of a relief also the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.110 
nice and bit of a relief also the
characters<00:02:19.170> themselves<00:02:19.470> have<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.400> soft

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
roundedness to them which is makes it

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.280 
roundedness to them which is makes it
look<00:02:23.040> distinctive<00:02:23.520> now<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.570> direction<00:02:24.930> is

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
look distinctive now the direction is
