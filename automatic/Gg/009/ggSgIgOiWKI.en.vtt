00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
with some tiny tiny shimmers in it very

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.820 
with some tiny tiny shimmers in it very
very<00:01:07.710> pretty<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:09.080> I'm<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.260> gonna<00:01:10.409> put<00:01:10.680> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
very pretty and I'm just gonna put a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.850 
very pretty and I'm just gonna put a
tiny<00:01:11.159> bit<00:01:11.310> onto<00:01:11.790> my<00:01:11.820> brush<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.540> I'm<00:01:13.470> gonna<00:01:13.619> put

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
tiny bit onto my brush and I'm gonna put

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.350 
tiny bit onto my brush and I'm gonna put
that<00:01:13.890> into<00:01:14.280> my<00:01:14.400> crease<00:01:16.549> in<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.729> window<00:01:18.119> wiper

motion

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.840 

so<00:01:23.210> this<00:01:23.360> is<00:01:23.540> going<00:01:23.690> to<00:01:23.780> keep<00:01:24.020> with<00:01:24.470> the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
so this is going to keep with the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.200 
so this is going to keep with the
consistency<00:01:25.850> of<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:27.340> shimmering<00:01:28.340> base<00:01:28.820> that

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
consistency of the shimmering base that

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.000 
consistency of the shimmering base that
is<00:01:29.330> just<00:01:29.510> gonna<00:01:29.630> give<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.170> eye<00:01:30.200> a<00:01:30.350> little<00:01:30.710> bit

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
is just gonna give the eye a little bit

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.100 
is just gonna give the eye a little bit
more<00:01:31.280> depth<00:01:31.520> I'm<00:01:32.270> gonna<00:01:32.540> take<00:01:32.869> a<00:01:33.729> very

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
more depth I'm gonna take a very

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.890 
more depth I'm gonna take a very
skintone<00:01:36.369> light<00:01:37.369> color<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.270> it's<00:01:38.630> called

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
skintone light color and it's called

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.580 
skintone light color and it's called
naked<00:01:39.200> it's<00:01:39.710> this<00:01:40.070> color<00:01:40.310> right<00:01:40.550> here<00:01:41.590> it

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
naked it's this color right here it

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.420 
naked it's this color right here it
looks<00:01:42.770> like<00:01:42.950> that

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
looks like that

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.630 
looks like that
and<00:01:44.409> I'm<00:01:45.409> gonna<00:01:45.590> put<00:01:45.800> that<00:01:45.950> just<00:01:46.220> above<00:01:46.430> the

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
and I'm gonna put that just above the

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.910 
and I'm gonna put that just above the
crease<00:01:46.850> colors<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.509> I'm<00:01:47.690> using<00:01:47.930> a<00:01:48.350> large

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
crease colors and I'm using a large

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.830 
crease colors and I'm using a large
fluffy<00:01:49.310> brush

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.469 

now<00:01:57.409> I'm<00:01:57.500> going<00:01:57.649> to<00:01:57.680> take<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:58.130> slightly<00:01:58.670> lighter

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
now I'm going to take a slightly lighter

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.789 
now I'm going to take a slightly lighter
color<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.530> this<00:02:01.040> is<00:02:01.280> from<00:02:01.970> my<00:02:02.210> Chanel<00:02:02.840> palette
