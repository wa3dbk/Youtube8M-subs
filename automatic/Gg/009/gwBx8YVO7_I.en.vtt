to pay that much for it um yeah we'll go
into<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.519> next<00:02:19.640> one<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.090> next<00:02:20.120> AFC<00:02:21.080> is

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
into the next one the next AFC is

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.199 
into the next one the next AFC is
marshal<00:02:24.290> Yanda<00:02:24.830> who's<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.580> right<00:02:25.850> guard<00:02:26.000> for

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
marshal Yanda who's a right guard for

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.610 
marshal Yanda who's a right guard for
the<00:02:26.300> ravens<00:02:26.660> pretty<00:02:27.440> good<00:02:27.970> linemen<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.620> it

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
the ravens pretty good linemen and it

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.729 
the ravens pretty good linemen and it
looks<00:02:30.739> pretty<00:02:30.860> cool<00:02:31.010> but<00:02:31.340> yeah<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:33.110> next<00:02:33.560> will

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
looks pretty cool but yeah the next will

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.070 
looks pretty cool but yeah the next will
be<00:02:33.769> Justin<00:02:34.370> Smith<00:02:34.640> who's<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.970> NFC<00:02:35.480> reward

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
be Justin Smith who's the NFC reward

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.350 
be Justin Smith who's the NFC reward
that<00:02:36.530> both<00:02:36.860> end<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.190> season<00:02:37.370> from<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.760> 49ers

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
that both end of season from the 49ers

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.720 
that both end of season from the 49ers
so<00:02:38.989> Justin<00:02:39.350> Smith<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.739> pretty<00:02:40.040> cheap<00:02:40.250> actually

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
so Justin Smith is pretty cheap actually

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.080 
so Justin Smith is pretty cheap actually
he's<00:02:41.120> only<00:02:41.269> 70k<00:02:42.160> pretty<00:02:43.160> good<00:02:43.400> sense<00:02:43.670> i<00:02:43.850> like

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
he's only 70k pretty good sense i like

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.460 
he's only 70k pretty good sense i like
his<00:02:44.330> block<00:02:44.569> should<00:02:44.780> power<00:02:45.019> move<00:02:45.260> and

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
his block should power move and

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.370 
his block should power move and
awareness<00:02:46.030> um<00:02:47.030> then<00:02:47.840> we<00:02:47.900> got<00:02:48.019> navorro<00:02:48.319> bowman

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
awareness um then we got navorro bowman

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.319 
awareness um then we got navorro bowman
she<00:02:49.310> was<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.459> pretty<00:02:49.610> good<00:02:49.760> linebacker<00:02:50.120> but<00:02:50.269> i

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
she was a pretty good linebacker but i

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.699 
she was a pretty good linebacker but i
don't<00:02:50.510> think<00:02:50.540> he's<00:02:50.810> as<00:02:50.930> good<00:02:51.049> as<00:02:51.110> a<00:02:51.230> two-star

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
don't think he's as good as a two-star

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:59.410 
don't think he's as good as a two-star
willis<00:02:51.980> for<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.459> two-star<00:02:53.269> ray

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
and he's gone for about 95 k pretty

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.800 
and he's gone for about 95 k pretty
cheap<00:03:04.250> actually<00:03:04.790> but<00:03:05.239> I<00:03:05.270> didn't<00:03:05.510> see<00:03:05.630> there's

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
bit better promo cards because they're

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.230 
bit better promo cards because they're
not<00:06:21.040> as<00:06:21.220> good<00:06:21.430> as<00:06:21.550> some<00:06:21.700> of<00:06:21.760> the<00:06:21.910> cars<00:06:22.090> that

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
not as good as some of the cars that

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.180 
not as good as some of the cars that
have<00:06:22.330> been<00:06:22.450> released<00:06:22.600> lately<00:06:23.010> chips<00:06:24.010> not

have been released lately chips not

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.070 
have been released lately chips not
expensive<00:06:24.520> I<00:06:24.880> thought<00:06:25.480> you'd<00:06:25.660> go<00:06:25.870> up<00:06:25.930> in<00:06:26.050> price

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
expensive I thought you'd go up in price

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.250 
expensive I thought you'd go up in price
I<00:06:27.390> think<00:06:28.390> the<00:06:28.480> Tom<00:06:28.690> Brady<00:06:28.870> is<00:06:29.080> pretty

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
I think the Tom Brady is pretty

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.970 
I think the Tom Brady is pretty
expensive<00:06:29.440> um<00:06:30.660> so<00:06:31.660> I<00:06:31.720> think<00:06:31.830> they're<00:06:32.830> gonna

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
expensive um so I think they're gonna

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.290 
expensive um so I think they're gonna
really<00:06:33.190> super<00:06:33.520> bowl<00:06:33.670> crimes<00:06:33.880> I<00:06:34.030> don't<00:06:34.180> know<00:06:34.240> if

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.250 
really super bowl crimes I don't know if
they're<00:06:34.450> going<00:06:34.540> to<00:06:34.630> be<00:06:34.690> considered<00:06:34.810> super

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
they're going to be considered super

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.690 
they're going to be considered super
little<00:06:35.470> playoff<00:06:35.800> card<00:06:36.070> or<00:06:36.310> they're<00:06:36.430> gonna<00:06:36.520> be

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
um so I don't know how much it would

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.270 
um so I don't know how much it would
cost<00:06:55.330> to<00:06:55.630> complete<00:06:56.200> these<00:06:56.320> collections<00:06:56.620> but<00:06:57.010> I

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
cost to complete these collections but I

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.210 
cost to complete these collections but I
don't<00:06:58.030> know<00:06:58.090> if<00:06:58.150> it's<00:06:58.270> worth<00:06:58.930> doing<00:06:59.080> I<00:06:59.590> haven't

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:00.220 
don't know if it's worth doing I haven't

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.460 
don't know if it's worth doing I haven't
even<00:07:00.310> tried<00:07:00.730> because<00:07:01.240> I<00:07:01.660> just<00:07:01.900> think<00:07:02.050> it's<00:07:02.170> um

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.470 
even tried because I just think it's um

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.250 
even tried because I just think it's um
it's<00:07:03.070> kind<00:07:03.340> of<00:07:03.460> like<00:07:03.670> if<00:07:03.970> like<00:07:04.540> the<00:07:04.720> report<00:07:05.080> was

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
it's kind of like if like the report was

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.150 
it's kind of like if like the report was
like<00:07:05.380> a<00:07:05.440> million<00:07:05.830> coins<00:07:06.070> like<00:07:06.370> Dom

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 
like a million coins like Dom

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.500 
like a million coins like Dom
position<00:07:07.610> collections<00:07:07.940> lecture<00:07:08.240> I<00:07:08.270> might

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.510 
position collections lecture I might

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.570 
position collections lecture I might
think<00:07:08.660> about<00:07:08.750> doing<00:07:08.900> them<00:07:09.230> but<00:07:09.440> I<00:07:09.710> just<00:07:10.310> don't

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 
think about doing them but I just don't

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.400 
think about doing them but I just don't
see<00:07:11.180> the<00:07:11.390> value<00:07:11.420> that<00:07:11.750> much<00:07:11.990> I<00:07:12.140> mean<00:07:12.260> because

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.410 
see the value that much I mean because

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.580 
see the value that much I mean because
you<00:07:12.800> get<00:07:12.920> 200<00:07:13.100> k<00:07:13.870> for<00:07:14.870> the<00:07:14.900> AFC<00:07:15.230> you<00:07:15.320> can<00:07:15.440> sell

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590 
you get 200 k for the AFC you can sell

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.070 
you get 200 k for the AFC you can sell
each<00:07:15.800> one<00:07:16.040> for<00:07:16.220> about<00:07:16.400> 100<00:07:16.820> well<00:07:17.060> you<00:07:17.720> can<00:07:17.870> sell

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
each one for about 100 well you can sell

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.180 
each one for about 100 well you can sell
them<00:07:18.260> for<00:07:18.290> really<00:07:18.710> good<00:07:18.830> so<00:07:18.920> I<00:07:18.950> think<00:07:19.070> the

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190 
them for really good so I think the

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.890 
them for really good so I think the
AFC's<00:07:19.550> gonna<00:07:19.730> cost<00:07:19.970> more<00:07:21.130> but<00:07:22.130> on<00:07:22.310> I<00:07:22.900> still

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:23.900 
AFC's gonna cost more but on I still

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.870 
AFC's gonna cost more but on I still
don't<00:07:23.930> see<00:07:24.140> any<00:07:24.440> value<00:07:24.710> in<00:07:24.950> it<00:07:25.160> I'm<00:07:25.340> like<00:07:25.580> for

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:25.880 
don't see any value in it I'm like for

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.520
