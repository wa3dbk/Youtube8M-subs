00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
it seems like they are really seasonal

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.820 
it seems like they are really seasonal
with<00:02:14.489> their<00:02:14.700> DLC<00:02:15.180> content<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.959> there<00:02:16.379> is<00:02:16.530> no

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
with their DLC content so there is no

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.190 
with their DLC content so there is no
clue<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.910> when<00:02:18.450> in<00:02:18.540> fact<00:02:18.660> we're<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.050> get<00:02:19.140> a

release date now personally I think they

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.250 
release date now personally I think they
should<00:02:21.180> put<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.480> into<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:21.750> game<00:02:21.870> because

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
should put this into the game because

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.630 
should put this into the game because
only<00:02:22.709> i'll<00:02:22.860> have<00:02:22.950> more<00:02:23.099> vehicles<00:02:23.340> there's
