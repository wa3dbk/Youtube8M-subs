00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.250 
would suggest to leave it in the fridge
for<00:03:47.350> at<00:03:48.010> least<00:03:48.040> about<00:03:48.489> an<00:03:48.760> hour<00:03:48.910> or<00:03:49.239> two<00:03:49.600> the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
for at least about an hour or two the

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.710 
for at least about an hour or two the
longer<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:51.069> salad<00:03:51.670> sits<00:03:51.970> in<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.180> fridge<00:03:52.389> and

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
longer the salad sits in the fridge and

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.080 
longer the salad sits in the fridge and
has<00:03:52.870> time<00:03:53.139> to<00:03:53.319> sort<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.590> marinate<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.370> all<00:03:54.700> the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
has time to sort of marinate and all the

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.460 
has time to sort of marinate and all the
ingredients<00:03:55.540> have<00:03:55.660> time<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:56.049> marry<00:03:56.319> each

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
ingredients have time to marry each

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.770 
ingredients have time to marry each
other<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:57.040> more<00:03:57.190> tasty<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.180> delicious<00:03:58.269> it

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
other the more tasty and delicious it

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.750 
other the more tasty and delicious it
will<00:03:58.930> be<00:03:59.170> so<00:03:59.560> once<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.980> salad<00:04:00.280> had<00:04:00.459> a<00:04:00.489> chance

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
will be so once the salad had a chance

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.099 
will be so once the salad had a chance
to<00:04:00.910> sit<00:04:01.060> in<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.299> fridge<00:04:01.510> for<00:04:01.540> at<00:04:01.810> least<00:04:01.900> an
