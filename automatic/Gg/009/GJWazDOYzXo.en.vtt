00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.169
 since 1997 for the first German railway serve Haas 

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:12.159
 you could say 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.720
 authorized 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.660
 so remained this wooden beam 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.400
 creates a blessing is water permeable Front leaves water Limo Foundation 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.830
 which does not reverse the intelligence services t 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.340
 But you should also worry on dry days with water from the mouth 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.920
 Railway donations are of course often made of wood 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.160
 but what the dryness of the rain stops because she does not wet her 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.290
 Underground 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.330
 and something speaks against wood as underground it would be too loud if the 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.310
 Trains drive over it 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.580
 Schottern does not know 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.580
 Iris go 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.140
 Well, then just come down bricks 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.850
 Masonry would not be the constant vibrations caused by the trains 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.070
 withstand 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.510
 that can 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.070
 Gravel can not diverge the gaps are not at all 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.920
 if not you could put tracks on Kiss 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.990
 Pebbles them 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.230
 decide to slip 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.330
 Schlatter, on the other hand, is a sharp-edged view and really 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.239
 enormous track 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.650
 So there is really no other material apart from gravel 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.650
 can use different 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.729
 Ability range between approx 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:27.129
 The trains run fast 300 kilometers per hour 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.129
 with the felt 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:35.239
 he stands here the direct underground under the concrete tracks 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:43.699
 most old town 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:47.879
 because even the repair is very easy if a gravel somewhere 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.969
 Little is missing here please 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:54.479
 the show leads background for this 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:57.479
 - 30 40 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.299
 Father Breulmann 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:16.039
 nothing else is out there it was not simply called by the cavities 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:18.879
 it 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.690
 I'm a bit hard hit 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.869
 the track is repaired quickly 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.119
 and something else speaks for gravel 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:29.929
 supposedly it should not hurt enough to have it in the wallet
