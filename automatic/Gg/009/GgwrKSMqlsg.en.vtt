00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
using up top the farm took a pretty good

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.500 
using up top the farm took a pretty good
beating<00:02:29.640> oops<00:02:30.709> well<00:02:31.709> building<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.510> because

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
beating oops well building this because

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.720 
beating oops well building this because
this<00:02:33.750> tower<00:02:34.020> came<00:02:34.410> out<00:02:34.590> into<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:35.010> farm<00:02:35.459> I

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
this tower came out into the farm I

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.940 
this tower came out into the farm I
think<00:02:36.270> what<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.480> will<00:02:36.750> probably<00:02:37.080> do<00:02:37.560> with<00:02:37.770> this

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
think what I will probably do with this

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.280 
think what I will probably do with this
is<00:02:38.250> move<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.819> farm<00:02:39.090> about<00:02:39.270> halfway<00:02:39.420> over<00:02:39.989> I

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
is move the farm about halfway over I

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.170 
is move the farm about halfway over I
think<00:02:40.739> i'm<00:02:40.800> going<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:40.980> tower<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.459> up<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:41.880> make

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
think i'm going to tower it up and make

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.479 
think i'm going to tower it up and make
it<00:02:42.209> an<00:02:42.450> auto<00:02:42.660> harvest<00:02:43.200> farm<00:02:43.560> rather<00:02:43.950> than<00:02:44.190> this

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
it an auto harvest farm rather than this

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.210 
it an auto harvest farm rather than this
manual<00:02:45.000> one<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:45.360> this<00:02:45.769> so<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:47.010> should<00:02:47.190> be

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
manual one like this so that should be

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.400 
manual one like this so that should be
kind<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.640> cool<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.090> good<00:02:48.239> project<00:02:48.450> i'll

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
kind of cool and a good project i'll

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.960 
kind of cool and a good project i'll
show<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.620> down<00:02:49.860> in<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.040> subway<00:02:50.340> really
