00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.820
 no 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:07.150
 swimming bike and now running force no 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.070
 actually I tell you very useful 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.590
 because multidisciplinary indeed how 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.740
 before we noticed we used it 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.110
 by bike and now we run from there 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.290
 heart rate distance and also the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.119
 step but above all considering that today 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.240
 however we do a job in the threshold ti 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.770
 gives the heart rate alarm in 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.390
 then threshold every time 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.190
 reaches the threshold then sounds 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.410
 will continue to play all the time 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.340
 for probably yes we will see no 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.619
 absolutely 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.720
 and then we say if you want to see how much 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.850
 you are going into the threshold ie the car the app 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.690
 that gives you it directly to the km then 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.380
 in the off beat step and you can 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.380
 verified immediately 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.880
 big luca really go thanks me 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.640
 I recommend this because it continues 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.480
 do not I train grotti I did not so 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.040
 you know what you have to do 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.200
 I know you keep me under the tea too 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.940
 street and then establish the 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.739
 connect workouts in this is 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:06.940
 I'm sure I also expect every want 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.940
 keep alive thanks to prizes 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.280
 so we left our athletes 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.880
 luca d'alessandro to their breeding of 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.800
 running 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.860
 but let's see what the 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.200
 forerunner 910xt for our dreamers 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.630
 in the first episode we presented 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.000
 the swimming function now crushing 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.690
 prolonged the mode key we pass 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.670
 to the running function or run 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.890
 normally the data fields to be used that 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.950
 are most recommended are the 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.830
 step time heart rate e 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.570
 the distance traveled the product 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.250
 substantially in addition to detecting all the 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.290
 sensitive data regarding the 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.510
 race gives you the opportunity to record 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.570
 the elevation profile that stands 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.460
 along the slope and many 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.130
 other data that are useful for 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.320
 an analysis at the back where on garmin 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.780
 connect that our free portal 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.840
 where it is only necessary to register for 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.210
 being able to monitor your own sessions 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.370
 training in a very technical way 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.290
 above all without losing any data 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.239
 regarding the training of the 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.910
 running calories are collected 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.610
 via a function called first 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.460
 bill currie calculation or through 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.560
 the symbiosis of this protocol is the 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.020
 heart rate detection 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.030
 we give exactly the exact one 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.070
 caloric intake that is consumed by 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.620
 our athletes during a race 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.920
 this is one of the many features 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.490
 which are developed since 910xt 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.690
 I only recommend that you look at least 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.220
 read it carefully and in the evening 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.540
 in front of the television set yourself up 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.460
 play that product sometimes 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.750
 find out that he does something that you either 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.750
 I could imagine him
