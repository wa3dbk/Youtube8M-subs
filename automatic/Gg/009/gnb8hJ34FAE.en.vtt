first<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.789> started<00:00:18.600> out<00:00:18.690> building<00:00:18.840> head<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.470> I

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
first I started out building head and I

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.679 
first I started out building head and I
never<00:00:20.369> really<00:00:20.699> thought<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:21.090> I'd<00:00:21.210> build<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
never really thought that I'd build the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.200 
never really thought that I'd build the
body<00:00:21.900> because<00:00:22.519> that<00:00:23.519> would<00:00:23.699> be<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> lot<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.000> work

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
body because that would be a lot of work

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.769 
body because that would be a lot of work
turns<00:00:24.600> out<00:00:24.720> wasn't<00:00:24.990> um<00:00:25.580> ed<00:00:26.580> was<00:00:27.090> actually<00:00:27.630> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
turns out wasn't um ed was actually the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.999 
turns out wasn't um ed was actually the
hardest<00:00:28.050> part<00:00:28.439> here<00:00:29.119> mostly<00:00:30.119> because<00:00:30.529> one<00:00:31.529> two

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
hardest part here mostly because one two

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.490 
hardest part here mostly because one two
three<00:00:32.660> one<00:00:33.660> two<00:00:33.690> three<00:00:33.960> four<00:00:34.829> five<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.690> is<00:00:36.690> five

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
three one two three four five it is five

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
want to build with odd numbers but I had

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.340 
want to build with odd numbers but I had
to<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.770> make<00:00:50.039> his<00:00:50.430> eyes<00:00:51.260> not<00:00:52.260> together<00:00:53.160> um<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
to to make his eyes not together um and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.319 
to to make his eyes not together um and
originally<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.770> had<00:00:55.980> another<00:00:56.760> white<00:00:57.120> piece

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
originally I had another white piece

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.420 
originally I had another white piece
right<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.320> another<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:58.949> piece<00:00:59.219> right

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
right here and another one piece right

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.970 
right here and another one piece right
here<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.850> black<00:01:00.170> separating<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.859> that

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
here in a black separating it but that

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.080 
here in a black separating it but that
would<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.340> double<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> length<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.000> his

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
would have to double the length of his

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.119 
would have to double the length of his
head<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.570> use<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.439> really<00:01:04.830> don't<00:01:04.979> have

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
head to use that and I really don't have

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.570 
head to use that and I really don't have
that<00:01:05.159> much<00:01:05.369> black<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:07.070> actually<00:01:08.070> kind<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.520> like

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
that much black I actually kind of like

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.109 
that much black I actually kind of like
the<00:01:08.820> way<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.710> pupils<00:01:10.710> are<00:01:10.979> looking<00:01:11.369> up<00:01:11.490> they

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the way the pupils are looking up they

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.280 
the way the pupils are looking up they
look<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.390> little<00:01:12.510> bit<00:01:12.750> different<00:01:13.080> from<00:01:13.140> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
look a little bit different from a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.600 
look a little bit different from a
normal<00:01:13.320> Linderman<00:01:13.920> he<00:01:14.250> looks<00:01:14.460> kind<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.700> cool

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
normal Linderman he looks kind of cool

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.230 
normal Linderman he looks kind of cool
again<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.700> don't<00:01:17.880> really<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.720> much<00:01:18.900> purple<00:01:19.439> so

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
again I don't really have much purple so

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.350 
again I don't really have much purple so
then<00:01:21.240> how<00:01:21.390> much<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.750> work<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.680> use

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
then how much to work with so I use

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.480 
then how much to work with so I use
slopes<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.689> by<00:01:24.840> one<00:01:24.990> slopes<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.590> put<00:01:26.369> them

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
slopes one by one slopes and put them

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.899 
slopes one by one slopes and put them
inside<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:28.369> really<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.520> how<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.820> looks

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
inside up I really like how it looks

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.280 
inside up I really like how it looks
like<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.240> was<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.509> almost<00:01:30.659> painted<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.259> it

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
like it was just almost painted on it

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.140 
like it was just almost painted on it
looks<00:01:31.619> perfect<00:01:32.250> um<00:01:34.100> rest<00:01:35.100> tag<00:01:35.280> was<00:01:35.430> easy<00:01:35.640> i<00:01:35.790> use

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
looks perfect um rest tag was easy i use

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.270 
looks perfect um rest tag was easy i use
the<00:01:36.299> snot<00:01:36.600> method<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> top<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.130> head

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the snot method for the top of the head

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.080 
the snot method for the top of the head
which<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.030> studs<00:01:39.420> not<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.869> top<00:01:40.430> which<00:01:41.430> kind

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
which is the studs not on top which kind

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.249 
which is the studs not on top which kind
of<00:01:42.150> makes<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.479> look<00:01:42.659> more<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:43.049> from

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
of makes it look more like from

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.060 
of makes it look more like from
minecraft<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:44.009> more<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.030> know<00:01:45.200> it's<00:01:46.200> cooler

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.719 

then<00:01:50.070> i<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> body<00:01:50.909> here<00:01:52.549> which<00:01:53.549> was

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
then i have the body here which was

then i have the body here which was
actually<00:01:53.939> pretty<00:01:54.329> simplistic<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:55.380> uh<00:01:55.820> he's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820

I<00:04:32.810> dees<00:04:33.050> and<00:04:33.410> not<00:04:34.250> not<00:04:34.550> as<00:04:34.670> fun<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:35.180> noticed<00:04:35.990> they

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
I dees and not not as fun I noticed they

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.990 
I dees and not not as fun I noticed they
kind<00:04:36.320> of<00:04:36.380> oftenly<00:04:36.860> pickups<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:37.550> a<00:04:37.670> little<00:04:37.880> bit

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
kind of oftenly pickups and a little bit

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.520 
kind of oftenly pickups and a little bit
more<00:04:38.180> than<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.420> grass<00:04:38.630> blocks<00:04:38.960> they<00:04:39.230> kind<00:04:39.470> of

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
more than the grass blocks they kind of

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:47.040 
more than the grass blocks they kind of
excellent<00:04:40.930> so<00:04:43.060> you'd<00:04:44.060> think<00:04:44.090> that<00:04:45.730> two<00:04:46.730> by<00:04:46.910> two

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
excellent so you'd think that two by two

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.550 
excellent so you'd think that two by two
like<00:04:48.050> this<00:04:48.260> is<00:04:49.060> perfect<00:04:50.060> square<00:04:50.600> it's<00:04:50.900> really

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
like this is perfect square it's really

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.680 
like this is perfect square it's really
really<00:04:52.190> not<00:04:52.340> it's<00:04:52.610> rectangle<00:04:53.240> so<00:04:54.370> you'd<00:04:55.370> think

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
really not it's rectangle so you'd think

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.630 
really not it's rectangle so you'd think
would<00:04:56.690> feel<00:04:56.900> about<00:04:56.990> whose<00:04:57.370> it's<00:04:58.370> all<00:04:58.520> your

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
would feel about whose it's all your

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.100 
would feel about whose it's all your
problems<00:04:59.290> now<00:05:00.290> it's<00:05:00.680> bigger<00:05:00.980> rectangle<00:05:02.110> so

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
problems now it's bigger rectangle so

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.420 
problems now it's bigger rectangle so

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.600 
look a little bit there I ended up with
three<00:05:12.020> blocks<00:05:12.380> here<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:13.960> flat<00:05:14.960> on<00:05:15.140> top<00:05:15.610> using

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
three blocks here and flat on top using

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.920 
three blocks here and flat on top using
this<00:05:16.700> not<00:05:16.910> method<00:05:17.240> again<00:05:17.420> it's<00:05:17.690> up<00:05:17.780> this

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930

little stud right here with cheese is to
hold<00:05:19.790> the<00:05:19.940> block<00:05:20.180> so<00:05:20.450> it<00:05:20.540> kind<00:05:20.750> of<00:05:20.780> looks

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
hold the block so it kind of looks

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.930 
hold the block so it kind of looks
really<00:05:21.410> cool<00:05:23.290> yeah<00:05:24.400> so<00:05:25.400> if<00:05:25.490> you're<00:05:25.610> holding<00:05:25.820> on
