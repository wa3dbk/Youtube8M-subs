there<00:00:24.320> now<00:00:25.119> once<00:00:26.119> again<00:00:26.270> I'm<00:00:26.510> showing<00:00:26.840> this

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
there now once again I'm showing this

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.680 
there now once again I'm showing this
tutorial<00:00:27.470> in<00:00:27.650> a<00:00:27.890> 1v1<00:00:28.279> so<00:00:28.760> it's<00:00:29.300> going<00:00:29.480> to<00:00:29.539> take

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
tutorial in a 1v1 so it's going to take

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.330 
tutorial in a 1v1 so it's going to take
two<00:00:29.840> tomahawks<00:00:30.260> just<00:00:30.619> so<00:00:30.830> he<00:00:30.949> knows<00:00:30.980> where<00:00:31.310> to

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
two tomahawks just so he knows where to

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.810 
two tomahawks just so he knows where to
stand<00:00:31.719> but<00:00:32.719> this<00:00:33.020> is<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.410> general<00:00:33.700> idea<00:00:34.700> of

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
stand but this is the general idea of

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.450 
stand but this is the general idea of
where<00:00:35.090> to<00:00:35.120> throw<00:00:35.390> it<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.530> here's<00:00:36.770> this<00:00:36.950> killcam

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
where to throw it so here's this killcam

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.760 
where to throw it so here's this killcam
what<00:00:38.300> it's<00:00:38.420> going<00:00:38.570> to<00:00:38.630> do<00:00:38.780> is<00:00:38.989> Bank<00:00:39.380> off<00:00:39.559> that

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
what it's going to do is Bank off that

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.530 
what it's going to do is Bank off that
building<00:00:39.980> then<00:00:40.340> that<00:00:40.579> wall<00:00:40.820> and<00:00:41.120> drop<00:00:41.329> down

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
building then that wall and drop down

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.930 
building then that wall and drop down
right<00:00:41.570> when<00:00:41.870> they<00:00:41.960> walk<00:00:42.140> out<00:00:42.290> or<00:00:42.470> spawn<00:00:42.770> or<00:00:43.130> run

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
right when they walk out or spawn or run

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.150 
right when they walk out or spawn or run
out<00:00:44.090> of<00:00:44.120> spawn<00:00:44.680> depends<00:00:45.680> on<00:00:45.800> if<00:00:46.010> they're

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
out of spawn depends on if they're

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.150 
out of spawn depends on if they're
feeling<00:00:46.309> lazy<00:00:46.670> or<00:00:46.910> not<00:00:47.110> so<00:00:48.110> now<00:00:48.559> that<00:00:48.800> this<00:00:48.950> was

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
feeling lazy or not so now that this was

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.840 
feeling lazy or not so now that this was
done<00:00:49.460> moving<00:00:49.850> on<00:00:49.969> to<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:50.809> side<00:00:51.340> now<00:00:52.340> you<00:00:52.399> see

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
done moving on to this side now you see

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.580 
done moving on to this side now you see
the<00:00:52.969> statue<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:53.719> then<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:53.930> see<00:00:54.140> this<00:00:54.290> lines

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
throw it over the first building that I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.590 
throw it over the first building that I
aimed<00:01:06.409> at<00:01:06.619> just<00:01:06.950> right<00:01:07.190> over<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.549> left<00:01:08.299> corner
