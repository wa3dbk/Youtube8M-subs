00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Good day to my viewers 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.210
 channel also subscribers of public rally 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.799
 car and today we look at this not 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.809
 little important topic as preparation 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.740
 car blood mine racing drove 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.740
 look at the splash screen 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.210
 so then let's start with a little 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.540
 retreat now I will tell you what 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.230
 rally car groups are 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.540
 accordance with international 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.030
 classification rally cars 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.010
 divided into 2 groups by level of training 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.409
 group n and group a 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.250
 and now you probably ask how 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.100
 group b 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.649
 legendary group in the same as lenchik as 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:59.019
 same ford rs200 how audi quattro 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:01.509
 I'll tell you so cars of group b 1987 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.790
 of the year it was forbidden to race 

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:05.049
 for one simple reason they had 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.780
 increased danger 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.119
 and if you still take on the group at that 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.009
 I need to think about doing a separate issue 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.500
 because there really is a lot 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.200
 information she means so what am i 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.960
 stopped in turn each of 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.490
 groups consists of four classes 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.640
 the main differences are 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.460
 engine capacity of the car group 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.780
 are stock cars 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.100
 released at least two 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.380
 half thousand copies 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.420
 and they are allowed to refine the first 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.370
 This bodywork is natural and further this 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.350
 injection system can be customized 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.810
 suspension change shock absorbers 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.400
 and reprogram it for those who do not 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.270
 knows for u is an electronic unit 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.580
 of management 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.380
 it's forbidden to change all two things 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.159
 engine design and geometry 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.400
 suspension and in fact everything further on 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.290
 Queuing cars group a car 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.420
 groups about undergo significant 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.490
 changes in this class are allowed 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.920
 modify as well as in the group we 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.619
 we can modify the body 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.780
 change the injection system but now what 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.090
 most importantly we can make changes 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.349
 in the design of the engine also we can 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.390
 install sports suspension 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.760
 sports gearbox there 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.500
 shock absorbers and just like in group n 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.870
 reprogrammed and was electronic 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.549
 Control block 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.799
 there are a number of international groups 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.620
 rally cars for example and a group 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.269
 we are stey world rally car supreme 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.459
 division so to speak rally 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.260
 cars allow maximum 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.900
 changes in the design of cars 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.909
 also I have not forgotten about a group of 2000 this 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.919
 less expensive shooting of the native version of the machine 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.850
 have a serial body atmospheric 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:43.310
 engines standard all-wheel drive 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.110
 the mixture is now going to the main 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.160
 the topic of how to prepare 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.860
 car kral 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.930
 first of all you need to take care of your 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.230
 safety and security by storm 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.350
 you need to buy a good helmet equipment 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.720
 fireproof overalls and gloves so 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.310
 Now for the finalization of the car first 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.310
 point we are finalizing the body 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.230
 car body must be strengthened and 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.990
 opportunities to ease to gain 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.090
 body frame roll cage 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.560
 as a stabilizer and reinforce the seats 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.960
 mounting front struts 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.880
 spars rear beam and so on yes 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.650
 car beggar also strengthen 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.440
 especially in the gearbox area 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.170
 install kevlar or other protection 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.820
 so now briefly suspension coercion 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.100
 car in line group 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.170
 and implies only slight changes in 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.360
 suspension settings for group a 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.880
 suspension tweaks almost 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.360
 completely minimal changes for 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.150
 groups 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.260
 and on the suspension and at least set 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.110
 sports cv joints 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.630
 ball bearings also 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.780
 try to modify the brake system 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.550
 briefly transmission finalize the transmission 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.390
 depends on the intended group 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.690
 cars 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.030
 if in a group and can and should go on 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.790
 factory gearbox then for group a 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.520
 apply from a shortened main pair 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.040
 to install sports transmission plus 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.500
 to this and regulates either to send either 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.630
 under gravel discipline and maybe too 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.430
 increased now you can say the most 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.160
 important point is the engine 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.650
 engine refinement in group n 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.020
 limited eg original system 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.970
 the injection must be saved but 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.130
 let's say and reprogram the block 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.020
 engine control and replace intake 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.510
 nozzles for more productive 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.090
 and if the engine is turbocharged 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.960
 on should stay standard 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.230
 naturally for a group 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.540
 and finishing piston group is allowed 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.140
 also finishing the cylinder block and much 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:43.490
 other 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:45.170
 and in conclusion we summarize the preparation 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.690
 rally car cost in 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.610
 a tidy sum but in any case you 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.860
 do not forget that the main role 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.530
 competition play no budget cat 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.530
 she spent the car and yet 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.270
 skill pilot and navigator here in 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.639
 principle and all i wanted is up to you 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.460
 bring on this video ends with everything 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.990
 thank you for your attention subscribe 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.150
 put huskies be sure to comment 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.259
 and do not keep a secret from friends to everyone 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.259
 thanks and see you soon
