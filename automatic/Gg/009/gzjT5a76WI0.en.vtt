run through approximately a hundred
different<00:02:22.050> control<00:02:22.860> patches<00:02:23.430> which<00:02:24.270> are

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
different control patches which are

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.040 
different control patches which are
going<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.810> display<00:02:25.620> unknown<00:02:26.340> la<00:02:26.700> b-value<00:02:27.330> RGB

going to display unknown la b-value RGB

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.830 
going to display unknown la b-value RGB
value<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.770> screen<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:30.180> spectro<00:02:30.660> is

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
value to the screen that the spectro is

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.690 
value to the screen that the spectro is
going<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.200> read<00:02:31.500> through<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.400> calibration

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
going to read through the calibration

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.490 
going to read through the calibration
process<00:02:33.120> through<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.690> process<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.170> creating

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
process through the process of creating

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.830 
process through the process of creating
the<00:02:34.590> profile<00:02:34.980> it'll<00:02:35.700> read<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.420> displayed

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
the profile it'll read the displayed

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.440 
the profile it'll read the displayed
values<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.500> what<00:02:37.890> they<00:02:38.010> should<00:02:38.220> actually<00:02:38.450> be

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
values in what they should actually be

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.480 
values in what they should actually be
displayed<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.530> screen<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.220> it's<00:02:41.400> a

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
displayed on the screen so it's a

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.720 
displayed on the screen so it's a
relative<00:02:42.440> database<00:02:43.440> comparing<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.220> two<00:02:44.430> and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
relative database comparing the two and

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.520 
relative database comparing the two and
that's<00:02:45.060> what<00:02:45.300> creates<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.810> calibration

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
that's what creates the calibration

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.410 
that's what creates the calibration
process<00:02:46.680> for<00:02:47.070> your<00:02:47.190> monitor<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:48.210> we're<00:02:48.300> going

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
process for your monitor so we're going

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.850 
process for your monitor so we're going
to<00:02:48.480> speed<00:02:48.660> up<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> process<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.440> go<00:02:49.620> through

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
to speed up the process to go through

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.700 
to speed up the process to go through
these<00:02:49.980> colors<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.610> we'll<00:02:51.300> be<00:02:51.420> back<00:02:51.600> in<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:52.530> a

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
these colors and we'll be back in just a

00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:00.390 
these colors and we'll be back in just a
minute

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.290 

you

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.540 

okay<00:03:07.300> we<00:03:08.200> are<00:03:08.500> done<00:03:10.080> with<00:03:11.080> reading<00:03:11.769> our<00:03:11.950> color

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
okay we are done with reading our color

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.600 
okay we are done with reading our color
patches<00:03:13.200> by<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.260> way<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:14.590> process<00:03:14.860> takes

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
patches by the way that process takes

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.170 
patches by the way that process takes
upwards<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.599> six<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.050> seven<00:03:17.379> minutes<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.180> we

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
upwards of six to seven minutes and we

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.699 
upwards of six to seven minutes and we
obviously<00:03:19.360> edit<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:19.900> down<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.530> don't<00:03:20.650> have

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
obviously edit it down so you don't have

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.850 
obviously edit it down so you don't have
to<00:03:20.800> bore<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.099> to<00:03:21.220> death<00:03:21.250> with<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.760> process

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
to bore you to death with that process

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.530 
to bore you to death with that process
now<00:03:23.860> up<00:03:24.069> on<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.430> right-hand<00:03:25.060> side<00:03:25.420> of<00:03:25.480> the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
now up on the right-hand side of the

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.820 
now up on the right-hand side of the
screen<00:03:25.750> here<00:03:25.900> these<00:03:26.080> are<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.440> patches<00:03:26.799> that

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
screen here these are the patches that

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.970 
screen here these are the patches that
reread<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:29.170> can<00:03:29.290> notice<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:29.560> they're

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
reread and you can notice that they're

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.119 
reread and you can notice that they're
they're<00:03:30.459> cut<00:03:30.730> with<00:03:30.849> a<00:03:30.879> diagonal<00:03:31.330> line<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.129> the

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
they're cut with a diagonal line and the

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.660 
they're cut with a diagonal line and the
the<00:03:33.340> value<00:03:33.730> on<00:03:33.879> top<00:03:34.180> is<00:03:34.870> what<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:36.280> actual

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
the value on top is what the actual

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.120 
the value on top is what the actual
color<00:03:37.030> should<00:03:37.510> render<00:03:37.870> as<00:03:38.049> and<00:03:38.349> the<00:03:38.799> color<00:03:39.010> on

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
color should render as and the color on

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.390 
color should render as and the color on
the<00:03:39.220> bottom<00:03:39.459> is<00:03:39.910> what<00:03:40.599> the<00:03:40.690> spectro<00:03:41.400> actually

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
the bottom is what the spectro actually

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.030 
the bottom is what the spectro actually
read<00:03:42.880> our<00:03:43.450> uncalibrated<00:03:43.959> monitor<00:03:44.680> actually

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
read our uncalibrated monitor actually

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.759 
read our uncalibrated monitor actually
reading<00:03:45.489> so<00:03:46.299> that<00:03:46.660> being<00:03:47.170> said<00:03:47.290> what<00:03:47.680> we're

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
reading so that being said what we're

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:48.780 
reading so that being said what we're
gonna<00:03:47.860> do<00:03:48.040> now<00:03:48.160> is<00:03:48.190> we're<00:03:48.340> going<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.519> create<00:03:48.730> a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
gonna do now is we're going to create a

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.610 
gonna do now is we're going to create a
relational<00:03:49.269> database<00:03:49.420> between<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.319> gnome

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
relational database between the gnome

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.860 
relational database between the gnome
color<00:03:50.950> values<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:51.519> what<00:03:51.790> was<00:03:51.970> displayed<00:03:52.329> and

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
color values and what was displayed and

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.729 
color values and what was displayed and
then<00:03:53.470> sync<00:03:54.190> those<00:03:54.340> up<00:03:54.579> together<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.739> we're

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
then sync those up together and we're

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.160 
then sync those up together and we're
gonna<00:03:56.799> do<00:03:57.069> that<00:03:57.569> by<00:03:58.569> clicking<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.049> next

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
gonna do that by clicking the next

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.860 
gonna do that by clicking the next
button<00:03:59.700> at<00:04:00.700> this<00:04:00.970> point<00:04:01.209> we're<00:04:01.420> gonna<00:04:01.510> name

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
button at this point we're gonna name

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.520 
button at this point we're gonna name
our<00:04:02.140> ICC<00:04:03.099> profile<00:04:03.959> now<00:04:04.959> this<00:04:05.140> is<00:04:05.230> going<00:04:05.379> to<00:04:05.440> be

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
our ICC profile now this is going to be

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.030 
our ICC profile now this is going to be
the<00:04:06.180> MacBook<00:04:07.180> Pro<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:09.120> today's<00:04:10.120> date<00:04:10.690> and

the MacBook Pro and today's date and
that<00:04:12.040> way<00:04:12.220> I<00:04:12.250> know<00:04:12.510> just<00:04:13.510> by<00:04:13.600> looking<00:04:13.989> at<00:04:14.079> that

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
that way I know just by looking at that

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.920 
that way I know just by looking at that
that<00:04:14.500> that's<00:04:14.590> for<00:04:14.920> my<00:04:15.310> MacBook<00:04:15.670> Pro<00:04:15.880> and<00:04:16.120> by

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
that that's for my MacBook Pro and by

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.449 
that that's for my MacBook Pro and by
having<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:17.380> date<00:04:17.590> in<00:04:17.739> there<00:04:17.889> I<00:04:17.919> can<00:04:18.190> choose

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
having the date in there I can choose

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.150 
having the date in there I can choose
the<00:04:18.729> most<00:04:19.139> recent<00:04:20.139> profile<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:22.060> from<00:04:22.389> here<00:04:22.660> I

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
the most recent profile so from here I

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.670 
the most recent profile so from here I
can<00:04:24.160> set<00:04:24.430> a<00:04:24.460> reminder<00:04:25.150> that<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:26.110> reminds<00:04:26.560> me

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
can set a reminder that it reminds me

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.420 
can set a reminder that it reminds me
every<00:04:26.919> four<00:04:27.220> weeks<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.760> actually<00:04:27.940> create<00:04:29.430> the

new profile reminder for me to go back
and<00:04:32.200> double-check<00:04:33.010> my<00:04:33.340> calibration<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:34.599> then

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
and double-check my calibration and then
