00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 do not 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.230
 very good on youtube as they are 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.209
 mention max with 1 video and I do not know what 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.530
 shares I bring a new server of the 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.049
 broad things for minecraft pocket 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.700
 edition the truth be very, very, very 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:24.170
 well this server is like the successor of 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.869
 the servers and I think here too 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:34.050
 from the servers the ip I think it was from 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:36.610
 6 c point lbs go something like that 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.710
 this these servers 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.710
 is this the first 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.130
 there is the ip and to put it only 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.610
 you have to go to edit 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:53.180
 external server name there they put the one 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:01:00.790
 you want and here in server andrÃ©s 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:04.449
 they put lapse point the bcg dot net 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.340
 and that would be all good, I would not do it 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.950
 I do because I already have it and well I have 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.460
 that remind them that it's for the version 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.750
 0.1 I say uy I'm already confused max that 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.710
 I'm saying 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:21.440
 is for version 0.8 point 1 and good 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:26.030
 they just put it on and they get 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.890
 she is already letting in is very 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.750
 but very well done already appear up 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.820
 for the computers 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.340
 and now you do not have to battle so much 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.820
 to enter and now I will explain 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.820
 how are you 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.030
 so my way 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.250
 already 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.420
 I have to tell you there are already 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.420
 people who speak Spanish there is 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.830
 where are we 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.380
 and here to get in a sand has 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.530
 to leave any of these of these 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.530
 places 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.870
 and well here are the sands where it says 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.080
 of saber I think that it occurs like this 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.140
 there they are spamming the channel in 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.480
 the chat 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.540
 where it says dissolve and is that still 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.390
 needs where it says internally that what 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.790
 that is pronounced like that is that they are in 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.060
 progress and where it says I is that they can 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.060
 get in 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.480
 and I'm full 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.240
 richard does not let me see 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.870
 here there is none we are going to take out 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.870
 this is not new 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.970
 what was filled 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.800
 there is none seriously 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.800
 none open 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.250
 for this I disconnect 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.050
 how easy 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.380
 there is on facebook troll leave it 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.380
 I close 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.650
 now we try to get back in 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.690
 and well yes I think that cut the video 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.390
 if not, I cut it short because I can 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.880
 put a first 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.280
 but good cut of the video up to which 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.620
 already can get me one and good here and I 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.020
 got into a game there as they could 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.020
 see me saying entering the game 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.110
 and to make it honest and to be made 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.610
 sincere 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.700
 this is my first game game in 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:08.670
 this and the 22 but I say is very is 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.250
 greatly improved are improved and I'm 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.650
 saying by shelves in the classrooms is 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.110
 what happened to this ip seriously 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.560
 thank you and then nothing here let's play 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.940
 a quick game 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.940
 I do not think it lasts long 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.639
 and there is one that is already armed I do not know how 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.730
 We have to wait 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.730
 here load the whole map 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.270
 and well I think also again cut 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.240
 the video that starts one minute away 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:52.110
 to begin and nothing right now because we 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.159
 we see and well it's going to start I think that 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.159
 they are like 15 seconds 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.950
 and good comes now if we go to 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.950
 prepare us 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.169
 is reading little 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:11.169
 in 543 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.169
 one 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.979
 let's try to grab a chest not 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.449
 lie and land leased much less 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:28.960
 for other chests 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:28.960
 says gamer craft name so more original 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:33.169
 we have to become 3rd 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:38.819
 and from here to upload 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.100
 I am total 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.789
 now we have invincibility 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.910
 they give 15 seconds 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:52.310
 I think yes no yes 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.890
 if my memory does not fail me because well 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.009
 the chests now on the other side of the 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.889
 island 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:02.909
 and I think that one of the other side 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:02.909
 there is nothing no 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.190
 well for where the bronzes 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.590
 do not fall 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.659
 I do not know why I'm saying that she 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.659
 every time 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.439
 it's harder to look 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:37.439
 About what I thought 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.850
 by teams 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:55.529
 for witches asked me 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.580
 no no, it does not kill me 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:07:00.479
 who kills me 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.479
 who is thinking 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:06.310
 good typical of 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.180
 I 'm going 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.200
 I 'm not worth 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:15.060
 two 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.060
 I think we are the ghost mode 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:20.439
 and then none of that would be all the 

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:22.419
 printing to the description itself 

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:24.339
 they want nothing else to go because they are 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:29.909
 some lazy and just want to copy and 

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:29.909
 hit and well nothing that would be goodbye
