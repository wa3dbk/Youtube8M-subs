 Welcome to the culture time

 who am I and to which group belong 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.679
 i used to keep true identities relatively 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.139
 stable 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.570

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.210
 unwanted loss of identity 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.279
 the price of modern flexibility and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.859
 Change does not exist anymore 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.500
 freedom and self-determination 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.630
 but more powerless isolation and 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.300
 senselessness too and especially in 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.460
 europe numerous teens on the

 especially in the Muslim it is 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.370

 she does not give left before right 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.539
 but to be identitaire 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.770
 it is clear that Muslim enemies have a new one 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.140
 youth movement 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.960

 your form of this movement is its 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.320
 staging that uses very strong 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.600

 multicultural ways fit with such 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.890
 slogans want to provoke them

 Weeks in Frankfurt am Main in october 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.400
 Last year, the 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.060
 identities in germany their first 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.860
 had public appearance until then 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.000
 hardly any of the self-proclaimed 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.650
 Jew's movement ultimately belongs 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.340
 behind it is racist

 people just younger people too 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.470
 mobilize against immigrants and 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.780
 especially against Muslim immigrants 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.900
 to resist they say that speak 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.450
 so they serve 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.120
 foreign in their own country with this fear 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.870
 backdrop makes the identity move 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.100
 mobil against muslims in europe a movie 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.970
 becomes the metaphor of her 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.950
 self-understanding 300 a little 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.010
 army of athletes holds its own against 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.920
 a barbarian perserver overrides too 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.160
 the symbol of identity movement that 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.890
 black yellow stock comes from 300 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.140
 pop culture meets history 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.150
 staging with your slogan 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.250
 reconquista remind her how 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.370
 Christians from the Iberian peninsula of

 recaptured her Arab invaders 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.570
 have tried this move yourself 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.480
 actually with historical insignia too 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.670
 arm around their racist 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.300
 Alignment is sort of a kind 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.060
 give cultural historical note 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.010

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.860
 europe both understand themselves 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.870
 the idea of ​​an identity generation 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.060
 comes from france in october 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.490
 occupied activists last year 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.580
 the generation identity 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.900
 a mosque roof imports the choice of 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.400
 places no coincidence 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.650
 in 732, import defeated the 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.230
 leader of the francs karl martell das 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.850
 heer muslim conqueror before the 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:35.930
 occupation had become a manifesto 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:38.210
 movement at youtube spreads one 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.160
 visually, there is no central 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.280
 control for this movement but 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.720
 This movement is a kind of right grass 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.320
 becomes the movement according to the principle 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.750
 the work in progress works 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.230
 It means that there are certain guiding ideas 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.000
 certain manifestations like this manifest 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.460
 from France with unique 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.500
 racist ku quotations into the net 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.680
 set and it will be called 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.750
 certain forms of actions 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.090
 to repeat the other one 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.400
 they have made their way into the net 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.310
 to set and therefore just these thoughts 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.380
 continue to spread 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.590
 in germany these spread 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:21.220
 thoughts on facebook next and that 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:24.370
 already like over 3,000 after own 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.790
 disclosures there is in this country 35 local 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.980
 groups and more than 350 activists 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:34.360
 men from west german big cities 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:36.670
 Usually between 18 and 25 years old 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.830
 pretend not to be racists 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:42.640
 Rather, they want their ethno 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.680
 cultural identity get the ns 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.980
 Concept of imminent folk death 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.040
 Avoid talking about survival 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.380
 ethnicity is said to be in 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.280
 a europe of peoples from each other 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.920
 be separated 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.100
 everything was shaped by the 1970s 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:03.100
 the band is the mastermind of the new right 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:07.180
 this folk ideology old content 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:09.460
 new label in consequence is this 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.710
 think and also this campaign of 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.730
 Ruling on an ethno cultural 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.140
 identity a thinking what democracy television 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.870
 is and not anymore 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.880
 is constitutional because it is the 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.250
 understanding of the political location that 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.530
 understanding of human rights is not 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.170
 to relate more to the individual but 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.660
 after an ethnically cultural 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:35.500
 Derive the principle of origin and thus 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:38.050
 per se, people are thinking of their thinking 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.150
 not fit but want in 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.850
 Austria carries this thinking first 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.890
 fruits the votivkirche in vienna asylum 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.390
 I've been looking for that until recently 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.270
 a hunger strike for more rights 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.430
 protests members of identities 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.190
 movement austria then started 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:58.170
 one against occupation of the church only one 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.170
 few hours lasted the haunting 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:06.139
 the movement wants to get out of the internet 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:08.160
 and wear your fight on the street 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.830
 Eventually, there will be something like that 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.169
 ethno cultural civil war preached 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:16.289
 and that is also substantiated with 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:19.080
 a kind of ethno-cultural self-sustaining 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:20.970
 this generation calls itself the 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.470
 last generation still able 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.080
 would be something to do 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.449
 Of course, there is the question what 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.250
 who want to do and what comes out 

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:33.090
 and that certainly has one 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.750
 dangerous note at flashmobs and in 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.090
 facebook 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.699
 dare to loud and determined 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.500
 but be the courage of his mask for one 

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:45.539
 interview with culture to take time off 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:47.400
 At the end nobody had the federal office for 

00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:49.349
 constitutional protection already has an eye 

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.300
 thrown on the move 

00:07:49.349 --> 00:07:54.270
 yet one was not sure 

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:57.169
 how to estimate the identities 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:00.900
 such a spokeswoman against culture time 

00:07:57.169 --> 00:08:03.169
 in death he polarizes as well as in 

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.169
 Life
