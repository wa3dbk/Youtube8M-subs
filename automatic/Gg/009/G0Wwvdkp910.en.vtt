00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
don't you know I think it's kind of a

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.220 
don't you know I think it's kind of a
myth<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.400> everybody<00:00:12.330> goes<00:00:12.540> out<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.049> does

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
myth that everybody goes out and does

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.140 
myth that everybody goes out and does
stuff<00:00:13.590> on<00:00:13.769> Year's<00:00:14.009> Eve<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.429> think<00:00:14.730> it's<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.880> small

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
stuff on Year's Eve I think it's a small

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.670 
stuff on Year's Eve I think it's a small
percent<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.809> think<00:00:15.839> most<00:00:16.109> people<00:00:16.230> just<00:00:16.379> kind<00:00:16.560> of

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
percent I think most people just kind of

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.279 
percent I think most people just kind of
stay<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.100> go<00:00:17.250> well<00:00:17.930> tomorrow's<00:00:18.930> another<00:00:19.170> day

cities<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> really<00:00:31.560> liked<00:00:31.710> capital<00:00:32.130> cities

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369

they<00:00:32.430> had<00:00:32.520> an<00:00:32.610> actual<00:00:32.790> trumpet<00:00:33.239> player<00:00:33.450> I

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
they had an actual trumpet player I

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.540 
they had an actual trumpet player I
thought<00:00:33.750> was<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> two<00:00:34.350> guys<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:35.040> duo

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
thought was just the two guys a a duo

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.729 
thought was just the two guys a a duo
but<00:00:36.079> apparently<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.110> guess<00:00:37.230> when<00:00:37.530> they<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
but apparently I guess when they do a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.049 
but apparently I guess when they do a
live<00:00:37.950> show<00:00:38.160> maybe<00:00:38.340> they'd<00:00:38.550> bring<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
live show maybe they'd bring in the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.700 
live show maybe they'd bring in the
whole<00:00:39.149> band<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.809> was<00:00:39.899> kind<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.110> cool<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.530> want

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
whole band so it was kind of cool I want

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.020 
whole band so it was kind of cool I want
to<00:00:40.770> show<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.010> really<00:00:41.190> cool<00:00:41.399> box<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.879> got

kind of dovetail I think there's a

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.700 
kind of dovetail I think there's a
certain<00:00:51.510> jigs<00:00:51.960> or<00:00:52.140> something<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.559> do

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
certain jigs or something you can do

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.590

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
that make those can you see that all

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.020 
that make those can you see that all
right<00:00:54.629> those<00:00:55.230> types<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.800> design<00:00:56.579> none<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.000> that

right those types of design none of that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.979

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
short maybe a minute or so but I sort of

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.700 
short maybe a minute or so but I sort of
like<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:29.970> format<00:01:30.840> anyway<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.259> that's<00:01:31.530> what's

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
them directly to my website I had a few

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.980 
them directly to my website I had a few
people<00:01:46.920> asking<00:01:47.369> me<00:01:47.460> about<00:01:47.579> my<00:01:47.909> shop<00:01:48.299> cabinet

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
people asking me about my shop cabinet

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.200 
people asking me about my shop cabinet
not<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.950> was<00:01:50.070> painted<00:01:50.340> green<00:01:50.880> it

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
not just that it was painted green it

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.270 
not just that it was painted green it
was<00:01:51.360> people<00:01:52.259> always<00:01:52.619> like<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.950> know<00:01:53.009> why<00:01:53.250> I

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
was people always like to know why I

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.219 
was people always like to know why I
paint<00:01:53.670> things<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.149> colors<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.630> do<00:01:54.689> actually

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
paint things the colors I do actually

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.230 
paint things the colors I do actually
the<00:01:55.470> reason<00:01:55.710> why<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.829> paint<00:01:56.189> these<00:01:56.610> colors<00:01:57.090> is

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the reason why I paint these colors is

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.700 
the reason why I paint these colors is
because<00:01:57.390> that's<00:01:57.719> what<00:01:57.930> paint<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.500> left

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
because that's what paint we have left

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.039 
because that's what paint we have left
over<00:01:59.009> from<00:01:59.189> other<00:01:59.430> projects<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.600> green<00:02:00.840> is

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
over from other projects that green is

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.840 
over from other projects that green is
actually<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> walls<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.670> our

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
actually the one of the walls in our

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.639 
actually the one of the walls in our
living<00:02:03.299> room<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:03.990> we<00:02:04.079> saw<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> whole<00:02:04.469> bunch

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
living room and so we saw a whole bunch

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.950 
living room and so we saw a whole bunch
of<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.950> leftover<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.880> used<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:06.840> you

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
of that leftover so I used that but you

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.050 
of that leftover so I used that but you
know<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.649> bright<00:02:07.890> colors<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.610> here<00:02:08.879> a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
know I like the bright colors in here a

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.639 
know I like the bright colors in here a
couple<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.479> people<00:02:09.690> asked<00:02:09.869> me<00:02:09.989> why<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.229> didn't

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
couple of people asked me why I didn't

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.450 
couple of people asked me why I didn't
make<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:11.039> channel<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:11.640> cut

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
make this channel just cut

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.660 
make this channel just cut
-<00:02:12.550> grooves<00:02:13.360> in<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.170> wood<00:02:14.380> itself<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.430> did

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
- grooves in the wood itself and I did

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.550 
- grooves in the wood itself and I did
think<00:02:15.910> about<00:02:16.150> doing<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.630> but<00:02:16.930> this<00:02:17.320> is

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
think about doing that but this is

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.090 
think about doing that but this is
different<00:02:18.130> than<00:02:18.490> say<00:02:19.000> my<00:02:19.270> credenza<00:02:19.830> where<00:02:20.830> the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
different than say my credenza where the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.370 
different than say my credenza where the
doors<00:02:21.370> don't<00:02:21.730> overlap<00:02:22.390> each<00:02:22.630> other<00:02:22.810> one<00:02:23.080> door

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
doors don't overlap each other one door

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.050 
doors don't overlap each other one door
just<00:02:23.650> goes<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.070> butts<00:02:24.250> up<00:02:24.430> against<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.910> other

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
just goes and butts up against the other

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.880 
just goes and butts up against the other
one<00:02:25.270> so<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.420> can<00:02:25.540> get<00:02:25.660> by<00:02:25.750> with<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:25.960> single<00:02:26.560> track

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
one so I can get by with a single track

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.040 
one so I can get by with a single track
which<00:02:27.160> I<00:02:27.280> just<00:02:27.490> cut<00:02:27.730> right<00:02:27.760> in<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.090> wood<00:02:28.270> for

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
which I just cut right in the wood for

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.230 
which I just cut right in the wood for
this<00:02:29.410> kind<00:02:29.770> of<00:02:29.920> track<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.490> hope<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:30.880> can<00:02:31.030> see

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
this kind of track I hope you can see

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.410 
this kind of track I hope you can see
that<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:33.160> pretty<00:02:33.430> thin<00:02:33.850> in<00:02:34.060> there<00:02:34.240> and<00:02:34.390> I

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
that this is pretty thin in there and I

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.270 
that this is pretty thin in there and I
was<00:02:34.540> just<00:02:34.660> afraid<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:34.990> if<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.260> cut<00:02:35.470> too<00:02:35.710> dedos

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
was just afraid that if I cut too dedos

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.970 
was just afraid that if I cut too dedos
that<00:02:36.520> that<00:02:36.670> would<00:02:36.820> probably<00:02:37.240> just<00:02:37.420> be<00:02:37.980> flimsy

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
that that would probably just be flimsy

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.950 
that that would probably just be flimsy
and<00:02:39.070> break<00:02:39.310> off<00:02:39.630> especially<00:02:40.630> if<00:02:40.720> it's<00:02:40.870> in

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
and break off especially if it's in

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.990 
and break off especially if it's in
plywood<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.680> could<00:02:42.010> probably<00:02:42.220> do<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.430> in<00:02:42.580> Maple

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
plywood I could probably do it in Maple

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.550 
plywood I could probably do it in Maple
but<00:02:43.180> even<00:02:43.420> then<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.780> might<00:02:43.990> you<00:02:44.350> know<00:02:44.410> because

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
but even then it might you know because

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.840 
but even then it might you know because
that<00:02:44.650> would<00:02:44.770> be<00:02:44.830> pretty<00:02:44.980> hard<00:02:45.100> so<00:02:45.520> that's<00:02:45.670> why

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
that would be pretty hard so that's why

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.640 
that would be pretty hard so that's why
I<00:02:45.880> use<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.300> plastic<00:02:46.510> runners<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.380> these<00:02:47.530> are

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
I use the plastic runners and these are

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.230 
I use the plastic runners and these are
pretty<00:02:47.770> inexpensive<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.850> seems<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.150> be

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
pretty inexpensive and it seems to be

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.210 
pretty inexpensive and it seems to be
working<00:02:49.630> out<00:02:49.720> really<00:02:50.110> well<00:02:50.440> Tapp<00:02:50.770> time<00:02:51.010> right

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
working out really well Tapp time right

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.490 
working out really well Tapp time right

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
suggestion another question about the

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.690 
suggestion another question about the
cabinet<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.590> few<00:03:59.740> people<00:03:59.980> were<00:04:00.070> asking<00:04:00.490> it<00:04:00.610> is

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
cabinet a few people were asking it is

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.120 
cabinet a few people were asking it is
whether<00:04:00.970> that<00:04:01.090> one<00:04:01.690> fringe<00:04:02.200> cleat<00:04:02.620> is<00:04:02.800> enough

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
whether that one fringe cleat is enough

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.010 
whether that one fringe cleat is enough
to<00:04:03.370> hold<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.910> weight<00:04:03.940> of<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.390> cabinet<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:04.960> I

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
to hold the weight of the cabinet and I

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.780 
to hold the weight of the cabinet and I
think<00:04:05.320> it<00:04:05.470> is<00:04:05.620> it's<00:04:05.890> pretty<00:04:06.100> strong<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:06.640> was

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
think it is it's pretty strong I was

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.210 
think it is it's pretty strong I was
kind<00:04:07.000> of<00:04:07.060> holding<00:04:07.660> myself<00:04:07.840> on<00:04:08.290> it<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:09.040> think

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
kind of holding myself on it and I think

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.730 
kind of holding myself on it and I think
as<00:04:09.310> long<00:04:09.400> as<00:04:09.580> your<00:04:09.910> fridge<00:04:10.450> cleat<00:04:10.780> goes<00:04:10.990> into

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
as long as your fridge cleat goes into

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.640 
as long as your fridge cleat goes into
the<00:04:12.550> studs<00:04:12.970> you're<00:04:13.540> fine<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:13.960> I<00:04:14.050> had<00:04:14.260> I<00:04:14.410> used<00:04:14.440> a

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
the studs you're fine and I had I used a

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.710 
the studs you're fine and I had I used a
lag<00:04:14.860> bolt<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.460> you<00:04:15.670> know<00:04:15.970> probably<00:04:16.210> had<00:04:16.570> that

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
lag bolt that you know probably had that

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.370 
lag bolt that you know probably had that
much<00:04:17.049> that<00:04:17.290> went<00:04:17.470> into<00:04:17.710> the<00:04:18.130> stud<00:04:18.460> and<00:04:19.390> also<00:04:20.140> as

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
much that went into the stud and also as

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.659 
much that went into the stud and also as
an<00:04:20.560> added<00:04:20.680> support<00:04:21.100> I<00:04:21.190> didn't<00:04:21.370> show<00:04:21.460> it<00:04:21.520> in<00:04:21.609> the

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
an added support I didn't show it in the

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:22.730 
an added support I didn't show it in the
video<00:04:21.880> but<00:04:21.940> I<00:04:22.060> had<00:04:22.270> some<00:04:22.510> of<00:04:22.600> the

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
video but I had some of the

video but I had some of the
little<00:04:23.090> angle<00:04:24.090> brackets<00:04:24.599> you<00:04:24.780> know<00:04:24.930> like

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
falling down but to keep it from

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.730 
falling down but to keep it from
swinging<00:04:39.509> out<00:04:39.960> which<00:04:40.169> I<00:04:40.289> don't<00:04:40.349> think<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:40.650> was

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
swinging out which I don't think it was

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.529 
swinging out which I don't think it was
gonna<00:04:40.830> be<00:04:40.919> a<00:04:41.009> problem<00:04:41.430> but<00:04:41.610> anyway<00:04:42.300> so<00:04:42.360> we'll

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
gonna be a problem but anyway so we'll

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.570 
gonna be a problem but anyway so we'll
just<00:04:42.660> see<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:42.840> don't<00:04:43.020> if<00:04:43.319> it<00:04:43.650> if<00:04:43.949> it<00:04:44.069> starts<00:04:44.400> to

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
just see I don't if it if it starts to

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.189 
just see I don't if it if it starts to
get<00:04:45.150> loose<00:04:45.360> or<00:04:45.569> anything<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:45.870> don't<00:04:46.020> think<00:04:46.139> the

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
get loose or anything I don't think the

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.050 
get loose or anything I don't think the
whole<00:04:46.289> thing's<00:04:46.530> gonna<00:04:46.620> crash<00:04:47.039> out<00:04:47.370> at<00:04:47.550> once<00:04:47.819> it

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
whole thing's gonna crash out at once it

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.390 
whole thing's gonna crash out at once it
would<00:04:48.180> slowly<00:04:48.539> start<00:04:49.080> to<00:04:49.289> loosen<00:04:49.830> so<00:04:50.130> people

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
would slowly start to loosen so people

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.159 
would slowly start to loosen so people
were<00:04:50.460> asking<00:04:50.759> me<00:04:50.880> about<00:04:51.000> my<00:04:51.270> jointer<00:04:51.870> that<00:04:52.139> I

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
were asking me about my jointer that I

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.529 
were asking me about my jointer that I
had<00:04:52.590> in<00:04:52.889> that<00:04:53.069> spot<00:04:53.460> and<00:04:53.669> I<00:04:53.729> had<00:04:53.910> I<00:04:54.090> took<00:04:54.360> my

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
had in that spot and I had I took my

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.170 
had in that spot and I had I took my
jointer<00:04:54.990> apart<00:04:55.470> it's<00:04:56.099> been<00:04:56.280> a<00:04:56.310> long<00:04:56.580> long<00:04:56.909> time

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
jointer apart it's been a long long time

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.510 
jointer apart it's been a long long time
ago<00:04:57.360> maybe<00:04:57.750> six<00:04:58.380> seven<00:04:58.740> months<00:04:58.860> ago<00:04:59.069> and<00:04:59.460> I

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
ago maybe six seven months ago and I

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.580 
ago maybe six seven months ago and I
thought<00:04:59.699> I<00:04:59.759> would<00:04:59.909> it<00:05:00.389> never<00:05:00.750> really<00:05:01.110> worked

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
thought I would it never really worked

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.230 
thought I would it never really worked
that<00:05:01.919> well<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.550> so<00:05:02.610> I<00:05:02.669> thought<00:05:02.849> I<00:05:02.909> would<00:05:03.090> take

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
that well and so I thought I would take

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.870 
that well and so I thought I would take
it<00:05:03.389> apart<00:05:03.659> and<00:05:03.750> just<00:05:03.870> try<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.139> refurbish<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:04.880> it

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
it apart and just try to refurbish it it

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.640 
it apart and just try to refurbish it it
ended<00:05:06.180> up<00:05:06.270> just<00:05:06.330> staying<00:05:06.840> up<00:05:07.020> I<00:05:07.199> just<00:05:07.409> never

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
ended up just staying up I just never

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.640 
ended up just staying up I just never
had<00:05:07.979> the<00:05:08.099> time<00:05:08.400> to<00:05:08.460> get<00:05:08.940> to<00:05:09.210> it<00:05:09.240> but<00:05:09.960> then<00:05:10.139> after

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
had the time to get to it but then after

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.029 
had the time to get to it but then after
I<00:05:10.949> was<00:05:11.330> not<00:05:12.330> using<00:05:12.750> it<00:05:13.050> I<00:05:13.080> hadn't<00:05:13.470> used<00:05:13.620> it<00:05:13.830> all

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
I was not using it I hadn't used it all

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.580 
I was not using it I hadn't used it all
this<00:05:14.220> time<00:05:14.550> I<00:05:14.970> thought<00:05:15.509> well<00:05:15.690> then<00:05:15.900> maybe<00:05:16.470> I

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
this time I thought well then maybe I

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.439 
this time I thought well then maybe I
don't<00:05:16.830> really<00:05:17.009> need<00:05:17.280> that<00:05:17.340> jointer<00:05:18.150> if<00:05:18.330> I

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
don't really need that jointer if I

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.390 
don't really need that jointer if I
haven't<00:05:18.659> used<00:05:18.960> it<00:05:19.110> I<00:05:19.169> haven't<00:05:19.380> missed<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:19.830> so<00:05:20.370> I

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
haven't used it I haven't missed it so I

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.189 
haven't used it I haven't missed it so I
gave<00:05:20.639> it<00:05:20.729> away<00:05:20.819> a<00:05:20.909> guy<00:05:21.150> on<00:05:21.300> Craig's<00:05:21.720> on

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199

great I hope somebody can get some use

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.920 
great I hope somebody can get some use
out<00:05:29.729> of<00:05:29.849> it<00:05:29.940> I'm<00:05:30.030> not<00:05:30.120> sure<00:05:30.389> if<00:05:30.509> I<00:05:30.599> want<00:05:30.780> to<00:05:30.840> get

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
out of it I'm not sure if I want to get

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.020 
out of it I'm not sure if I want to get
a<00:05:30.990> no<00:05:31.229> jointer<00:05:31.800> for<00:05:32.039> now<00:05:32.340> I<00:05:32.370> don't<00:05:32.759> really

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
a no jointer for now I don't really

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.480 
a no jointer for now I don't really
think<00:05:33.180> I<00:05:33.449> need<00:05:33.690> one<00:05:33.800> at<00:05:34.800> least<00:05:34.979> for<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.310> work

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
think I need one at least for the work

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.270 
think I need one at least for the work
that<00:05:35.729> I<00:05:35.759> do<00:05:35.909> I<00:05:36.180> don't<00:05:36.840> do<00:05:37.020> a<00:05:37.050> lot<00:05:37.229> of<00:05:37.440> super

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
that I do I don't do a lot of super

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.089 
that I do I don't do a lot of super
super<00:05:38.610> fine<00:05:38.880> high<00:05:39.389> tolerance<00:05:40.110> work<00:05:40.409> so<00:05:40.800> I

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
super fine high tolerance work so I

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.760 
super fine high tolerance work so I
think<00:05:41.880> I'll<00:05:42.090> just<00:05:42.240> do<00:05:42.930> with<00:05:43.080> that<00:05:43.229> I<00:05:43.349> did<00:05:43.530> a<00:05:43.560> lot

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
think I'll just do with that I did a lot

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.860 
think I'll just do with that I did a lot
of<00:05:43.800> nailing<00:05:44.190> in<00:05:44.520> this<00:05:44.669> last<00:05:44.940> video<00:05:45.240> using

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.040 
of nailing in this last video using
these<00:05:46.080> two<00:05:46.949> nail<00:05:47.639> guns<00:05:48.030> I<00:05:48.300> have<00:05:48.360> used<00:05:48.900> them

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
these two nail guns I have used them

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.420 
these two nail guns I have used them
before<00:05:49.380> but<00:05:49.560> I<00:05:49.620> haven't<00:05:49.889> used<00:05:50.099> it<00:05:50.219> to<00:05:50.340> the

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
before but I haven't used it to the

before but I haven't used it to the
extent<00:05:50.880> that<00:05:50.940> I<00:05:51.060> did<00:05:51.300> in<00:05:51.449> that<00:05:51.479> video<00:05:51.990> this<00:05:52.710> is

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.930 
the one I've always had and I don't I
don't<00:05:55.289> even<00:05:55.469> think<00:05:55.740> it's<00:05:55.860> a<00:05:55.949> real<00:05:56.130> brand<00:05:56.490> it's

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
don't even think it's a real brand it's

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.290 
don't even think it's a real brand it's
just<00:05:57.210> it's<00:05:57.659> blue<00:05:58.159> it<00:05:59.159> doesn't<00:05:59.430> have<00:05:59.669> a<00:05:59.699> logo<00:06:00.270> or

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
just it's blue it doesn't have a logo or

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.029 
just it's blue it doesn't have a logo or
anything<00:06:00.750> on<00:06:01.110> it<00:06:01.259> so<00:06:01.380> I'm<00:06:01.469> not<00:06:01.590> sure<00:06:01.650> what<00:06:01.949> it

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
anything on it so I'm not sure what it

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.719 
anything on it so I'm not sure what it
is<00:06:02.069> but<00:06:02.190> it<00:06:02.430> works<00:06:02.580> well<00:06:02.759> and<00:06:03.000> it<00:06:03.449> takes<00:06:03.719> these

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
is but it works well and it takes these

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:10.399 
is but it works well and it takes these
nails<00:06:05.729> I<00:06:06.150> guess<00:06:06.360> they're<00:06:06.990> to<00:06:07.110> rub<00:06:08.599> is<00:06:09.599> it<00:06:09.840> 16

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.409 
nails I guess they're to rub is it 16

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:13.040 
nails I guess they're to rub is it 16
gauge<00:06:10.919> something<00:06:11.490> like<00:06:11.639> that<00:06:11.909> those<00:06:12.719> kind<00:06:12.990> of

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
gauge something like that those kind of

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.820 
gauge something like that those kind of
things<00:06:13.289> but<00:06:13.560> these<00:06:13.979> have<00:06:14.250> head<00:06:14.520> zones<00:06:14.880> but<00:06:15.240> I

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
things but these have head zones but I

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.249 
things but these have head zones but I
used<00:06:16.830> this<00:06:17.310> this<00:06:17.969> came<00:06:18.300> from<00:06:18.569> a<00:06:18.750> viewer<00:06:18.990> sent

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
used this this came from a viewer sent

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:20.959 
used this this came from a viewer sent
me<00:06:19.380> this<00:06:19.530> a<00:06:19.590> while<00:06:19.860> back<00:06:20.069> and<00:06:20.250> I<00:06:20.310> just<00:06:20.340> recently

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
me this a while back and I just recently

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.270 
me this a while back and I just recently
got<00:06:21.419> pins<00:06:21.780> for<00:06:21.990> this<00:06:22.110> is<00:06:22.259> a<00:06:22.289> pin<00:06:22.680> nailer<00:06:23.130> and

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
got pins for this is a pin nailer and

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.529 
got pins for this is a pin nailer and
this<00:06:24.180> thing<00:06:24.509> takes<00:06:24.870> 18<00:06:25.560> gauge<00:06:25.949> pins<00:06:26.430> which<00:06:27.389> are

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
this thing takes 18 gauge pins which are

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.029 
this thing takes 18 gauge pins which are
these<00:06:27.659> little<00:06:27.960> bitty<00:06:28.139> things<00:06:28.440> and<00:06:28.650> they<00:06:28.740> look

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
these little bitty things and they look

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.040 
these little bitty things and they look
almost<00:06:29.190> like<00:06:29.460> needles<00:06:29.969> and<00:06:30.240> you<00:06:30.509> can<00:06:30.659> just<00:06:30.810> you

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
almost like needles and you can just you

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.510 
almost like needles and you can just you
shoot<00:06:31.320> them<00:06:31.440> right<00:06:31.620> in<00:06:31.770> and<00:06:31.949> it<00:06:32.039> leaves<00:06:32.219> no

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
shoot them right in and it leaves no

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.440 
shoot them right in and it leaves no
hole<00:06:33.240> on<00:06:33.539> the<00:06:33.659> top<00:06:33.839> so<00:06:34.020> I<00:06:34.050> use<00:06:34.289> these<00:06:34.500> two

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
hole on the top so I use these two

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.720 
hole on the top so I use these two
fit<00:06:35.630> this<00:06:36.050> inside<00:06:36.830> of<00:06:37.160> the<00:06:38.830> this<00:06:39.830> track<00:06:40.280> and<00:06:40.610> it

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:40.730 
fit this inside of the this track and it

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.390 
fit this inside of the this track and it
just<00:06:40.940> fits<00:06:41.180> down<00:06:41.420> in<00:06:41.630> there<00:06:41.810> really<00:06:42.020> nicely<00:06:42.400> so

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
just fits down in there really nicely so

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.920 
just fits down in there really nicely so
I'm<00:06:43.460> gonna<00:06:43.580> start<00:06:43.760> using<00:06:43.970> that<00:06:44.270> a<00:06:44.510> little<00:06:44.810> bit

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
I'm gonna start using that a little bit

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.590 
I'm gonna start using that a little bit
more<00:06:45.200> often<00:06:45.440> I<00:06:45.740> think<00:06:45.770> I<00:06:46.130> like<00:06:46.360> projects<00:06:47.360> that

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 
more often I think I like projects that

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.290 
more often I think I like projects that
I<00:06:47.630> could<00:06:47.900> glue<00:06:48.140> up<00:06:48.380> and<00:06:48.590> then<00:06:48.680> just<00:06:49.240> put<00:06:50.240> them

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
I could glue up and then just put them

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.120 
I could glue up and then just put them
together<00:06:50.540> with<00:06:50.870> the<00:06:50.930> tacks<00:06:51.320> the<00:06:51.680> purpose<00:06:52.010> of

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
together with the tacks the purpose of

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.000 
together with the tacks the purpose of
the<00:06:52.220> tax<00:06:52.460> is<00:06:52.760> just<00:06:52.970> to<00:06:53.180> hold<00:06:53.870> the<00:06:54.650> wood

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.010 
the tax is just to hold the wood

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.740 
the tax is just to hold the wood
together<00:06:55.250> while<00:06:55.670> the<00:06:55.880> glue<00:06:56.150> dries<00:06:56.180> it's<00:06:56.570> just

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750 
together while the glue dries it's just

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.780 
together while the glue dries it's just
I<00:06:56.870> think<00:06:57.410> it's<00:06:57.590> just<00:06:57.710> an<00:06:57.860> alternative<00:06:58.400> to

00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:58.790 
I think it's just an alternative to

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.520 
I think it's just an alternative to
clamping<00:06:59.450> and<00:06:59.630> it<00:06:59.720> saves<00:06:59.960> a<00:07:00.080> lot<00:07:00.110> of<00:07:00.320> time

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
clamping and it saves a lot of time

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.290 
clamping and it saves a lot of time
especially<00:07:00.770> if<00:07:01.130> you<00:07:01.220> don't<00:07:01.370> have<00:07:01.550> tons<00:07:02.120> and

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.300 
especially if you don't have tons and

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.810 
especially if you don't have tons and
tons<00:07:02.330> of<00:07:02.660> clamps<00:07:03.170> and<00:07:03.350> my<00:07:03.740> compressor<00:07:04.550> I've

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:04.820 
tons of clamps and my compressor I've

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.880 
tons of clamps and my compressor I've
had<00:07:05.090> for<00:07:05.450> many<00:07:05.840> years<00:07:06.140> I<00:07:06.170> actually<00:07:06.380> got<00:07:06.680> the

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:06.890 
had for many years I actually got the

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.920 
had for many years I actually got the
compressor<00:07:07.250> at<00:07:07.700> Target<00:07:08.300> which<00:07:08.480> is<00:07:08.660> just<00:07:08.840> a

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:08.930 
compressor at Target which is just a

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.550 
compressor at Target which is just a
discount<00:07:09.530> store<00:07:09.920> and<00:07:10.190> I<00:07:11.030> got<00:07:11.420> it<00:07:11.600> a<00:07:11.870> long<00:07:12.230> time

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
discount store and I got it a long time

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.590 
discount store and I got it a long time
ago<00:07:12.860> it<00:07:13.040> came<00:07:13.220> as<00:07:13.370> a<00:07:13.400> package<00:07:13.910> with<00:07:14.150> it<00:07:14.420> came

with this actually and it also is just I
don't<00:07:18.260> know<00:07:18.380> it<00:07:18.440> doesn't<00:07:18.530> really<00:07:18.710> have<00:07:18.920> a

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:18.950 
don't know it doesn't really have a

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.330 
don't know it doesn't really have a
brand<00:07:19.310> I'm<00:07:19.880> sure<00:07:20.270> what<00:07:20.570> it<00:07:20.780> is<00:07:20.810> but<00:07:21.230> it<00:07:21.890> just<00:07:22.100> it

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:22.340 
brand I'm sure what it is but it just it

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.800 
brand I'm sure what it is but it just it

woodworking<00:07:25.760> for<00:07:25.790> mere<00:07:25.940> mortals<00:07:26.210> I'm<00:07:26.870> really

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.200 
woodworking for mere mortals I'm really

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.390 
woodworking for mere mortals I'm really
looking<00:07:27.410> forward<00:07:27.650> to<00:07:27.830> this<00:07:27.950> year<00:07:28.250> I<00:07:28.280> think

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 
looking forward to this year I think

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.820 
looking forward to this year I think
it's<00:07:28.610> gonna<00:07:28.760> be<00:07:28.970> a<00:07:29.000> good<00:07:29.510> one<00:07:29.750> very<00:07:29.830> productive

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:30.830 
it's gonna be a good one very productive

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.620 
it's gonna be a good one very productive
and<00:07:30.980> I'm<00:07:31.460> approaching<00:07:32.120> it<00:07:32.150> with<00:07:32.240> a<00:07:32.330> lot<00:07:32.600> of

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:32.630 
and I'm approaching it with a lot of

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.340 
and I'm approaching it with a lot of
energy<00:07:33.350> and<00:07:33.670> so<00:07:34.670> I'm<00:07:35.090> hoping<00:07:35.570> that<00:07:35.810> one<00:07:36.200> of<00:07:36.230> the

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:36.350 
energy and so I'm hoping that one of the

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.540 
energy and so I'm hoping that one of the
things<00:07:36.500> I<00:07:36.560> want<00:07:36.710> to<00:07:36.740> do<00:07:36.860> is<00:07:37.040> I<00:07:37.190> want<00:07:37.340> to<00:07:37.370> keep

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:37.550 
things I want to do is I want to keep
