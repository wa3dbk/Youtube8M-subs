00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 welcome the x games my name 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.310
 benjamin burkhart and today we are 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.690
 short commercially inclined bench press my 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.370
 breast program normally like that 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.040
 out that I start with a with 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.710
 a flat bench eg barbell flat 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.260
 bench press and then I want the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.070
 upper part of the breast increases 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.980
 encumber 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.070
 You can through oblique bank variants the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.039
 Upper chest phase increasingly responsive 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.800
 there is no inner outer upper 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.230
 lower chest but you can target through 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.520
 an obliquely bank variant upper fibers 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.980
 burden more 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.110
 The problem with the thing is that many 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.820
 people when pressing as well as at an angle 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.460
 Bank press performs incorrectly 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.200
 I 'm going to make you like you cant 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.370
 Bench press runs and a weight that 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.640
 is on your thighs 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.920
 as I said that the weight is relative 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.329
 a queen is far ahead because here we are 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.489
 have the weight right to the front 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.840
 will go up if you are 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.629
 my weight back there is yours 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.460
 lever bad means if that 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.890
 weight at the knees is one 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.330
 good lever experienced year puts the you 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.760
 that weight you here now and 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.320
 Now move the weight upwards 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.390
 she is on the rack and now 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.790
 very important that we like the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.470
 bank press no t bar bank press 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.860
 So do not look that the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.930
 yes, that would be 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.759
 wrong now in the elbows 90 degrees 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.320
 put away from the body now I have 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.420
 Nice load on the front 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.369
 shoulder actually does the show 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.729
 my shoulder broke that's the bank 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.009
 to press 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.650
 this is equally true for diagonally bank cloudy 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.570
 What is the goal which the target in the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.360
 thing is that you have the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.560
 elbow gets something clean that the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.479
 angle is right so look that the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.009
 elbow gets inside clean and 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.110
 what is my trick with the whole thing 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.610
 Many people find it easier 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.060
 to take the elbow at the short 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.670
 trade 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.909
 if you enter the wrist as well 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.950
 many would make many extremely the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.110
 then, for example, shortly when signed 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.030
 press so execute with this 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.440
 position of the trade so not at all 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.550
 Somehow that's what you do 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.590
 Doing a lot of normal flying this 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.170
 Most people do that kind of thing 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.160
 many fly and do that too 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.260
 press briefly 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.420
 the problem is now often one has then 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.820
 If you can hand the positive hand 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.550
 so it actually takes it that way now 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.470
 a kind of bench press is doing now 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.150
 we have a lot of treat what the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.930
 black variant would be 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.630
 who just instead of the elbows 90 degrees 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.400
 outward 75 degrees inwards and the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.620
 wrists 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.820
 So put that one line 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.470
 make it with our upper arm that would be 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.020
 now no line worthy hunter 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.760
 so go and have the forearm so now 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.070
 I raise my hand at the right angle 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.920
 like the upper one and now you're looking at that 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:01.920
 her with slightly angled so the 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.920
 angle here 75 45 to 75 degrees 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.300
 again with a seat lightweight yes 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:23.200
 what I always do is if you do that 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:25.720
 weight high is so beautiful 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.319
 wrists tighten slightly now have 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.900
 we have a right angle from top to bottom 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.670
 down in the winkl like the dumbbell now 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.910
 I also go downstairs 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:42.540
 not with my upper arm up again 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:46.000
 Together, boxing is about to start higher 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.709
 Going deep this is not deep 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.069
 this is not a rap we have too 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.900
 no chest now it is pressing triceps 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.819
 we make it here shortly his 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.849
 it's just the chest , it's just like a bank 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.739
 Deep Deep Deep Deep Deep Nice 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.060
 almost until the dumbbell can touch us 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.000
 she also touches again depends on passports 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.819
 of your anatomy from relative point and 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.030
 then out of the world from the full to the 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.030
 all the way up 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.169
 Now I've collapsed friends 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.640
 not so that was it for 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.260
 Fear of pressure really looks 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.120
 that the poor are right angles 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.640
 Turn your wrists a bit 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.960
 A small tip still looks to the bank 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.360
 first, that your seat is light 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.490
 Angled so is me just that 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.380
 she is slightly bent 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.180
 We can not really do it here 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.910
 adjust the inclination I like 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.030
 I would like to have something in common 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.130
 As a matter of fact, the bank is a bit 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.120
 To put it diagonally that we only increased 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.620
 weigh up provided the higher the more 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.400
 shoulder more I demand shoulder 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.169
 course in there 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.690
 that means it is actually our goal 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.760
 that we endangered the action with ally 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.700
 bank in a tilt of about 30 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.070
 degree, yes 30 degrees have the inclination 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.720
 I still multiply a lot of breasts 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.080
 the upper and relieved to the 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.620
 shoulder 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.789
 the higher the thing here is the 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.020
 Stock position around for more shoulder 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.070
 I wanted to push in and students 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.710
 we do not do here now 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.530
 that's his fault in chrome march 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.930
 often previously popular exercise often performed 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.640
 but often wrong, I hope with 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.380
 this guide might be short in the future 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.880
 commerce student press better run 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.650
 and then it works with your upper one 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.570
 breast approach in this sense are pleased 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.570
 It's all good of smart goes
