00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.860
 do not 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.380
 for glacier crossings one of the 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.170
 basic and elementary techniques is the 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.240
 tie in the example that we are going 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.860
 to explain then you are going to see 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.130
 how is an agreed upon two 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.380
 people 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.599
 the distance to which we must gain weight 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.429
 we depend on the type of terrain and 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.000
 type of cracks must be taken into account 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.590
 that if we are at a distance 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.720
 excessively short the case may come 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.870
 that all the rope falls inside 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.180
 a crack the basic idea is that the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.510
 rope distance between the two 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.050
 climbers should always be less than 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.059
 the extra rope that we have collected 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.190
 because it is the rope that we will need in 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.640
 the case of having to assemble a hoist 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.330
 for a hypothetical rescue 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.430
 regardless of the system 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.820
 tie that we use what is 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.309
 fundamental is that the attraction is 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.240
 ventral over the knot that is not over 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.740
 our shoulders or on our trunk 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.780
 Another important issue is that the rope 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.670
 has to be tense so that in case of 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.409
 that our partner who leads in 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.450
 crack this does not suppose more than a 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.920
 minimal loss of level 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.799
 at the time of fattening us for a 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.500
 High mountain crossing at one end 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.720
 of the rope we will make a knot in 8 that 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.430
 we will join the harness 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.160
 of this particular knot you have to have 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.710
 consider two precautions that the gag 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.300
 be as small as possible and that 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.250
 a leftover rope of at least four 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.700
 fingers to avoid that the knot can be 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.210
 undo then roll up the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.530
 rope in rings of the same distance 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.720
 for this we can pass the rope through 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.950
 behind the head and by one hand 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.950
 located at the height of the harness 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.440
 the next step once we have the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.150
 Appropriate distance for the 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.790
 terrain that we are going to cover will be 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.570
 make the knot 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.750
 we will pass a gau through the ventral ring 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.330
 and finish with a knot 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.380
 We will secure the remaining gauze 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.380
 harness using a carabiner 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.060
 in anticipation of a possible fall in 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.310
 companion we can take prepared 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.379
 march bidirectional assured 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.940
 directly to our harness and it's going to 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.510
 greatly facilitate the maneuver in 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.510
 rescue case 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.610
 if we are able to gain weight 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.070
 correctly we will have taken a step 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.400
 very important for our security in 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.400
 high mountain
