um<00:04:33.180> now<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.240> other<00:04:34.600> so<00:04:35.020> these<00:04:35.170> are<00:04:35.320> the

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
um now the other so these are the

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.280 
um now the other so these are the
bumpers<00:04:35.860> as<00:04:36.070> you<00:04:36.460> can<00:04:36.610> see<00:04:36.850> they<00:04:37.360> like<00:04:37.990> launch

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
bumpers as you can see they like launch

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.470 
bumpers as you can see they like launch
you<00:04:38.500> in<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.710> air<00:04:38.920> you<00:04:39.820> do<00:04:39.940> take<00:04:40.150> fall<00:04:40.450> damage

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
you in the air you do take fall damage

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.720 
you in the air you do take fall damage
so<00:04:41.170> if<00:04:41.530> you're<00:04:41.770> not<00:04:41.920> on<00:04:42.100> creative<00:04:42.550> motor

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
so if you're not on creative motor

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.160 
so if you're not on creative motor
you're<00:04:42.910> not<00:04:43.060> wearing<00:04:43.300> a<00:04:43.360> pair<00:04:43.540> of<00:04:43.570> boots<00:04:43.870> that

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
you're not wearing a pair of boots that

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.350 
you're not wearing a pair of boots that
have<00:04:44.440> feather<00:04:44.920> fall<00:04:45.190> or<00:04:45.910> whatever<00:04:46.150> you<00:04:46.240> want

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
have feather fall or whatever you want

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.380 
have feather fall or whatever you want
to<00:04:46.390> call<00:04:46.570> it<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:47.560> will<00:04:48.040> die<00:04:48.280> but<00:04:49.060> it's<00:04:49.300> a

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
to call it you will die but it's a

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.230 
to call it you will die but it's a
really<00:04:49.570> cool<00:04:49.660> mechanic<00:04:50.350> for<00:04:50.620> like<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:51.040> know

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
really cool mechanic for like you know

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.820 
really cool mechanic for like you know
some<00:04:52.240> custom<00:04:52.660> maps<00:04:52.900> that<00:04:53.140> you<00:04:53.290> want<00:04:53.470> with<00:04:53.740> the

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
some custom maps that you want with the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.830 
some custom maps that you want with the
sonic<00:04:54.190> map<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.610> it's<00:04:55.210> definitely<00:04:55.510> a<00:04:55.660> lot

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
sonic map and it's definitely a lot

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.800 
sonic map and it's definitely a lot
better<00:04:56.020> than<00:04:56.350> in<00:04:56.890> my<00:04:57.460> opinion<00:04:57.880> than<00:04:58.090> like<00:04:58.390> Fe

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
better than in my opinion than like Fe

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.690 
better than in my opinion than like Fe
disco<00:04:59.230> did<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.530> bumpers<00:04:59.860> in<00:04:59.890> his<00:05:00.160> sonic<00:05:00.460> math

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
disco did the bumpers in his sonic math

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.730 
disco did the bumpers in his sonic math
because<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.510> mean<00:05:01.750> he<00:05:01.840> just<00:05:01.870> didn't<00:05:02.260> TNT

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
because I mean he just didn't TNT

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.530 
because I mean he just didn't TNT
explosion<00:05:03.370> and<00:05:03.580> even<00:05:04.000> though<00:05:04.060> it<00:05:04.180> launches

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
explosion and even though it launches

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.260 
explosion and even though it launches
you<00:05:04.720> I<00:05:04.930> mean<00:05:05.500> it<00:05:05.830> took<00:05:06.220> some<00:05:06.460> resources<00:05:07.030> it

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
you I mean it took some resources it

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.990 
you I mean it took some resources it
kind<00:05:07.450> of<00:05:07.510> lacks<00:05:07.720> people's<00:05:08.140> computers<00:05:08.620> so<00:05:09.220> no

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
kind of lacks people's computers so no

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.030 
kind of lacks people's computers so no
