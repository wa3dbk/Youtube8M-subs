00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.770 

all<00:00:01.260> right<00:00:01.469> I<00:00:01.920> thought<00:00:02.610> I'd<00:00:02.760> make<00:00:03.240> this<00:00:03.419> video

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
all right I thought I'd make this video

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.410 
all right I thought I'd make this video
because<00:00:04.049> there's<00:00:04.290> not<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.500> lot<00:00:04.710> out<00:00:04.740> there

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
because there's not a lot out there

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:13.700 
because there's not a lot out there
about<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:07.910> MakerBot<00:00:08.910> replicator<00:00:09.210> mini<00:00:12.710> I've

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
about the MakerBot replicator mini I've

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.080 
about the MakerBot replicator mini I've
had<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.040> about<00:00:14.460> I'd<00:00:15.179> say<00:00:16.550> two<00:00:17.550> or<00:00:17.670> three<00:00:17.880> days

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
had this about I'd say two or three days

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.060 
had this about I'd say two or three days
now<00:00:18.740> and<00:00:20.930> after<00:00:21.930> reading<00:00:22.320> all<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> reviews

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
now and after reading all the reviews

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.640 
now and after reading all the reviews
and<00:00:23.699> all<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.300> was<00:00:24.570> really<00:00:25.140> skeptical

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
and all that I was really skeptical

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.939 
and all that I was really skeptical
about<00:00:26.039> even<00:00:26.400> opening<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.880> box<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.949> thought

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
about even opening the box I thought

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.540 
about even opening the box I thought
that<00:00:30.859> thought<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:31.890> might<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.250> made<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> mistake

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
that thought I might have made a mistake

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.150 
that thought I might have made a mistake
by<00:00:33.030> buying<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:34.700> but<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:36.059> decided<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.780> keep<00:00:36.960> it

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
by buying it but I decided to keep it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.850 
by buying it but I decided to keep it
you<00:00:39.469> know<00:00:40.670> decided<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.809> take<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> chance<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.559> know

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
you know decided to take a chance I know

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.490 
you know decided to take a chance I know
it's<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.070> lot<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.219> money<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:45.360> such<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> small

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
it's a lot of money for such a small

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.299 
it's a lot of money for such a small
print<00:00:46.890> space<00:00:47.600> but<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.899> thought<00:00:49.219> it<00:00:50.219> was

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
print space but I just thought it was

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.869 
print space but I just thought it was
just<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.789> cool<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.770> at<00:00:52.920> least<00:00:53.129> give<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
just so cool and I at least give it a

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:54.400 
just so cool and I at least give it a
shot

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
shot

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:03.709 
shot
number<00:00:55.410> actually<00:00:55.890> glad<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.699> did<00:00:59.629> it<00:01:02.690> you<00:01:03.690> know

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
number actually glad I did it you know

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.640 
number actually glad I did it you know
it<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> pretty<00:01:04.350> small<00:01:05.159> machine<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:06.000> I

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
it is a pretty small machine but it's I

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.109 
it is a pretty small machine but it's I
don't<00:01:07.650> know<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:07.860> definitely<00:01:08.400> entertaining

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
don't know it's definitely entertaining

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.370 
don't know it's definitely entertaining
to<00:01:09.210> watch<00:01:11.689> some<00:01:12.689> people<00:01:12.960> complain<00:01:13.350> about

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
to watch some people complain about

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.899 
to watch some people complain about
noise<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:15.090> guess<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.080> don't<00:01:16.409> know

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
noise and all that I guess I don't know

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.359 
noise and all that I guess I don't know
it<00:01:17.909> may<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.180> noisy<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.619> really<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
it may be noisy but it's not really that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.710 
it may be noisy but it's not really that
bad<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.409> have<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.530> downstairs<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:24.600> can

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
bad I have it downstairs and you can

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.149 
bad I have it downstairs and you can
sometimes<00:01:24.960> hear<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.530> when<00:01:25.680> you're<00:01:25.830> upstairs

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
sometimes hear it when you're upstairs

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.600 
sometimes hear it when you're upstairs
but<00:01:27.259> for<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.320> most<00:01:28.500> part<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:29.579> not<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.970> bad

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
but for the most part it's not that bad

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.789 
but for the most part it's not that bad
I've<00:01:32.610> already<00:01:32.820> obviously<00:01:33.659> unboxed<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
I've already obviously unboxed it and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.319 
I've already obviously unboxed it and
I've<00:01:35.369> been<00:01:35.579> printing<00:01:36.000> with<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:38.000> as<00:01:39.000> far<00:01:39.270> as

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
I've been printing with it and as far as

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.190 
I've been printing with it and as far as
printing<00:01:39.750> goes<00:01:39.900> I've<00:01:40.140> only<00:01:40.350> had<00:01:41.030> I<00:01:43.399> think<00:01:44.399> two

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
printing goes I've only had I think two

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.920 
printing goes I've only had I think two
failed<00:01:46.200> prints<00:01:47.810> my<00:01:48.810> first<00:01:49.140> failed<00:01:49.530> print<00:01:49.950> was

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
failed prints my first failed print was

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.660 
failed prints my first failed print was
after<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.960> had<00:01:52.259> load<00:01:52.619> his<00:01:52.770> D<00:01:54.110> filament<00:01:55.670> down

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
after I had load his D filament down

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.630 
after I had load his D filament down
here<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.899> dropped<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.380> down<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.710> there<00:01:58.860> and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
here and I dropped it down in there and

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.270 
here and I dropped it down in there and
you<00:01:59.939> know<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.930> loaded<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.740> extruder<00:02:02.219> I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
you know I loaded it in the extruder I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.090 
you know I loaded it in the extruder I
did<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.790> alright<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.710> there<00:02:04.710> was<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.860> little

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
did it alright but there was a little

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.289 
did it alright but there was a little
slack<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
slack in the

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.010 
slack in the
in<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.990> root<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:08.500> know<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.890> real<00:02:10.020> and

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
in the root you know and the real and

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.300 
in the root you know and the real and
what<00:02:11.260> happened<00:02:11.590> was<00:02:11.709> as<00:02:11.890> soon<00:02:12.040> as<00:02:12.220> the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
what happened was as soon as the

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.690 
what happened was as soon as the
extruder<00:02:12.760> got<00:02:13.630> about<00:02:14.410> halfway<00:02:15.069> down<00:02:15.400> with<00:02:15.580> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
extruder got about halfway down with the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.380 
extruder got about halfway down with the
piece<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.239> guess<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.349> filament<00:02:18.099> had<00:02:18.280> got<00:02:18.489> like

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
piece I guess the filament had got like

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.080 
piece I guess the filament had got like
underneath<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:21.720> underneath<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.900> reel<00:02:23.110> and

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
underneath the underneath the reel and

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.050 
underneath the underneath the reel and
like<00:02:25.090> basically<00:02:25.510> was<00:02:25.900> like<00:02:25.930> jammed<00:02:26.700> here<00:02:27.700> like

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
like basically was like jammed here like

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.160 
like basically was like jammed here like
it<00:02:28.209> wouldn't<00:02:28.420> roll<00:02:28.810> anymore<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.680> then<00:02:30.519> it<00:02:31.330> was

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
it wouldn't roll anymore and then it was

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.229 
it wouldn't roll anymore and then it was
basically<00:02:32.560> wouldn't<00:02:33.400> feed<00:02:33.550> anymore<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.180> it

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
basically wouldn't feed anymore so it

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.050 
basically wouldn't feed anymore so it
was<00:02:34.330> printing<00:02:34.750> an<00:02:34.840> open<00:02:35.170> space<00:02:36.569> but<00:02:37.569> that<00:02:39.060> was

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
was printing an open space but that was

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.789 
was printing an open space but that was
my<00:02:40.180> first<00:02:40.209> fail<00:02:40.630> print<00:02:40.959> my<00:02:41.080> second<00:02:41.440> one<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.590> was

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
my first fail print my second one I was

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.949 
my first fail print my second one I was
praying<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.760> was<00:02:43.750> printing<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:45.090> ring<00:02:46.090> diamond

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
praying I was printing a ring diamond

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.330 
praying I was printing a ring diamond
ring<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:49.090> was<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.830> way<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.250> was

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
ring and it was the way that it was

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.160 
ring and it was the way that it was
printing<00:02:52.860> was<00:02:53.860> like<00:02:54.069> this<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.720> as<00:02:55.810> soon<00:02:55.989> as<00:02:56.080> it

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
printing was like this and as soon as it

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.199 
printing was like this and as soon as it
got<00:02:56.260> towards<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.680> top<00:02:56.950> is<00:02:57.190> so<00:02:57.400> top-heavy

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
got towards the top is so top-heavy

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.789 
got towards the top is so top-heavy
it<00:02:58.420> fell<00:02:58.810> over<00:02:59.019> and<00:02:59.530> then<00:03:00.100> it<00:03:00.940> was<00:03:01.120> just

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
it fell over and then it was just

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.070 
it fell over and then it was just
squirting<00:03:02.799> stuff<00:03:03.069> out<00:03:03.250> in<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.549> open<00:03:03.790> air<00:03:04.080> but

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
squirting stuff out in the open air but

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.339 
squirting stuff out in the open air but
that<00:03:05.440> was<00:03:05.590> more<00:03:05.799> I<00:03:06.420> think<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.540> modeling<00:03:08.019> fault

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
that was more I think the modeling fault

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:14.750 
that was more I think the modeling fault
then<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:11.530> was<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:11.920> printer

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.949 

everything<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:15.880> print<00:03:16.150> on<00:03:16.239> this<00:03:16.390> thing<00:03:16.660> it

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
everything you print on this thing it

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.220 
everything you print on this thing it
will<00:03:17.200> have<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.500> raft<00:03:18.359> so<00:03:19.359> I<00:03:19.390> can<00:03:19.660> print<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:20.019> base

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
will have a raft so I can print a base

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.140 
will have a raft so I can print a base
and<00:03:20.620> then<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:21.100> prints<00:03:21.430> on<00:03:21.549> top<00:03:21.730> of<00:03:21.820> that<00:03:21.910> base

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
and then it prints on top of that base

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.729 
and then it prints on top of that base
and<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:23.769> can<00:03:23.920> see<00:03:24.160> if<00:03:25.049> actually<00:03:26.049> you<00:03:26.620> know

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
and you can see if actually you know

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.819 
and you can see if actually you know
like<00:03:26.769> some<00:03:27.190> people<00:03:27.430> complain<00:03:27.730> about<00:03:27.760> these

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
like some people complain about these

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.390 
like some people complain about these

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
a printable engine block it says five

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.960 
a printable engine block it says five
hours<00:04:45.550> 15<00:04:45.940> minutes<00:04:47.220> yeah<00:04:48.220> I<00:04:48.250> bet<00:04:48.550> it'll<00:04:48.730> take
