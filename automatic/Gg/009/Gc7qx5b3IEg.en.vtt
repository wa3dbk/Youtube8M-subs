00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.739
 No doubt about it 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:29.199
 breakneck the question is is you 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:29.199
 crashed or pushed 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.870
 this noble being was white in every one of them 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.879
 angelic she was not a bad old one 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.790
 witch she was a bit 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.059
 strange 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.530
 Basically, I had no plan 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:49.659
 I knew that I got my chance 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.710
 but they said that they had painted 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:56.239
 but I was not alone 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.600
 and then I could not one at night 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.600
 fall asleep 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.049
 mela trace that was an unfortunate 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.409
 chance the wrong place to the wrong 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.409
 time 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.290
 do not you feel that sometimes? 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:28.030
 without you he would still be alive no 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.030
 but me 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.660
 You also know outside yesterday night 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.660
 you did not say that 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.530
 they do not surprise you 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.680
 they are aware that here in one 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.680
 to cut off murder by medium 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.040
 I was so angry that I scared him 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.170
 powder sprinkled over the small cakes 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.880
 that he is on stage and what 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.650
 is connected to the baby cook went off father's 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.290
 of course, the most outrageous 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.290
 dude like salut 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.360
 nobody's perfect faithful 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.850
 his spirit risen again and new 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.260
 dimensioned question is what exactly do 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.450
 we here we really try to be 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.800
 and somebody else was supposed to go last night 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.370
 to be killed 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:18.600
 with a cannonball if now one 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:22.760

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.760
 whole round fat 3 million pounds 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.210
