00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.360 

okay<00:00:03.429> here<00:00:04.089> is<00:00:04.210> the<00:00:04.359> first<00:00:04.750> value<00:00:05.620> pass<00:00:06.100> a

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.370 
okay here is the first value pass a

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.730 
okay here is the first value pass a
little<00:00:07.120> bit<00:00:07.240> of<00:00:07.359> lighting<00:00:07.839> to<00:00:08.080> bring<00:00:08.410> up<00:00:08.590> see

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
little bit of lighting to bring up see

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.800 
little bit of lighting to bring up see
over<00:00:09.040> here<00:00:09.070> all<00:00:09.519> the<00:00:09.700> lights<00:00:09.910> are<00:00:10.030> off<00:00:10.060> it's

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:10.810 
over here all the lights are off it's

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.040 
over here all the lights are off it's
almost<00:00:11.050> like<00:00:11.290> muted<00:00:11.710> overcast<00:00:12.490> on<00:00:12.760> a<00:00:12.790> gray<00:00:13.030> sky

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.050 
almost like muted overcast on a gray sky

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.080 
almost like muted overcast on a gray sky
here<00:00:14.620> we<00:00:14.770> start<00:00:15.040> introducing<00:00:15.340> a<00:00:15.730> little<00:00:16.000> bit

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
here we start introducing a little bit

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.860 
here we start introducing a little bit
brighter<00:00:16.330> values<00:00:16.930> so<00:00:17.109> from<00:00:17.350> here<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:19.570> reason

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:19.870 
brighter values so from here the reason

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.779 
brighter values so from here the reason
why<00:00:19.960> we<00:00:20.110> do<00:00:20.260> this

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
why we do this

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.210 
why we do this
it's<00:00:21.789> like<00:00:21.940> extract<00:00:22.600> brighter<00:00:23.530> values<00:00:24.070> from

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
it's like extract brighter values from

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.340 
it's like extract brighter values from
here<00:00:24.460> higher<00:00:24.699> value<00:00:25.240> levels<00:00:25.600> once<00:00:26.020> I<00:00:26.140> have

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
here higher value levels once I have

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.230 
here higher value levels once I have
this<00:00:26.530> I<00:00:26.680> could<00:00:26.860> then<00:00:27.010> take<00:00:27.280> that<00:00:27.520> value<00:00:27.730> for

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
this I could then take that value for

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.720 
this I could then take that value for
example<00:00:28.330> and<00:00:28.750> use<00:00:28.990> it<00:00:29.199> elsewhere<00:00:29.529> see<00:00:30.400> without

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
example and use it elsewhere see without

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.060 
example and use it elsewhere see without
me<00:00:30.880> having<00:00:31.090> to<00:00:31.529> redefine<00:00:32.529> anything<00:00:32.920> so<00:00:33.039> I

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
me having to redefine anything so I

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.470 
me having to redefine anything so I
could<00:00:33.219> just<00:00:33.399> basically<00:00:33.789> go<00:00:34.030> in<00:00:34.149> here<00:00:34.329> and

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
could just basically go in here and

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.410 
could just basically go in here and
start<00:00:35.100> painting<00:00:36.100> with<00:00:36.280> that<00:00:36.579> value<00:00:37.030> if<00:00:37.149> I<00:00:37.239> want

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
start painting with that value if I want

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.330 
start painting with that value if I want
that<00:00:37.510> value<00:00:37.720> there<00:00:38.110> or<00:00:38.320> this<00:00:38.470> value<00:00:38.649> here<00:00:39.190> I

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
that value there or this value here I

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.120 
that value there or this value here I
could<00:00:40.149> just<00:00:40.180> do<00:00:40.480> so<00:00:40.690> by<00:00:40.960> color<00:00:41.350> picking<00:00:41.649> with

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
could just do so by color picking with

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.850 
could just do so by color picking with
the<00:00:42.309> color<00:00:42.760> picker<00:00:42.970> you<00:00:43.540> see<00:00:43.720> here<00:00:43.930> so<00:00:44.530> this<00:00:44.710> is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
the color picker you see here so this is

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.069 
the color picker you see here so this is
why<00:00:45.760> I<00:00:45.790> only<00:00:46.090> need<00:00:46.450> a<00:00:46.480> little<00:00:46.660> bit<00:00:46.809> of<00:00:46.960> it

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
why I only need a little bit of it

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.020 
why I only need a little bit of it
defined<00:00:47.469> I<00:00:47.710> just<00:00:47.890> need<00:00:48.040> a<00:00:48.070> part<00:00:48.370> of<00:00:48.550> it<00:00:48.670> defined

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
defined I just need a part of it defined

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.510 
defined I just need a part of it defined
for<00:00:49.270> allow<00:00:49.570> me<00:00:49.809> to<00:00:49.989> start<00:00:50.739> extracting<00:00:51.100> the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
for allow me to start extracting the

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.139 
for allow me to start extracting the
values<00:00:52.420> from<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.930> image<00:00:53.200> itself<00:00:53.559> so<00:00:54.309> like<00:00:54.969> so

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
values from the image itself so like so

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.540 
values from the image itself so like so
what<00:00:55.780> I<00:00:55.809> have<00:00:56.079> here<00:00:56.230> basically<00:00:56.379> from<00:00:57.370> this

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
what I have here basically from this

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.880 
what I have here basically from this

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
area here is a full range of values I

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.420 
area here is a full range of values I
have<00:01:00.070> very<00:01:00.309> dark<00:01:00.579> blacks<00:01:01.300> I<00:01:01.629> have<00:01:02.379> kind<00:01:03.370> of

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430

have very dark blacks I have kind of
seven<00:01:04.030> eight<00:01:04.210> nine<00:01:04.479> values<00:01:05.140> of<00:01:05.409> gray<00:01:05.710> here<00:01:05.979> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
seven eight nine values of gray here and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.050 
seven eight nine values of gray here and
from<00:01:07.360> here<00:01:07.869> maybe<00:01:08.650> around<00:01:08.860> here<00:01:09.220> I<00:01:09.580> have<00:01:09.850> all

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.480 
from here maybe around here I have all
the<00:01:10.180> values<00:01:10.330> from<00:01:10.720> five<00:01:10.990> four<00:01:11.770> three<00:01:11.830> two<00:01:12.220> one

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
all the way the only one I'm missing

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.870 
all the way the only one I'm missing
here<00:01:14.020> is<00:01:14.080> white<00:01:14.320> right<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.280> highest<00:01:15.610> value<00:01:15.850> I

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
here is white right the highest value I

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.300 
here is white right the highest value I
have<00:01:15.940> here<00:01:16.570> if<00:01:16.810> I<00:01:16.930> sample<00:01:17.409> is<00:01:17.560> not<00:01:17.799> over<00:01:18.130> here

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
have here if I sample is not over here

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.219 
have here if I sample is not over here
right<00:01:18.520> so<00:01:18.549> over<00:01:19.060> here<00:01:19.299> this<00:01:19.659> range<00:01:19.960> I<00:01:20.080> don't

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
right so over here this range I don't

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.320 
right so over here this range I don't
have<00:01:20.380> yet<00:01:20.590> in<00:01:20.799> this<00:01:21.189> image<00:01:21.369> we<00:01:21.670> want<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.240> be

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
have yet in this image we want to be

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.969 
have yet in this image we want to be
very<00:01:22.479> careful<00:01:22.750> using<00:01:23.170> ranges<00:01:23.650> out<00:01:23.799> here

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
very careful using ranges out here

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.649 
very careful using ranges out here
because<00:01:24.220> it's<00:01:24.369> very<00:01:24.430> very<00:01:24.790> bright<00:01:25.090> if<00:01:25.330> I<00:01:25.450> put

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
because it's very very bright if I put

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:26.429 
because it's very very bright if I put
white<00:01:25.900> up<00:01:26.080> here

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
white up here

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.450 
white up here
let's<00:01:26.710> get<00:01:26.860> 100%<00:01:27.280> it's<00:01:28.210> extremely<00:01:28.869> bright<00:01:29.460> as

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
let's get 100% it's extremely bright as

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.640 
let's get 100% it's extremely bright as
you<00:01:30.610> can<00:01:30.729> see<00:01:30.909> here<00:01:31.150> and<00:01:31.330> you<00:01:32.320> can<00:01:32.500> see

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
you can see here and you can see

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.380 
you can see here and you can see
instantly<00:01:33.250> pops<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.640> image<00:01:33.939> you've<00:01:34.119> ever

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
instantly pops the image you've ever

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.240 
instantly pops the image you've ever
zoom<00:01:34.630> out<00:01:34.780> it's<00:01:35.080> always<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.590> number<00:01:35.710> one<00:01:35.860> read

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
zoom out it's always the number one read

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.969 
zoom out it's always the number one read
so<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:37.030> want<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.570> build<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:37.930> up<00:01:37.990> slowly<00:01:38.500> I<00:01:38.710> want

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
so I want to build that up slowly I want

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.710 
so I want to build that up slowly I want
to<00:01:39.070> save<00:01:39.369> my<00:01:39.610> white<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:40.180> don't<00:01:40.270> want<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:40.570> get

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
to save my white you don't want to get

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.359 
to save my white you don't want to get
white<00:01:40.990> all<00:01:41.200> over<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.619> place<00:01:41.770> like<00:01:41.950> this<00:01:42.159> which

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
white all over the place like this which

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.390 
white all over the place like this which
is<00:01:42.520> just<00:01:42.549> too<00:01:43.060> exposed<00:01:43.860> right<00:01:44.860> even<00:01:45.250> if<00:01:45.310> you

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
is just too exposed right even if you

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.090 
is just too exposed right even if you
take<00:01:45.549> a<00:01:45.579> photo<00:01:45.820> with<00:01:46.329> your<00:01:46.689> camera<00:01:47.140> it's<00:01:47.770> very

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.550 
take a photo with your camera it's very
very<00:01:48.340> hard<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.610> get<00:01:48.810> 100%<00:01:49.810> white<00:01:50.020> or<00:01:50.200> something

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
very hard to get 100% white or something

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.870 
very hard to get 100% white or something
unless<00:01:50.799> you've<00:01:50.979> white<00:01:51.159> balance<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:51.640> out<00:01:51.729> on

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
unless you've white balance it out on

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.850 
unless you've white balance it out on
purpose<00:01:52.150> right<00:01:52.689> but<00:01:52.930> typical<00:01:53.290> images<00:01:53.710> don't

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
purpose right but typical images don't

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.219 
purpose right but typical images don't
have<00:01:54.100> a<00:01:54.340> pure<00:01:54.610> white<00:01:54.850> or<00:01:55.299> at<00:01:55.630> least<00:01:55.780> quite<00:01:56.049> hard

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
have a pure white or at least quite hard

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.800 
have a pure white or at least quite hard
to<00:01:56.290> find

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
to find

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.660 
to find
okay<00:01:58.260> so<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.860> right<00:01:59.070> there<00:01:59.190> earlier<00:01:59.490> I

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
okay so just like right there earlier I

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.210 
okay so just like right there earlier I
took<00:01:59.970> those<00:02:00.390> values<00:02:00.930> sampled<00:02:01.440> it<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.740> add<00:02:01.979> my

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
took those values sampled it to add my

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.170 
took those values sampled it to add my
secondary<00:02:02.880> or<00:02:03.740> guys<00:02:04.740> by<00:02:05.070> now<00:02:05.100> be<00:02:05.520> third<00:02:05.820> level

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
secondary or guys by now be third level

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.389 
secondary or guys by now be third level
details<00:02:06.710> start<00:02:07.710> defining<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.160> form

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
details start defining the form

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.040 
details start defining the form
especially<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.880> face<00:02:09.090> area<00:02:09.300> which<00:02:09.630> we<00:02:09.780> talked

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
especially the face area which we talked

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.680 
especially the face area which we talked
about<00:02:10.140> earlier<00:02:10.819> okay<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:11.880> let<00:02:12.390> me<00:02:12.450> turn<00:02:12.569> that

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
about earlier okay so let me turn that

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.300 
about earlier okay so let me turn that
layer<00:02:12.840> on<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.230> off<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.560> see<00:02:13.770> we<00:02:13.980> start

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
layer on and off you see we start

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.570 
layer on and off you see we start
defining<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.300> little<00:02:15.540> eyeballs<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:17.250> major

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
defining the little eyeballs this major

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.370 
defining the little eyeballs this major
form<00:02:18.120> needs<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.420> read<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> big

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
form needs to read so this is a big

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.400 
form needs to read so this is a big
cylindrical<00:02:20.010> shape<00:02:20.690> me<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.720> pic<00:02:22.080> color<00:02:22.260> up<00:02:22.380> here

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
cylindrical shape me a pic color up here

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.949 
cylindrical shape me a pic color up here
this<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.160> round<00:02:23.520> object<00:02:23.850> with<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.540> little<00:02:24.840> bit

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
this is a round object with a little bit

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.530 
this is a round object with a little bit
of<00:02:25.050> lip<00:02:25.530> right<00:02:25.860> here<00:02:26.069> kind<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.360> goes

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
of lip right here kind of that goes

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.520 
of lip right here kind of that goes
mm-hmm<00:02:28.200> does<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.370> raise<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:30.420> out<00:02:30.600> does

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
mm-hmm does that raise that out does

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.759 
mm-hmm does that raise that out does
this<00:02:31.739> just<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:32.910> like<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.690> right<00:02:34.019> so<00:02:34.200> the

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
this just this like that right so the

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.759 
this just this like that right so the
form<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:36.060> there's<00:02:36.300> another<00:02:36.690> also<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.350> negative

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
form and there's another also a negative

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.229 
form and there's another also a negative
to<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.010> positive<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.670> negative<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.180> positive

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
to a positive and negative to a positive

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.699 
to a positive and negative to a positive
negative<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.170> positive

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
negative to a positive

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.550 
negative to a positive
so<00:02:41.489> even<00:02:41.670> it's<00:02:41.970> though<00:02:42.269> it's<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.750> kind<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.230> side

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
so even it's though it's a kind of side

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.670 
so even it's though it's a kind of side
views<00:02:43.890> shape<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.730> drawing<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.959> still<00:02:46.470> could

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
views shape a drawing you still could

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.940 
views shape a drawing you still could
define<00:02:47.250> quite<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> bit<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.880> form<00:02:48.239> within<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.500> by

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
define quite a bit of form within it by

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.030 
define quite a bit of form within it by
showing<00:02:50.910> your<00:02:51.390> values<00:02:51.930> right<00:02:52.200> which<00:02:52.410> faces<00:02:52.830> up

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
showing your values right which faces up

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.040 
showing your values right which faces up
which<00:02:53.459> faces<00:02:53.910> down<00:02:54.180> like<00:02:54.569> these<00:02:54.720> are<00:02:54.870> little

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
which faces down like these are little

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.280 
which faces down like these are little
bumps<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.069> without<00:02:56.340> these<00:02:57.269> values<00:02:57.750> this

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
bumps so you without these values this

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.229 
bumps so you without these values this
actually<00:02:58.620> doesn't<00:02:58.890> read<00:02:59.100> eyeball<00:02:59.580> area<00:02:59.880> but

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
actually doesn't read eyeball area but

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.449 
actually doesn't read eyeball area but
just<00:03:00.840> simply<00:03:01.170> by<00:03:01.350> doing<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.860> values<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.370> the

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
just simply by doing the values of the

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.030 
just simply by doing the values of the
cylindrical<00:03:03.090> form<00:03:03.720> these<00:03:04.320> read<00:03:04.620> as<00:03:04.769> little

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
cylindrical form these read as little

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.060 
cylindrical form these read as little
popping<00:03:05.370> eyeballs<00:03:06.230> so<00:03:07.230> same<00:03:07.680> with<00:03:07.799> all<00:03:07.920> these

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
popping eyeballs so same with all these

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.289 
popping eyeballs so same with all these
little<00:03:08.340> areas<00:03:08.790> here<00:03:10.790> okay<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:11.880> that's<00:03:12.150> what

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
little areas here okay so that's what

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.390 
little areas here okay so that's what
this<00:03:12.630> layer<00:03:12.959> sort<00:03:13.380> of<00:03:13.440> accomplished<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.220> it's

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
this layer sort of accomplished and it's

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.310 
this layer sort of accomplished and it's
important<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:14.940> can<00:03:15.360> see<00:03:15.390> we<00:03:15.900> haven't<00:03:16.110> touched

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
important you can see we haven't touched

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.319 
important you can see we haven't touched
the<00:03:16.500> background<00:03:16.920> off<00:03:17.100> everything<00:03:17.760> here<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.299> uh

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
the background off everything here is uh

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.479 
the background off everything here is uh
everything<00:03:19.320> over<00:03:19.590> here<00:03:19.620> are<00:03:19.860> still<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.190> same

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
everything over here are still the same

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.699 
everything over here are still the same
nothing's<00:03:20.940> changed<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:22.019> with<00:03:22.290> only<00:03:22.380> thing<00:03:22.590> we

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
nothing's changed so with only thing we

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.580 
nothing's changed so with only thing we
did<00:03:22.890> right<00:03:23.130> now<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.280> just<00:03:23.930> focusing<00:03:24.930> here

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
did right now is just focusing here

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.590 
did right now is just focusing here
right<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.910> good<00:03:27.150> way<00:03:27.299> to<00:03:27.329> work

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
right and this is a good way to work

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.479 
right and this is a good way to work
because<00:03:27.900> he<00:03:28.350> even<00:03:28.590> at<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.829> stage<00:03:29.010> for

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
because he even at this stage for

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.160 
because he even at this stage for
example<00:03:29.940> you're<00:03:30.150> you're<00:03:30.420> on<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.540> client<00:03:30.959> work

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
example you're you're on a client work

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.569 
example you're you're on a client work
or<00:03:31.380> you're<00:03:31.530> working<00:03:31.680> in<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:31.980> house<00:03:32.130> somewhere

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
or you're working in the house somewhere

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.880 
or you're working in the house somewhere
in<00:03:32.850> yeah<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:34.049> have<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.290> finish<00:03:34.410> right<00:03:34.739> now

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
in yeah you have to finish right now

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.259 
in yeah you have to finish right now
like<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:35.250> has<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.459> go<00:03:35.549> to<00:03:35.579> production<00:03:35.940> then

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
like this has to go to production then

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.729 
like this has to go to production then
at<00:03:36.570> least<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.840> can<00:03:36.959> show<00:03:37.109> it<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.380> see<00:03:37.530> it's
