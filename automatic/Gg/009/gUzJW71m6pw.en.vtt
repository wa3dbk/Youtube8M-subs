during<00:00:14.860> the<00:00:14.920> Cold<00:00:15.130> War<00:00:15.370> how<00:00:15.610> do<00:00:15.670> we<00:00:15.759> make

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
during the Cold War how do we make

something<00:00:16.930> this<00:00:17.080> big<00:00:17.349> hover<00:00:17.680> and

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
something this big hover and

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.490 
something this big hover and
