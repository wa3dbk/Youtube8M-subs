that's<00:00:21.270> not<00:00:21.420> something<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.170> lot<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.350> people

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
that's not something a lot of people

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.370 
that's not something a lot of people
would<00:00:23.029> probably<00:00:24.029> set<00:00:24.480> out<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.750> strive<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.230> do

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
would probably set out and strive to do

but<00:00:25.619> for<00:00:25.830> me<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.039> was<00:00:26.160> an<00:00:26.279> interesting<00:00:26.490> Lane

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
but for me it was an interesting Lane

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.210 
but for me it was an interesting Lane
because<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.330> realized<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.900> was<00:00:28.050> area<00:00:28.920> mostly

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.519 
because I realized it was area mostly
dominated<00:00:29.490> by<00:00:29.910> women<00:00:30.269> because<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:31.109> pretty
