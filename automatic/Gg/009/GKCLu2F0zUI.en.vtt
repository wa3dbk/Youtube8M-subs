 from this weekend to the cinemas 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.070
 of all 6 yes ladies and gentlemen because 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.070
 this is a bit like 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.200
 How will we sell my friend Tom Cruise? 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.450
 stayed together with jeremy renner simon 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.040
 Pegg is out there too good they 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.080
 are on the poster of the new delivery 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.820
 impossible mission call brou 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.820
 nation mission astonished 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.880
 they did it again this movie is already 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.550
 a whole franchise makes many many 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.830
 many years there was a series like that began 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.840
 is this story to a mission series 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.910
 impossible on television and then 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.920
 another blues came and changed all this 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.750
 brother is a superstar and he makes 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.220
 many of the action scenes is by 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.990
 example of the poster is sad from here 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.310
 when you see that scene where you are 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.110
 trying to get on the plane 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.200
 this in cross is not a double is not a 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.830
 booth is not producing its scenes of 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.730
 risk 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.730
 but no 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.380
 and that's why it's so successful 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.000
 type of movies because the net is that 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.310
 they are quite credible then we are going to 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.560
 watch an action-packed movie full of 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.060
 adrenaline of motor chases in 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.920
 self situations that are going to put at 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.630
 Mr. Ethan Haww who is the character of 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.759
 Tom Cruise in a pretty situation 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.320
 quite dangerous many missions 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.560
 impossible we are going to have in this 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.560
 movie 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.149
 like they almost always had us 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.799
 used to the fact that the movie was going 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.390
 developing little by little and it was auctioned 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.610
 with a super super super mega mission 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.990
 impossible so they have like 5 from 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.000
 principle in a few houses crisis of how 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.830
 is going to be this 4 and he succeeds and as tom 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.119
 cruise and its team have the person of 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.069
 world then another challenge arrives ' is 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.390
 practically impossible to achieve it and 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.099
 it overcomes it again and returns it to 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.959
 overcome and overcome it again is a 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.519
 very palomera movie this you can go 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.230
 with all your friends with your girlfriend with you 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.230
 family until lonely and you want 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.960
 m 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.640
 and heel has realized that there is 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.830
 a kind of mafia as a kind of 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.450
 He calls union with the guys who 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.980
 before they were dedicated to doing good or they 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.500
 dedicated to doing missions so super 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.150
 super super years and zimmer over but 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.190
 that have turned against the government 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.690
 and now they want to extort they want 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.270
 do terrorist acts after all 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.070
 what he learned during his training in 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.660
 box in the temple and from there in the 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.520
 mossad to any spy agency 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.500
 secret from anywhere in the world 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.910
 there are the most cannons and tom cruise 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.830
 he knows it and he wants to unmask them 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.360
 although many say you are already 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.070
 I am obsessing a bit that makes me 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.050
 enough in your imagination but well 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.730
 clung this compass and it goes up to the 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.280
 last consequences and I put that has 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.260
 reason 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.260
 is destroyed queen 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.160
 so he's going to try to unmask 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.270
 these secrets with the help of several of 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.890
 the protagonists that you have already known in 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.840
 other films as I told exits 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.700
 new there is a fish comes out again big game 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.530
 they play this morenazo that came out in the 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.090
 first movie again also 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.880
 Jeremy Renner from the last movie 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.010
 from 4 from coast fargo was there 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.390
 got into this story obviously already 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.740
 has become a superstar 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.870
 after having interpreted several 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.820
 sometimes to hockey then they keep it 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.550
 simply also nothing of back wing 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.750
 they also come out 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.750
 the reverse that ferguson 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:01.920
 the trend in this photo is a 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.570
 pretty applicable movie for this 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.250
 weekend or for the day that you 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.690
 soles going to the cinema tom cruise is the 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.460
 producer so I always miss him 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.410
 very much desire to each of the 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.930
 projects in which he puts his bar or in 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.220
 who puts his creativity this story 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.960
 is always proposing not only 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.180
 that's not like seeing the plastic and 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.830
 Super unattainable so this guy will not 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.480
 like to get his hands dirty 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.850
 think he likes to put creativity 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.130
 do amazing things and commission 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.730
 impossible 5 was not the disappointment is already 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.730
 in theaters 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:39.599
 why scary movie that is also going 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:43.549
 to heal in some cinemas in a way 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.549
 limited is this the dragon ball z 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.540
 for all 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.970
 a few months ago , the 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.050
 premiere there at the egyptian theater in 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.880
 Los Angeles California 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.560
 Hollywood Boulevard and they met up 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.210
 all the boy especially the actors that 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.800
 lend their voices to the characters all 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.360
 the voices in English and also came the 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.490
 lady who makes the voice in Japanese already 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.490
 yuri boza kamehameha folk mexico 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.850
 along with many toay managers 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.200
 animation that they had no idea how 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.820
 Spanish was spoken and less English 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.100
 then it was very difficult to interview him 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.900
 but it got pretty good there were many 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.150
 cosplayers with lots of fun and up 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.620
 Now the dubbing was done in English and 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.810
 is going to be able to start distributing here 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.790
 in v6 for you to go see the 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.020
 film at least in Mexico they 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.020
 it was super chinese 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.900
 I do not know if you're just a fan of the 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.460
 series or also some kind of dubbing 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.110
 if you like the voices in English if you 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.820
 they like the voices in Japanese or if nothing 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.350
 with the subtitles or if you like the 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.540
 things in Spanish but the movie 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.980
 answer in what language do you hear it is 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.050
 a super chivas movie I washed 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:03.000
 Japanese subtitled 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.000
 the two versions I love 2 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:15.110
 but you will be able to see all the 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:17.629
 warriors zetas are goku a vegueta itch 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.489
 or to the master roshi atencingo jaén 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:20.809
 etcetera etcetera etcetera all each 

00:06:19.489 --> 00:06:22.879
 one of them has like a moment 

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:24.709
 stellar of the movie not like the last 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:27.110
 that nothing but goku and vegeta were like 

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:28.909
 that shone more vegetable less provoked 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.319
 very much here everyone has a 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.319
 moment when you can look 

00:06:38.769 --> 00:06:43.849
 that you're going to remember that old series 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.229
 where they got the tournaments and they 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:46.879
 they prepare to be champions but now 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:49.129
 they are to raffle to defend all the 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:51.169
 planet because if you come back freezer one of 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:53.529
 the villains plus more countries that have 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:53.529
 faced 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.350
 so it's going to be pretty fun 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.880
 he also has his comedy touches like 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.500
 it's already part of Japanese animation 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.970
 surely many of you already 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.949
 They made spoiler with the 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.900
 transformations of goku and now has 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:12.729
