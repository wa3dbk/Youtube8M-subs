the<00:00:24.570> way<00:00:24.660> around<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.230> I've<00:00:25.289> got<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.529> really<00:00:25.859> nice

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
the way around so I've got a really nice

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.900 
the way around so I've got a really nice
bright<00:00:26.609> reflective<00:00:26.930> surface<00:00:27.930> both<00:00:28.800> up<00:00:29.460> and

this<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> pro<00:00:38.129> Scion<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.910> think<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.600> f400

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
this is a pro Scion I think it's f400

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.030 
this is a pro Scion I think it's f400
not<00:00:41.309> positive<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> series<00:00:42.270> number<00:00:42.540> but<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:43.260> is

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
not positive the series number but it is

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.600 
not positive the series number but it is
a<00:00:44.160> 400<00:00:44.700> watt<00:00:45.180> equivalent<00:00:46.280> grow<00:00:47.280> light<00:00:47.579> and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
a 400 watt equivalent grow light and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.000 
a 400 watt equivalent grow light and
that<00:00:48.180> uses<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.600> boat<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.500> under<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> hundred

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
that uses a boat just under a hundred

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.209 
that uses a boat just under a hundred
watts<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.969> produce<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.890> very

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
watts to produce that so it's very

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.160 
watts to produce that so it's very
efficient<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.239> does<00:00:54.449> still<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> little

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
efficient it does still get a little

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.410 
efficient it does still get a little
warm<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.800> got<00:00:55.980> heat<00:00:56.250> heatsink<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.329> fan

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
warm so it's got heat heatsink and fan

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.840 
warm so it's got heat heatsink and fan
on<00:00:57.809> top<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.379> want<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> actually<00:00:59.039> maybe<00:00:59.399> convert

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
on top I want to actually maybe convert

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.100 
on top I want to actually maybe convert
that<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.590> water<00:01:01.590> cooling<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:03.110> possibly

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
that to water cooling and possibly

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.130 
that to water cooling and possibly
circulate<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.309> under<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> under<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> grow

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
circulate that under a under the grow

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.580 
circulate that under a under the grow
medium<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.830> my<00:01:08.400> seedling<00:01:08.850> beds<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.380> can

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
medium of my seedling beds so I can

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.510 
medium of my seedling beds so I can
Longley<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.729> soil<00:01:12.420> for<00:01:12.689> my<00:01:12.810> seedlings<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.920> did

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
Longley the soil for my seedlings I did

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.289 
Longley the soil for my seedlings I did
end<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.850> having<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> put<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.630> fuse<00:01:16.290> there<00:01:16.619> I

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
end up having to put in a fuse there I

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.030 
end up having to put in a fuse there I
found<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.470> pieces<00:01:19.710> when<00:01:20.009> I

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
found that one of the pieces when I

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.630 
found that one of the pieces when I
first<00:01:20.280> got<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:21.080> blue<00:01:22.080> army<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.250> didn't<00:01:23.490> want

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
first got it blue army and I didn't want

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.880 
first got it blue army and I didn't want
to<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.020> if<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.200> became<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.470> recurring

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
to have to if it became a recurring

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.160 
to have to if it became a recurring
problem<00:01:26.150> pull<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.270> all<00:01:27.390> apart<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.960> just

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
problem pull it all apart so I just

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.580 
problem pull it all apart so I just
built<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.009> little<00:01:29.250> slip<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.299> cover<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.320> i<00:01:31.350> can

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
built this little slip on cover so i can

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.830 
built this little slip on cover so i can
quickly<00:01:31.799> access<00:01:32.100> my<00:01:32.549> fuses<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.420> happens

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
quickly access my fuses if it happens

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.870 
quickly access my fuses if it happens
again<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.470> hasn't<00:01:35.070> happened<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.670> been

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
again and it hasn't happened it's been

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.350 
again and it hasn't happened it's been
more<00:01:36.090> than<00:01:37.100> probably<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.159> year<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.909> that's<00:01:39.090> good

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
more than probably a year so that's good

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.319 
more than probably a year so that's good
I<00:01:39.990> highly<00:01:40.799> recommend<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.369> pro<00:01:41.579> Scion<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.150> think

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
I highly recommend the pro Scion I think

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.800 
I highly recommend the pro Scion I think
it's<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> great<00:01:42.689> lap<00:01:43.070> but<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.130> will<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
it's a great lap but I will be for the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.450 
it's a great lap but I will be for the
sake<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.590> flowering<00:01:48.619> adding<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.770> lab<00:01:50.040> which

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
sake of flowering adding this lab which

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.789 
sake of flowering adding this lab which
I<00:01:50.759> made<00:01:51.030> myself<00:01:51.619> just<00:01:52.619> use<00:01:52.829> some<00:01:53.720> some<00:01:54.799> welding

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
I made myself just use some some welding

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.190 
I made myself just use some some welding
rods<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.490> kind<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.030> bust<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.689> lights<00:01:57.899> together

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
rods to kind of bust the lights together

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.819 
rods to kind of bust the lights together
put<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> switch<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.310> top<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.960> what<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.259> in

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
put a switch on top and what I do is in

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.030 
put a switch on top and what I do is in

order for to induce flowering this is

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.190 
order for to induce flowering this is
actually<00:02:05.399> something<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.820> NASA<00:02:06.390> discovered

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200

292<00:02:41.000> hurts<00:02:41.270> what<00:02:41.569> it<00:02:41.660> does<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:42.080> it<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:43.250> actually

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
292 hurts what it does is it it actually

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.699 
292 hurts what it does is it it actually
stimulates<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.750> growth<00:02:44.780> response<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:45.620> the

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
stimulates the growth response in the

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.940 
stimulates the growth response in the
skin<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:47.080> what<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.200> do<00:02:48.350> is<00:02:48.380> that<00:02:48.590> when<00:02:48.860> it

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
skin so what you do is that when it

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.100 
skin so what you do is that when it
comes<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.340> 12<00:02:49.670> 12<00:02:50.030> light<00:02:50.300> cycle<00:02:50.840> like<00:02:50.989> the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
comes to a 12 12 light cycle like the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.420 
comes to a 12 12 light cycle like the
end<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.440> year<00:02:51.620> when<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:51.920> want<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.250> have

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
end of the year when you want to have

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.509 
end of the year when you want to have
fruit<00:02:53.170> bearing<00:02:54.170> from<00:02:54.440> your<00:02:54.620> vegetables<00:02:55.370> and

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
fruit bearing from your vegetables and

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.540 
fruit bearing from your vegetables and
whatnot<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.930> cut<00:02:57.140> your<00:02:57.170> blue<00:02:57.890> spectrum<00:02:58.310> back

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
whatnot you cut your blue spectrum back

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.330 
whatnot you cut your blue spectrum back
at<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.910> 12-point<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.780> 12-hour<00:03:00.319> point<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.830> then

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
at the 12-point a 12-hour point and then

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.570 
at the 12-point a 12-hour point and then
you<00:03:01.459> run<00:03:01.790> strictly<00:03:02.360> red<00:03:02.690> LEDs<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.500> these<00:03:04.220> when

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
you run strictly red LEDs and these when

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.699 
you run strictly red LEDs and these when
they're<00:03:04.730> pulsed<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.150> 292<00:03:05.780> hurts<00:03:06.200> actually

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
they're pulsed of 292 hurts actually

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.309 
they're pulsed of 292 hurts actually
come<00:03:06.890> out<00:03:06.920> almost<00:03:07.400> like<00:03:07.550> a<00:03:07.690> heat<00:03:08.690> lamp<00:03:08.900> it

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
come out almost like a heat lamp it

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.290 
come out almost like a heat lamp it
looks<00:03:09.530> almost<00:03:09.980> kind<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.340> orange<00:03:10.670> ii<00:03:10.850> which<00:03:11.120> is

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
looks almost kind of orange ii which is

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.090 
looks almost kind of orange ii which is
an<00:03:11.420> infrared<00:03:11.780> spectrum<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:13.060> what<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.090> does

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
an infrared spectrum and what that does

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.130 
an infrared spectrum and what that does
there's<00:03:16.100> two<00:03:16.310> types<00:03:16.550> of<00:03:16.790> i<00:03:17.540> think<00:03:18.019> its

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
there's two types of i think its

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.250 
there's two types of i think its
phytochrome<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:19.670> an<00:03:20.060> A<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.420> B<00:03:20.450> component

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
phytochrome to an A and a B component

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.770 
phytochrome to an A and a B component
the<00:03:22.010> red<00:03:22.250> spectrum<00:03:22.610> all<00:03:22.880> day<00:03:23.090> long<00:03:23.299> that<00:03:23.360> gets

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
the red spectrum all day long that gets

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.830 
the red spectrum all day long that gets
from<00:03:23.959> this<00:03:24.610> has<00:03:25.610> to<00:03:25.820> be<00:03:25.910> counterbalanced<00:03:26.209> with

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
from this has to be counterbalanced with

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.620 
from this has to be counterbalanced with
an<00:03:26.989> infrared<00:03:27.320> spectrum<00:03:28.070> in<00:03:28.340> order<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:29.000> produce

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
an infrared spectrum in order to produce

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.259 
an infrared spectrum in order to produce
fruit<00:03:30.079> or<00:03:30.350> it<00:03:30.530> becomes<00:03:30.709> kind<00:03:31.250> of<00:03:31.340> stalls<00:03:32.060> out

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
fruit or it becomes kind of stalls out

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.180 
fruit or it becomes kind of stalls out
it'll<00:03:32.570> become<00:03:32.720> anemic<00:03:33.170> if<00:03:33.470> it<00:03:33.590> has<00:03:33.709> too<00:03:34.010> much

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
it'll become anemic if it has too much

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.420 
it'll become anemic if it has too much
red<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.150> not<00:03:35.329> enough<00:03:35.600> infrared<00:03:36.140> to<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:37.220> the

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
red and not enough infrared to and the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.770 
red and not enough infrared to and the
infrared<00:03:37.880> is<00:03:38.000> kind<00:03:38.209> of<00:03:38.269> what<00:03:38.390> you<00:03:38.480> get<00:03:38.660> at

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
infrared is kind of what you get at

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.949 
infrared is kind of what you get at
sunset<00:03:39.350> when<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:39.980> Sun<00:03:40.190> is<00:03:40.340> setting<00:03:40.519> and

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
sunset when the Sun is setting and

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.990 
sunset when the Sun is setting and
rising<00:03:42.160> it's<00:03:43.160> kind<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.519> triggering<00:03:43.910> that

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
rising it's kind of triggering that

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.180 
rising it's kind of triggering that
growth<00:03:44.390> response<00:03:44.870> for<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.440> for<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.769> fruit<00:03:46.010> to

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
growth response for the for the fruit to

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.640 
growth response for the for the fruit to
bear<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:46.760> that's<00:03:47.720> what<00:03:47.900> I've<00:03:48.019> been<00:03:48.049> doing<00:03:48.320> and

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
bear so that's what I've been doing and

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.979 
bear so that's what I've been doing and
I<00:03:48.739> want<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.100> actually<00:03:49.489> document<00:03:49.880> this<00:03:50.660> I've

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
I want to actually document this I've

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.220 
I want to actually document this I've
got<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.200> web<00:03:51.920> camera<00:03:52.510> I've<00:03:53.510> been<00:03:53.810> having<00:03:54.109> my

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
want to get any hotter than

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.030 
want to get any hotter than
26<00:04:24.950> 27<00:04:25.400> degrees<00:04:25.730> so<00:04:26.000> I'm<00:04:26.120> pushing<00:04:26.570> it<00:04:26.660> a<00:04:27.040> little

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
26 27 degrees so I'm pushing it a little

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.620 
26 27 degrees so I'm pushing it a little
here<00:04:28.520> but<00:04:29.060> I<00:04:29.419> am<00:04:30.380> exhausting<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.790> heat<00:04:32.419> that

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
here but I am exhausting the heat that

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.730 
here but I am exhausting the heat that
builds<00:04:33.050> up<00:04:33.169> when<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:33.919> doors<00:04:34.130> are<00:04:34.280> closed<00:04:34.550> I've

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
builds up when the doors are closed I've

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.600 
builds up when the doors are closed I've
exhaust<00:04:36.740> fan<00:04:37.010> it's<00:04:37.250> actually<00:04:37.639> a<00:04:37.669> bedini<00:04:38.470> SSG

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
exhaust fan it's actually a bedini SSG

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.790 
exhaust fan it's actually a bedini SSG
it's<00:04:41.020> exhausting<00:04:42.020> my<00:04:42.169> air<00:04:42.320> down<00:04:42.560> here<00:04:42.590> on

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
it's exhausting my air down here on

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.170 
it's exhausting my air down here on
keeping<00:04:45.800> it<00:04:45.889> relatively<00:04:46.550> cool<00:04:46.910> in<00:04:47.060> there

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
keeping it relatively cool in there

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.760 
keeping it relatively cool in there
thought<00:04:47.720> I<00:04:47.750> was<00:04:47.780> kind<00:04:47.930> of<00:04:48.110> neat<00:04:48.260> because<00:04:48.410> I<00:04:48.590> can

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
thought I was kind of neat because I can

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.790 
thought I was kind of neat because I can
also<00:04:49.639> charge<00:04:50.419> a<00:04:50.630> battery<00:04:50.780> at<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.230> same<00:04:51.500> time

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
also charge a battery at the same time

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.960 
also charge a battery at the same time
as<00:04:51.860> I'm<00:04:52.310> exhausting<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.090> cold<00:04:53.300> air

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
as I'm exhausting the cold air

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.520 
as I'm exhausting the cold air
ultimately<00:04:55.970> I<00:04:56.120> want<00:04:56.389> to<00:04:56.540> hook<00:04:56.690> this<00:04:57.050> up<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.350> a

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
ultimately I want to hook this up to a

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.560 
ultimately I want to hook this up to a
giant<00:04:58.040> bank<00:04:58.460> of<00:04:58.669> batteries<00:04:58.850> that<00:04:59.450> I'm

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
giant bank of batteries that I'm

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.070 
giant bank of batteries that I'm
reconditioning<00:05:00.410> using<00:05:01.340> my<00:05:01.540> my<00:05:02.540> wheel<00:05:02.750> which

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
reconditioning using my my wheel which

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.760 
reconditioning using my my wheel which
has<00:05:03.229> now<00:05:03.410> got<00:05:03.800> a<00:05:03.830> slave<00:05:05.169> hooked<00:05:06.169> up<00:05:06.290> on<00:05:06.440> a<00:05:06.470> slave

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
has now got a slave hooked up on a slave

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.409 
has now got a slave hooked up on a slave
configuration<00:05:07.120> of<00:05:08.410> one<00:05:09.410> trigger<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:10.610> power

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
configuration of one trigger and power

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.810 
configuration of one trigger and power
and<00:05:11.600> power<00:05:12.350> power<00:05:12.830> power<00:05:13.010> so<00:05:13.580> there's<00:05:13.790> four

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
and power power power so there's four

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.330 
and power power power so there's four
power<00:05:14.240> coils<00:05:14.720> and<00:05:14.870> one<00:05:15.440> trigger<00:05:15.770> on<00:05:15.950> the<00:05:16.070> front

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
power coils and one trigger on the front

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.190 
power coils and one trigger on the front
one<00:05:16.520> and<00:05:16.729> I've<00:05:17.450> been<00:05:17.570> getting<00:05:17.840> some<00:05:17.960> pretty

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
one and I've been getting some pretty

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.920 
one and I've been getting some pretty
good<00:05:18.320> lighting<00:05:18.590> off<00:05:18.830> of<00:05:19.040> that<00:05:19.750> that's<00:05:20.750> why

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
good lighting off of that that's why

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.430 
good lighting off of that that's why
radiant<00:05:21.139> charger<00:05:22.010> just<00:05:22.520> kind<00:05:23.210> of<00:05:23.300> working<00:05:24.139> out

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
radiant charger just kind of working out

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.230 
radiant charger just kind of working out
some<00:05:24.680> of<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:24.830> kinks<00:05:25.130> there<00:05:25.310> I've<00:05:25.550> got<00:05:25.820> to<00:05:25.970> pile

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
some of the kinks there I've got to pile

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.960 
some of the kinks there I've got to pile
of<00:05:26.680> DC<00:05:27.680> adapters<00:05:28.250> that<00:05:28.280> I<00:05:28.520> was<00:05:28.669> going<00:05:28.850> to<00:05:28.940> use

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
of DC adapters that I was going to use

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.480 
of DC adapters that I was going to use
with<00:05:29.360> them<00:05:29.539> that<00:05:29.750> came<00:05:30.590> in<00:05:30.770> wrong<00:05:31.039> they<00:05:31.430> were

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
with them that came in wrong they were

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.810 
with them that came in wrong they were
the<00:05:31.700> wrong<00:05:31.850> type<00:05:32.270> and<00:05:32.770> so<00:05:33.770> I've<00:05:33.890> got<00:05:34.100> to<00:05:34.130> get

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
the wrong type and so I've got to get

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.260 
the wrong type and so I've got to get
some<00:05:35.030> new<00:05:35.180> ones<00:05:35.330> but<00:05:36.520> that's<00:05:37.520> not<00:05:37.760> about<00:05:37.910> that

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
some new ones but that's not about that

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.960 
some new ones but that's not about that
a<00:05:38.630> little<00:05:38.810> bit<00:05:38.930> of<00:05:39.080> a<00:05:39.140> mess<00:05:39.350> in<00:05:39.530> here<00:05:39.640> yeah<00:05:40.640> so<00:05:40.940> I

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
a little bit of a mess in here yeah so I

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.210 
a little bit of a mess in here yeah so I
just<00:05:41.180> want<00:05:41.360> to<00:05:41.539> kind<00:05:41.870> of<00:05:41.960> show<00:05:42.650> everyone<00:05:43.039> where

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
just want to kind of show everyone where

just want to kind of show everyone where
I've<00:05:43.370> got<00:05:43.669> what<00:05:44.240> I've<00:05:44.330> got<00:05:44.479> started<00:05:45.020> here

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
I've got what I've got started here

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.670 
I've got what I've got started here
start<00:05:47.090> to<00:05:47.240> shape<00:05:47.450> up<00:05:47.660> outside<00:05:48.080> a<00:05:48.140> little<00:05:48.470> bit

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
start to shape up outside a little bit

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.800 
start to shape up outside a little bit
so<00:05:48.950> I'm<00:05:49.100> planning<00:05:49.700> on<00:05:49.820> transplanting<00:05:50.570> a<00:05:50.660> lot

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
so I'm planning on transplanting a lot

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.710 
so I'm planning on transplanting a lot
of<00:05:50.900> these<00:05:50.990> out<00:05:51.580> ultimately<00:05:52.580> down<00:05:53.120> below<00:05:53.450> here

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
of these out ultimately down below here

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.750 
of these out ultimately down below here
I<00:05:53.960> want<00:05:54.260> to<00:05:54.380> have<00:05:54.530> the<00:05:54.740> four<00:05:55.039> plants<00:05:55.340> that<00:05:55.580> do

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
I want to have the four plants that do

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.409 
I want to have the four plants that do
remain<00:05:56.120> in<00:05:56.680> bubble<00:05:57.680> buckets<00:05:58.130> I<00:05:58.580> think<00:05:59.270> they're

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
remain in bubble buckets I think they're

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.020 
remain in bubble buckets I think they're
referred<00:05:59.750> to<00:05:59.930> as<00:06:00.110> but<00:06:00.500> what<00:06:00.680> it<00:06:00.770> is<00:06:00.800> is<00:06:00.919> you<00:06:01.880> get

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
referred to as but what it is is you get

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.330 
referred to as but what it is is you get
a<00:06:02.060> bucket<00:06:02.330> you<00:06:03.260> have<00:06:03.470> it<00:06:03.590> up<00:06:03.710> underneath<00:06:03.889> in

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
a bucket you have it up underneath in

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.779 
a bucket you have it up underneath in
here<00:06:04.750> sits<00:06:05.750> in<00:06:05.930> a<00:06:06.050> soilless<00:06:06.860> mediums<00:06:07.100> it<00:06:07.580> at

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
here sits in a soilless mediums it at

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:10.090 
here sits in a soilless mediums it at
the<00:06:07.910> top<00:06:08.150> the<00:06:08.810> roots<00:06:09.020> hang<00:06:09.289> down<00:06:09.560> into<00:06:09.979> the

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
the top the roots hang down into the

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.879 
the top the roots hang down into the
bucket<00:06:10.520> and<00:06:10.639> you<00:06:11.090> actually<00:06:11.270> pump<00:06:11.810> a<00:06:12.080> fine

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
bucket and you actually pump a fine

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.690 
bucket and you actually pump a fine
spray<00:06:13.610> of<00:06:13.880> your<00:06:14.660> nutrient<00:06:15.139> tea<00:06:15.470> on<00:06:15.800> to<00:06:16.610> the

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
spray of your nutrient tea on to the

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.550 
spray of your nutrient tea on to the
roots<00:06:16.910> continuously<00:06:17.630> and<00:06:17.900> the<00:06:18.169> water<00:06:18.350> just

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
roots continuously and the water just

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.550 
roots continuously and the water just
gets<00:06:18.800> recycled<00:06:19.130> into<00:06:19.490> the<00:06:19.639> tank<00:06:19.940> and<00:06:20.180> then<00:06:20.870> and

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
gets recycled into the tank and then and

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.129 
gets recycled into the tank and then and
then<00:06:21.770> pump<00:06:22.250> back<00:06:22.460> into<00:06:22.910> them<00:06:23.060> so<00:06:23.300> the<00:06:23.930> four

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
then pump back into them so the four

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.770 
then pump back into them so the four
plants<00:06:24.410> are<00:06:24.680> that<00:06:24.950> will<00:06:25.190> remain<00:06:25.580> in<00:06:25.760> here<00:06:26.030> are

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
plants are that will remain in here are

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.180 
plants are that will remain in here are
going<00:06:27.050> to<00:06:27.169> be<00:06:27.669> aeroponic<00:06:28.669> Lee<00:06:28.870> fed<00:06:29.870> and<00:06:30.190> that
