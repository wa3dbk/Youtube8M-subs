00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.200
 ah ah ah ah 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.030
 I want to talk to you today about 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:29.550
 a very frequent situation in the life of 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:32.340
 all of us what is the relationship of parents 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.290
 with their children so they have relationships 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.150
 infantilize the children 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.430
 this is something we all have kids 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.800
 we run the risk of going through this 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.280
 These things start early in life like this. 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.920
 often the parents in the desire that the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.630
 children in one film has difficulties the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.310
 parents start offering themselves if they 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.260
 intrude on the lives of children 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.760
 if a child knows poorly in high school 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.050
 soon the parents are doing 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.880
 we are by her 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.680
 if a child has difficulty getting 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.780
 relate to the child because the parents 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.080
 talking to the parents of this child 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.820
 if a child has difficulty sleeping 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.200
 in your home on the road while keeping 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.940
 child in parents bed 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.060
 this is very dangerous because children 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.710
 quickly realize the ability 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.720
 they have to control the parents of 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.720
 manipulate countries will develop 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.479
 unconsciously even seems to start 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.549
 do not use your skills as your 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.950
 capabilities are becoming more hinders 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.869
 days in life was that parents and 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.360
 third their lives are children have 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.400
 afraid to go out friends then 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.470
 This is starting to be doubtful. 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.390
 It is important for parents to meet 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.460
 so the children have to get the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.530
 their alternatives that children have 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.700
 to learn to take care of their lives 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.710
 children have to have their situations 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.439
 that children need plants 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.840
 because otherwise the children grow 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.630
 mechanisms within very salt areas 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.790
 tissues will leave them for the rest of their lives 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.979
 adolescents are very often 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.470
 teenagers often do not do well in the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.460
 school and observe the two girls 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.290
 adolescents is of the upper middle class who 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.140
 have been well known to get pregnant 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.340
 and sometimes in pregnancy I sat in a 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.049
 stable relationship 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.079
 parents are going to have to absorb 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:18.060
 this child observes absorbing the 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.190
 It's good, this teenager does not need 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.920
 continue your studies will not work 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.579
 Why do you care for your parents? 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.410
 parents and we observe that parents who 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.120
 have the most children of a son JosÃ© 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.410
 unconsciously choose to stay with the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.820
 life problems 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.040
 that's when you, like, that son will 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.890
 taking care of us is as if it were clear that 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.530
 if a thing thought consciously 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.720
 This son will also like this 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.540
 relationship rallied one of the 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.450
 dispatch gave him jerks of the parents he 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.240
 If parents baby, they keep fighting, they do not. 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.460
 nothing is used drugs there are debts to 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.740
 pay their voices to the poles so 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.050
 parents will maintain this dependency and 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.520
 this son leaving very interesting 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.680
 only that no measure that life goes 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.110
 passing and he will become adult and 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.970
 he realizes that he has stayed behind and 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.830
 begins to get very angry that 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.050
 relationship already or your children 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.940
 they are very submitted the parents do not 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.860
 are very nervous nominal capita of 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.270
 parents because they realize that they 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.320
 autonomy to take care of their lives and 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.790
 others made a group in the 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.010
 santa house from porto alegre i do 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.410
 therapy 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.180
 are groups that both have 20 people 30 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.010
 also family where you do not have to 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.870
 offer for their patients 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.930
 is a perception about the phenomena 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.730
 emotional problems that sick patients and 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.090
 one lady spoke of the relationship of her 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.630
 son who lived near her 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.060
 in a detached house and together with annual 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.370
 a meter and that this son do many 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.680
 nonsense bought things off mother 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.520
 It is always surprising that you 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.130
 annoyed with the leftovers and fought and 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.990
 mother in the group explanation why make 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.000
 that book was the subject of these things 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.800
 It's all too bad for her relationship . 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.020
 with the son that he did not want the son 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.390
 dependent on it at a certain moment 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.290
 said as he had no further explanation 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.709
 alves said this maxims with pearl 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.970
 doctor 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:17.070
 mother mother of course it does not make 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.260
 felt as if it were as if the 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.930
 mother was authorized all inclusive 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.940
 is to make sure that the child does not 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.910
 develop helps the child stay more 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.669
 infantilized in life to make the 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.910
 film does not take over your life 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.640
 sometimes children when 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.560
 drug dependencies went through the 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.050
 so the parents on the last day of the parents 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.780
 wanting to choose the life that the children 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.490
 must be 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.040
 When do I choose the college I went to? 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.070
 make the profession that the fund will do 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.660
 this is something that leaves people very 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.960
 important for the lives of children and 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.580
 children were probably very 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.110
 rage of this dependence on parents 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.450
 have also chosen countries or 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.460
 companions to rule in their lives 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.830
 so this is a very frequent point in 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.300
 our lives including Joel who only 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.180
 area I have already been through difficulties 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.310
 that my children because I never in my 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.060
 life was also much more cluttered 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.060
 of what I am today
