00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
know knock the Mongoose off and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.209 
know knock the Mongoose off and
everything<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.350> it's<00:00:37.680> really<00:00:37.920> really<00:00:38.100> cool

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
everything so it's really really cool

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.180 
everything so it's really really cool
and<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.180> map<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.780> design<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.469> design<00:00:40.950> such

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
and the map is design is design such

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.650 
and the map is design is design such
that<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.460> pretty<00:00:41.879> much<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.239> stay<00:00:42.570> on

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
that you pretty much have to stay on

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.200 
that you pretty much have to stay on
your<00:00:42.780> mongoose<00:00:43.170> if<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.460> get<00:00:44.670> off<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.030> certain

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
your mongoose if you get off in certain

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.180 
your mongoose if you get off in certain
areas<00:00:45.539> you'll<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.870> teleported<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.590> die<00:00:46.829> so

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
areas you'll be teleported and die so

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.410 
areas you'll be teleported and die so
basically<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> only<00:00:47.579> place<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.180> get<00:00:48.270> off

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
basically the only place you can get off

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.150 
basically the only place you can get off
is<00:00:48.600> right<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.350> that's<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.920> pick<00:00:50.070> up

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
is right up here and that's to pick up

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.470 
is right up here and that's to pick up
the<00:00:50.280> flag<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:50.670> there's<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> soft<00:00:51.090> kill<00:00:51.300> there

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
the flag but there's a soft kill there

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.119 
the flag but there's a soft kill there
so<00:00:51.750> basically<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> whole<00:00:52.739> time<00:00:52.980> you're

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
so basically the whole time you're

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.130 
so basically the whole time you're
either<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.460> driver<00:00:53.969> or<00:00:54.270> you're<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> back

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
either a driver or you're in the back

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.930 
either a driver or you're in the back
time<00:00:55.680> with<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.010> railgun<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.520> that's<00:00:56.670> really

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
time with the railgun so that's really

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.520 
time with the railgun so that's really
cool<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.390> kind<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> rocket<00:00:58.379> race

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
cool it's kind of like a rocket race

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.750 
cool it's kind of like a rocket race
type<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.920> thing<00:00:59.039> where<00:00:59.190> you're<00:00:59.280> going<00:00:59.609> back

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
type of thing where you're going back

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.130 
type of thing where you're going back
and<00:00:59.910> forth<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.359> trying<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.930> hit<00:01:01.020> people

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
and forth and trying to hit people

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.599 
and forth and trying to hit people
either<00:01:01.410> with<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> sticky<00:01:01.890> detonator<00:01:02.340> or<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
either with a sticky detonator or the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.880 
either with a sticky detonator or the
railgun<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.390> really<00:01:03.600> cool<00:01:03.890> dynamic

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
railgun so it's a really cool dynamic

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.130 
railgun so it's a really cool dynamic
that<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.460> don't<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:05.790> too<00:01:05.939> much<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:07.049> on

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
that you don't see too much and then on

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.840 
that you don't see too much and then on
the<00:01:07.260> top<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.650> activate<00:01:08.070> defenses<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the top you can activate defenses the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.039 
the top you can activate defenses the
turrets<00:01:09.210> right<00:01:09.390> there<00:01:09.600> you'll<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:09.900> later

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
turrets right there you'll see later

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.289 
turrets right there you'll see later
people<00:01:10.740> will<00:01:10.830> turn<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.520> their<00:01:11.939> vehicle

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
people will turn it on and their vehicle

people will turn it on and their vehicle

then<00:01:24.720> there's<00:01:24.900> mines<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.530> different<00:01:25.770> areas<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
then there's mines in different areas to

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.499 
then there's mines in different areas to
make<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.460> bit<00:01:26.549> more<00:01:26.580> tricky<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.180> stuff<00:01:27.420> like

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
make it a bit more tricky and stuff like

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.600 
make it a bit more tricky and stuff like
that<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.350> think<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.159> had<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.340> good

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.090 
that so I think we had a really good
time<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:29.939> map<00:01:30.210> um<00:01:30.479> yeah<00:01:31.079> yeah<00:01:31.409> every<00:01:31.950> time

skill<00:02:05.250> involved<00:02:05.700> obviously<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.299> sticky

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
skill involved obviously the sticky

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.190 
skill involved obviously the sticky
dinner<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.380> know<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.710> arcs<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.310> also<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
dinner you know it arcs and also the

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.540 
dinner you know it arcs and also the
railgun<00:02:10.200> arcs<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.800> well<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.430> be<00:02:11.519> a

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
railgun arcs as well so you have to be a

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.979 
railgun arcs as well so you have to be a
good<00:02:11.790> shot<00:02:12.030> especially<00:02:12.420> when<00:02:12.720> you're<00:02:12.840> moving

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
good shot especially when you're moving

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.170 
good shot especially when you're moving
the<00:02:13.410> targets<00:02:13.799> moving<00:02:13.860> plus<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.790> throw<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.060> top

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
the targets moving plus you throw on top

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.270 
the targets moving plus you throw on top
of<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.540> arcing<00:02:15.989> factor<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.890> takes<00:02:17.160> a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
of that the arcing factor so it takes a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.770 
of that the arcing factor so it takes a
lot<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.430> skill<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.269> is<00:02:18.360> still<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.569> really

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
lot of skill but it is still a really

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.440 
lot of skill but it is still a really
