00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.300
 this is the next organ in the new version of it that I will see it 7200 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.389
 item 11 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.980
 he was introduced the rappa little time and by the seeds in the market 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.070
 is the event features several 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.179
 improvements compared to the previous day for the 7200 with all this 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.070
 the analysis of the opening 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.130
 main advantage the following week the fact that you have 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.269
 in the following year commits that in Brazil for lack of 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.170
 sum 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.500
 for a period of three years after the purchase 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.800
 it came from some kind of defect some kind of problem 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.470
 you have this deadline to go directly to the manufacturer 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.000
 the agave martyr also has the same facility because they are 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.880
 manufactured by the same company matsui follow are the same the head 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.730
 the sand yielded 7 me and say 10 point 11 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.100
 it is not performing much better than others in the 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.260
 market both the previous model 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.489
 I want to be shy for all with the other competitors 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.700
 in the case of brands we have examples here 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.600
 was done by extreme tech 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.750
 they have the guess that it did not show up as described average 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.830
 of some competitors here who are top of the line 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.750
 then know that the following it has a rate of 35 meters per second 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.810
 in swimming described in art. 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.939
 are many and avoid at 73 meters per second and the fmi are 64 mega per 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:32.950
 second 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.950
 these are the rates entered either as you need to record 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.490
 with a file with a touch commented the scenario that gives us great 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.010
 Miranda mother do you have 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.610
 a much better rate in the next year 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.720
 one in the district seat 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.420
 it's time to leave the reservation bank was a good debut to be considered 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.620
 precipitated 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.890
 an action that since 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.810
 the norm brings three reading 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.040
 then use 20 245 meters per second 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.770
 the tie 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.199
 the much lower figure according to him the former minister 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.199
 at 223 meters per second 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.899
 the action - really loves is a much improved model if the issue of the guarantee 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.660
 also interesting because you can turn to it both for the company that 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:24.879
 you got to sell as directly with the following that the sites you call 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.399
 next partner point with br br 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:31.229
 where you can have access to all types of 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.099
 it is a similar procedure 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.859
 the following year is actually really the best choice 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.019
 Do you have a high performance machine? 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.229
 and if you want the reliability of the deputies
