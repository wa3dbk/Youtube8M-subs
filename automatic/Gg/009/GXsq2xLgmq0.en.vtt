00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149

 or the people that you are 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.230
 Welcome once again to my sweet channel 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.900
 rumÃ­ today I bring you a little bit of advance 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.790
 warfare thanks to the permission of the lord 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.529
 black de optique esp some what 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.810
 you will know they have granted me the permits 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.730
 to be able to upload a bit of 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.559
 advance warfare not with permits 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.360
 necessary of activision and others you have 

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:30.800
 his face in the description is what the 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.170
 Spanish some you will know is my 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.540
 optical chief who is the one who mistreats me 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.250
 and doing every day and nothing and 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.370
 adjusting me in the restrictions that 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.719
 put activision not to be able to upload 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.829
 videos and others that are because the 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.749
 duration of the clients and others 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.249
 I can bring this little fragment and 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:48.320
 well let's talk a little about the 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:49.760
 advance warfare you will not have seen a 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.769
 bunch of gameplays and a lot of 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.059
 opinions but I wanted to upload mine and 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.949
 I want you to put in 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.050
 comments yours not my opinion 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.609
 general about the game itself not in total 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.170
 because at the beginning I'm not going to lie to you 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.390
 I throw a little backwards I see double 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.129
 I jump the grenade throw that 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.229
 throws from the hand there as if it were a 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.030
 throwing and those things then to 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.400
 I was startled by a bit 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.170
 it seemed a little and so forged what 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.760
 typical that everyone says no but 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.740
 then rethinking very little more the 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.640
 game watching more videos approaching me more 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.500
 to 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.360
 halfway through the game he could see that 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.220
 it pretty much resembles white everything 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.740
 which are the least choice of weapons 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.810
 the gusts the holes and others and even 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.130
 there's going to be a game mode that's going to be 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.720
 without the exoskeleton as I said 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.430
 previously in which is going to be 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.890
 exactly the same as the rest of call of 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.300
 duty the way to die is to say 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.759
 bullets you need to kill your 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.470
 opponent is very similar to the 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.970
 white all the videos you have seen 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.159
 you have to remember that that was played in 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.780
 the gamescom of germany in the cndh is 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.000
 say with a perfect connection 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.330
 then online as well said black 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.860
 in your video because it's probably the same 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.570
 that white 2 does not need more than 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.280
 some balls to kill is not like the 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.229
 color and ticos who died with the look 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.110
 I looked at them it's a little bit bad and 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.450
 they were on the ground so that having it 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.310
 in mind the weapons there are a lot of 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.920
 weapons there are a lot of weapons of 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.380
 accessories and others is that it is for me 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.420
 It seems like a lot of gust 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.950
 well he has not seen us much, but 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.540
 well I think it will be fine 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.310
 that I did not like the truth is what 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.200
 the nuclear not that the gusts count 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.370
 to nuclear that I do not like anything because 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.350
 everything is the whole world the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.300
 nuclear then that is not added 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.310
 that difficulty not that very few 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.020
 that is to remove the nuclear I always 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.510
 He has liked the challenges and so on. 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.310
 I think that with that, the gusts are going 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.900
 the nuclear streak is going to lose the 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.930
 grace not but good have put us 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.890
 nuclear streak at least something is something 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.630
 I also wanted to talk a little bit about what 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.300
 that is talking about the zombies not 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.160
 I personally think that it is going to 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.960
 have zombies because they have not is they have not 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.670
 taught absolutely nothing and always 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.560
 they have put something on us if they have not been 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.300
 the aliens have been the zombies so 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.280
 I think there are going to be zombies 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.590
 more than anything because people ask for it and 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.820
 I am now those who have 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.200
 designed the game and would have put 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.790
 zombies although I would have also put 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.320
 other things that they have not put as the 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.060
 cinema mode that were not since it's that 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.980
 I'm going to shoot it but well that 's 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.450
 what I think in general, more or less 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.280
 I hope you put me in comments 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.410
 you what do you think the game I have 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.300
 many more opinions so like 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.710
 I upload another video explaining more 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.090
 things carefully 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.710
 but hey, just this video 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.330
 I wanted to interact with you not 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.970
 so you can in comments what is it 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.650
 what it looks like and so I see what it looks like 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.910
 for people as you see it because what 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.700
 I put that you have seen maybe 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.470
 you confuse these and only something 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.390
 well so I do not expect anything from you 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.650
 answers in comments and see you in 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.239
 the next video I hope that 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.950
 have enjoyed that fragment of 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.360
 advance warfare and see you in the 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.870
 next video a greeting and see you later 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.870
 goodbye 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.750
 at least at least more
