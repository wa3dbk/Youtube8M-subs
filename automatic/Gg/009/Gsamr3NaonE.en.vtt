00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.710
 let's see if it holds the whole system good 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.590
 we have relied on a man who has 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.079
 said that three was going straight 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.770
 but we found that not the train is 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.109
 stopping and every stop at the right time 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.909
 we are not going to say anything to him because those 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.929

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.470
 more or less well 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.980
 As you can see we have a slightly cloudy day 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.980
 there are enough people 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.640
 and nothing because we are beginning to take 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.460
 some pictures and now we will go 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.580
 so to Eiffel tower to see if 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.320
 we do not want to make a route either 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.730
 depends what we find 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.730
 we will stop more or less 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.240
 we are testing the free expert 1 that is 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.370
 a mirrorless camera with very good 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.790
 quality I take a couple of fixed optics a 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.680
 28 millimeters in 50 and it's a camera that 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.860
 although it is not that it is completely compact 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.270
 has its size is not a clear reflex and 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.280
 Well, a goat, what happens? 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.170
 unnoticed and allows us to do so 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.270
 portraits and some photos that also 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.190
 I will place in this video so that 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.680

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.770

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.610
 metro and 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.290
 about three stations will take us from 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.290
