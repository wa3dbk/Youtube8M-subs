00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270 

alright<00:00:00.599> guys<00:00:00.750> so<00:00:01.170> we<00:00:01.829> talked<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.129> lot<00:00:02.220> about

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
alright guys so we talked a lot about

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.640 
alright guys so we talked a lot about
the<00:00:02.550> draft<00:00:02.850> and<00:00:03.259> now<00:00:04.259> we're<00:00:04.350> going<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.529> go<00:00:04.620> over

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
the draft and now we're going to go over

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.740 
the draft and now we're going to go over
some<00:00:04.859> more<00:00:05.279> about<00:00:05.520> point<00:00:05.940> scoring<00:00:06.270> systems

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
some more about point scoring systems

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.220 
some more about point scoring systems
because<00:00:08.030> different<00:00:09.030> leagues<00:00:09.389> have<00:00:09.750> totally

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
because different leagues have totally

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.549 
because different leagues have totally
different<00:00:10.290> point<00:00:10.740> systems<00:00:12.170> like<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.290> said<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
different point systems like I said the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.680 
different point systems like I said the
standards<00:00:13.950> usually<00:00:14.130> for<00:00:14.849> quadric<00:00:15.089> 25<00:00:15.450> yards

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
standards usually for quadric 25 yards

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.390 
standards usually for quadric 25 yards
equals<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.960> point<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:16.590> some<00:00:16.830> leagues<00:00:17.010> actually

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
equals a point but some leagues actually

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.090 
equals a point but some leagues actually
will<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.730> 50<00:00:18.210> yards<00:00:18.510> for<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> point<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.289> some

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
will have 50 yards for a point and some

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.800 
will have 50 yards for a point and some
of<00:00:20.160> these<00:00:20.220> will<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.580> quarterbacks<00:00:21.539> throwing

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
of these will have quarterbacks throwing

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.849 
of these will have quarterbacks throwing
touchdowns<00:00:22.289> or<00:00:22.529> four<00:00:23.070> points<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.609> then<00:00:24.539> also

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
touchdowns or four points and then also

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.380 
touchdowns or four points and then also
they'll<00:00:25.859> give<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.580> for<00:00:26.760> example<00:00:26.820> a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
they'll give like for example a

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.130 
they'll give like for example a
quarterback<00:00:28.109> who<00:00:28.140> rushes<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.740> lot<00:00:29.300> like<00:00:30.300> just

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
quarterback who rushes a lot like just

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.840 
quarterback who rushes a lot like just
say<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> guy<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.769> will<00:00:32.160> McNabb<00:00:32.460> before<00:00:32.730> got

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
say a guy like will McNabb before got

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.750 
say a guy like will McNabb before got
injured<00:00:33.230> he<00:00:34.230> would<00:00:34.469> get<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.860> point<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:35.640> every

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
injured he would get a point for every

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.010 
injured he would get a point for every
ten<00:00:36.090> yards<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:37.850> quarterbacks<00:00:38.850> are<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.840> lot

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
ten yards so quarterbacks are a lot

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.119 
ten yards so quarterbacks are a lot
different<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> lot<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.649> different<00:00:40.980> leagues

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
different in a lot of different leagues

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.440 
different in a lot of different leagues
so<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:41.700> example<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.120> have<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.239> quarterback

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
so for example if you have a quarterback

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.959 
so for example if you have a quarterback
that<00:00:42.899> has<00:00:43.110> 50<00:00:43.500> yards<00:00:43.710> for<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> point<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.460> want

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
that has 50 yards for a point you want

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.500 
that has 50 yards for a point you want
to<00:00:45.059> take<00:00:46.489> less<00:00:47.489> emphasis<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> quarterback

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
to take less emphasis on a quarterback

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.360 
to take less emphasis on a quarterback
because<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.110> harder<00:00:49.410> outside<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.190> like

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
because it's harder outside of like

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.580 
because it's harder outside of like
Peyton<00:00:50.730> Manning<00:00:50.760> Tom<00:00:51.120> Brady<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.750> those<00:00:52.379> type

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
Peyton Manning Tom Brady and those type

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.920 
Peyton Manning Tom Brady and those type
of<00:00:52.620> players<00:00:52.860> there's<00:00:53.100> only<00:00:53.219> four<00:00:53.460> or<00:00:53.520> five<00:00:53.930> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
of players there's only four or five the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.819 
of players there's only four or five the
quarterbacks<00:00:55.260> not<00:00:55.379> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> score<00:00:55.710> their

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
quarterbacks not going to score their

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.680 
quarterbacks not going to score their
many<00:00:55.980> points<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.059> league<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.510> was

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
many points if it's a league that I was

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.410 
many points if it's a league that I was
talking<00:00:57.989> about<00:00:58.020> where<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.559> six<00:00:59.270> points<00:01:00.270> for

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
talking about where it's six points for

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.020 
talking about where it's six points for
a<00:01:00.449> touchdown<00:01:00.690> then<00:01:01.680> there<00:01:02.579> will<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.850> more

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
a touchdown then there will be more

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.060 
a touchdown then there will be more
emphasis<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.840> quarterback<00:01:04.320> as<00:01:04.710> opposed<00:01:04.979> to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
emphasis on a quarterback as opposed to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.060 
emphasis on a quarterback as opposed to
other<00:01:05.159> leagues<00:01:05.510> same<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.890> running<00:01:07.890> backs

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
other leagues same with running backs

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.380 
other leagues same with running backs
and<00:01:08.780> wide<00:01:09.780> receivers<00:01:09.900> as<00:01:10.619> well<00:01:11.150> looking<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and wide receivers as well looking for a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.960 
and wide receivers as well looking for a
guy<00:01:12.540> that's<00:01:12.570> that's<00:01:13.260> well-rounded<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.189> is

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
guy that's that's well-rounded is is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.280 
guy that's that's well-rounded is is
kind<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.330> important<00:01:15.710> now<00:01:16.710> also<00:01:17.490> when<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.970> have

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
kind of important now also when you have

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.219 
kind of important now also when you have
four<00:01:19.290> different<00:01:19.409> roster<00:01:19.920> spots<00:01:20.840> also<00:01:21.840> look<00:01:22.020> at

four different roster spots also look at

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.990 
four different roster spots also look at
your<00:01:22.710> bench<00:01:22.950> as<00:01:23.189> well<00:01:23.369> because<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.790> kind<00:01:23.970> of

your bench as well because that kind of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.390 
your bench as well because that kind of
determines<00:01:24.509> who<00:01:25.439> you're<00:01:25.590> going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:25.979> on
