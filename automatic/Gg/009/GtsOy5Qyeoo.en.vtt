00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.700
 7.215 depth 13:30 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.029
 One-step downgrade 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:15.199
 A listener together 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.429
 This is more 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.429
 My book- 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:26.529
 There are 8 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.110
 It is the character that the amount of eyes is the strongest in general 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.970
 But it was decided adult and dust in this way 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.089
 It was exciting, but I was competing for such a function 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:42.800
 Various things 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.500
 I noticed a fishing boat 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.930
 Sword 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.930
 Well that's what it means to make 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.580
 I said this year with a large drum 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.990
 Well this is the scene 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.150
 This is basically the shape decided 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.820
 That is why 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.820
 That I was worried 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.750
 How to take care of Southern European style 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.710
 There is Mitsubishi Toka face living 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.830
 Of course there is such a thing, too and of course it is perfect 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.310
 It will change again 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.320
 Shall I go for a little time 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.170
 If you do so, for example 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.170
 We are advancing with Mitsukoshi and Isetan 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.780
 It's approaching 59 years, so I'm about to buy it 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.220
 Want to put out 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.220
 Decide such thing 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.390
 This is firmly 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.710
 somewhere 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.640
 A little like this 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.920
 Even the actual 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.000
 High school club 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.290
 I drank a lot of books 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.290
 * 1 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:14.059
 Sometimes 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:16.429
 I put out
