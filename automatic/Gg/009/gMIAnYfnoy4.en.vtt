00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
um I wish this would have gone better

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.070 
um I wish this would have gone better
and<00:01:37.410> I<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.920> probably

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.600 

anyways<00:01:45.920> guys<00:01:47.440> out<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.710> next<00:01:49.100> video<00:01:49.370> is

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
anyways guys out the next video is

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.090 
anyways guys out the next video is
better<00:01:50.060> but<00:01:50.480> as<00:01:50.720> you<00:01:50.930> can<00:01:51.050> see<00:01:51.380> these<00:01:51.710> many

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
better but as you can see these many

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.220 
better but as you can see these many
guys<00:01:52.370> are<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.670> little<00:01:52.750> overpowered<00:01:53.750> I<00:01:53.960> think

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
guys are a little overpowered I think

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.860 
guys are a little overpowered I think
I'm<00:01:54.500> that<00:01:54.830> they<00:01:55.010> should<00:01:55.280> just<00:01:55.760> turn<00:01:56.600> them<00:01:56.840> down

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
I'm that they should just turn them down

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.530 
I'm that they should just turn them down
a<00:01:57.050> little<00:01:57.170> bit<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.620> think<00:01:57.740> that<00:01:58.280> for<00:01:58.760> is<00:01:59.000> a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.340 

more<00:02:02.540> than

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.250 

reasonable<00:02:06.330> reasonable<00:02:07.330> number<00:02:08.200> for<00:02:10.260> these

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
reasonable reasonable number for these

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.690 
reasonable reasonable number for these
guys<00:02:11.530> to<00:02:11.590> be<00:02:12.100> equal<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:13.060> those<00:02:13.209> big<00:02:13.780> guys<00:02:14.700> maybe

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
guys to be equal to those big guys maybe

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.240 
guys to be equal to those big guys maybe
even<00:02:16.000> like<00:02:16.360> more<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.290> don't<00:02:17.650> know<00:02:17.739> how<00:02:17.920> many

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
even like more I don't know how many

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.850 
even like more I don't know how many
more<00:02:18.280> but<00:02:18.700> um<00:02:18.959> let's<00:02:19.959> see<00:02:20.170> if<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.410> can<00:02:20.440> find

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
more but um let's see if I can find

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.360 
more but um let's see if I can find
something<00:02:21.220> else<00:02:21.489> to<00:02:21.730> do<00:02:21.880> real<00:02:22.450> fast<00:02:22.780> okay<00:02:23.370> guys

but if you don't toy soldiers don't like

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.420 
but if you don't toy soldiers don't like
regular<00:02:41.250> MPC's<00:02:41.940> let's<00:02:42.750> just<00:02:42.810> say<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.430> once

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
regular MPC's let's just say that once

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.160 
regular MPC's let's just say that once
the<00:02:44.610> other<00:02:44.760> way<00:02:44.940> around<00:02:45.240> but<00:02:45.390> anyways

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.030 

let's<00:02:49.620> give<00:02:50.130> him<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.640> bunch<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.300> them

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
let's give him a bunch of them

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
let's give him a bunch of them
when<00:02:54.040> she<00:02:54.310> damn

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
when she damn

and a couple of them
and<00:03:02.000> let's<00:03:02.570> get<00:03:02.780> in<00:03:02.870> this<00:03:02.930> corner<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:03.590> we<00:03:04.370> will

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
and let's get in this corner and we will

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.510 
and let's get in this corner and we will
go<00:03:05.300> like<00:03:05.510> this<00:03:06.430> let's<00:03:07.430> see<00:03:07.580> how<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.760> goes<00:03:09.520> and

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
go like this let's see how it goes and

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.240 
go like this let's see how it goes and
you<00:03:10.700> can<00:03:10.910> see<00:03:11.180> all<00:03:11.540> you<00:03:12.050> can't<00:03:12.260> see<00:03:12.470> me

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
you can see all you can't see me

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.220 
you can see all you can't see me
thought<00:03:13.850> you<00:03:13.940> could<00:03:14.030> see<00:03:14.330> me<00:03:14.540> that's<00:03:14.780> happened

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
thought you could see me that's happened

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.740 
thought you could see me that's happened
before<00:03:15.530> but<00:03:17.830> as<00:03:18.830> you<00:03:19.070> can<00:03:19.220> see<00:03:19.580> it's<00:03:20.210> actually

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
before but as you can see it's actually

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.910 
before but as you can see it's actually
pretty<00:03:23.380> equally<00:03:24.380> balanced<00:03:26.410> when<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:27.440> test<00:03:27.770> it

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
pretty equally balanced when I test it

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.090 
pretty equally balanced when I test it
before<00:03:28.070> it<00:03:28.460> was<00:03:28.550> actually<00:03:29.560> really<00:03:30.560> equally

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
before it was actually really equally

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.610 
before it was actually really equally
balanced<00:03:31.550> like<00:03:31.850> there's<00:03:32.180> four<00:03:32.570> for<00:03:33.380> one

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
balanced like there's four for one

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.570 
balanced like there's four for one
person<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.959> eventually<00:03:35.959> we<00:03:35.990> ran<00:03:36.500> out<00:03:36.680> quickly

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
person and eventually we ran out quickly

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.980 
person and eventually we ran out quickly
actually<00:03:37.910> ran<00:03:38.360> out<00:03:38.540> with<00:03:38.720> daenerys<00:03:39.320> but<00:03:40.990> see

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
actually ran out with daenerys but see

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:50.550 
actually ran out with daenerys but see
how<00:03:42.080> this<00:03:42.260> goes<00:03:42.500> on<00:03:43.450> don't<00:03:44.450> be<00:03:44.660> hit<00:03:44.840> my<00:03:45.080> partner

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.310 

yeah<00:03:51.560> they<00:03:51.890> looks<00:03:52.340> like<00:03:52.550> they're<00:03:53.260> taking<00:03:54.260> over

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
yeah they looks like they're taking over

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:03.730 
yeah they looks like they're taking over
them<00:03:54.650> faster<00:03:55.220> I'm<00:03:55.310> gonna<00:03:56.170> conjure<00:03:57.170> up

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.740 

scary<00:04:04.610> planning

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.380 

peace

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
apparently saw two guards and much

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.860 
apparently saw two guards and much
younger<00:04:17.420> than<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:17.989> toy<00:04:18.200> soldiers<00:04:19.870> and

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
younger than the toy soldiers and

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.600 
younger than the toy soldiers and
they're<00:04:21.380> taking<00:04:21.829> their<00:04:21.950> own<00:04:22.010> kindness

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
they're taking their own kindness

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.740 
they're taking their own kindness

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.719 

pounding<00:05:11.969> um

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.210 

um<00:05:15.240> I<00:05:15.330> was<00:05:15.839> just<00:05:15.900> seeing<00:05:16.319> if<00:05:16.439> I<00:05:16.620> could

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
um I was just seeing if I could

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.070 
um I was just seeing if I could
and<00:05:18.370> like<00:05:18.790> much<00:05:19.000> of<00:05:19.030> the<00:05:19.270> story<00:05:19.510> line<00:05:19.750> so<00:05:20.020> i

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
and like much of the story line so i

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.340 
and like much of the story line so i
don't<00:05:20.380> know<00:05:20.560> like<00:05:21.010> any<00:05:21.310> of<00:05:21.760> the<00:05:21.970> stuff<00:05:22.350> around

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
don't know like any of the stuff around

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.040 
don't know like any of the stuff around
here<00:05:23.740> but<00:05:23.980> oh

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.059 

looks<00:05:27.620> like<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.919> walls<00:05:28.159> are<00:05:28.430> just<00:05:28.729> kind<00:05:29.300> of

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
looks like the walls are just kind of

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:33.309 
looks like the walls are just kind of
glitching<00:05:31.069> out<00:05:31.159> over<00:05:31.580> here<00:05:32.139> except<00:05:33.139> for<00:05:33.169> that

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
glitching out over here except for that

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:37.290 
glitching out over here except for that
one<00:05:34.090> nope<00:05:35.090> nope<00:05:35.389> now<00:05:35.690> is<00:05:35.840> there<00:05:35.930> any<00:05:36.080> way<00:05:36.319> I

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
one nope nope now is there any way I

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:44.080 
one nope nope now is there any way I
guess<00:05:38.300> some<00:05:38.449> wolves<00:05:39.020> aren't<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:40.069> best<00:05:43.090> unit

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
guess some wolves aren't the best unit

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.080 
guess some wolves aren't the best unit
because<00:05:44.690> they<00:05:45.259> run<00:05:45.770> away<00:05:46.009> like<00:05:46.460> as<00:05:46.699> soon<00:05:46.970> as

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090
