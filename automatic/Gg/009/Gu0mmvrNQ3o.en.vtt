didn't go up past 20 points and he

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.080 
didn't go up past 20 points and he

didn't go into the 66 range rebounds and
assists<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.080> look<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> Houston<00:01:22.860> Rockets<00:01:22.890> they

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
assists so look the Houston Rockets they

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.280 
assists so look the Houston Rockets they
got<00:01:23.640> better<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> long<00:01:24.750> run<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.140> my

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
got better but in the long run in my

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.620 
got better but in the long run in my
opinion<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.920> don't<00:01:26.040> think<00:01:26.369> James<00:01:26.970> Harden<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
opinion I don't think James Harden is a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.140 
opinion I don't think James Harden is a
super<00:01:28.380> star<00:01:28.950> player<00:01:29.400> that's<00:01:29.640> going<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> push
