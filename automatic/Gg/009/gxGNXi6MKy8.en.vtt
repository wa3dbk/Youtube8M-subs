00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.920
 I'm not happy to be here murcia now what in the things of 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.729
 soon they are coming out to me as one wants 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.149
 I think that's where it's quieter to have 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.730
 is the ups and downs and good now what is happening for a moment 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.769
 have much moderation a lot of humility 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.390
 because I think that can change at any time then I think that 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.490
 of what you have to do suddenly do not try to talk so much but about 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.659
 to seize the moment and train more the presence 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.659
 of them 9 as if you look 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.770
 I assure you 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.030
 to ateneo for the repression allen to download 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.130
 the truth is 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.150
 for that reason I am very happy because in 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.280
 with anyone who is in the front I feel comfortable and for that 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.500
 calm when he wins lugüercio equal I felt very well why lugüercio 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.250
 tcp moves too much in the area 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.950
 it's been a long time that he pays slow in how is it to download 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.610
 the same is the case of boos blushing that moves a lot and it is clear said 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.980
 claudio with the movements in front of a lot of space the player who 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.040
 what good very good a whole that is good uncle and as he said his second goal 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.280
 for me it is for the work that makes the mark sweep when peace armea alone 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.280
 with the archer 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.659
 5 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.819
 you have to be professional at this moment miranda hita perfect one 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.760
 one believes that 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.370
 the insults always happened and it's always going to happen 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.220
 and it does not have to be is ready to stop for those occasions and I think the 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.760
 team is because 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.720
 for the experience that it has 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.250
 but roque when you pass the line efe by what was said and what happened 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.950
 During last week 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.730
 I think we're talking about something else 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.730
 and where we do not think it's good 20 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.580
 also called to smoke rohr in finalize 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.490
 next had to import 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.640
 for a few 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.590
 I'm afraid that it was not either it was time the airport bouquets g 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.659
 that people deserve all our respect 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.859
 has all the respect 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:19.129
 and he knows that what we want most is union 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.129
 with people as it always was that supports us 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.150
 where it helps us to be encouraged and harassed 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.549
 so what is this 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.509
 but for the people who come and encourage 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:34.549
 to insult knows how to prove repaired and is entitled 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.259

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:40.969
 efe out there I repeat you was out there 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.969
 because we thought they had been based on the line because of what happened 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.799
 the previous week with braian 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.539

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.539
