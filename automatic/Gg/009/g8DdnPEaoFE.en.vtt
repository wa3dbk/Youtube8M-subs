so<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.649> way<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.219> I've<00:00:44.340> actually

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
so the way you do it I've actually

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.090 
so the way you do it I've actually
searched<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.300> bunch<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.840> videos<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.440> YouTube

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
searched up a bunch of videos on YouTube

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.470 
searched up a bunch of videos on YouTube
and<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.370> think<00:00:47.610> there's<00:00:47.760> only<00:00:47.850> one<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.390> this

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
and I think there's only one and this

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.720 
and I think there's only one and this
were<00:00:48.660> actually<00:00:48.750> learned<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.379> from<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.579> this

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
were actually learned it from to do this

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.060 
were actually learned it from to do this
move<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.629> can't<00:00:51.989> actually<00:00:52.350> do<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
move like you can't actually do the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.750 
move like you can't actually do the
inputs<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.879> way<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.300> shows<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.289> screen

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
inputs the way it shows it on the screen

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.349 
inputs the way it shows it on the screen
what<00:00:56.760> I've<00:00:57.000> learned<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:59.010> X<00:00:59.730> X

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
what I've learned is that if you do X X

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.650 
what I've learned is that if you do X X
X<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.320> then<00:01:01.770> X<00:01:02.100> Y<00:01:02.370> at<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.760> same<00:01:02.969> time<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.539> then

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
X and then X Y at the same time and then

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.410 
X and then X Y at the same time and then
after<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.140> obviously<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.880> all<00:01:06.180> going

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
after that obviously be it's all going

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.789 
after that obviously be it's all going
to<00:01:06.450> combo<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.650> pretty

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
to combo and you have to do it pretty

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.500 
to combo and you have to do it pretty
quick<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.340> gonna<00:01:08.610> take<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> little<00:01:09.240> bit<00:01:09.420> of

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
quick it's gonna take a little bit of

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.210 
quick it's gonna take a little bit of
muscle<00:01:09.689> memory<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.290> look<00:01:10.409> at<00:01:10.619> my<00:01:10.799> inputs

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
muscle memory but look at my inputs

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.500 
muscle memory but look at my inputs
right<00:01:11.369> there<00:01:11.580> that's<00:01:11.700> why<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> inputs

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
right there that's why I have the inputs

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.010 
right there that's why I have the inputs
on<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.439> X<00:01:13.920> 3<00:01:14.340> times<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:15.299> quick<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.750> then

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
on I do X 3 times really quick and then

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.530 
on I do X 3 times really quick and then
I<00:01:16.140> press<00:01:16.439> Y<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.130> X<00:01:17.369> at<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> same<00:01:17.939> time<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
I press Y and X at the same time and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.300 
I press Y and X at the same time and
after<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.900> obviously<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.590> B<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> last

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
after that obviously the B is the last

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.730 
after that obviously the B is the last
input<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.060> then<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> e<00:01:22.049> x<00:01:22.290> hat<00:01:22.470> spin

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
input and then you do the e x hat spin

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.310 
input and then you do the e x hat spin
if<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.950> want<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.189> go<00:01:23.310> into<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.909> pressure<00:01:24.320> or

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
if you want to go into the pressure or

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.170 
if you want to go into the pressure or
you<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.979> regular<00:01:26.159> hat<00:01:26.520> spin<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:27.060> you

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
you do the regular hat spin if you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.120 
you do the regular hat spin if you
actually<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.960> hits<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.799> leads

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
actually get it on hits and it leads

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.670 
actually get it on hits and it leads
into<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.909> combo<00:01:30.420> alright<00:01:31.170> guys<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.470> now<00:01:31.500> I'm

going to show you guys how the actual

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.080 
going to show you guys how the actual
