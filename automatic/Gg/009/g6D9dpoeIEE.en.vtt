00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.179 
hi I'm David from music matters and
today<00:00:07.259> we're<00:00:07.470> having<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.740> look<00:00:07.770> at<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:07.980> new

today we're having a look at a new
product<00:00:08.550> for<00:00:08.670> Meridian<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.480> director<00:00:10.820> so<00:00:11.820> the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
product for Meridian the director so the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.990 
product for Meridian the director so the
Meridian<00:00:12.240> director<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.769> digital<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.700> analog

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
Meridian director is a digital to analog

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.080 
Meridian director is a digital to analog
converter<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.960> they've<00:00:16.109> released<00:00:17.090> quite

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
converter that they've released quite

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.189 
converter that they've released quite
like<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.420> new<00:00:18.600> charcoal<00:00:19.050> packaging<00:00:21.199> with

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
like this new charcoal packaging with

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.990 
like this new charcoal packaging with
the<00:00:22.320> red<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.800> quite<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> nice<00:00:23.519> color<00:00:23.820> scheme

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
the red a quite a nice color scheme

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.370 
the red a quite a nice color scheme
right<00:00:24.539> they<00:00:24.689> move<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.099> across<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.250> range

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
right they move that across the range

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.299 
right they move that across the range
we're<00:00:28.380> going<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.560> see<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.820> same<00:00:31.309> anodized

seen that so that's our look at the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.709 
seen that so that's our look at the
product<00:00:45.320> connections<00:00:46.320> wise<00:00:47.450> we've<00:00:48.450> got<00:00:48.600> our

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
product connections wise we've got our

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.319 
product connections wise we've got our
made<00:00:48.960> analog<00:00:49.469> outputs<00:00:49.950> gold-plated<00:00:50.940> which

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
made analog outputs gold-plated which

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.910 
made analog outputs gold-plated which
are<00:00:51.480> connected<00:00:51.840> straight<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.410> circuit

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
are connected straight on to the circuit

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.729 
are connected straight on to the circuit
board<00:00:53.360> we've<00:00:54.360> got<00:00:54.510> our<00:00:54.600> USB<00:00:55.020> connection<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
board we've got our USB connection and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.709 
board we've got our USB connection and
we've<00:00:56.010> got<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.309> mini<00:00:56.550> jack<00:00:56.850> now<00:00:57.239> if<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.629> can

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
we've got this mini jack now if you can

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.080 
we've got this mini jack now if you can
get<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> close-up<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.609> mini<00:00:59.789> jack

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
get a close-up on that the mini jack

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.110 
get a close-up on that the mini jack
allows<00:01:00.690> us<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.170> use<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.609> digital<00:01:02.609> connections

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
allows us to use the digital connections

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.750 
allows us to use the digital connections
for<00:01:03.329> optical<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.589> coax<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.519> plug

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
for optical and for coax in one plug

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.500 
for optical and for coax in one plug
type<00:01:06.020> which<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.170> quite<00:01:07.409> good<00:01:08.240> from<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.390> front

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
type which is quite good from the front

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.179 
type which is quite good from the front
we're<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.409> see<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> selection<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
we're going to see a selection of

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.609 
we're going to see a selection of
different<00:01:11.340> input<00:01:12.240> selector<00:01:12.689> switches<00:01:12.930> so

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
different input selector switches so

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.230 
different input selector switches so
every<00:01:13.860> time<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.100> press<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.430> down<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.939> going

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
every time we press this down is going

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.340 
every time we press this down is going
to<00:01:15.299> indicate<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.659> light<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.110> what<00:01:16.229> you've

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
to indicate a light as to what you've

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.649 
to indicate a light as to what you've
got<00:01:16.500> connected<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.189> also<00:01:17.939> we're<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.600> to

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
got connected and also we're going to

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.539 
got connected and also we're going to
see<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.500> kind<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.890> sampling<00:01:20.280> rate

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
see here what kind of sampling rate

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.870 
see here what kind of sampling rate
we're<00:01:20.700> working<00:01:21.090> at

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.120 

so<00:01:25.510> the<00:01:25.600> Meridian<00:01:25.869> director<00:01:26.409> is<00:01:26.590> using<00:01:27.009> the
