00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.860
I think the Chinese culture, so to say, of competitiveness,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.496
and comparing themselves to others,

00:00:23.496 --> 00:00:26.518
really has a big impact on their involvement.

00:00:26.518 --> 00:00:28.444
I think that they will become really strong,

00:00:28.444 --> 00:00:31.977
especially with, if they keep growing a huge playerbase.

00:00:31.977 --> 00:00:35.722
I'm very interested in the Chinese team going into the World Tournament series.

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:38.382
They did quite well for themselves in the last World Tournament Series.

00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:40.660
They had really close games versus the Dankening.

00:00:41.153 --> 00:00:44.993
And they even put Orange in a tough spot in one of the games.

00:00:44.993 --> 00:00:47.721
Yeah, they caught us off guard, so to say, but I think

00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:50.141
we could have caught them off guard as well.

00:00:50.141 --> 00:00:53.841
Now when the metagame has been so shifted toward, well, chaos,

00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:56.301
because we don't know where it's headed with the balance patch,

00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:58.940
they might actually have a genuine chance as a dark horse.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.291
Not knowing what China is going to do is, of course, it's an issue.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.040
I don't know, we've never in any tournament really known

00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:09.422
what China will come in with.

00:01:09.422 --> 00:01:13.100
But now, in Cologne, we're going to be seeing a new Team China.

00:01:13.102 --> 00:01:15.125
We didn't really look at them as a huge threat before.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:16.046
But now we really do.

00:01:16.046 --> 00:01:17.769
We're trying to prepare, but it's really hard.

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:20.369
Nocturne, team captain, is just a drill sergeant.

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.331
He was just like, bringing the most energy,

00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:24.369
and having a great time on stage,

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.909
and I was really drawn in by that.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.811
I was really captivated by their ability to play together.

00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:29.243
I think rather than looking at the player,

00:01:29.243 --> 00:01:30.787
their roster has gotten progressively stronger.

00:01:30.787 --> 00:01:33.297
And that's what we're mainly focusing on, rather than a single player.

00:01:33.297 --> 00:01:36.857
China is definitely in a stronger spot than they were a year in.

00:01:36.857 --> 00:01:38.881
At least from the last time I saw them play.

00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:40.822
Every single tournament they've played with us,

00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:44.425
they have used our builds that we have created, etc.,

00:01:44.425 --> 00:01:46.048
and that is a natural development.

00:01:46.048 --> 00:01:49.374
If they get the game after us, yeah, of course they are going to copy what is best.

00:01:49.374 --> 00:01:52.096
If they keep developing at this rate they can be a huge threat.

00:01:52.096 --> 00:01:55.854
Chinese players, in general I think, are more to themselves in a way.

00:01:55.854 --> 00:01:59.825
They'd rather ask more questions than they want to answer to.

00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:02.946
They are somehow more disciplined as well than us Westerners,

00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:04.770
and they definitely put in time,

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.516
and I know for a fact that they come in stronger every single time we face them.

00:02:08.516 --> 00:02:12.183
Yeah, maybe they will be the reigning champions even in Cologne.
