00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.390 
from next month we will actually be
launching<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.989> cello<00:02:10.379> version<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.129> double

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
launching the cello version and a double

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.809 
launching the cello version and a double
bass<00:02:11.519> version<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.989> nutshell<00:02:13.819> the

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
bass version and in a nutshell the

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:15.979 
bass version and in a nutshell the
reason<00:02:15.150> people<00:02:15.299> would<00:02:15.569> choose<00:02:15.599> these

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
reason people would choose these

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.320 
reason people would choose these
microphones<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.769> because<00:02:17.099> they<00:02:17.640> reproduce

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
microphones is because they reproduce

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.000 
microphones is because they reproduce
the<00:02:18.540> sound<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.140> instrument<00:02:19.410> naturally

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
the sound that the instrument naturally

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.220 
the sound that the instrument naturally
produces<00:02:20.580> exactly<00:02:21.390> one<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.840> things<00:02:22.080> that

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
produces exactly one of the things that

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.740 
produces exactly one of the things that
we<00:02:22.470> really<00:02:22.739> wanted<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.069> do<00:02:23.190> was<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.670> take<00:02:23.940> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
we really wanted to do was to take the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.809 
we really wanted to do was to take the
experience<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.950> sound<00:02:26.250> from<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.489> studio

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
experience and the sound from the studio

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.809 
experience and the sound from the studio
and<00:02:27.090> add<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.950> live<00:02:29.129> stage<00:02:29.400> as<00:02:29.610> well

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
and add that to the live stage as well

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.410 
and add that to the live stage as well
so<00:02:30.769> what<00:02:31.769> what<00:02:32.010> we<00:02:32.160> really<00:02:32.670> wanted<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.120> to

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
so what what we really wanted to to

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.479 
so what what we really wanted to to
retain<00:02:33.870> was<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.379> natural<00:02:34.590> sound<00:02:35.099> of<00:02:35.340> these

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
retain was the natural sound of these

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.850 
retain was the natural sound of these
instruments<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.269> this<00:02:37.019> actually<00:02:37.349> believe

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
instruments and this actually believe

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.580 
instruments and this actually believe
that<00:02:37.890> we<00:02:38.069> have<00:02:38.160> been<00:02:38.250> able<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.549> address<00:02:39.590> while

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
that we have been able to address while

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.009 
that we have been able to address while
also<00:02:40.890> ensuring<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.450> musicians

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
also ensuring that the musicians

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.430 
also ensuring that the musicians
themselves<00:02:43.200> feel<00:02:45.049> they<00:02:46.049> feel<00:02:46.260> comfortable

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
themselves feel they feel comfortable

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.740 
themselves feel they feel comfortable
using<00:02:46.890> these<00:02:47.190> mounts<00:02:47.670> on<00:02:47.790> there<00:02:48.329> and<00:02:48.629> the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
using these mounts on there and the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.920 
using these mounts on there and the
instruments<00:02:49.430> so<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.549> a<00:02:50.609> nutshell<00:02:50.760> if<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.299> play

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
instruments so in a nutshell if you play

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.599 
instruments so in a nutshell if you play
an<00:02:52.140> acoustic<00:02:52.379> instrument<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.370> want<00:02:53.549> to

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
an acoustic instrument and you want to

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.460 
an acoustic instrument and you want to
reproduce<00:02:53.879> the<00:02:54.359> sound<00:02:54.540> as<00:02:54.750> closely<00:02:55.049> as<00:02:55.349> you

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
reproduce the sound as closely as you

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.800 
reproduce the sound as closely as you
can<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.950> natural<00:02:56.400> timber<00:02:56.640> choose<00:02:57.329> dpa

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
can to natural timber choose dpa

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.330 
can to natural timber choose dpa
microphones<00:02:58.440> that's<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.769> message<00:02:58.950> that's

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
microphones that's the message that's

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.250 
microphones that's the message that's
basically<00:02:59.849> the<00:02:59.940> message<00:03:00.359> here<00:03:00.599> and<00:03:00.840> then<00:03:01.049> at

got any information regards the Space
Shuttle<00:03:27.950> recording<00:03:28.950> yeah<00:03:29.310> there's<00:03:30.030> actually

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
Shuttle recording yeah there's actually

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.830 
Shuttle recording yeah there's actually
and<00:03:31.079> this<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.500> very<00:03:31.859> very<00:03:32.340> secret<00:03:33.060> recording

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
into Cape Canaveral we actually recorded

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.910 
into Cape Canaveral we actually recorded
a<00:03:51.599> spaceship<00:03:52.500> launch<00:03:52.769> at<00:03:53.069> NASA's<00:03:54.060> premises

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
a spaceship launch at NASA's premises

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.770 
a spaceship launch at NASA's premises
and<00:03:56.920> it<00:03:57.250> out<00:03:57.400> that<00:03:57.640> I'm<00:03:57.819> just<00:03:58.090> imagining<00:03:58.330> to

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
and it out that I'm just imagining to

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.330 
and it out that I'm just imagining to
get<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.050> right<00:03:59.260> sounder<00:03:59.830> you<00:03:59.980> were<00:04:00.069> close

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
get the right sounder you were close
