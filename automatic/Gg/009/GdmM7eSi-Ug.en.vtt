hi<00:00:00.359> guys<00:00:00.690> Dex<00:00:01.290> here<00:00:01.500> on<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:02.370> test<00:00:02.610> world

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hi guys Dex here on this test world

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.499 
hi guys Dex here on this test world
video<00:00:03.030> I'm<00:00:03.480> testing<00:00:04.290> out<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.740> new<00:00:05.509> spawner

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
video I'm testing out a new spawner

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.009 
video I'm testing out a new spawner
concept<00:00:07.170> that<00:00:07.649> envelope<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.460> talked<00:00:08.849> about

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
concept that envelope and I talked about

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.339 
concept that envelope and I talked about
called<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.440> leashed<00:00:11.070> spawner<00:00:12.110> basically<00:00:13.110> what

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
called a leashed spawner basically what

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.860 
called a leashed spawner basically what
this<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:14.130> unlike<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.730> wide<00:00:15.179> area<00:00:15.210> spawner

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
this is is unlike a wide area spawner

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.070 
this is is unlike a wide area spawner
that<00:00:16.170> gets<00:00:16.379> monsters<00:00:16.800> all<00:00:17.070> over<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.430> place

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
that gets monsters all over the place

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.370 
that gets monsters all over the place
this<00:00:19.080> spawner<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:20.689> designed<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.900> just<00:00:22.140> keep

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
this spawner is designed to just keep

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.060 
this spawner is designed to just keep
its<00:00:23.269> spawn<00:00:24.269> monsters<00:00:24.840> very<00:00:25.170> close<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.859> not

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
its spawn monsters very close and not

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.689 
its spawn monsters very close and not
let<00:00:26.250> them<00:00:26.369> wander<00:00:26.580> off<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:28.160> basically<00:00:29.160> what

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
let them wander off so basically what

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.720 
let them wander off so basically what
this<00:00:29.820> means<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.920> very<00:00:32.160> close<00:00:32.460> range

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
this means is it's a very close range

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.330 
this means is it's a very close range
spawner<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.899> spawns<00:00:34.320> monsters<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.190> have

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
spawner and it spawns monsters that have

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.000 
spawner and it spawns monsters that have
lower<00:00:35.610> health<00:00:35.910> than<00:00:36.239> normal<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.829> they<00:00:37.829> have

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
lower health than normal and they have

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.479 
lower health than normal and they have
wither<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.399> them<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.540> I'll<00:00:40.079> set<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.649> normal

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
wither on them so I'll set it to normal

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.319 
wither on them so I'll set it to normal
and<00:00:42.230> for<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.649> I've<00:00:43.980> even<00:00:44.850> lowered<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
and for this one I've even lowered the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.119 
and for this one I've even lowered the
range<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.620> close

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
range so you have to you have to close

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.490 
range so you have to you have to close
closer<00:00:47.730> than<00:00:47.850> normal<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.719> spawn<00:00:49.020> these<00:00:49.230> things

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
closer than normal to spawn these things

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.920 
closer than normal to spawn these things
and<00:00:49.770> when<00:00:50.460> they<00:00:50.579> do<00:00:50.640> spawn<00:00:51.059> they<00:00:51.300> get<00:00:51.480> off<00:00:51.600> one

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
and when they do spawn they get off one

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.760 
and when they do spawn they get off one
volley<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.879> if<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.000> back<00:00:54.210> off<00:00:54.420> they<00:00:54.809> die<00:00:54.989> so

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
volley and if you back off they die so

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.099 
volley and if you back off they die so
they<00:00:55.980> basically<00:00:56.129> spawn<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> volley<00:00:57.960> of

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
they basically spawn do a volley of

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.529 
they basically spawn do a volley of
fireballs<00:00:58.649> at<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.309> then<00:00:59.820> they<00:00:59.940> die<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
fireballs at you and then they die and

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.789 
fireballs at you and then they die and
if<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.590> stand<00:01:01.920> here<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:03.559> range<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
if you stand here in range of the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.880 
if you stand here in range of the
spawner<00:01:07.909> as<00:01:08.909> soon<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:09.360> they<00:01:09.540> die<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:10.560> set<00:01:10.860> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
spawner as soon as they die it's set to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.410 
spawner as soon as they die it's set to
immediately<00:01:11.430> spawn<00:01:11.850> another<00:01:12.119> way<00:01:12.479> before<00:01:13.080> so

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
immediately spawn another way before so

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.520 
immediately spawn another way before so
basically<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.540> long<00:01:15.689> as<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.900> stay<00:01:16.140> near<00:01:16.380> this

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
basically as long as you stay near this

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.140 
basically as long as you stay near this
thing<00:01:16.799> you're<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.520> ahead<00:01:17.670> you're<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:18.090> to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
thing you're going ahead you're going to

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.320 
thing you're going ahead you're going to
basically<00:01:18.390> constantly<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.729> four<00:01:20.729> blazes

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
basically constantly have four blazes

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.690 
basically constantly have four blazes
always<00:01:21.990> spawned<00:01:22.320> they'll<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> split

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
always spawned they'll be like a split

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.999 
always spawned they'll be like a split
second<00:01:24.119> delay<00:01:24.540> between<00:01:24.780> when<00:01:25.259> when<00:01:25.560> wave<00:01:25.740> dies

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
second delay between when when wave dies

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.789 
second delay between when when wave dies
and<00:01:26.520> another<00:01:26.700> wave<00:01:27.259> respawns<00:01:28.259> i<00:01:28.409> think<00:01:28.590> i<00:01:28.650> have

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
and another wave respawns i think i have

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.770 
and another wave respawns i think i have
it<00:01:28.920> set<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.369> spawn<00:01:29.820> or<00:01:29.970> two<00:01:30.090> one<00:01:30.390> second

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
it set on that spawn or two one second

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.660 
it set on that spawn or two one second
so<00:01:31.380> basically<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:31.829> long<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.130> stay<00:01:32.430> near

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
so basically as long as you stay near

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.969 
so basically as long as you stay near
this<00:01:32.820> thing<00:01:33.119> you'll<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.079> four<00:01:34.439> blazes

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
this thing you'll have four blazes

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.800 
this thing you'll have four blazes
shooting<00:01:35.579> at<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.119> as<00:01:36.210> soon<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.630> back

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
shooting at you and as soon as you back

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.310 
shooting at you and as soon as you back
away<00:01:37.310> they<00:01:38.310> will<00:01:40.310> die<00:01:41.310> off<00:01:42.020> really<00:01:43.020> quickly

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
away they will die off really quickly

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.859 
away they will die off really quickly
they<00:01:44.009> basically<00:01:44.340> get<00:01:44.610> they<00:01:44.939> get<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.390> wave<00:01:45.600> at

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
they basically get they get one wave at

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.020 
they basically get they get one wave at
you<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.140> fireballs<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:47.490> they<00:01:47.579> die<00:01:47.729> off

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.910 

so<00:01:51.030> that's<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.960> leashed<00:01:52.409> spawner

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
so that's it that is a leashed spawner

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.450 
so that's it that is a leashed spawner
and<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:54.090> foresee<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.170> concept<00:01:55.740> working<00:01:56.340> with

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
and I foresee this concept working with

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.260 
and I foresee this concept working with
working<00:01:59.460> with<00:01:59.490> blazes<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:01.040> ghasts<00:02:02.040> and

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
working with blazes and ghasts and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.870 
working with blazes and ghasts and
skeletons<00:02:03.950> maybe<00:02:04.950> even<00:02:05.189> which<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.640> I'm<00:02:05.790> not

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
skeletons maybe even which is I'm not

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.040 
skeletons maybe even which is I'm not
sure<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.920> any<00:02:08.310> any<00:02:08.640> range<00:02:09.090> monster<00:02:09.690> where<00:02:09.929> you

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
sure so any any range monster where you

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.500 
sure so any any range monster where you
can<00:02:10.200> get<00:02:10.349> close<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:11.220> has<00:02:11.520> time<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.120> shoot<00:02:12.390> at

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
can get close it has time to shoot at

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.280 
can get close it has time to shoot at
you<00:02:12.629> once

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
you once

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.789 
you once
and<00:02:13.409> then<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.489> dies<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.209> they<00:02:16.170> can't<00:02:16.439> chase

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
and then it dies and they can't chase

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.440 
and then it dies and they can't chase
you<00:02:17.040> because<00:02:17.069> as<00:02:17.790> soon<00:02:17.939> as<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.120> get<00:02:18.209> away<00:02:18.390> from

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
you because as soon as you get away from

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.440 
you because as soon as you get away from
the<00:02:18.659> spawner<00:02:18.989> they<00:02:19.709> only<00:02:19.890> have<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.099> short

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
the spawner they only have a short

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.020 
the spawner they only have a short
lifespan<00:02:21.450> so<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.140> monsters<00:02:22.500> die<00:02:22.530> off<00:02:23.030> all

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
lifespan so the monsters die off all

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.640 
lifespan so the monsters die off all
right<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.780> that's<00:02:25.109> it<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:27.500> yeah<00:02:28.500> i'll

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
right so that's it and yeah i'll

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.289 
right so that's it and yeah i'll
probably<00:02:28.890> make<00:02:29.280> use<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.519> these<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.090> front

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
probably make use of these and in front

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.910 
probably make use of these and in front
of<00:02:30.390> mine<00:02:30.510> somewhere<00:02:30.780> I'm<00:02:31.349> actually<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.799> was

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
of mine somewhere I'm actually I was

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.880 
of mine somewhere I'm actually I was
thinking<00:02:31.950> these<00:02:32.640> would<00:02:32.939> be<00:02:33.090> good<00:02:33.450> as<00:02:33.810> a

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
thinking these would be good as a

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.099 
thinking these would be good as a
deterrent<00:02:35.150> for<00:02:36.150> players<00:02:36.390> trying<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.810> bridge

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
deterrent for players trying to bridge

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.819 
deterrent for players trying to bridge
somewhere<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.670> you're<00:02:39.659> trying<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.959> bridge<00:02:40.260> and

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
somewhere so you're trying to bridge and

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.940 
somewhere so you're trying to bridge and
if<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:41.549> if<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.909> back<00:02:42.269> off<00:02:42.469> then<00:02:43.469> they<00:02:43.650> go<00:02:43.829> away

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
if you if you back off then they go away

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.550 
if you if you back off then they go away
but<00:02:44.819> if<00:02:44.909> you<00:02:45.000> keep<00:02:45.209> going<00:02:45.510> then<00:02:46.079> they'll<00:02:46.260> stick

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
but if you keep going then they'll stick

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.740 
but if you keep going then they'll stick
with<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.099> keep<00:02:47.730> shooting<00:02:48.540> at<00:02:48.629> you

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
with you and keep shooting at you

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.220 
with you and keep shooting at you
constantly<00:02:48.900> Oh<00:02:50.060> another<00:02:51.060> thing<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.989> stop

Inferno<00:02:56.909> mines<00:02:57.180> I'm<00:02:57.650> thinking<00:02:58.650> not<00:02:59.579> to<00:02:59.879> and

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
Inferno mines I'm thinking not to and

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
just see how the map plays out without

to try to stop a bridging I might go

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.140 
to try to stop a bridging I might go
with<00:03:40.349> something<00:03:40.650> like<00:03:40.859> that<00:03:40.889> if<00:03:41.729> I<00:03:42.090> do

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
with something like that if I do

with something like that if I do
actually<00:03:42.449> decide<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:42.989> do<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:44.250> anyway
