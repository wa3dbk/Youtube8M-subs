alright<00:00:10.320> SARM<00:00:10.620> so<00:00:10.920> what<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.580> first<00:00:11.880> step

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
alright SARM so what is the first step

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.049 
alright SARM so what is the first step
when<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.740> consumer<00:00:14.250> gets<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.610> thing<00:00:14.670> home

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
when the consumer gets this thing home

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.400 
when the consumer gets this thing home
what<00:00:15.480> do<00:00:15.540> they<00:00:15.630> need<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.809> know<00:00:16.020> what<00:00:16.260> do<00:00:16.320> they

little bit for you already in
advancement<00:00:20.820> we<00:00:21.180> did<00:00:21.420> mount<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.930> wheels

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
advancement we did mount the wheels

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.349 
advancement we did mount the wheels
which<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.890> very<00:00:23.220> simple<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.760> do<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.180> got

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
which is very simple to do it's got

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.509 
which is very simple to do it's got
actually<00:00:25.140> even<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.380> DVD<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:26.070> comes<00:00:26.250> along

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
actually even a DVD that comes along

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.880 
actually even a DVD that comes along
with<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:27.119> helps<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> assembling

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
with it that helps you in the assembling

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.130 
with it that helps you in the assembling
process<00:00:28.920> at<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.970> wheels<00:00:30.150> basically<00:00:30.420> just<00:00:30.960> two

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
process at the wheels basically just two

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.080 
process at the wheels basically just two
little<00:00:31.830> bolts<00:00:32.009> here<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.610> tighten<00:00:33.030> up

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
little bolts here that you tighten up

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.959 
little bolts here that you tighten up
with<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> 10<00:00:33.630> millimeter<00:00:33.989> wrench<00:00:34.230> and

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
with a 10 millimeter wrench and

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.729 
with a 10 millimeter wrench and
basically<00:00:35.969> they<00:00:36.270> also<00:00:36.480> come<00:00:36.809> labeled<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.710> you

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
basically they also come labeled so you

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.430 
basically they also come labeled so you
can't<00:00:38.100> even<00:00:38.280> mess<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.879> up<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.270> goes<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> B<00:00:40.260> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
can't even mess that up a goes to a B to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.979 
can't even mess that up a goes to a B to
B<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.800> saw<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.239> if<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.809> can

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
B I saw that so if you can if you can

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.139 
B I saw that so if you can if you can
read<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.200> guess<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.070> only<00:00:44.309> Rick

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
read I guess is the only Rick

read I guess is the only Rick
prerequisite<00:00:46.110> today<00:00:47.000> but<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.210> put<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.629> wheels

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
prerequisite today but we put the wheels

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.709 
prerequisite today but we put the wheels
on<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.340> basically<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
on here and we basically all of the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.240 
on here and we basically all of the
parts<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.079> are<00:00:52.260> inside<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:52.980> come

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
parts that are inside of here come

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.209 
parts that are inside of here come
wrapped<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.480> removed<00:00:54.899> those

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
wrapped up and we have removed those

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.170 
wrapped up and we have removed those
unwrapped<00:00:56.219> them<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.670> we're<00:00:56.789> going<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.940> show

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
unwrapped them and we're going to show

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.479 
unwrapped them and we're going to show
you<00:00:57.210> how<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.600> goes<00:00:57.809> back<00:00:58.260> together<00:00:58.559> okay<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
you how it goes back together okay and

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.479 
you how it goes back together okay and
get<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.420> operating<00:01:00.840> phase<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.340> this

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
get it to the operating phase so this

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.090 
get it to the operating phase so this
here<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.730> your<00:01:03.180> fire-pot<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.589> where<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
here is your fire-pot this is where the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.149 
here is your fire-pot this is where the
magic<00:01:05.339> happens<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:07.290> fire<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.950> it's

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
magic happens and the fire as it's

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.250 
magic happens and the fire as it's
burning<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.670> here<00:01:08.970> if<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.750> could<00:01:09.869> see<00:01:10.110> these

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
burning in here if you could see these

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.170 
burning in here if you could see these
little<00:01:10.470> plates<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.670> actually

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
little plates in here this actually

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.450 
little plates in here this actually
causes<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.600> turbulence<00:01:13.229> with<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> fan<00:01:13.950> forced

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
causes a turbulence with the fan forced

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.330 
causes a turbulence with the fan forced
air<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.420> Maples<00:01:15.930> pellets<00:01:16.409> burn<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.950> that

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
air the Maples pellets burn and that

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.340 
air the Maples pellets burn and that
turbulence<00:01:17.939> also<00:01:18.360> helps<00:01:18.659> declare<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> fire

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
turbulence also helps declare the fire

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.499 
turbulence also helps declare the fire
pot<00:01:19.619> as<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.130> burning<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.090> don't<00:01:21.330> get

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
pot as it's burning so you don't get

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.230 
pot as it's burning so you don't get
excess<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.680> building<00:01:23.159> up<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.549> your<00:01:23.580> fire<00:01:23.970> pot

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
excess just building up in your fire pot

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.539 
excess just building up in your fire pot
that<00:01:24.810> rod<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.470> looks<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> chrome<00:01:26.310> rod

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
that rod that looks like a chrome rod

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.010 
that rod that looks like a chrome rod
sticking<00:01:26.850> out<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.479> actually<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
sticking out there it is actually the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.890 
sticking out there it is actually the
your<00:01:28.200> igniter<00:01:28.560> okay<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.700> goes<00:01:30.030> red-hot<00:01:30.659> and

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
your igniter okay it goes red-hot and

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.899 
your igniter okay it goes red-hot and
get<00:01:31.229> your<00:01:31.439> colored<00:01:31.710> Spurs<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.430> electric

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
get your colored Spurs so that electric

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.370 
get your colored Spurs so that electric
that<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.240> plugged<00:01:33.420> into<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.930> electrical

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that it's plugged into the electrical

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.590 
that it's plugged into the electrical
outlet<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:35.040> thing<00:01:35.280> heats<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.360> burns

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
outlet that thing heats up and it burns

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.999 
outlet that thing heats up and it burns
the<00:01:36.750> pellets<00:01:37.049> that's<00:01:37.320> right<00:01:37.560> that's<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the pellets that's right that's the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.160 
the pellets that's right that's the
first<00:01:38.310> oh<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.270> first<00:01:39.420> thing<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.780> your<00:01:39.990> auger

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
first oh the first thing is your auger

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.080 
first oh the first thing is your auger
actually<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.829> turning<00:01:41.280> inside<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.820> tube

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
actually is turning inside this tube

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.719 
actually is turning inside this tube
bringing<00:01:42.840> fuel<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> fire<00:01:43.920> pot<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.579> can

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
bringing fuel to the fire pot so it can

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.109 
bringing fuel to the fire pot so it can
drop<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.540> ignite<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.369> electricity<00:01:47.759> is

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
drop in and ignite so the electricity is

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.870 
drop in and ignite so the electricity is
being<00:01:48.299> used<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.810> do<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.500> ignition<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.340> also

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
being used to do the ignition and also

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.050 
being used to do the ignition and also
the<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.200> feeding<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> fuel<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:53.790> first

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the the feeding of the fuel the first

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
the the feeding of the fuel the first
thing<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.450> you'll<00:01:54.659> put<00:01:54.840> into<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.439> grill

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
thing that you'll put into the grill

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.850 
thing that you'll put into the grill
it's<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.700> first<00:01:56.940> burn<00:01:57.270> plate<00:01:57.570> or<00:01:57.840> what<00:01:58.710> you

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
it's the first burn plate or what you

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.880 
it's the first burn plate or what you
might<00:01:59.010> call<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.310> wind<00:01:59.640> plate<00:02:00.380> 10<00:02:01.380> gauge<00:02:01.620> steel

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
might call a wind plate 10 gauge steel

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.710 
might call a wind plate 10 gauge steel
very<00:02:02.220> heavy-duty<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:03.030> can<00:02:03.210> see<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.510> cross

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
very heavy-duty you can see the cross

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.300 
very heavy-duty you can see the cross
bends<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.440> for<00:02:04.620> strength<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.100> stability

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
bends on it for strength and stability

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.910 
bends on it for strength and stability
this<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.270> not<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.750> grill<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.290> you'll<00:02:07.470> be<00:02:07.560> taken

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
this is not a grill that you'll be taken

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.370 
this is not a grill that you'll be taken

louver which is built into the plate

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.340 
louver which is built into the plate

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.140 
right the louver goes to the top now
this<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.100> know<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.370> course<00:02:38.580> for<00:02:38.790> higher

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
this is you know of course for higher

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.449 
this is you know of course for higher
wind<00:02:39.510> areas<00:02:40.140> or<00:02:40.470> where<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:40.830> don't<00:02:41.040> have<00:02:41.190> wind

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
wind areas or where you don't have wind

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.160 
wind areas or where you don't have wind
protection<00:02:41.640> on<00:02:42.090> maybe<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.450> back<00:02:42.660> porch<00:02:42.990> or

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
protection on maybe a back porch or

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.770 
protection on maybe a back porch or
patio<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:44.220> helps<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.730> keep<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.150> fire<00:02:45.420> hotter

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
patio this helps to keep the fire hotter

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.130 
patio this helps to keep the fire hotter
and<00:02:46.310> safe<00:02:47.310> from<00:02:47.490> any<00:02:47.820> kind<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.150> blowouts<00:02:48.390> okay

and safe from any kind of blowouts okay

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.940 
and safe from any kind of blowouts okay
which<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.890> very<00:02:50.070> rare<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:51.030> this<00:02:51.270> type<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.480> grill

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
which is very rare on this type of grill

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.190 
which is very rare on this type of grill
this<00:02:52.950> also<00:02:53.250> helps<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.880> aid<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.630> all-around

this also helps to aid in the all-around

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.590 
this also helps to aid in the all-around
even<00:02:55.950> temperature<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.640> your<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:57.090> your<00:02:57.150> surface

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
even temperature of your of your surface

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.080 
even temperature of your of your surface
of<00:02:57.720> your<00:02:57.900> grills<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.740> there<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.430> purpose<00:02:59.850> for

of your grills so there is a purpose for
everything<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.870> they<00:03:00.989> do<00:03:01.050> here<00:03:02.000> next<00:03:03.000> one<00:03:03.150> is

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
everything that they do here next one is

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.770 
everything that they do here next one is
your<00:03:03.650> drip<00:03:04.650> tray<00:03:04.890> very<00:03:05.880> heavy-duty<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.510> mean

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
your drip tray very heavy-duty I mean

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.100 
your drip tray very heavy-duty I mean
you<00:03:07.170> feel<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.650> yeah<00:03:08.280> oh<00:03:08.610> man<00:03:09.450> that's<00:03:09.810> not<00:03:09.989> a

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
you feel that yeah oh man that's not a

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.470 
you feel that yeah oh man that's not a
piece<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.500> tin<00:03:10.739> that's<00:03:11.010> solid<00:03:11.489> steel<00:03:11.730> right

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
piece of tin that's solid steel right

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.100 
piece of tin that's solid steel right
there<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:12.930> it's<00:03:13.380> shaped<00:03:14.269> so<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:15.690> drops

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
there and it's shaped so that it drops

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.220 
there and it's shaped so that it drops
into<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.680> trough<00:03:17.100> on<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.730> right

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
into the trough on the right

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.580 
into the trough on the right
and<00:03:20.010> then<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.300> rides<00:03:21.599> over<00:03:22.020> on<00:03:22.170> this<00:03:22.319> side<00:03:22.560> I

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
and then it rides over on this side I

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.900 
and then it rides over on this side I
missed<00:03:23.099> it<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.370> first<00:03:23.430> time<00:03:23.730> just<00:03:25.430> like<00:03:26.430> that

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
missed it the first time just like that

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.690 
missed it the first time just like that
okay<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:28.260> hole<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.739> very<00:03:28.800> important<00:03:29.400> that

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
okay this hole is very important that

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.430 
okay this hole is very important that
helps<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.150> keep<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.450> temperature<00:03:30.900> accurate

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
helps to keep the temperature accurate

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.860 
helps to keep the temperature accurate
so<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.099> whole<00:03:32.280> going<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.849> your<00:03:33.030> sensor<00:03:33.450> that

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
so the whole going to your sensor that

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.809 
so the whole going to your sensor that
basically<00:03:34.470> tells<00:03:34.830> you<00:03:34.920> you've<00:03:35.400> done<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.730> the

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
basically tells you you've done it the

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.699 
basically tells you you've done it the
right<00:03:35.849> way<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.989> think<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.319> camera<00:03:37.650> is

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
right way and I think the camera is

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.410 
right way and I think the camera is
shown<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:38.099> there<00:03:38.340> is<00:03:38.370> actually<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.030> slant

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
shown that there is actually a slant

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.660 
shown that there is actually a slant
going<00:03:39.959> on<00:03:40.110> here<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.920> best<00:03:41.099> thing<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.370> do<00:03:41.580> with

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
going on here the best thing to do with

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.550 
going on here the best thing to do with
this<00:03:41.880> plate<00:03:42.180> is<00:03:42.390> actually<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:42.959> cover<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.410> with

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
this plate is actually you cover it with

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.559 
this plate is actually you cover it with
with<00:03:43.890> foil<00:03:44.280> aluminum<00:03:44.400> foil<00:03:44.970> that's<00:03:45.420> what<00:03:45.540> I

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
with foil aluminum foil that's what I

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.180 
with foil aluminum foil that's what I
did<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.049> did<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.380> at<00:03:46.530> my<00:03:46.620> house<00:03:46.769> if<00:03:47.069> you

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
did and I did that at my house if you

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.500 
did and I did that at my house if you
also<00:03:47.340> want<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.670> make<00:03:47.819> sure<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.090> poke<00:03:48.299> that

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
also want to make sure you poke that

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.780 
also want to make sure you poke that
hole<00:03:48.720> right<00:03:49.019> that's<00:03:49.950> important<00:03:50.519> for<00:03:50.670> your

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
hole right that's important for your

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.570 
hole right that's important for your
accuracy<00:03:51.569> in<00:03:51.870> temperature<00:03:52.349> because<00:03:52.769> why

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
accuracy in temperature because why

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.890 
accuracy in temperature because why
would<00:03:53.819> you<00:03:53.910> want<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.150> have<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.360> take<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.690> out

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
would you want to have to take this out

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.000 
would you want to have to take this out
and<00:03:55.049> scrub<00:03:55.319> this<00:03:55.500> when<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:55.830> could<00:03:55.980> just

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
and scrub this when you could just

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.420 
and scrub this when you could just
remove<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.670> layer<00:03:56.849> of<00:03:57.180> aluminum<00:03:57.840> foil<00:03:58.079> and

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
remove a layer of aluminum foil and

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.190 
remove a layer of aluminum foil and
never<00:03:59.430> have<00:03:59.640> to<00:03:59.670> even<00:04:00.209> remove<00:04:00.720> that<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:00.930> mean

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
never have to even remove that I mean

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.720 
never have to even remove that I mean
you<00:04:01.440> can<00:04:01.590> actually<00:04:01.739> layer<00:04:02.069> this<00:04:02.280> up<00:04:02.519> with

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
you can actually layer this up with

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.509 
you can actually layer this up with
seven<00:04:03.599> or<00:04:03.690> eight<00:04:03.780> layers<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.440> as<00:04:04.920> one<00:04:05.250> gets

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
seven or eight layers and as one gets

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.789 
seven or eight layers and as one gets
dirty<00:04:05.819> just<00:04:06.090> pull<00:04:06.599> it<00:04:06.780> off<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:07.620> got<00:04:07.769> a

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
dirty just pull it off and you got a

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.770 
dirty just pull it off and you got a
clean<00:04:08.099> one<00:04:08.280> right<00:04:08.640> underneath<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.239> that's<00:04:09.660> a

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
clean one right underneath it that's a

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.190 
clean one right underneath it that's a
good<00:04:09.900> idea

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
good idea

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.589 
good idea
and<00:04:10.500> everything<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.010> drips<00:04:11.459> off<00:04:11.849> of<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:12.299> goes

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
and everything that drips off of it goes

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.990 
and everything that drips off of it goes
right<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.230> right<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.650> there's<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.220> chute

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
right to the right and there's a chute

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.719 
right to the right and there's a chute
that<00:04:15.299> goes<00:04:15.720> directly<00:04:16.350> to<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.680> tin<00:04:17.100> bucket<00:04:17.370> and

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
that goes directly to a tin bucket and

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.409 
that goes directly to a tin bucket and
you<00:04:18.510> can<00:04:18.660> actually<00:04:18.810> take<00:04:19.049> foil<00:04:19.410> and<00:04:20.150> line<00:04:21.150> this

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
you can actually take foil and line this

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.260 
you can actually take foil and line this
with<00:04:21.630> foil<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.169> as<00:04:22.830> that<00:04:23.010> gets<00:04:23.310> nasty<00:04:24.030> pull

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
with foil and as that gets nasty pull

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.060 
with foil and as that gets nasty pull
the<00:04:24.389> foil<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:24.990> replace<00:04:25.470> it<00:04:25.680> that's<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:25.919> good

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
the foil and replace it that's a good

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.460 
the foil and replace it that's a good
tip<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.610> don't<00:04:26.639> have<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:27.120> send<00:04:28.050> this<00:04:28.200> to<00:04:28.260> the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
tip you don't have to send this to the

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.390 
tip you don't have to send this to the
steam<00:04:28.800> cleaner<00:04:29.100> it<00:04:30.060> fills<00:04:30.330> up<00:04:30.600> with<00:04:30.630> that

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
steam cleaner it fills up with that

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.710 
steam cleaner it fills up with that
leftover<00:04:32.400> grease<00:04:32.910> that<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:33.150> don't<00:04:33.419> need<00:04:33.570> in

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
leftover grease that you don't need in

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.900 
leftover grease that you don't need in
your<00:04:33.750> body<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.830> last<00:04:35.010> part<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:35.370> put<00:04:35.610> on<00:04:35.789> of

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
your body the last part you put on of

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.670 
your body the last part you put on of
course<00:04:35.940> is<00:04:36.240> your<00:04:36.389> grills<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:37.020> of<00:04:37.169> course<00:04:37.440> they

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
course is your grills and of course they

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.040 
course is your grills and of course they
they<00:04:38.280> split<00:04:38.880> these<00:04:39.120> grills<00:04:39.450> for<00:04:39.600> a<00:04:39.690> reason

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
they split these grills for a reason

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.210 
they split these grills for a reason
because<00:04:40.169> you<00:04:40.320> could<00:04:40.590> actually<00:04:40.620> put<00:04:41.070> these

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
because you could actually put these

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.340 
because you could actually put these
right<00:04:41.490> into<00:04:41.669> your<00:04:41.850> dishwasher<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:42.630> they're

inside<00:04:58.160> of<00:04:58.430> your<00:04:58.760> grill<00:04:58.970> so<00:04:59.630> you'll<00:04:59.780> just<00:04:59.840> have

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
inside of your grill so you'll just have

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.590 
inside of your grill so you'll just have
to<00:05:00.290> take<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.830> unfasten<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.640> screws<00:05:01.970> same<00:05:02.330> ten

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
to take and unfasten the screws same ten

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.930 
to take and unfasten the screws same ten
millimeter<00:05:03.020> wrench<00:05:03.290> put<00:05:04.190> it<00:05:04.310> on<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.550> outside

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
millimeter wrench put it on the outside

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.130 
millimeter wrench put it on the outside
because<00:05:05.030> if<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.330> leave<00:05:05.480> it<00:05:05.600> inside<00:05:05.720> gets

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
because if you leave it inside gets

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.550 
because if you leave it inside gets
really<00:05:06.470> hot<00:05:06.680> a<00:05:07.150> lot<00:05:08.150> harder<00:05:08.420> to<00:05:08.540> use<00:05:08.690> makes<00:05:09.440> it

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
really hot a lot harder to use makes it

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.580 
really hot a lot harder to use makes it
harder<00:05:09.890> to<00:05:09.920> open<00:05:10.160> -<00:05:10.550> this<00:05:11.540> is<00:05:11.720> your<00:05:11.930> pellet

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
harder to open - this is your pellet

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.220 
harder to open - this is your pellet
hopper<00:05:13.010> this<00:05:13.520> is<00:05:13.760> basically<00:05:14.240> the<00:05:14.480> storage<00:05:14.930> for

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
hopper this is basically the storage for

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.260 
hopper this is basically the storage for
your<00:05:15.410> pellets<00:05:16.010> for<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.340> cooking<00:05:16.820> time<00:05:17.060> that

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
your pellets for the cooking time that
