00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.170
 many times we hear that such a car 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.170
 has an abs brake system 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.430
 but how does this really work 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.470
 braking system its name derives from 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.809
 the acronym in English anti lock brake in 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.699
 system and its function is to vary the 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.260
 braking force to prevent the 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.590
 tires lose grip with the 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.590
 ground 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.440
 we go 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.489
 the anti-lock braking system 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.039
 decreases the risk that the tires 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.930
 block and slide when braking the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.479
 vehicle decelerates optimally and 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.920
 remains stable and addressable 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.140
 we will be able to turn the steering wheel 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.390
 while we brake what allows us 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.799
 avoid a possible collision in each 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.690
 rim you will find a sensor 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.339
 revolutions that is connected with the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.009
 electronic control central unit 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.530
 of the abs the revolutions of the wheels 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.240
 well measures are constantly compared 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.580
 each other and with the actual speed of the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.229
 vehicle in the event that the speed 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.750
 of some tire turn 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.130
 considerably the electronics leave the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.319
 pro book lock and reduce 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.789
 immediately the hydraulic pressure of the 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.929
 brake fluid on the circuit 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.929
 corresponding brake 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.110
 here 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.850
 this system works automatically 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.280
 without the driver having to reduce 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.380
 the pressure on the brake pedal 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.210
 the abs systems commonly used in 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.890
 modern vehicles perform the 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.560
 operation to decrease and increase the 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.869
 braking pressure about 15 or 18 times 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.130
 per second although we keep stomping 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.130
 the brake pedal thoroughly 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.090
 currently most of the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.770
 cars have this system of 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.110
 braking thus ensuring safety 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.730
 of the driver and avoiding skids and 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.320
 landslides especially in 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.320
 Wet or sliding surfaces
