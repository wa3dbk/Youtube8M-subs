00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
on now this is a fish tank now you guys

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.320 
on now this is a fish tank now you guys
are<00:00:07.740> probably<00:00:08.010> wondering<00:00:08.220> why<00:00:08.760> do<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:09.059> have<00:00:09.300> a

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
are probably wondering why do I have a

fish in this think we're actually gonna
have<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.540> Raspberry<00:00:16.379> Pi<00:00:16.410> B+<00:00:17.130> clustering<00:00:17.970> in

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
have a Raspberry Pi B+ clustering in

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.689 
have a Raspberry Pi B+ clustering in
this<00:00:18.210> thing<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.600> it's<00:00:19.170> gonna<00:00:19.320> be<00:00:19.699> completely

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
this thing and it's gonna be completely

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.720 
this thing and it's gonna be completely
submerged<00:00:21.439> with<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.650> mineral<00:00:22.859> oil<00:00:23.189> here<00:00:23.430> so

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
submerged with this mineral oil here so

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.859 
submerged with this mineral oil here so
in<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.750> tank<00:00:25.019> will<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:25.680> Raspberry<00:00:26.070> Pi

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
in this tank will be this Raspberry Pi

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.929 
in this tank will be this Raspberry Pi
completely<00:00:27.869> submerged<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.740> mineral<00:00:29.550> oil<00:00:29.580> I

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
completely submerged with mineral oil I

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.730 
completely submerged with mineral oil I
have<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.150> gallon<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.599> mineral<00:00:30.720> here<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.619> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
have a gallon of mineral here of a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.229 
have a gallon of mineral here of a
gallon<00:00:32.239> fish<00:00:33.239> tank<00:00:33.300> here<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.940> yeah<00:00:35.940> we're

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
gallon fish tank here and yeah we're

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.580 
gallon fish tank here and yeah we're
going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.510> set<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.899> up<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.320> going<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
going to set this up and it's going to

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.160 
going to set this up and it's going to
completely<00:00:37.860> work<00:00:38.430> no<00:00:39.090> it's<00:00:39.750> cool<00:00:39.960> this

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
completely work no it's cool this

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.959 
completely work no it's cool this
project<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.770> need<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.100> cool<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.550> project

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
project is we need to cool the project

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.729 
project is we need to cool the project
if<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.360> don't<00:00:42.540> cool<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> tank<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:43.559> just

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
if you don't cool the tank it's just

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.750 
if you don't cool the tank it's just
gonna<00:00:43.829> keep<00:00:44.040> getting<00:00:44.190> hotter<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.640> hotter

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
gonna keep getting hotter and hotter

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.450 
gonna keep getting hotter and hotter
because<00:00:45.270> there's<00:00:45.450> nowhere<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:47.160> heat<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
because there's nowhere for the heat to

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.790 
because there's nowhere for the heat to
dissipate<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.390> that's<00:00:49.140> why<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.350> got<00:00:49.620> this

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
dissipate so that's why I got this

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.950 
dissipate so that's why I got this
radiator<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.120> got<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> pump<00:00:51.539> here<00:00:51.780> that's

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
radiator here I got a pump here that's

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.600 
radiator here I got a pump here that's
gonna<00:00:52.079> pump<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.530> mineral<00:00:52.800> oil<00:00:52.920> through<00:00:53.430> this

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
gonna pump the mineral oil through this

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.279 
gonna pump the mineral oil through this
radiator<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.480> all<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.750> tubing<00:00:55.079> here

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
this is a vinyl to be 10 feet of it and

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.650 
this is a vinyl to be 10 feet of it and
it's<00:00:59.460> gonna<00:00:59.550> pump<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.879> through<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.359> rat

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
it's gonna pump it through this rat

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.200 
it's gonna pump it through this rat
eater<00:01:00.870> right<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.760> gonna<00:01:02.850> pump<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.180> back

radiator<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.560> fan<00:01:08.189> here<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.909> fan

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
radiator I have this fan here the fan

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.670 
radiator I have this fan here the fan
will<00:01:09.240> cool<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> radiator<00:01:09.869> which<00:01:10.200> will<00:01:10.409> cool

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
will cool the radiator which will cool

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.280 
will cool the radiator which will cool
the<00:01:11.280> mineral<00:01:11.610> which<00:01:12.210> will<00:01:12.390> keep<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.840> entire

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the mineral which will keep this entire

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.039 
the mineral which will keep this entire
loop<00:01:14.100> cool<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.850> then<00:01:15.270> tank<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.540> also<00:01:15.689> got<00:01:15.900> some

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049

that's<00:01:18.210> gonna<00:01:18.390> go<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> bottom<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
that's gonna go on the bottom of the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.710 
that's gonna go on the bottom of the
fish<00:01:19.500> tank<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.979> got<00:01:20.549> some<00:01:20.790> plants<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.630> some

decorative<00:01:22.439> things<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.040> will<00:01:23.220> up<00:01:23.430> make<00:01:24.090> this

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
decorative things that will up make this

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.760 
decorative things that will up make this
look<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.659> an<00:01:24.869> actual<00:01:25.049> under<00:01:25.320> sink<00:01:25.590> but

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
look like an actual under sink but

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.990 
look like an actual under sink but
instead<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.220> fish<00:01:26.340> again<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.670> gonna<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
instead of fish again is gonna be a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.630 
instead of fish again is gonna be a
Raspberry<00:01:27.450> Pi<00:01:27.479> B+<00:01:28.170> cluster<00:01:28.920> I'm<00:01:29.369> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.549> see

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
Raspberry Pi B+ cluster I'm going to see

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.460 
Raspberry Pi B+ cluster I'm going to see
if<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.939> fit<00:01:30.180> my<00:01:30.540> bit<00:01:30.750> man<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.110> minor<00:01:31.350> you

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
if I can fit my bit man a minor you

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.020 
if I can fit my bit man a minor you
three<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.040> there<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.700> figure<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:32.970> in

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
three in there if I can figure it in

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.490 
three in there if I can figure it in
there<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.509> would<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.720> cool<00:01:34.049> I'll<00:01:34.259> also<00:01:34.409> be

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
there that would be cool I'll also be

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.730 
there that would be cool I'll also be
