the PowerPoint slides dynamically update
so<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:42.989> know<00:00:43.109> what<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.559> presentation<00:00:44.160> would

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
so I know what the presentation would

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.599 
so I know what the presentation would
look<00:00:44.519> like<00:00:45.769> so<00:00:46.769> here's<00:00:46.980> an<00:00:47.070> example<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.429> what

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
look like so here's an example of what

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.220 
look like so here's an example of what
this<00:00:47.760> slide<00:00:48.030> would<00:00:48.210> look<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.839> the<00:00:49.050> next

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
this slide would look like in the next

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.329 
this slide would look like in the next
theme<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.440> wanted<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> change<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.249> a<00:00:53.280> more

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
theme so if I wanted to change to a more

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:59.779 
theme so if I wanted to change to a more
gray<00:00:53.819> scale<00:00:54.179> theme<00:00:54.510> here's<00:00:54.839> an<00:00:54.960> example<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> I

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
gray scale theme here's an example so I

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.189 
gray scale theme here's an example so I
no<00:00:59.879> longer<00:01:00.120> actually<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.749> to<00:01:00.899> go<00:01:01.019> through

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
no longer actually have to go through

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.139 
no longer actually have to go through
the<00:01:01.319> process<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.739> changing<00:01:02.370> each<00:01:02.519> side<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.789> see

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the process of changing each side to see

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.390 
the process of changing each side to see
what<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.629> slide<00:01:03.960> would<00:01:04.229> look<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.589> let's

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
what that slide would look like let's

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.820 
what that slide would look like let's
look<00:01:05.550> at<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:05.820> more<00:01:05.850> example<00:01:06.380> if<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.500> go<00:01:07.620> down<00:01:07.800> to

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
look at one more example if I go down to

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.370 
look at one more example if I go down to
the<00:01:08.070> next<00:01:08.250> slide<00:01:08.550> you'll<00:01:08.910> see<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.990> format

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the next slide you'll see in this format

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.990 
the next slide you'll see in this format
the<00:01:10.560> titles<00:01:11.040> are<00:01:11.190> over<00:01:11.460> here<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.880> the

the titles are over here on the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
the titles are over here on the
right-hand<00:01:12.240> side<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:14.400> if<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.550> go<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.060> look<00:01:15.270> at

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
right-hand side so if I go and look at

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.420 
right-hand side so if I go and look at
what<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.440> might<00:01:16.650> look<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.130> another

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430

format you can see how the title

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.880 
format you can see how the title
actually<00:01:20.660> disappears<00:01:21.660> behind<00:01:22.200> this

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
this smart out into something I like so

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.199 
this smart out into something I like so
let's<00:02:11.760> look<00:02:11.999> at<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.239> quarters<00:02:12.659> like<00:02:13.140> this

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.339 

one<00:02:17.209> of<00:02:17.329> the<00:02:17.390> nice<00:02:17.480> thing<00:02:17.720> is<00:02:17.750> that<00:02:17.900> now<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.200> can

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
one of the nice thing is that now I can

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.770 
one of the nice thing is that now I can
update<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:19.099> information<00:02:19.400> on<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.329> graphics

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
update the information on the graphics

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.600 
update the information on the graphics
without<00:02:21.349> actually<00:02:21.709> having<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:22.040> update<00:02:22.310> the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
without actually having to update the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.360 
without actually having to update the
graphics<00:02:23.000> themselves<00:02:23.629> so<00:02:24.500> let's<00:02:24.739> say<00:02:24.980> instead

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
graphics themselves so let's say instead

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:36.690 
graphics themselves so let's say instead
I'd<00:02:26.239> like<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.599> look<00:02:26.750> at<00:02:29.470> this<00:02:30.470> will<00:02:30.709> your<00:02:30.920> 08<00:02:32.260> h1

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.780 

and<00:02:37.700> then<00:02:37.909> I'd<00:02:38.030> like<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.329> look<00:02:38.480> at<00:02:39.579> fiscal<00:02:40.579> year

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
and then I'd like to look at fiscal year

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.479 
and then I'd like to look at fiscal year
oah<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:44.230> can<00:02:45.230> even<00:02:45.319> delete<00:02:45.769> these<00:02:46.099> bullets

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
oah to I can even delete these bullets

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.610 
oah to I can even delete these bullets
so<00:02:46.730> let's<00:02:47.569> say<00:02:47.750> that's<00:02:47.870> all<00:02:48.079> I'd<00:02:48.200> like<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.500> look

so let's say that's all I'd like to look

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.000 
so let's say that's all I'd like to look
at<00:02:48.799> I<00:02:49.010> can<00:02:49.190> go<00:02:49.280> ahead<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.519> take<00:02:49.849> these<00:02:50.030> out<00:02:50.269> and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
at I can go ahead and take these out and

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.470 
at I can go ahead and take these out and
it's<00:02:52.010> going<00:02:52.129> to<00:02:52.190> update<00:02:52.579> my<00:02:52.730> presentation

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
it's going to update my presentation

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.110 
it's going to update my presentation
accordingly<00:02:54.310> now<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:55.549> only<00:02:55.730> have<00:02:55.940> two

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
accordingly now that I only have two

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.180 
accordingly now that I only have two
bullets<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:56.510> information<00:02:57.109> maybe<00:02:57.739> I'd<00:02:57.920> like<00:02:58.069> to

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
bullets of information maybe I'd like to

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.670 
bullets of information maybe I'd like to
change<00:02:58.489> this<00:02:58.790> SmartArt<00:02:59.329> graphic<00:02:59.840> I<00:03:00.079> can<00:03:00.500> see

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
change this SmartArt graphic I can see

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.869 
change this SmartArt graphic I can see
what<00:03:00.829> it<00:03:00.920> would<00:03:01.010> look<00:03:01.189> like<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.579> some<00:03:01.760> other

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
what it would look like in some other

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:10.300 
what it would look like in some other
similar<00:03:02.450> formats<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:08.439> can<00:03:09.439> also<00:03:09.560> go<00:03:09.799> back<00:03:10.010> and

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
similar formats I can also go back and

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.699 
similar formats I can also go back and
change<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.510> SmartArt<00:03:11.900> graphic<00:03:12.379> that<00:03:12.500> I'm

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
change the SmartArt graphic that I'm

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.990 
change the SmartArt graphic that I'm
using<00:03:15.040> so<00:03:16.040> if<00:03:16.129> I'd<00:03:16.220> like<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.519> change<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.970> a

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
using so if I'd like to change to a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.089 
using so if I'd like to change to a
different<00:03:17.090> layout<00:03:17.569> I<00:03:18.049> can<00:03:18.440> go<00:03:18.560> ahead<00:03:18.709> through

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
different layout I can go ahead through

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.159 
different layout I can go ahead through
here<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.609> here<00:03:19.760> are<00:03:19.790> some<00:03:19.900> options<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:21.049> I

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
here and here are some options that I

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.349 
here and here are some options that I
have<00:03:21.470> let's<00:03:22.099> say<00:03:22.280> I<00:03:22.310> looked<00:03:22.579> like<00:03:22.910> to<00:03:23.060> look<00:03:23.180> at

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
have let's say I looked like to look at

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:29.979 
have let's say I looked like to look at
the<00:03:23.569> process<00:03:24.099> for<00:03:25.099> these<00:03:25.250> two<00:03:25.639> halves<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:28.989> can

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
the process for these two halves I can

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.569 
the process for these two halves I can
look<00:03:30.139> at<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.409> way<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:30.650> h1<00:03:31.129> would<00:03:31.280> flow<00:03:31.549> into

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
look at the way that h1 would flow into

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.890 
look at the way that h1 would flow into
h<00:03:32.000> 2<00:03:32.359> i<00:03:33.280> can<00:03:34.280> also<00:03:34.430> go<00:03:34.639> ahead<00:03:34.940> and<00:03:35.299> create<00:03:35.780> a

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
h 2 i can also go ahead and create a

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.300 
h 2 i can also go ahead and create a
more<00:03:36.139> colourful<00:03:36.709> presentation<00:03:36.739> of<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.609> data

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
more colourful presentation of the data

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.670 
more colourful presentation of the data
all<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.370> time<00:03:40.579> my<00:03:41.209> content<00:03:41.840> is<00:03:41.989> staying<00:03:42.379> there

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
and i'm just looking at the visual

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.770 
and i'm just looking at the visual
