probably one of the best defenders in

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.359 
probably one of the best defenders in
the<00:01:09.600> game<00:01:09.780> not<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> lot<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> guys<00:01:10.500> got<00:01:10.710> 99<00:01:11.040> shot

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the game not a lot of guys got 99 shot

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.399 
the game not a lot of guys got 99 shot
power<00:01:11.549> which<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:11.970> I'm<00:01:12.180> correct<00:01:12.360> he's<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.170> got

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
power which if I'm correct he's a got

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.810 
power which if I'm correct he's a got
power<00:01:13.619> head<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.950> trade<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.400> think<00:01:14.490> that

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
power head of trade so I think that

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.700 
power head of trade so I think that
corners<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.720> when<00:01:15.930> he<00:01:16.080> hit<00:01:16.200> his<00:01:16.439> head<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
corners and when he hit his head on the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.830 
corners and when he hit his head on the
corner<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.280> think<00:01:17.909> they're<00:01:18.030> actually<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.330> rocket

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
corner I think they're actually I rocket

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.020 
corner I think they're actually I rocket
so<00:01:19.020> am<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.560> think<00:01:20.189> sharp<00:01:20.430> air<00:01:20.549> comes<00:01:20.759> into<00:01:20.909> play

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
so am I think sharp air comes into play

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.880 
so am I think sharp air comes into play
that<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.630> instance<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.110> well<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.590> left<00:01:22.799> eye

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
that that instance as well the left eye

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.260 
that that instance as well the left eye

was a labatt and the right back was my
Khan<00:01:24.509> who<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.840> an<00:01:25.049> absolute<00:01:25.500> God<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.220> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
Khan who is an absolute God on to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.950 
Khan who is an absolute God on to
midfield<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.880> which<00:01:27.030> consists<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.509> Phillip

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
midfield on which consists of Phillip

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.440 
midfield on which consists of Phillip
Blum<00:01:28.200> Steven<00:01:28.950> Gerrard<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.430> daniele<00:01:30.090> de<00:01:30.240> rossi

Blum Steven Gerrard and daniele de rossi

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.090 
Blum Steven Gerrard and daniele de rossi
de<00:01:30.780> Rossi<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.259> me<00:01:31.320> was<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> biggest<00:01:31.650> letdown

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
de Rossi for me was the biggest letdown

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.730 
de Rossi for me was the biggest letdown
and<00:01:32.509> Aslan<00:01:33.509> wasn't<00:01:33.930> impressive<00:01:34.350> either<00:01:34.500> they

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
and Aslan wasn't impressive either they

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.039 
and Aslan wasn't impressive either they
both<00:01:34.770> didn't<00:01:35.310> recon<00:01:35.610> tree<00:01:35.790> at<00:01:36.000> all<00:01:36.240> whereas

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
both didn't recon tree at all whereas

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.719 
both didn't recon tree at all whereas
Jared<00:01:37.380> offices<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> higher<00:01:37.950> position<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.700> he

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
Jared offices a higher position so he

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.640 
Jared offices a higher position so he
probably<00:01:39.299> gets<00:01:39.450> more<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.810> ball<00:01:39.960> rather

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
probably gets more of the ball rather

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.530 
probably gets more of the ball rather
than<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> two<00:01:41.040> beside<00:01:41.400> him<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.759> overall<00:01:42.420> this

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
than the two beside him so overall this

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.179 
than the two beside him so overall this
team<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:43.079> didn't<00:01:43.290> perform<00:01:43.470> as<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.040> should

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
team just didn't perform as it should

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.319 
team just didn't perform as it should
have<00:01:44.310> because<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.790> looks<00:01:44.939> absolutely

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
have because it looks absolutely

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.080 
have because it looks absolutely
incredible<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:47.009> didn't<00:01:47.520> really<00:01:47.790> seem

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
incredible and it didn't really seem

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.370 
incredible and it didn't really seem
like<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.540> seemed<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.720> my<00:01:48.869> players<00:01:49.140> were

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380

pretty<00:02:11.790> poor<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.209> team

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
pretty poor in this team

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.160 
pretty poor in this team
100k<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.920> don't<00:02:14.459> know<00:02:14.520> if<00:02:14.940> he<00:02:15.330> got<00:02:15.569> his<00:02:15.840> normal

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
kinda think he'd probably do a better

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.370 
kinda think he'd probably do a better
job<00:02:17.459> because<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.060> less<00:02:18.270> blues<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.989> finally

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
job because the less blues and finally

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.650

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
people very like him and imagine if he's

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.660 
people very like him and imagine if he's
normal<00:02:25.290> Bundesliga<00:02:25.770> team<00:02:25.980> he'd<00:02:26.520> be
