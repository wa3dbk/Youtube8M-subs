hey<00:00:06.399> guys<00:00:06.580> welcome<00:00:06.819> to<00:00:07.029> the<00:00:07.149> gallery<00:00:07.569> here<00:00:07.870> on

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
hey guys welcome to the gallery here on

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.270 
hey guys welcome to the gallery here on
our<00:00:08.260> server<00:00:08.620> I<00:00:09.360> stumbled<00:00:10.360> across<00:00:10.450> a<00:00:11.049> couple

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
our server I stumbled across a couple

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.700 
our server I stumbled across a couple
designs<00:00:12.280> for<00:00:13.000> some<00:00:13.480> more<00:00:13.629> blocks<00:00:13.960> whoppers

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:14.710 
designs for some more blocks whoppers

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:23.060 
designs for some more blocks whoppers
and<00:00:15.270> I<00:00:16.270> wanted<00:00:16.540> to<00:00:16.660> share<00:00:17.110> those<00:00:17.380> with<00:00:17.410> you

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.910 

really<00:00:24.070> compact<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:26.019> is<00:00:26.199> actually<00:00:27.779> almost

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
really compact this is actually almost

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.150 
really compact this is actually almost
identical<00:00:29.920> to<00:00:31.110> paper<00:00:32.110> cuts<00:00:32.410> design<00:00:32.800> except

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
identical to paper cuts design except

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.200 
identical to paper cuts design except
it's<00:00:33.370> upside<00:00:33.699> down<00:00:33.879> so<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:36.550> can<00:00:36.730> see<00:00:36.970> there's

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
it's upside down so you can see there's

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.079 
it's upside down so you can see there's
a<00:00:37.300> quite<00:00:37.839> a<00:00:37.870> similarity<00:00:38.379> there<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:42.370> instead

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
a quite a similarity there but instead

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:44.880 
a quite a similarity there but instead
of<00:00:43.299> pushing<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.140> block<00:00:44.320> down<00:00:44.530> this<00:00:44.710> one

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
of pushing the block down this one

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.920 
of pushing the block down this one
pushes<00:00:45.220> it<00:00:45.369> up<00:00:45.460> so<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:49.239> kind<00:00:49.570> of<00:00:49.600> rearrange

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
pushes it up so just kind of rearrange

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.850 
pushes it up so just kind of rearrange
things<00:00:50.350> and<00:00:50.680> then<00:00:50.769> I<00:00:51.510> added<00:00:52.510> a<00:00:52.809> little<00:00:52.860> circle

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
things and then I added a little circle

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.350 
things and then I added a little circle
on<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.040> back<00:00:54.220> there<00:00:54.580> to<00:00:54.729> speed<00:00:55.000> it<00:00:55.119> up<00:00:55.239> a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
on the back there to speed it up a

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:04.140 
on the back there to speed it up a
little<00:00:55.479> bit<00:01:00.839> so<00:01:01.839> it's<00:01:02.110> very<00:01:03.070> quick<00:01:03.519> a<00:01:03.760> little

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
little bit so it's very quick a little

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.929 
little bit so it's very quick a little
bit<00:01:04.360> of<00:01:04.479> a<00:01:04.600> server<00:01:04.960> lag<00:01:05.290> there<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.790> you

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
bit of a server lag there that you

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.889 
bit of a server lag there that you
wouldn't<00:01:07.360> see<00:01:07.600> I'm<00:01:07.840> not<00:01:08.130> single<00:01:09.130> player<00:01:09.899> but

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
wouldn't see I'm not single player but

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.529 
wouldn't see I'm not single player but
that<00:01:11.200> works<00:01:11.380> really<00:01:11.619> well<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:14.009> did<00:01:15.009> have<00:01:15.039> a<00:01:15.539> sped

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
that works really well I did have a sped

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.749 
that works really well I did have a sped
up<00:01:16.630> version<00:01:16.659> of<00:01:17.259> paper<00:01:17.530> cuts<00:01:17.890> over<00:01:18.189> here<00:01:18.549> and

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
up version of paper cuts over here and

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.389 
up version of paper cuts over here and
it<00:01:19.450> was<00:01:19.539> a<00:01:19.570> little<00:01:19.840> bit<00:01:20.049> different<00:01:20.439> but<00:01:20.530> I<00:01:20.590> went

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
it was a little bit different but I went

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.510 
it was a little bit different but I went
ahead<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:22.289> did<00:01:23.289> it<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.560> same<00:01:23.799> way<00:01:24.039> as<00:01:24.189> the<00:01:24.310> one

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
ahead and did it the same way as the one

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.590 
ahead and did it the same way as the one
you<00:01:24.670> saw<00:01:25.359> just<00:01:25.659> a<00:01:25.749> second<00:01:26.079> ago<00:01:26.109> so<00:01:27.070> this<00:01:27.340> one

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
you saw just a second ago so this one

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.100 
you saw just a second ago so this one
works<00:01:28.600> pretty<00:01:28.869> fast<00:01:28.990> too

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.500 

so<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.400> pretty<00:01:36.120> easy<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.510> build<00:01:38.390> go<00:01:39.390> ahead

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
so it's pretty easy to build go ahead

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.460 
so it's pretty easy to build go ahead
and<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:40.230> one<00:01:40.410> here<00:01:40.590> real<00:01:40.770> quick<00:01:40.980> for<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:42.470> got

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
and do one here real quick for you got

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.210 
and do one here real quick for you got
two<00:01:44.660> normal<00:01:45.660> pistons<00:01:46.110> three<00:01:46.740> blocks<00:01:47.040> apart

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
two normal pistons three blocks apart

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.390 
two normal pistons three blocks apart
the<00:01:47.910> sticky<00:01:48.240> piston<00:01:48.630> then<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.200> middle

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.940 

going<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.610> put<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.060> torch<00:01:54.479> under<00:01:55.170> each<00:01:55.790> of<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
going to put a torch under each of the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.050 
going to put a torch under each of the
regular<00:01:58.950> piston<00:01:59.400> so<00:01:59.550> when<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.700> put<00:01:59.880> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
regular piston so when I put the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.160 
regular piston so when I put the
blocking<00:02:00.810> her<00:02:00.960> first<00:02:02.720> otherwise<00:02:03.720> it<00:02:03.930> will<00:02:03.990> get

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
blocking her first otherwise it will get

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.850 
blocking her first otherwise it will get
squished<00:02:05.660> torch<00:02:06.660> under<00:02:06.900> there<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.560> sit<00:02:07.800> there

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
squished torch under there and sit there

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.820 
squished torch under there and sit there
and<00:02:10.610> put<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> torch<00:02:12.030> they're<00:02:14.120> going<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.390> put

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
and put a torch they're going to put

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.949 
and put a torch they're going to put
people<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:17.100> repeater<00:02:17.700> there<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.810> then<00:02:18.930> a

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
people a repeater there and then a

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:28.760 
people a repeater there and then a
button<00:02:19.350> mom<00:02:20.300> that's<00:02:21.300> torch<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:26.570> put<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.840> dust

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
button mom that's torch and put the dust

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:38.140 
button mom that's torch and put the dust
on<00:02:28.980> top<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:31.260> should<00:02:31.650> be<00:02:31.830> it

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:47.090 

just<00:02:39.150> like<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:44.360> then<00:02:45.800> if<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.890> want<00:02:47.040> to

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
just like so and then if you want to

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.090 
just like so and then if you want to
speed<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.370> up<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.670> little<00:02:47.820> bit<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.090> can<00:02:48.210> just

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
speed it up a little bit you can just

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.220 
speed it up a little bit you can just
put<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.130> repeater<00:02:50.670> here<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:51.420> piece<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:51.930> death

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
put a repeater here a piece of death

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.820 
put a repeater here a piece of death
I'll<00:02:52.530> catch<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:54.080> info<00:02:55.080> from<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.470> torch

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
I'll catch the info from that torch

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.860 
I'll catch the info from that torch
there<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.400> then<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:56.940> will<00:02:57.210> not<00:02:58.400> have<00:02:59.400> this

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
there and then it will not have this

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.520 
there and then it will not have this
sticky<00:03:00.870> piston<00:03:01.290> pop<00:03:02.130> back<00:03:02.370> up<00:03:02.550> early<00:03:03.530> just

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
sticky piston pop back up early just

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:13.130 
sticky piston pop back up early just
like<00:03:04.740> so<00:03:08.270> so<00:03:09.270> there<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.600> go<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:12.140> useful

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
like so so there you go the useful

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.700 
like so so there you go the useful
little<00:03:13.410> gadget<00:03:13.890> thanks<00:03:14.580> for<00:03:14.670> watching
