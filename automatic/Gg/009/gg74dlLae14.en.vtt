00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
pitches and that they're okay for

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.190 
pitches and that they're okay for
younger<00:00:11.190> guys<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.759> use<00:00:12.000> as<00:00:12.300> an<00:00:12.630> alternative<00:00:13.139> to

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
younger guys to use as an alternative to

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.470 
younger guys to use as an alternative to
throwing<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.920> curveball<00:00:14.160> like<00:00:14.460> because<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.089> lot

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
throwing a curveball like because a lot

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.060 
throwing a curveball like because a lot
of<00:00:15.509> people<00:00:15.660> know<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:15.929> throwing<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.800> curveball

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
of people know that throwing a curveball

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.160 
of people know that throwing a curveball
or<00:00:17.460> slider<00:00:17.490> at<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.000> young<00:00:18.210> age<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.630> not

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
or slider at a young age is not

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.410 
or slider at a young age is not
necessarily<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.760> right<00:00:20.789> thing<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.240> do<00:00:21.390> or

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
necessarily the right thing to do or

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.050 
necessarily the right thing to do or
very<00:00:21.720> good<00:00:21.779> for<00:00:22.109> your<00:00:22.199> arm<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:22.980> some<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.609> saw

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
very good for your arm so some I saw

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.029 
very good for your arm so some I saw
some<00:00:24.240> websites<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.170> some<00:00:25.650> coaches

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
some websites and and some coaches

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.670 
some websites and and some coaches
believe<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:27.900> slip<00:00:28.170> pitch<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.560> an

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
believe that the slip pitch is an

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.009 
believe that the slip pitch is an
alternative<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.730> disagree<00:00:30.689> very

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
alternative to this and I disagree very

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.729 
alternative to this and I disagree very
strongly<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.679> think<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.790> slip<00:00:33.120> pitch

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
strongly I think that the slip pitch

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.940 
strongly I think that the slip pitch
which<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.770> by<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.160> way<00:00:35.430> uh<00:00:36.320> you<00:00:37.320> know<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> fork

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
which is by the way uh you know a fork

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.479 
which is by the way uh you know a fork
ball<00:00:38.540> palm<00:00:39.540> ball<00:00:39.980> you<00:00:40.980> know<00:00:41.100> if<00:00:41.370> you're

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
ball palm ball you know if you're

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.920 
ball palm ball you know if you're
throwing<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.790> shot<00:00:41.969> obviously<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.750> a

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
throwing a shot obviously it's like a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.830 
throwing a shot obviously it's like a
spit<00:00:43.800> or<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> shine<00:00:44.820> ball<00:00:45.120> those<00:00:45.480> are<00:00:45.600> illegal

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
spit or a shine ball those are illegal

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.160 
spit or a shine ball those are illegal
but<00:00:46.289> they're<00:00:46.800> also<00:00:47.120> slip<00:00:48.120> pitches<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.719> those

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
but they're also slip pitches so those

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.139 
but they're also slip pitches so those
are<00:00:49.320> some<00:00:49.440> examples<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:50.010> slip<00:00:50.280> pitches<00:00:50.640> but<00:00:50.940> I

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
are some examples of slip pitches but I

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.840 
are some examples of slip pitches but I
think<00:00:51.750> they're<00:00:51.960> they're<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> lot<00:00:52.920> more<00:00:52.949> harmful

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
think they're they're a lot more harmful

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.380 
think they're they're a lot more harmful
than<00:00:54.059> even<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.110> curveball<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> slider<00:00:56.969> at<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
than even the curveball or a slider at a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.810 
than even the curveball or a slider at a
young<00:00:57.660> age<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:58.590> don't<00:00:59.280> think<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.550> should<00:00:59.579> be

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
young age I don't think you should be

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.689 
young age I don't think you should be
throwing<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.750> curveball<00:01:01.320> or<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> slider<00:01:02.399> at<00:01:02.609> a

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
throwing a curveball or a slider at a

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.219 
throwing a curveball or a slider at a
young<00:01:02.879> age<00:01:02.910> nor<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.660> think<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.989> should<00:01:04.140> be

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
young age nor do I think you should be

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.469 
young age nor do I think you should be
throwing<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.589> grip<00:01:04.830> pitch<00:01:05.070> if<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.150> want<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.390> see

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
throwing a grip pitch if you want to see

throwing a grip pitch if you want to see
my<00:01:06.600> recommendation<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> age<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.740> throw<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
my recommendation on the age to throw a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.149 
my recommendation on the age to throw a
curveball<00:01:09.750> or<00:01:10.020> slider<00:01:10.049> I'll<00:01:10.890> leave<00:01:11.070> an

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159

to<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> slip<00:01:15.030> pitch<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.479> really<00:01:16.049> bad<00:01:17.040> for<00:01:17.460> your

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
throwing a slip each pitch because what

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
throwing a slip each pitch because what
you're<00:01:22.229> doing<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:23.960> you're<00:01:24.960> throwing<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:26.070> know
