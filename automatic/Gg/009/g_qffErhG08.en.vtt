00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.639
 I'm teaching you today how to make a 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:12.509
 cannon ball poles iron 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:16.230
 differences poles so what else goes 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.420
 need as well as how much iron ball 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.420
 You will need a brother who is 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.010
 glued on the ball a piece of 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.689
 paper to make this Bolivian position and is 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.539
 important that you are in this part of the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.539
 floor so ok the ballots very still 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:45.800
 so let's show you how it works 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.450
 in your opinion simply scale 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.110
 the ball 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.110
 there are other ways 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:07.400
 now it worked out because it 's a game 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.400
 quite again 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:20.319
 It's these folks forget to write in the 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.060
 my channel 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:28.030
 let me now like I'll 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.259
 teaching how to make a 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.459
 iron ball but differences 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.469
 so what more will you need 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:40.630
 how much iron ball 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:44.049
 you will need a magnet that is 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.219
 glued to the ball a piece of paper 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.869
 to make this Bolivian position and is 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.119
 important that you are in this part of the 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:02:00.280
 floor so hockey or bubbles a lot 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:02:11.549
 stop or we'll show you how it is 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:11.549
 running blue simply ball 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:29.140
 now it worked out but it's the one with 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.140
 enough strength again 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.650
 It's these folks do not forget to 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.580
 write my channel 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.580
