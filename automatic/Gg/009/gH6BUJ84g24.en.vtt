00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.910 
you shake the gun and unless you were
shooting<00:02:13.690> at<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:14.020> target<00:02:14.140> as<00:02:14.590> big<00:02:14.710> as<00:02:14.830> that

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
shooting at a target as big as that

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.380 
shooting at a target as big as that
piece<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.190> plexiglass<00:02:15.670> which<00:02:15.940> we<00:02:16.060> still<00:02:16.240> miss

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
piece of plexiglass which we still miss

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.180 
piece of plexiglass which we still miss
sometimes<00:02:16.840> you'd<00:02:17.380> probably<00:02:17.650> not<00:02:17.920> hit<00:02:18.070> your

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
sometimes you'd probably not hit your

sometimes you'd probably not hit your
target<00:02:18.520> looks<00:02:20.250> 3.5<00:02:21.250> out<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.430> 5<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.790> guess<00:02:21.910> it

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
target looks 3.5 out of 5 I guess it

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.070 
target looks 3.5 out of 5 I guess it
looks<00:02:22.030> kind<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.300> cool<00:02:22.450> but<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:22.690> also<00:02:22.810> looks

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
looks kind of cool but it also looks

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.670 
looks kind of cool but it also looks
kind<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.290> retarded<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.980> some<00:02:24.160> ways<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.640> will<00:02:25.240> see

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
kind of retarded in some ways I will see

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.960 
kind of retarded in some ways I will see
see<00:02:26.680> how<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:26.980> changes<00:02:27.250> in<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:27.580> mod<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:27.850> don't

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
see how that changes in the mod I don't

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.160
