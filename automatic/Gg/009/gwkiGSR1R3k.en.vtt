00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Now my beautiful welcome once 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.710
 more to the channel today as you see in the title 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.460
 I'm going to talk to you about the system of the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.080
 Orly's xxi system consists of a 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.619
 permanent manicure that can last 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.010
 up to two weeks the novelty that the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.430
 gel 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.380
 efe ecs de orly is that within 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.260
 components of the enamels and the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.180
 steps that I will reveal next has 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.300
 vitamins which nourishes our 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.969
 seeds and strengthens them 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.270
 to know prices where I bought the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.930
 lamp that used the glazes and how 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.760
 get this set they simply have 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.710
 to visit my blog in the box 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.050
 information I have left a link 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.000
 direct to an entry in my blog where 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.000
 detailed each of these things 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.230
 this is my manicure of almost three 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.330
 weeks as you see some nails already have 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.270
 growth others I was a bit 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.740
 and nothing is practically intact but 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.040
 I must remove it because you are already seeing 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.040
 ugly 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.930
 to remove the enamel I will use 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.970
 this common acetone that can be 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.190
 find in any supermarket and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.870
 cotton balls followed I will 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.850
 I use aluminum foil to cut it 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.850
 in squares 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.630
 now with this file I will proceed to 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.579
 file only the end of my nails 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.130
 because it really costs sometimes to withdraw 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.979
 the enamel I'm going to take the acetone 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.100
 soak a cotton ball well and I'll 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.289
 to place him to wrap his fingers 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.959
 last up to 30 minutes up to 45 minutes 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.090
 with her put because I like that the 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.459
 enamel is removed quite well from the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.219
 nail to ensure we do not mistreat 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:54.219
 the nail at the time of removing the enamel 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.619
 with a stick for manicure 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.580
 retiring the enamel slowly without 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.580
 hurt my nails 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.490
 that's how my nails are 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.150
 now I will proceed to place the 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.510
 first that is also vitaminado and I'm going to 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.140
 put it only on my nails this 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.720
 shape 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.050
 after drying I'm going to use this 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.290
 beige with that is the base and I'll put it 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.420
 in all my year 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.780
 always a thin layer to avoid between 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.780
 things 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.750
 this is the finish that looks good 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.060
 bright now I will use my 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.840
 LED lamp for 30 seconds to dry 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.840
 that this layer 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.700
 and 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.080
 I'm going to use this color that is 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.080
 quite beautiful and also autumnal 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.020
 as you can appreciate the glazes are 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.880
 pretty transparent so it's 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.010
 necessary two layers after having 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.870
 drying of course I'll finish off 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.870
 put it on all my nails 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.260
 and then I'm going to dry it the led lamp by 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.260
 30 more seconds 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.819
 after this a second layer and I already 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.819
 see the color darker 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.160
 and again to dry 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.780
 now it's time to use the top coat 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.780
 which is the protective base 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.980
 I'm going to place a pretty thin layer and 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:03.730
 then to dry for 30 seconds 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.700
 followed by this I will use this 3.1 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.190
 which is an alcohol-based cleanser 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:13.600
 that will remove the sticky layer that 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:16.570
 is after drying the tom com 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.209
 Now I'm going to use oil for 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.370
 cuticles I put only a little bit 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.130
 this pays a lot girls rubbed it on 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.570
 my cuticles he is delicious and also 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.600
 I think he is responsible for the 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.849
 nails grow as they see my nails 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.499
 pretty pretty 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.259
