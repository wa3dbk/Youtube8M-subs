00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.620
 Hello dear viewers with you jay 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.520
 pi x dangers 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:23.220
 and today i will show you how to build 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:26.849
 automatic potions maker so 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.820
 let's start building about building 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.650
 building pretty pretty just me so 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.329
 I do not think that you will have some 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.149
 difficulty to build this building on 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:42.210
 server and actually step 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:47.879
 built by this building and automatic 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:51.090
 potion maker put a block any and so 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.760
 our potion maker will be here later 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.710
 sit work.ua yes I forgot to tell you and 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.890
 forgot to tell you 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.559
 for this building we need a comparator 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.170
 any block 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:10.229
 red torch ejector funnel and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.680
 the cooking counter only us beautiful torch 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.850
 need a few put here and so 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.240
 comparator that this one is small 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.360
 the thing was looking right there 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.640
 on our two blocks further put 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.000
 birch boards on them red torch 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.900
 this red torch is still birch boards 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.970
 on any block 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.549
 there is no difference 2 just so the torch 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.100
 no way differently set we cover these 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.750
 torch 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.829
 put the red torch just like that not 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.979
 On this block, namely here so further 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.200
 we set set red torch 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.439
 it 's exactly like this because 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.409
 nothing will work continue to put 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.899
 ejector and 3 ejector and more 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:03.469
 you can not build because in principle 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.469
 no longer necessary, you can 4 of course but 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:15.310
 so then I zalagalo disorder Well 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.310
 okay, what's terrible 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.370
 everything is ok 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.060
 but all principle is our automatic 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.790
 the potion maker is ready only left 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.580
 put the ingredients for this to us 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.250
 need a bubble of water 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.970
 any secondary ingredient and primary 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.970
 hellish growth 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.690
 can we 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.220
 first lay the ingredients 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.530
 necessarily a hellish 1 lies in the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.810
 here are the lowest and the ejector 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.940
 secondary ingredient in the second 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.430
 the ejector amplifiers are already light and here 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.610
 enlightened then tell you now 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.280
 when you laid the ingredients 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:11.230
 laying a bubble of water 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.239
 and it started being cooked just not 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.980
 put the bubble first because 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.440
 brewed will not be and now I tell you this 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.440
 I'll show you stew 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:35.730
 brewed and awkward potion as you see 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:39.320
 further busting gusta will potion 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.320
 regeneration for 45 seconds 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.500
 here's a regeneration potion 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:58.610
 Now 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.379
 and amplifiers so the day is made now about 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:07.720
 amplifiers 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:11.049
 redstone amplifiers or light stone 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.049
 glowing dust 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:19.690
 action diet redstone it prolongs 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:24.310
 time effect potion a 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.800
 holy dust she strengthens the case here I am 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.090
 show now for example redstone on this 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.300
 potion put it here but no matter in 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.639
 which ejector is better to go there 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.560
 but that's not cooked well see you now 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.800
 take and move to another cell 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.660
 and she began brewed here now and so 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.520
 now we have brewed Regeneration Potion 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:52.229
 for two minutes and show you also how 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.229
 acts here this glowing dust 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.690
 Now we do not say here 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.070
 eat never go to the potion translated 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:08.099
 than the ingredient in the distributor 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:10.750
 but ejector see this difference 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:14.919
 can here and it starts to happen 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.889
 time two minutes and heads of stone that is 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:21.520
 these sip and it reduces the time of action 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.500
 but enhances the potion so we see not 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.150
 regeneration potion and already potion 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.150
 regeneration 2 look 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:39.479
 here is the recovery 2 22 seconds here we are 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:42.990
 drink this potion and restore 2 such 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:46.500
 so here is the height of this building 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.130
 six blocks you see two two three 4 5 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.210
 six 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.280
 and the width of 4 blocks now takes only 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.280
 four blocks in total 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:59.430
 I think you need this construction 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.280
 You can put it in every house in 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.889
 Anyone in any of your construction and you can 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.130
 can also be placed in the basement 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:15.870
 perfect room for this for this 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:17.580
 for this building well, actually everything with 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.880
 you were dzhipik singers 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:25.069
