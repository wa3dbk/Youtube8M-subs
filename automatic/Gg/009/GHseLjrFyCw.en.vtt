00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.149 
routine maybe if you lose 50 pounds
although<00:01:30.810> or<00:01:31.170> more<00:01:31.530> which<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.890> don't<00:01:31.950> know

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
although or more which I don't know

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.210 
although or more which I don't know
quite<00:01:32.460> what<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.610> would<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:34.009> your<00:01:35.009> body

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
quite what that would be like your body

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.819 
quite what that would be like your body
starts<00:01:35.610> holding<00:01:35.880> itself<00:01:36.150> differently<00:01:38.689> it's<00:01:39.689> a

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
starts holding itself differently it's a

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.630 
starts holding itself differently it's a
realignment<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.890> guess<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.340> good<00:01:41.490> way<00:01:41.610> to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
realignment I guess it's a good way to

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.210 
realignment I guess it's a good way to
describe<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.380> where<00:01:43.380> my<00:01:43.560> tongue<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.100> my

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
describe it where my tongue is in my

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.190 
describe it where my tongue is in my
mouth<00:01:44.430> if<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.299> hear<00:01:45.509> my<00:01:45.689> voice<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:46.170> a

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
mouth if you can hear my voice is a

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.080 
mouth if you can hear my voice is a
little<00:01:46.290> different<00:01:46.829> from<00:01:47.009> other<00:01:47.310> videos<00:01:47.729> that

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
little different from other videos that

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.929 
little different from other videos that
seems<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.659> going<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.579> don't<00:01:50.579> think<00:01:50.880> I

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
seems to be going on I don't think I

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.780 
seems to be going on I don't think I
have<00:01:51.090> any<00:01:51.240> kind<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.509> sickness<00:01:52.549> my<00:01:53.549> nose

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
have any kind of sickness my nose

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.639 
have any kind of sickness my nose

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
doesn't seem to be running as much which

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.109 
doesn't seem to be running as much which
if<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.890> look<00:01:56.100> at<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.700> watch<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
if you look at that if you watch the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.770 
if you look at that if you watch the
video<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:58.790> grow<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.969> your<00:02:00.090> face<00:02:00.299> which<00:02:00.600> i<00:02:00.719> think

is a weird term I don't know why they

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.190 
is a weird term I don't know why they
got<00:02:02.280> termed<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.299> way<00:02:03.479> he<00:02:03.990> says<00:02:04.170> it

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
got termed it that way he says it

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.999 
got termed it that way he says it
actually<00:02:04.469> will<00:02:04.920> change<00:02:05.189> your<00:02:05.430> bone<00:02:05.640> structure

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
actually will change your bone structure

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.330 
actually will change your bone structure
at<00:02:08.009> least<00:02:08.250> for<00:02:08.429> your<00:02:08.550> draw<00:02:08.819> after<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.629> while<00:02:09.929> I

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
at least for your draw after a while I

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.979 
at least for your draw after a while I
think<00:02:11.340> he<00:02:11.550> said<00:02:11.790> he's<00:02:11.970> had<00:02:12.000> major<00:02:12.480> changes

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
think he said he's had major changes

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.680 
think he said he's had major changes
after<00:02:13.349> said

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
after said

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.660 
after said
years<00:02:14.080> maybe<00:02:14.350> seven<00:02:14.650> years<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.100> he<00:02:15.340> looks<00:02:15.550> a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
years maybe seven years that he looks a

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.170 
years maybe seven years that he looks a
lot<00:02:15.790> different<00:02:16.210> than<00:02:16.240> he<00:02:16.450> did<00:02:16.600> before<00:02:16.830> but<00:02:18.180> if

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
lot different than he did before but if

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.490 
lot different than he did before but if
you<00:02:19.240> want<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.600> teach<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.020> your<00:02:20.290> children

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
you want to teach this to your children

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.340 
you want to teach this to your children
something<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.160> talk<00:02:21.310> about<00:02:21.520> he<00:02:22.420> says<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.780> which

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
something to talk about he says it which

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.170 
something to talk about he says it which
I'm<00:02:23.680> beginning<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:24.070> believe<00:02:24.280> there's<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.910> lot

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
I'm beginning to believe there's a lot

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.210 
I'm beginning to believe there's a lot
of<00:02:25.330> truth<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.660> what<00:02:25.690> he's<00:02:25.930> saying<00:02:26.220> instead
