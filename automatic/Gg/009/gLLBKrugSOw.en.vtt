00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.410
 hi to all with the video that I will show you 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.140
 now let's start the series about the 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.649
 replacing children now I will make you 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.519
 see replace the front flower 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:49.720
 let's start by loosening the nut we have 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:52.059
 in this state for practicality since 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.739
 we can also replace the thread 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:01:11.140
 think of cutting it this way e 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:15.840
 then we go to parade now we go to 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.840
 unscrew the screw of our lever 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.060
 then we take away our network 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.079
 let's take off our lever 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.299
 attention that in this position there is 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.630
 under a thickness and we will have to 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:44.579
 put it back after is a good ara inina 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:49.439
 unthread from Thu here is the thickness 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:53.420
 see that we are going to remove ours 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.420
 lever in this way 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.610
 now we make sure our sheath 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.729
 remain still that does not come out of his 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.729
 seat we begin to extract our thread 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:14.190
 usually before threading the thread 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:18.209
 of fine wool greased in all his 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:24.560
 length and then I go to put I keep 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:30.900
 always stop mine and girdles and proceed 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.970
 tuck into glory to facilitate the 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.760
 outside the site of the wire it is appropriate to toria 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.440
 this stops sheaths and if it is ruined 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:44.090
 we change it and proceed always push 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.090
 from above holding our sheath 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.569
 now let's put ours ours 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.880
 head of the thread in the lever as 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.440
 you can see this is the fixed head 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.389
 we will hardly do just a little bit more 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.579
 put it in but we can do it 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:08.130
 very well otherwise there is a model of 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:12.930
 wire that has a rotating head in this 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:16.849
 way and it facilitates the work we insert the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.849
 our thread this way 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:28.200
 pulling from below we insert ours 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:34.680
 we now put our thickness back 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:39.269
 below in this way it seems we help each other 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.620
 with a central screwdriver forum e 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.620
 let's go and put our life 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.439
 now we are going to tighten the whole having 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.709
 the foresight not to overdo it for 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:01.139
 leave the game on our lever 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.629
 of course thickness screws so in phase 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.419
 of restoration will be replaced and put 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.370
 all new 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:11.099
 to have more register margin at 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.680
 end it is convenient to bring this register 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.000
 just to zero before we loosen this 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.180
 contrada do 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.180
 and then we all live this way 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.430
 even here if it was worn out 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.880
 we can say it very well with a new one 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:40.650
 like this we want to bring to zero 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:44.849
 everything now we put our firm 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:49.800
 sheath that we had removed before we want 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:51.630
 put on the sheath in this way e 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.800
 let's put higuain thread inside 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:59.880
 register and let out now we do 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:09.240
 pass the thread into its clamp in 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:15.000
 this way you see 32 plates in 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:18.300
 this way now to fix everything for 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.120
 record everything we should operate 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.099
 the hand lever and in the meantime I'd do 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.919
 wheel to the wheel until we see that not 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.300
 opposes resistance 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.279
 after which we will go to register at 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.750
 liking with our director now 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:34.930
 let's record the coarse 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.550
 one way so we hold firm with our finger and 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.440
 meanwhile let's pull our own 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.440
 given this way 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:48.640
 now we are going to pull it all we serve 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.980
 well here our little cut of 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.200
 measure and then we're going to put it in 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.120
 this way then we can cut it 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.540
 great here and if we had to register 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.670
 of the braking play of the lever etcetera 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:05.169
 let's act on our register as 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:07.210
 they did see this first 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.669
 video is everything in the next video I will make you 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.830
 see the dismantling of the son of 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.830
 clutch and see you at the next
