00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.889 
functionality slows the tweak down but I
really<00:01:44.189> didn't<00:01:44.460> notice<00:01:44.820> much<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.509> slow<00:01:45.720> down

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
really didn't notice much of a slow down

really didn't notice much of a slow down
at<00:01:46.049> all<00:01:46.140> now<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.350> am<00:01:46.500> running<00:01:46.829> an<00:01:46.950> iphone<00:01:47.340> for

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
at all now I am running an iphone for

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.910 
at all now I am running an iphone for
granted<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.509> didn't<00:01:49.079> notice<00:01:49.320> much<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
granted but I didn't notice much of a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.190 
granted but I didn't notice much of a
slow<00:01:50.130> down<00:01:50.310> at<00:01:50.549> all<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:51.180> something<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.930> note

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
slow down at all just something to note

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.260 
slow down at all just something to note
there<00:01:52.500> now<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.130> paging<00:01:53.700> option<00:01:54.090> is

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
there now this paging option is

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.359 
there now this paging option is
particularly<00:01:54.930> interesting<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.920> allows<00:01:56.159> you

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
particularly interesting it allows you

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.639 
particularly interesting it allows you
basically<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.880> page<00:01:57.149> through<00:01:57.450> apps<00:01:57.659> one<00:01:58.500> by

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
basically to page through apps one by

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.399 
basically to page through apps one by
one<00:01:58.920> vertically<00:01:59.520> I'm<00:02:00.299> not<00:02:00.600> too<00:02:00.840> fond<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.380> i

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
one vertically I'm not too fond of it i

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.469 
one vertically I'm not too fond of it i
like<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.950> smoothness<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.850> scrolling

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
like the smoothness of the scrolling

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.929 
like the smoothness of the scrolling
that<00:02:03.719> comes<00:02:03.990> with<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.560> stock<00:02:04.920> settings<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.729> i

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
that comes with the stock settings so i

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.850 
that comes with the stock settings so i
like<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.329> leave<00:02:06.570> paging<00:02:07.079> off<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.530> i<00:02:07.649> don't

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
like to leave paging off and i don't

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.529 
like to leave paging off and i don't
really<00:02:08.099> recommend<00:02:08.520> using<00:02:08.849> paging<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
really recommend using paging the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.330 
really recommend using paging the
alphabetical<00:02:10.289> sorting<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.800> going<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.160> up

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
alphabetical sorting is going to be up

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.750 
alphabetical sorting is going to be up
to<00:02:11.370> you

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
to you

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.520 
to you
of<00:02:11.849> course<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.420> then<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.599> hidden<00:02:12.780> icons<00:02:12.989> ax

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
of course and then the hidden icons ax

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.039 
of course and then the hidden icons ax
I'd<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.129> have<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.400> enable<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:15.049> suppress

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
I'd like to have that enable to suppress

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.660 
I'd like to have that enable to suppress
those<00:02:16.349> hidden<00:02:16.620> icons<00:02:16.799> they're<00:02:17.220> hidden<00:02:17.400> for<00:02:17.640> a

those hidden icons they're hidden for a

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.520 
those hidden icons they're hidden for a

cool factor of having all your apps at

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.360 
cool factor of having all your apps at
your<00:02:36.450> fingertips<00:02:36.870> with<00:02:37.049> just<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.379> simple<00:02:37.920> swipe

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
your fingertips with just a simple swipe

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.130 
your fingertips with just a simple swipe
but<00:02:38.849> you<00:02:38.940> also<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.269> your<00:02:39.390> music<00:02:39.540> controls

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
which is a nice touch as well and no

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:42.759 
which is a nice touch as well and no
doubt<00:02:42.180> there<00:02:42.390> will<00:02:42.480> be<00:02:42.599> additional

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
doubt there will be additional

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.720 
doubt there will be additional
functionality<00:02:43.769> at<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.099> on<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.579> only

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
functionality at it on this is only

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.270 
functionality at it on this is only
version<00:02:45.000> 1<00:02:45.390> point<00:02:45.629> 0<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.900> Android<00:02:46.230> loader<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:47.040> I

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
version 1 point 0 of Android loader so I
