00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.150
 most of the top synthesizers 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.400
 range as well as arrangers features 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.369
 to vocoder harmonizes hours and even 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.570
 integrated digital recorder 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.700
 allowing you to capture your voice 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.500
 in order to synthesize it to produce a 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.500
 heart or even to record it 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.760
 of course you have your 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.220
 return or amplification 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.170
 internal of your keyboard in monitoring 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.660
 which makes the use of the microphone 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.870
 complex because of the very presence 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.570
 quick of sir larsen in absolute 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.120
 in recording mode it would be ideal 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.170
 own them a microphone 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.380
 electrostatic requiring a 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.700
 phantom power of 48 volts which 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.379
 would allow you to have a very large 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:59.230
 accuracy of problems appear 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.760
 Immediately first few 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.710
 keyboard has power 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.050
 ghosts and the use of a 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.760
 electrostatic microphone and very 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.280
 difficult because of the feedback 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.350
 if there is simultaneous monitoring and 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.900
 capture sounds related to games 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.320
 manipulations in very recording 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.320
 difficult 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.190
 otherwise the use of 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.630
 low-end dynamic microphones do not 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.100
 would not allow to get all the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.950
 desired precision in 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.960
 records there are, however, 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.430
 very large dynamic microphones 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.680
 quality 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.570
 here is our selection of course we 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.560
 take into account that the real big ones 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.560
 microphone brands 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:50.210
 audio technica had 6106 neither 1945 and 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.500
 shourd beta 58 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.830
 they are all very directive 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.970
 robust and insensitive 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.830
 feedback their grain of directivity is going 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.450
 allow a capture of the path that 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.470
 will be much less polluted by 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.869
 surrounding noises well plus the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.619
 Directivity is tight plus nuisance 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.619
 have moved away 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.390
 the frequency curve is also a 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.329
 parameter to take into account 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.400
 you must not be too much 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.290
 draconian on this point because a very 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.269
 wide frequency curve is not 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.310
 always desirable 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:34.189
 so a female voice that has no 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.840
 serious will take no advantage of microphones 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.750
 that would come down too well at 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.459
 opposite 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.329
 here are the curves of the three microphones that 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.329
 we selected 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.360
 we often take into consideration their 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.150
 strong momentum by calling them 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.010
 pickups that has peach or potato 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.340
 on the way what horror of talking 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.260
 so from a microphone do not forget that 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.150
 the main quest that one must have 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.750
 with a microphone and transmit 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.080
 the emotion intact and seek the 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.750
 greater transparency - will bring 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.739
 changes to prison more 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.739
 great will be the quality 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.769
 an important point to consider 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.200
 and the behavior of the microphone 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.599
 hop hop if it's true that in the language 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.440
 english this problem does not exist in 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.379
 Latin languages 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.390
 he is particularly present in 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.790
 reality we should not attribute this 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.580
 microphone defect but to the singer to 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.330
 the ping bed should be mastered but 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.330
 this is not often the case 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.480
 the beta 58 will be appreciated by a 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.570
 technician his because he's very well known and 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.540
 very used one can say of him that he 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.390
 is referent in sound system to friends 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.580
 not its accents but let us in 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:08.050
 sung more pleasant and more 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:12.090
 joyful joy beautiful sparks divine life 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.770
 of the assembly of the gods 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.800
 a bump of 3 db in the mediums of the 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.140
 donor at 7am patata but at the expense of 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.660
 intelligibility it is extremely 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.290
 solid but for me it's not 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.290
 a fundamental quality 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.389
 the 945 is a nice end microphone and 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.610
 excellent bill 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.979
 however, there is a lack of transparency in 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.919
 the mediums because its high is exaggerated and 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.990
 unnatural to friends not its accents 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.860
 but let us sing more 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:53.030
 nice and more joyful joy beautiful 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:55.330
 divine spark life of the assembly of 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.330
 gods 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.000
 our favorite and the 6100 because it has a 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.060
 beautiful presence a great clarity on the 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.230
 tracks without aggressiveness nor shine nor 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.570
 accentuation of serious 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.210
 in addition he has a very good 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.880
 feedback resistance and has a 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.490
 built-in anti pop that protects very 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.550
 effectively ziv pins and noises 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.770
 of manipulation to friends not of his 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.900
 accents but let us in singing of 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:34.330
 more pleasant and more joyful joy 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:37.820
 beautiful spark divine daughter of 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.590
 the assembly of the gods 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.750
 this microphone is guaranteed for life 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.700
 anyway these are three stars 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.860
 of the microfauna i that will suit 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.550
 perfectly to an application on a 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.550
 keyboard a player
