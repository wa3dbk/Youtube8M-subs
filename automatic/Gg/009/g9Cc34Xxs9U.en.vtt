00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:01.899
 hi Guys 

00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:05.849
 Jade Zetsche's and best video made for six uses and it will 

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:08.849
 new zone to be continued 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.199
 it just did not cost even 30 minutes 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.470
 WehrschÃ¼tz just show briefly what the 18 that is a train 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.880
 or bring in ions 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.699
 after thumb this chamber 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.640
 you will surely be dressed up in these and that bit better the Coba 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.910
 Lungs of this plant and soil under the soil makes and this better 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.760
 hidden and also a bit nicer 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.860
 but this was going to pump his house Brazzo in front of the door 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.780
 and the fidelity of it can not seem hard to do it though I am looking for though 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.179
 Percent Gero Jentzsch failure because Schaeffler 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.769
 as well as getting rid of loses interest more and more interesting 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:48.790
 I know how it works 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:49.999
 but to 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.910
 I am not sure if it would develop normally 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.820
 one goes now presses the button also not on board 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.920
 So what are they? 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.380
 now her first step 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.500
 and moves to the button the button activates directly 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.150
 around the slopes here which is pressed where 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.120
 and about these about these gave here 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.590
 when then this push for the best goals activates the one 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.980
 to push on the mermaid slopes and that would be high again by the 8 and it 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.130
 everything goes one after another because of these last members 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.760
 First of all, they are complicated to explain, and then they are all about Rome 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.850
 Certificates is rebuilt 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.850
 so a bit complicated biceps more so through 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.290
 and I can just give it a try 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.290
 Return the button and then it starts 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.470
 you can see 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.010
 we are looking for 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.070
 comes as a problem is maybe he is a wheel 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.140
 the whole here is still in the net No 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.850
 on Ibiza the idea when activated and it does it to the front 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.070
 and that every Kulterer normal front because the track otherwise too short 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.700
 I decided on the next best but when they retire 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.159
 retreats but it stays full Sisson stick the slopes 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.919
 I do not know why Prem 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.709
 I do not know why that is 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.359
 not retreating to the other slope here 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.370
 Weingarten then you have to declare Zollondz user rights 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.899
 Active 3 is worth putting 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:24.289
 and make new ones 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:27.289
 he reignited 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.479
 Quarter Madrid 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:39.369
 Brummel were so nice if she still wants to show all this 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:41.669
 cabling 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:44.669
 At &amp; s on average taken time 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.639
 DAPD 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.549
 I thank him for shuddering if you have any questions about it 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.879
 to go into too much detail because 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.789
 yes that's pretty complicated to explain 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.629
 Bertoni comments from and until next time
