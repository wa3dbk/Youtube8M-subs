00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
very early even if he's pulling some

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.789 
very early even if he's pulling some
random<00:02:47.819> crap<00:02:48.030> he's<00:02:48.209> still<00:02:48.450> Scouts<00:02:48.720> early<00:02:49.170> so

here he is scouting now though and we're
not<00:02:55.920> seeing<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.370> singularity<00:02:56.849> upgrader<00:02:57.329> or

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
not seeing a singularity upgrader or

not seeing a singularity upgrader or
anything<00:02:57.840> like<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:57.989> so<00:02:58.170> he<00:02:58.980> prolly<00:02:59.159> is

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340

have<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:01.859> see<00:03:01.950> though<00:03:02.190> mind<00:03:02.959> maybe<00:03:03.959> he<00:03:04.109> I<00:03:04.260> mean

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
have to see though mind maybe he I mean

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.190 
have to see though mind maybe he I mean
he<00:03:04.470> might<00:03:04.709> figure<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.370> mind<00:03:05.670> as<00:03:06.000> a

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
he might figure that mind as a

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.390 
he might figure that mind as a
conservative<00:03:07.200> player<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:07.680> not<00:03:07.709> going<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.280> be

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
conservative player is not going to be

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.610 
conservative player is not going to be
going<00:03:08.670> for<00:03:08.940> like<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.209> rush<00:03:09.629> or<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.989> bio<00:03:10.230> build<00:03:10.500> or

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
going for like a rush or a bio build or

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.809 
going for like a rush or a bio build or
anything<00:03:10.859> like<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.010> actually<00:03:11.730> is

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
anything like that actually is

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.420 
anything like that actually is
researching<00:03:12.180> something<00:03:12.569> now<00:03:12.780> at<00:03:13.019> is<00:03:13.230> a

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
researching something now at is a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.900 
researching something now at is a
cybernetics<00:03:14.430> core<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:15.290> he<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:17.700> might

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
cybernetics core so he you might

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.699 
cybernetics core so he you might
actually<00:03:18.150> be<00:03:18.419> doing<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.810> so<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.440> he<00:03:19.530> can

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
actually be doing that so that he can

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.500 
actually be doing that so that he can
have<00:03:19.889> a<00:03:19.919> couple<00:03:20.250> goons<00:03:20.459> out<00:03:20.639> to<00:03:20.910> hold<00:03:21.060> off<00:03:21.269> an

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
have a couple goons out to hold off an

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.509 
have a couple goons out to hold off an
early<00:03:21.750> push<00:03:21.959> because<00:03:22.709> if<00:03:22.919> you<00:03:23.040> are<00:03:23.160> doing<00:03:23.310> some

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
early push because if you are doing some

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.920 
early push because if you are doing some
kind<00:03:23.639> of<00:03:23.700> brush<00:03:23.910> like<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.389> is<00:03:24.720> difficult

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
kind of brush like that it is difficult

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.920 
kind of brush like that it is difficult
to<00:03:25.730> hold<00:03:26.730> off<00:03:26.910> kind<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.209> an<00:03:27.329> early<00:03:27.480> push<00:03:27.660> but<00:03:27.840> if

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
to hold off kind of an early push but if

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.270 
to hold off kind of an early push but if
you<00:03:27.989> have<00:03:28.079> that<00:03:28.200> range<00:03:28.500> upgrade<00:03:28.919> it'll<00:03:29.160> make

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
you have that range upgrade it'll make

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.789 
you have that range upgrade it'll make
it<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.489> lot<00:03:29.519> easier<00:03:29.669> to<00:03:30.329> deal<00:03:31.319> with<00:03:31.349> Marines<00:03:31.650> I

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
it a lot easier to deal with Marines I

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.400 
it a lot easier to deal with Marines I
mean<00:03:31.919> like<00:03:32.069> a<00:03:32.340> couple<00:03:33.030> goons<00:03:33.840> with<00:03:34.139> range

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
mean like a couple goons with range

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.539 
mean like a couple goons with range
upgrade<00:03:34.769> will<00:03:34.919> be<00:03:35.040> able<00:03:35.099> to<00:03:35.220> deal<00:03:35.430> with

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
upgrade will be able to deal with

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.759 
upgrade will be able to deal with
Marines<00:03:35.819> very<00:03:36.060> easily<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:36.650> vulture<00:03:37.650> is

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
Marines very easily and vulture is

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.890

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
sorry just did find me so he's probably

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.860 
sorry just did find me so he's probably
gonna<00:03:56.069> head<00:03:56.220> out<00:03:56.400> that<00:03:57.120> direction<00:03:57.419> with<00:03:57.750> this

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
gonna head out that direction with this

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.039 
gonna head out that direction with this
little<00:03:58.109> force<00:03:58.410> there<00:03:59.629> yeah<00:04:00.629> looks<00:04:00.810> like<00:04:00.870> he's

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
little force there yeah looks like he's

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.300 
little force there yeah looks like he's
going<00:04:01.139> to<00:04:01.199> say<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.799> looks<00:04:01.949> like<00:04:02.069> he's<00:04:02.190> pulling

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
going to say it looks like he's pulling

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.830 
going to say it looks like he's pulling
those<00:04:02.489> Marines<00:04:02.790> back<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.299> protect<00:04:03.750> the

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
those Marines back to protect the

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.939 
those Marines back to protect the
secondary<00:04:04.199> I<00:04:04.260> think<00:04:04.410> what<00:04:04.530> he's<00:04:04.650> going<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:04.799> do

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
secondary I think what he's going to do

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.039 
secondary I think what he's going to do
is<00:04:05.069> just<00:04:05.099> that<00:04:05.400> standard<00:04:05.910> he's<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.810> very

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
is just that standard he's a very

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.059 
is just that standard he's a very
conservative<00:04:07.290> player<00:04:07.620> he's<00:04:07.739> probably<00:04:07.889> just

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
conservative player he's probably just

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.920 
conservative player he's probably just
going<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.310> go<00:04:08.430> directly<00:04:09.299> into<00:04:09.359> siege<00:04:09.660> stuck

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
going to go directly into siege stuck

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.839 
going to go directly into siege stuck
near<00:04:10.169> that<00:04:10.319> standard<00:04:10.739> really<00:04:11.069> fast<00:04:11.370> expand

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
near that standard really fast expand

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.589 
near that standard really fast expand
and<00:04:12.419> then<00:04:12.660> basically<00:04:13.440> go<00:04:13.980> from<00:04:14.190> there<00:04:14.599> even

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
and then basically go from there even

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.000 
and then basically go from there even
the<00:04:15.720> even<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.349> conservative<00:04:17.039> players<00:04:17.280> do<00:04:17.870> you

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
the even the conservative players do you

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.270 
the even the conservative players do you
go<00:04:20.010> for<00:04:20.310> early<00:04:21.180> pushes<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:21.570> mean<00:04:21.719> it's<00:04:22.500> so

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
go for early pushes I mean it's so

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.950 
go for early pushes I mean it's so
conservative<00:04:23.790> to<00:04:23.910> kind<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.090> put<00:04:24.270> pressure<00:04:24.600> on

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
conservative to kind of put pressure on

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.390 
conservative to kind of put pressure on
your<00:04:24.990> opponent<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:25.590> mean<00:04:25.710> that's<00:04:25.800> what's<00:04:26.280> kind

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
your opponent I mean that's what's kind

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.980 
your opponent I mean that's what's kind
of<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.580> normal<00:04:26.760> thing<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:26.940> do<00:04:27.060> but<00:04:27.180> yeah<00:04:27.360> he<00:04:27.810> is

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
of a normal thing to do but yeah he is

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.930 
of a normal thing to do but yeah he is
blocking<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:29.040> ramp<00:04:29.280> for<00:04:29.460> some<00:04:29.639> reason<00:04:29.880> I

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
blocking that ramp for some reason I

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.550 
blocking that ramp for some reason I
guess<00:04:30.090> until<00:04:30.720> he<00:04:30.840> get<00:04:30.960> ya<00:04:31.110> he's<00:04:31.290> going<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.500> get

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
guess until he get ya he's going to get

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.560 
guess until he get ya he's going to get
a<00:04:31.620> command<00:04:31.919> center<00:04:32.010> up<00:04:32.250> above<00:04:32.490> that<00:04:32.639> ramp<00:04:32.910> neat

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
a command center up above that ramp neat

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.879 
a command center up above that ramp neat

upgrade so beast is going to be able to

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.980 
upgrade so beast is going to be able to
hunt<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.800> down<00:04:37.830> very<00:04:38.669> relatively<00:04:39.389> quickly<00:04:39.660> and

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
hunt it down very relatively quickly and

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.750 
hunt it down very relatively quickly and

facility<00:04:43.500> after<00:04:43.889> all<00:04:44.190> so<00:04:45.020> maybe<00:04:46.020> he<00:04:46.290> wanted<00:04:46.590> to

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
facility after all so maybe he wanted to

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.909 
facility after all so maybe he wanted to
get<00:04:46.889> a<00:04:47.130> quick<00:04:47.610> river<00:04:47.970> drop<00:04:48.300> out<00:04:48.540> before<00:04:49.139> mine

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
get a quick river drop out before mine

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.730 
get a quick river drop out before mine
had<00:04:50.190> a<00:04:50.250> chance<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.730> get<00:04:50.880> really<00:04:51.570> his<00:04:52.260> forces

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
hard time of it because he's put down no

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.600 
hard time of it because he's put down no
he's<00:04:57.300> going<00:04:57.510> for<00:04:57.630> observatory<00:04:58.230> also<00:04:58.560> so<00:04:59.160> maybe

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
he's going for observatory also so maybe

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.210 
he's going for observatory also so maybe
I'm<00:05:00.110> it's<00:05:01.110> kind<00:05:01.290> of<00:05:01.320> weird<00:05:01.560> he's<00:05:01.890> kind<00:05:02.160> of

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
I'm it's kind of weird he's kind of

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.710 
I'm it's kind of weird he's kind of
switched<00:05:02.460> over<00:05:02.790> he<00:05:02.880> went<00:05:03.000> very<00:05:03.240> very<00:05:03.330> quick

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
switched over he went very very quick

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.020 
switched over he went very very quick
tech<00:05:03.930> and<00:05:04.169> now<00:05:05.040> he's<00:05:05.190> switched<00:05:05.430> over<00:05:05.700> and<00:05:05.820> have

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
tech and now he's switched over and have

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.840 
tech and now he's switched over and have
a<00:05:06.060> normal<00:05:06.360> build<00:05:07.310> maybe<00:05:08.310> just<00:05:08.400> want<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:08.669> get<00:05:08.730> an

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
a normal build maybe just want to get an

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.730 
a normal build maybe just want to get an
early<00:05:08.940> start<00:05:09.120> on<00:05:09.480> it<00:05:09.540> get<00:05:10.200> observers<00:05:10.590> out

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
early start on it get observers out

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.770 
early start on it get observers out
quickly<00:05:11.160> quicker<00:05:11.700> in<00:05:11.940> case<00:05:12.090> mine<00:05:12.330> was<00:05:12.540> getting

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
quickly quicker in case mine was getting

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.560 
quickly quicker in case mine was getting
mines<00:05:12.990> out<00:05:13.200> quicker<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:13.970> mind<00:05:14.970> is<00:05:15.090> gonna<00:05:15.270> hold

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
mines out quicker and mind is gonna hold

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.930 
mines out quicker and mind is gonna hold
that<00:05:15.660> easy<00:05:16.110> I<00:05:16.440> think<00:05:17.250> what<00:05:17.340> happened<00:05:17.580> is<00:05:17.640> he

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
that easy I think what happened is he

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.400 
that easy I think what happened is he
did<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.360> standard<00:05:18.660> abusive<00:05:18.930> build<00:05:19.080> is<00:05:19.200> going

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
did the standard abusive build is going

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.810 
did the standard abusive build is going
those<00:05:19.590> early<00:05:19.830> observers<00:05:19.979> I<00:05:20.340> think<00:05:20.520> he<00:05:20.669> might

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
those early observers I think he might

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.159 
those early observers I think he might
have<00:05:20.880> been<00:05:21.180> predicting<00:05:21.810> that<00:05:21.870> mine<00:05:22.050> was

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
have been predicting that mine was

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.900 
have been predicting that mine was
skipping<00:05:22.560> it<00:05:22.650> and<00:05:23.220> as<00:05:23.310> soon<00:05:23.430> as<00:05:23.550> you<00:05:23.639> saw<00:05:23.790> that

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
skipping it and as soon as you saw that

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.240 
skipping it and as soon as you saw that
first<00:05:24.150> vulture<00:05:24.540> out<00:05:24.690> he<00:05:25.290> reacted<00:05:25.770> media<00:05:26.070> looks

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
first vulture out he reacted media looks

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.190 
first vulture out he reacted media looks
like<00:05:26.370> he's<00:05:26.520> going<00:05:26.790> for<00:05:26.970> a<00:05:27.030> second<00:05:27.930> expansion

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
like he's going for a second expansion

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.380 
like he's going for a second expansion
so<00:05:28.950> maybe<00:05:29.100> thinking<00:05:29.460> about<00:05:29.550> carriers<00:05:30.150> here

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
so maybe thinking about carriers here

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.150 
so maybe thinking about carriers here
because<00:05:30.990> carriers<00:05:31.380> are<00:05:31.530> very<00:05:31.740> strong<00:05:31.950> in<00:05:32.010> this

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
because carriers are very strong in this

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.320 
because carriers are very strong in this
map<00:05:32.370> I<00:05:32.520> think<00:05:32.729> he<00:05:32.790> might<00:05:32.910> be<00:05:33.030> thinking<00:05:33.060> about

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
map I think he might be thinking about

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.969 
map I think he might be thinking about
that<00:05:33.419> match<00:05:33.810> he<00:05:34.020> had<00:05:34.169> against<00:05:34.350> equation<00:05:34.800> where

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
that match he had against equation where

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.950 
that match he had against equation where
he<00:05:35.100> almost<00:05:35.340> got<00:05:35.460> bowled<00:05:35.729> over<00:05:35.880> by<00:05:36.240> a<00:05:36.570> Terran

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
he almost got bowled over by a Terran

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.640 
he almost got bowled over by a Terran
with<00:05:37.410> kind<00:05:37.680> of<00:05:37.710> that<00:05:37.890> really<00:05:38.040> expanded

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
with kind of that really expanded

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.520 
with kind of that really expanded
anything<00:05:40.650> of<00:05:40.770> yours<00:05:41.310> yet<00:05:41.820> I<00:05:42.150> mean<00:05:42.510> this<00:05:43.320> is

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
anything of yours yet I mean this is

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.170 
anything of yours yet I mean this is
pretty<00:05:43.560> early<00:05:44.190> yet<00:05:44.430> he's<00:05:44.669> prob<00:05:45.000> about

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
pretty early yet he's prob about

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.400 
pretty early yet he's prob about
thinking<00:05:45.390> about<00:05:45.450> carriers<00:05:45.930> at<00:05:46.080> this<00:05:46.229> moment

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
thinking about carriers at this moment

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.469 
thinking about carriers at this moment
it<00:05:47.010> just<00:05:47.190> wants<00:05:47.280> to<00:05:47.460> keep<00:05:47.610> it<00:05:47.760> in<00:05:47.850> even

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
it just wants to keep it in even

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.990 
it just wants to keep it in even
economically<00:05:49.140> because<00:05:49.380> he<00:05:49.590> bets<00:05:50.130> that<00:05:50.250> mind

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
economically because he bets that mind

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.510 
economically because he bets that mind
is<00:05:51.150> getting<00:05:51.510> that<00:05:51.600> command<00:05:51.900> center<00:05:52.520> yeah

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
is getting that command center yeah

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.130 
is getting that command center yeah
early<00:05:53.850> saying<00:05:54.150> there's<00:05:54.539> the<00:05:54.660> first<00:05:54.780> observer

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
early saying there's the first observer

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.180 
early saying there's the first observer
coming<00:05:55.440> down<00:05:55.560> that's<00:05:55.770> going<00:05:55.890> to<00:05:55.950> be<00:05:56.039> hard

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
coming down that's going to be hard

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.380 
coming down that's going to be hard
because<00:05:56.460> really<00:05:56.700> if<00:05:56.789> you're<00:05:56.880> going<00:05:56.970> to<00:05:57.030> be<00:05:57.150> PC

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
because really if you're going to be PC

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.050 
because really if you're going to be PC
you<00:05:57.570> have<00:05:57.750> to<00:05:57.870> deny<00:05:57.990> the<00:05:58.169> scout<00:05:58.530> and<00:05:58.950> yeah<00:05:59.910> it

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
you have to deny the scout and yeah it

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.670 
you have to deny the scout and yeah it
doesn't<00:06:00.210> look<00:06:00.360> like<00:06:00.450> there's<00:06:01.320> and<00:06:01.440> he's<00:06:01.530> got

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
doesn't look like there's and he's got

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.820 
doesn't look like there's and he's got
nothing<00:06:02.039> against<00:06:02.370> that<00:06:02.490> observer<00:06:02.820> yeah<00:06:03.830> he

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
nothing against that observer yeah he

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.180 
nothing against that observer yeah he
doesn't<00:06:05.039> have<00:06:05.130> any<00:06:05.280> detection<00:06:05.550> right<00:06:05.820> now

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
doesn't have any detection right now

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.130 
doesn't have any detection right now
which<00:06:08.190> could<00:06:08.400> be<00:06:08.490> bad<00:06:08.520> for<00:06:08.940> him<00:06:09.030> he's<00:06:09.870> getting

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
which could be bad for him he's getting

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.260 
which could be bad for him he's getting
that<00:06:10.169> engineering<00:06:10.650> Bay<00:06:10.770> up<00:06:10.890> but<00:06:11.160> we<00:06:11.700> tied<00:06:11.940> it

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
that engineering Bay up but we tied it

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.570 
that engineering Bay up but we tied it
looks<00:06:12.780> like<00:06:12.960> he<00:06:13.500> might<00:06:13.710> have<00:06:13.919> some<00:06:14.130> turrets<00:06:14.430> up

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
looks like he might have some turrets up

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.850 
looks like he might have some turrets up
just<00:06:15.240> in<00:06:15.450> time<00:06:15.479> yeah<00:06:16.350> he's<00:06:16.500> friggin<00:06:16.650> have

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
just in time yeah he's friggin have

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.350 
just in time yeah he's friggin have
turrets<00:06:17.130> up<00:06:17.250> in<00:06:17.370> time<00:06:17.520> to<00:06:17.550> deal<00:06:17.820> with<00:06:18.000> Reavers

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
turrets up in time to deal with Reavers

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.120 
turrets up in time to deal with Reavers
actually<00:06:18.780> so<00:06:19.200> then<00:06:19.530> it's<00:06:19.680> going<00:06:19.800> to<00:06:19.860> come<00:06:20.070> down

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
actually so then it's going to come down

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
actually so then it's going to come down
to<00:06:21.680> basically<00:06:22.680> his<00:06:22.890> ability<00:06:23.280> to<00:06:23.490> place<00:06:23.880> his

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
to basically his ability to place his

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.840 
to basically his ability to place his
turrets<00:06:24.479> and<00:06:24.690> place<00:06:25.020> his<00:06:25.260> tanks<00:06:25.620> to<00:06:25.800> do<00:06:26.669> with

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
turrets and place his tanks to do with

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.430 
turrets and place his tanks to do with
the<00:06:26.970> river<00:06:27.210> drop<00:06:27.390> because<00:06:27.539> basically

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
the river drop because basically

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.960 
the river drop because basically
obviously<00:06:29.010> if<00:06:29.130> you<00:06:29.280> fight<00:06:29.520> if<00:06:29.640> you<00:06:29.760> leave<00:06:29.940> a

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
obviously if you fight if you leave a

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.810 
obviously if you fight if you leave a
hole<00:06:30.240> in<00:06:30.840> your<00:06:31.260> defense<00:06:31.620> be<00:06:32.010> soo<00:06:32.250> will<00:06:32.520> drop<00:06:32.789> a

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
hole in your defense be soo will drop a

at that Island expansion mine is going
to<00:06:43.749> scout<00:06:43.989> it<00:06:44.019> but<00:06:44.259> it<00:06:44.349> is<00:06:44.439> going<00:06:44.559> to<00:06:44.649> be

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:44.679 
to scout it but it is going to be

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:46.949 
to scout it but it is going to be

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:46.959 
difficult for him to do anything about

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:51.509 
difficult for him to do anything about
it<00:06:48.779> since<00:06:49.779> he's<00:06:50.080> he's<00:06:50.409> not<00:06:50.800> getting<00:06:51.099> dropships
