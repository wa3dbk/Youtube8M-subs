00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
probably wear this with like a white

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.550 
probably wear this with like a white
tank<00:04:00.330> underneath<00:04:00.660> or<00:04:00.900> something<00:04:01.140> very<00:04:01.290> simple

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
tank underneath or something very simple

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.360 
tank underneath or something very simple
to<00:04:02.010> match<00:04:02.880> or<00:04:03.390> balance<00:04:04.200> out<00:04:04.350> I<00:04:04.410> should<00:04:04.740> say<00:04:04.980> the

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
to match or balance out I should say the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.660 
to match or balance out I should say the
boldness<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.240> this<00:04:06.390> pattern<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.370> so<00:04:08.370> here<00:04:08.610> it

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
boldness of this pattern and so here it

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.820 
boldness of this pattern and so here it
is<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:09.030> then<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.300> collar<00:04:10.050> once<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.530> pop<00:04:10.709> it

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
is and then the collar once you pop it

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.930 
is and then the collar once you pop it
over<00:04:10.950> it's<00:04:11.160> like<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.340> blush<00:04:12.350> nude<00:04:13.350> color<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:14.370> so

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
over it's like a blush nude color and so

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.910 
over it's like a blush nude color and so
it<00:04:15.060> just<00:04:15.180> comes<00:04:15.330> apart<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.990> saw<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:16.770> comes

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
it just comes apart I saw it comes

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.560 
it just comes apart I saw it comes
together<00:04:17.100> like<00:04:17.370> this

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
together like this

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.690 
together like this
so<00:04:19.570> it<00:04:19.900> very<00:04:20.230> much<00:04:20.350> reminded<00:04:20.890> me<00:04:20.980> of<00:04:21.010> retro

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
so it very much reminded me of retro

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.090 
so it very much reminded me of retro
like<00:04:21.940> 60s<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:22.870> actually<00:04:23.560> pointed<00:04:23.860> that<00:04:23.950> out

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
like 60s and actually pointed that out

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.710
