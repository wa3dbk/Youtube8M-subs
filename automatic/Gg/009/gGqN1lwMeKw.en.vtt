00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.980 

a<00:03:57.660> little<00:03:58.230> bit<00:03:58.350> here<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.860> did<00:03:59.580> not<00:03:59.610> mess<00:04:00.600> up<00:04:00.630> the

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
a little bit here I did not mess up the

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.050 
a little bit here I did not mess up the
intake<00:04:01.380> manifold<00:04:01.860> gasket<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:02.520> what<00:04:02.970> I'll

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
intake manifold gasket so what I'll

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.610 
intake manifold gasket so what I'll
probably<00:04:03.210> do<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.690> just<00:04:03.720> spray<00:04:04.110> a<00:04:04.140> little<00:04:04.380> bit

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
probably do is just spray a little bit

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.760 
probably do is just spray a little bit
of<00:04:04.740> that<00:04:04.830> copper<00:04:05.400> spray<00:04:06.330> on<00:04:06.600> here<00:04:06.960> bolt<00:04:07.590> it

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
of that copper spray on here bolt it

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.820 
of that copper spray on here bolt it
back<00:04:07.800> up<00:04:09.170> we<00:04:10.170> still<00:04:10.410> got<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:12.170> good<00:04:13.170> gasket<00:04:13.650> for

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
back up we still got a good gasket for

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.449 
back up we still got a good gasket for
the<00:04:14.030> exhaust<00:04:15.030> manifold<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:16.280> want<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.340> make

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
the exhaust manifold you want to make

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.740 
the exhaust manifold you want to make
sure<00:04:17.670> that<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.940> plug<00:04:18.180> everything<00:04:18.420> back<00:04:18.720> up

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
sure that you plug everything back up

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.660 
sure that you plug everything back up
you<00:04:19.140> got<00:04:19.320> your<00:04:19.350> little<00:04:19.620> two<00:04:20.040> sensors<00:04:20.489> over

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
you got your little two sensors over

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.390 
you got your little two sensors over
here<00:04:21.830> your<00:04:22.830> distributor<00:04:23.510> connector<00:04:24.510> here

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
here your distributor connector here

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.010 
here your distributor connector here
your<00:04:26.400> holes<00:04:26.790> that<00:04:27.120> goes<00:04:27.300> on<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.660> back<00:04:27.840> of

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
your holes that goes on the back of

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.990 
your holes that goes on the back of
there<00:04:30.920> that's<00:04:31.920> pretty<00:04:32.190> much<00:04:32.310> everything<00:04:32.550> now

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
there that's pretty much everything now

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.610 
there that's pretty much everything now
it's<00:04:33.150> on<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.420> if<00:04:33.450> you<00:04:33.690> want<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:34.500> know

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
it's on you if you want to you know

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.230 
it's on you if you want to you know
reconnect<00:04:34.950> everything<00:04:35.280> under<00:04:35.820> it<00:04:35.850> like<00:04:35.970> the

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
reconnect everything under it like the

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.820 
reconnect everything under it like the
mount<00:04:36.480> for<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:39.500> exhaust<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:40.770> the

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
mount for the the exhaust and the

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.960 
mount for the the exhaust and the
manifold<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.280> all<00:04:41.400> that<00:04:41.580> if<00:04:41.730> you<00:04:41.820> got<00:04:41.910> a

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
manifold and all that if you got a

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.610 
manifold and all that if you got a
aftermarket<00:04:42.600> is<00:04:42.720> also<00:04:42.960> more<00:04:43.080> likely<00:04:43.500> you

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
aftermarket is also more likely you

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.400 
aftermarket is also more likely you
don't<00:04:43.800> have<00:04:43.950> it<00:04:44.070> on<00:04:44.190> there<00:04:44.340> anyway<00:04:45.020> it's<00:04:46.020> up<00:04:46.290> to

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
don't have it on there anyway it's up to

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.930 
don't have it on there anyway it's up to
you<00:04:46.530> it's<00:04:46.740> not<00:04:46.860> really<00:04:47.160> going<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.370> hurt<00:04:47.520> it<00:04:47.730> I

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
you it's not really going to hurt it I

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.640 
you it's not really going to hurt it I
would<00:04:48.360> recommend<00:04:48.810> just<00:04:48.960> going<00:04:49.110> under<00:04:49.440> there

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
would recommend just going under there

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.140 
would recommend just going under there
spending<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.370> extra<00:04:50.520> like<00:04:50.820> three<00:04:51.000> or<00:04:51.120> four

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
spending the extra like three or four

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.810 
spending the extra like three or four
minutes<00:04:51.540> to<00:04:51.630> bolt<00:04:51.840> everything<00:04:52.200> back<00:04:52.380> up<00:04:52.820> once

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
minutes to bolt everything back up once

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.030 
minutes to bolt everything back up once
you<00:04:53.940> do<00:04:54.060> that<00:04:54.090> put<00:04:54.420> your<00:04:54.510> plug<00:04:54.780> wires<00:04:54.990> in<00:04:55.260> watch

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
you do that put your plug wires in watch

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.860 
you do that put your plug wires in watch
the<00:04:56.250> video<00:04:56.490> in<00:04:56.580> Reverse<00:04:56.790> if<00:04:57.180> you<00:04:57.300> want<00:04:57.480> to<00:04:57.660> and
