00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.870
 Welcome once again to life- 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.390
 paranormal and a very special greeting to 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.450
 all group members records 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.180
 x prohibited area 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.240
 in today's video we will clarify some 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.330
 issues about the supposed asteroid 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.790
 dangerous that approaches the earth this 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.790
 January 26 , 2015 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.590
 this last week has spread a 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.380
 news in a massive way it's about the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.530
 news that an asteroid will approach 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.590
 to the earth this January 26 all the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.570
 media that have spread this news 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.900
 ensures that it is highly dangerous 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.930
 but this is true 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.930
 the news was mainly broadcast 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.390
 by the Russian media since it was this 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.750
 Russian space agency that 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.820
 spread the news in first stay 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.670
 this made many people believe 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.160
 that NASA was not aware or that 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.480
 I was lying about this body 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:28.860
 celestial thing that is false 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:32.790
 the asteroid called 2004 bl 86 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.670
 will go to 12 million kilometers of 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.120
 diameter of our planet the diameter 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.420
 of the celestial body is from 400 to 1000 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.210
 meters and they say it will be visible from the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.660
 Northern Hemisphere but how dangerous 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.690
 is actually all the means have 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.540
 cited the news as something urgent what 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.450
 that has spread like something massive and 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.330
 people are starting to be alarmist 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.370
 with this matter it is clear that the 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.520
 scientists have very little information 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.130
 on this asteroid or at least so 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.710
 they make it known by starting with the simple 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.200
 fact that they do not know their real diameter 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.020
 in addition to that the distance to which 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.630
 it will pass is distant compared to others 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.510
 asteroids and celestial bodies that have 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.970
 gone really close to the earth and not 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.220
 They have had repercussions not 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.220
 include violent against the planet 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.500
 next I will quote a couple of bodies 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.170
 celestial that have really happened close 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.050
 of the land in the records of the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.260
 history and there's information of bodies 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.540
 celestial asteroids and meteorites that 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.680
 have really happened near the earth 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:55.170
 and that they have not represented any danger 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:58.569
 on March 22, 1989 the asteroid 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.470
 Asklepios with a diameter of 300 meters 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:05.500
 approached 0 7 million kilometers to 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:10.380
 Earth the asteroid of January 26 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.380
 will pass to the double distance of this one 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:21.470
 On March 18 of the year 2004, a 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:24.100
 asteroid called 2004 fh to only 42 thousand 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.680
 600 kilometers away from the earth 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.380
 with a diameter of 30 meters was 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.080
 cataloged as potentially dangerous 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.540
 but nothing happened 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.290
 comparing these distances with the 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.360
 January 26 presents no danger 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.970
 real 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.210
 after these two events that I just 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.660
 mention there are others who had a 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.970
 approach really dangerous and the 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.110
 distances were really close 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.410
 compared with January 26 as well 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.390
 scientific studies claim that 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.990
 asteroids with a diameter between 30 and 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.840
 100 meters pass at a distance of 40 to 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.530
 50 thousand kilometers from the earth every year 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.050
 a close distance and that represents 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.470
 in a certain way a danger although the 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.209
 January 26 is far from being something 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.240
 potentially dangerous 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.090
 so from paranormal life we ​​put in 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.389
 doubt the dangerousness of the asteroid of 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.669
 January 26 and we call on all 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.630
 the community especially to those who 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:39.180
 they spread the mystery to do it 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.520
 misinformation with this event and try 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.610
 to explain to all the people that what 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.710
 follow that this asteroid actually 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.979
 does not represent any danger to the 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:53.610
 earth and that alarming the people of that 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:56.699
 this is not something healthy normally 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:00.449
 end with conspiracy theories and 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:03.030
 with people really scared from life 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:06.300
 paranormal we want to avoid this and the 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.340
 we invite you to keep an eye on
