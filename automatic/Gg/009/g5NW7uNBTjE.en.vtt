 I dream of being a soccer player but 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.390
 I really do not think I had much talent 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.200
 Anyway, my friend, you have a 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.049
 there is something new in the city, and after 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.210
 class Let's see what it is I was and it was 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.450
 a music band rehearsal and I have 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.659
 around the age of 13, 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.820
 So we always record the first cd in 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.860
 2011 is not in 2000 and 2010 2010 calls 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.740
 beginning always tell me how 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.649
 what was in this project 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:07.200
 on the first disc is the name says it all is 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:10.310
 The beginning of an is when you do not have 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.830
 nothing to prove and taiba 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.709
 aaaah make the beginning of the year a 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.489
 walk so the name so the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.290
 leaves with very much on ok basis 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.730
 I have nothing to prove to anyone to 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.849
 already but mine is one is the beginning of 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.450
 my career a little bit of this new cd 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.480
 that calls metamorphosis, are not you a producer? 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.569
 the cd itself how it is that yes it is a 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.000
 of jazz musicians often 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:49.620
 then produce themselves saw discs 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:54.180
 many voices is is is even a change is 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.930
 style change approach one 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:03.140
 change of the atmosphere atmosphere a case 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:16.250
 It's all and it 's what I feel today is this 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:18.450
 change between the beginning and now the current and 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:24.350
 was also greatly influenced by the 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:35.299
 period of the 70s electronic music 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:41.420
 It's rock is and this influence was then a fan. 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:45.269
 of rock but but something darker 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.900
 I like I like you already traveled by 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.910
 many ctv countries have 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.889
 many types of people 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.340
 What do you think is a people that 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:58.620
 Sometimes it is more sensitive to music or what 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.239
 You found it more challenging too. 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.430
 more challenging 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:08.519
 the people without doubt the cable people 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:13.170
 green verdant is one thing and is so for 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:16.889
 it was those people like jajá 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:20.039
 I already have my friend, he does not have 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.049
 people who have nothing this thousand option 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.409
 say 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:28.990
 is to assess the pole question but even 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:32.810
 it's really her having nothing they invite 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.060
 to walk in their houses they give 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.629
 all this was what most impressed the 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.490
 in without speaking for the musicality and that 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:43.639
 they do naturally reminds one of 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:47.919
 little our Brazilian people 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.919
 but the Cape Verdean people with no doubts
