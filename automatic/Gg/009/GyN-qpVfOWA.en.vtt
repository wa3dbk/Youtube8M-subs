questions about the data they're putting

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.620 
questions about the data they're putting
in<00:01:13.009> the<00:01:13.159> flag<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:13.850> up<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:14.240> then<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.420> checker

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
in the flag it up and then the checker

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.899 
in the flag it up and then the checker
can<00:01:14.930> check<00:01:15.380> by<00:01:15.619> just<00:01:15.830> going<00:01:16.399> back<00:01:16.610> could<00:01:16.850> be

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
can check by just going back could be

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.399 
can check by just going back could be
playing<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.210> footage<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:17.630> then<00:01:17.750> be

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
playing the footage and then be

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.469 
playing the footage and then be
inputting<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.799> data<00:01:18.830> on<00:01:19.340> certain<00:01:19.940> games<00:01:20.210> we

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479

definitely could not do it I know that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.710 
definitely could not do it I know that
for<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.310> hand-eye<00:01:55.880> coordination<00:01:56.119> they

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
they've got a little bit of time to go

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.130 
they've got a little bit of time to go
back<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.700> check<00:02:04.819> errors<00:02:05.179> during<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.899> breaks

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
back and check errors during the breaks

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.589 
back and check errors during the breaks
and<00:02:06.500> we'll<00:02:07.340> see<00:02:07.550> go<00:02:08.090> through<00:02:08.270> every<00:02:08.479> match

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
they're doing it it's pretty intense

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.839 
they're doing it it's pretty intense
4550<00:02:12.470> minutes<00:02:12.590> at<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.920> time<00:02:13.099> where<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.730> don't

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
4550 minutes at a time where you don't

have<00:02:14.150> much<00:02:14.360> led<00:02:14.629> up<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:14.989> it's<00:02:15.349> pretty

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
have much led up and it's pretty

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.430 
have much led up and it's pretty
impressive<00:02:16.599> demonstration<00:02:17.599> of<00:02:17.750> skills<00:02:18.319> and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
impressive demonstration of skills and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.720 
impressive demonstration of skills and
not<00:02:18.560> sure<00:02:18.709> what<00:02:18.890> skills<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.400> how<00:02:19.550> they've

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
not sure what skills and how they've

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.270 
not sure what skills and how they've
built<00:02:19.910> them<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.120> but<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.569> is<00:02:20.890> more<00:02:21.890> than<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.069> can

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
built them up but it is more than I can

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.820 
built them up but it is more than I can
do<00:02:22.400> certainly<00:02:22.849> it<00:02:23.420> takes<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.870> unique<00:02:24.140> kind<00:02:24.709> of

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
do certainly it takes a unique kind of

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.559 
do certainly it takes a unique kind of
person<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.430> mean<00:02:25.790> if<00:02:25.879> you're<00:02:25.970> good<00:02:26.090> at<00:02:26.209> computer

person I mean if you're good at computer

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.270 
person I mean if you're good at computer
games<00:02:26.599> it<00:02:27.019> helps<00:02:27.319> and<00:02:27.560> if<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:27.739> have<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.160> have<00:02:28.250> a

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
question

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.470 
question
he<00:03:02.360> might<00:03:02.810> say<00:03:03.379> can<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.620> double-check<00:03:04.040> a

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
he might say can you double-check a

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.520 
he might say can you double-check a
defender<00:03:05.480> may<00:03:05.600> have<00:03:05.690> made<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:05.840> clearance<00:03:06.260> but

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
defender may have made a clearance but

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.910 
defender may have made a clearance but
it<00:03:06.620> might<00:03:06.800> have<00:03:06.890> been<00:03:06.920> a

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
it might have been a

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.280 
it might have been a
instead<00:03:08.819> so<00:03:09.300> they'd<00:03:09.480> ask<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.870> checker<00:03:10.080> to

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
instead so they'd ask the checker to

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.900 
instead so they'd ask the checker to
just<00:03:10.470> check<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.860> replay<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.490> then<00:03:11.610> if<00:03:11.760> it

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
just check that replay it and then if it

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.160 
just check that replay it and then if it
needs<00:03:12.060> correcting<00:03:12.450> correctly<00:03:12.750> straightaway

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
needs correcting correctly straightaway

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.229 
needs correcting correctly straightaway
I'll<00:03:13.590> say<00:03:13.739> here<00:03:13.920> we<00:03:14.010> can<00:03:14.160> replay<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.640> data<00:03:14.849> and

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
I'll say here we can replay the data and

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.300 
I'll say here we can replay the data and
they<00:03:15.390> can<00:03:15.420> double-check<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.950> pause<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.550> see

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
they can double-check and pause and see

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.830 
they can double-check and pause and see
so<00:03:20.310> quite<00:03:20.520> often<00:03:20.670> if<00:03:21.060> there's<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.510> deflection

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
so quite often if there's a deflection

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.360 
so quite often if there's a deflection
on<00:03:22.050> a<00:03:22.080> goal<00:03:22.319> and<00:03:22.739> we're<00:03:22.860> not<00:03:22.920> sure<00:03:23.069> if<00:03:23.099> it's<00:03:23.310> a

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
on a goal and we're not sure if it's a

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.370 
on a goal and we're not sure if it's a
known<00:03:23.520> goal<00:03:23.849> we<00:03:24.630> can<00:03:24.780> then<00:03:24.900> slow<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.350> down

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
known goal we can then slow it down

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.500 
known goal we can then slow it down
replay<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.100> pause<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.459> so<00:03:26.790> we<00:03:27.030> can<00:03:27.150> take

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
replay it pause it so we can take

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.210 
replay it pause it so we can take
different<00:03:28.110> angles<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.770> have<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.920> look<00:03:29.100> at

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
different angles and have a look at

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.250 
different angles and have a look at
whether<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:30.209> is<00:03:30.360> an<00:03:30.480> own-goal<00:03:30.630> run<00:03:30.930> up

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.050

the moment you'll hit you'll hear

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.120 
the moment you'll hit you'll hear
something<00:04:42.660> that<00:04:42.870> he's<00:04:43.050> just<00:04:43.500> put<00:04:43.620> across<00:04:43.890> them

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
something that he's just put across them

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.029 
something that he's just put across them
within<00:04:44.640> 30<00:04:45.000> seconds<00:04:45.470> so<00:04:46.470> that's<00:04:46.590> as<00:04:46.740> quick<00:04:46.950> as

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
within 30 seconds so that's as quick as

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.950 
within 30 seconds so that's as quick as
it<00:04:47.160> can<00:04:47.250> happen<00:04:47.400> so<00:04:47.580> if<00:04:47.880> safe<00:04:48.240> now<00:04:48.600> there's<00:04:48.900> a

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
it can happen so if safe now there's a

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.590 
it can happen so if safe now there's a
red<00:04:49.140> card<00:04:49.410> we<00:04:50.220> could<00:04:50.400> research<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:51.060> fact<00:04:51.330> about
