00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.259
 Hi, how are you doing today? 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.899
 I really bring a makeup for now 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.660
 for the summer is that it is super easy to 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:13.290
 make fresh you do not have to use so much 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.640
 Thing my shadow under salt 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.230
 and then nothing is true and if you are like 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.240
 I really do not go much to the beach 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.210
 but you want to have as it is 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.950
 that detail is true this tan as 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.800
 If I had gone to the beach 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.989
 chosen as just that way on the beach 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.690
 a little something like that would have been 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.800
 many, it was on the beach, nothing 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.580
 because this is for you to see it and thus a 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.820
 look like that scruffy a bit that I 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.769
 You are liking it a lot lately too 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.570
 and this makeup teaches it is clear 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.940
 also like that now lately 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.519
 also with others and using ipe I decided 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.989
 see it this recreate it for you and 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.659
 share it truth what I'm using 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.260
 to give them ideas and everything for the summer 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:05.150
 and then nothing here I leave you with the step to 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.670
 step I hope you like any doubt 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.060
 as you can always leave comments 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.909
 in the bottom part social networks 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.979
 and then welcome are all true 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.810
 I do not want a lot and many that 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.640
 supported and began to load a little my 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.789
 line at the top of the sheet 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.439
 here in the corners or that can 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:29.150
 copy true but I want to do it in 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:33.400
 this moment and also in the 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.400
 let's see a little bit more 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.760
 with a pretty long little chin 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.760
 as you wish 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.250
 so on the corner on the outside 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.990
 in the upper inner part of the eye 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.990
 as well 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:08.890
 and the same thing we're going to do in the other 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.750
 well, more or less they have to stay 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.810
 this is also what you want 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.700
 blur the upper outer line the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.850
 can blur a little bit and sometimes I do not 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.750
 we sometimes do not today I did not do this 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.530
 but nothing 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.050
 now let's apply a mask like 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.720
 I'm always wearing my favorite mask 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.330
 the authority of volumes in this case 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.550
 of black black black it is but I have 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.550
 carbon black carbon black 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.590
 and nothing here how many layers like 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.590
 I always like many layers 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.200
 and only 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.510
 we're just going to apply the mask on 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.640
 the upper lashes if you're like me 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.890
 that does not go much to the beach because this 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.330
 step that I'm going to do now is perfect 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.660
 for us, we do not see much 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.239
 to the beach because I do not know or we do not like 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.110
 a lot of going to the beach or something I do not know is 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.730
 forget not to be but nothing now we go 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.700
 to apply the pronounced in this case 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.799
 I'm using the clinic of your brawn 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.799
 zonkeys that is here 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.120
 and for nothing 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.120
 let's apply it 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.920
 apply it 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.830
 i 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.720
 I believe that in him 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.220
 but not 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.700
 that way you 'll pretty much see that 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.139
 it gives us as if we had gone to the 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:20.549
 beach and we would not have burned a little 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:26.610
 now let's apply I'm going to use 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:29.310
 this one of usa in handy with petacchi it 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.009
 cut a little bit but what I applied 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.979
 it was the blogs 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:38.809

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.809

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.420

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.270
 Y 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.400
 a little enlightening truth and 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.890
 you know that it is the df that always 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.690
 used a little illuminator here in 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.740
 nothing in the nose in the center of the 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.800
 nose 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.660
 and a little here in the bone of the 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.210
 cheeks to light up a little more the 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.630
 area 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.340

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:17.719

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.100
