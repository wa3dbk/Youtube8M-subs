00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.880
First driver gets the most difficult part in the race.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.080
After that does't matter if you are second or third driver in the team.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.520
You only need sound car

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.280
All other competitors will be all along the track and it won't cause any additional difficulties.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:26.000
First laps are most difficult when everywhere around is other cars.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.880
Last race I tried that, got a lesson from other drivers and today Konstantins is behind the wheel.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.060
He is the most experienced in our team

00:02:53.906 --> 00:03:00.426
It is not a difficult situation, but honestly, I am really angry on Ginetta factory

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.200
They didn't provide us parts we needed so repairs took us 5 times longer than normally

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.700
We have what we have, we need to race now

00:03:12.248 --> 00:03:15.888
It was hard job. These cars aren't made like LMP2 cars

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.260
and repairs takes more time and energy

00:03:21.778 --> 00:03:25.838
We did well but now we lost about 20 minutes

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.380
I don't know what happened

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.174
Šūdas

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:37.560
Greičiausiame posūkyje mane lenkė LMP2 automobilis ir išstūmė iš trasos.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.960
Ratas atsidūrė už kerbo ir pajutau, kad kažkas nuskrido

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.540
Nobody invited us today

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.520
You can't climb podium everyday

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.970
We compete against really good drivers

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.720
Guys and teams are well prepared

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.980
Our team did too many mistakes today

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.980
And those mistakes made our car fail.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.640
Twice

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.400
And thats why this year we had to withdraw from race

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.940
But we are learning from our mistakes

00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:55.761
And I am sure we will be stronger in the next race

00:05:55.986 --> 00:06:00.386
-You spend 20 minutes in a car while it was being repaired. How you felt there?

00:06:08.617 --> 00:06:10.617
That wasn't so bad.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.920
I had simple thoughts. I was wondering why does it takes so long.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.160
But it takes time to change whole car back

00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:28.343
I didn't thought much. I just wanted to race
