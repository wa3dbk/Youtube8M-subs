00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.170
 one year 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.419
 this is a dacia this is the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.949
 second generation of sandero 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.900
 so as you see his style did 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.789
 nothing more low cost but the principle 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.189
 remains the same a rudimentary car 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.449
 with a very interesting rate and 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.550
 some additional options 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.550
 we'll see all this in this essay 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.590
 his new hero has to be ashamed 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.750
 of its line there are fires 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.280
 recalling those of a few volkswagen 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.789
 chrome effects and even edges 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.559
 projections 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.420
 like at the competition its 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.430
 measurements remains almost unchanged 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.820
 the car only gains 4 cm 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.800
 length 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.300
 and for good reason it's always the same 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.040
 platform that equip the entire range 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.420
 since the first logan on this 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.640
 stepway version the ground clearance is 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.110
 enhanced by 4 cm which is practical in 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.820
 the paths and some details 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.710
 aesthetics come to perfect this side 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.570
 adventurer as before the stepway 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:13.179
 should represent half of 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:15.009
 sales in France on board also it changes 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:16.720
 quite importantly the board 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.250
 has been completely redesigned 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.110
 as well as the center console 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.479
 it's a lot more modern, prettier 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.750
 so we have two days or plastic 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.310
 hard but it's pretty coherent it's nothing 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.530
 really shocking the other novelty 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.179
 it's the introduction of the median system 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.520
 to this navigation system that has appeared 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.899
 on the dacia lojie his qualities one 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.899
 knows it's a functional system 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.399
 simple easy to handle with no 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.829
 bad bluetooth features 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.290
 doubt to call and listen to 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.750
 music but also a usb plug and 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.549
 then there is a price 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.880
 unbeatable it is 240 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.439
 euros 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.579
 it's hardly more expensive than a system 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.579
 portable gps 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.820
 here we have the engine dci 90 is very 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.280
 well sized for the car 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.440
 the average consumption we observed 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.930
 these innocent civilians it's okay 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.330
 the engine is rather well soundproofed 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.310
 thanks to the addition of new insulators 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.200
 behind the dashboard on the other hand 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.510
 we always feel the vibrations that are 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.950
 quite present when the engine is in 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.380
 full charge during big 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.120
 accelerations it's not very nice 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.380
 at the level of behavior at the center the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.270
 suspensions were reworked them 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.680
 are slightly more doing which allows 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.660
 to have a little more clarification 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.230
 likewise if the car is very very 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.020
 flexible and then other little thing to 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.760
 point out the bases that are enough 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:49.370
 flexible and that do not offer enough 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:51.140
 matter we told you these prices 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.860
 remain unchanged and on this version 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.450
 top of the line 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.940
 we have an overview of everything that can 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.320
 offer the car but also the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.000
 elements that will need to be done 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.240
 a cross several equipments arrive 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.340
 in series the power steering esp 2 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.140
 additional side airbags a 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.120
 folding seat 2/3 1/3 and one 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.220
 eco button that reduces the 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.320
 10% consumption in the best of 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.000
 optional case or according to the finish on 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.370
 can now count on a regulator 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.410
 speed a recoil radar of the seats 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.880
 leather and electric windows 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.739
 back that we can even order 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.390
 with feet seen where they are 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.620
 located on the other hand it will not be necessary 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.230
 still not count on a finish 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.790
 neat modern buttons or real 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.790
 alloy wheels on this step 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.010
 like the latest models in the range 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.810
 dacia sandero is therefore the same trend 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.510
 get closer to the classic models 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.580
 while maintaining unbeatable prices 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.860
 this stepway diesel version to 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.450
 the complete equipment claims 13 1600 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.580
 euros while at the competition 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.920
 it will cost thousands 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.360
 of euros in addition of course it remains 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.459
 counterparties but they are 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.410
 reduce so much that this sandero is 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.500
 more than ever a good deal 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.540
 we summarize its qualities a price ratio 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.489
 unbeatable equipment and a line 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.019
 now in the shot these gaps 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.090
 a diesel engine that vibrates at 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.480
 acceleration and missing seats 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.480
 keeping
