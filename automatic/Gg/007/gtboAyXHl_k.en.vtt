football<00:00:09.860> normally<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.099> technique<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.670> to

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
football normally the technique is to

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
just pass it underhanded in a nice tight

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.510 
just pass it underhanded in a nice tight
spiral<00:00:18.199> this<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> different<00:00:19.830> technique<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
spiral this is a different technique and

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.640 
spiral this is a different technique and
it<00:00:20.850> involves<00:00:21.240> taking<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.689> ball<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.140> lifting

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
it involves taking the ball and lifting

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.160 
it involves taking the ball and lifting
the<00:00:22.800> rear<00:00:23.039> end<00:00:23.310> off<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.880> ground<00:00:24.119> now<00:00:24.930> what<00:00:25.080> you

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
the rear end off the ground now what you

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.990 
the rear end off the ground now what you
do<00:00:25.289> with<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.529> laces<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.220> make<00:00:26.550> sure<00:00:26.580> they're

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
do with the laces is make sure they're

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.550 
do with the laces is make sure they're
facing<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.720> same<00:00:27.750> direction<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
facing in the same direction the

facing in the same direction the
quarterbacks<00:00:29.039> throwing<00:00:29.460> hand<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.660> a

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
quarterbacks throwing hand is so a

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.510 
quarterbacks throwing hand is so a
right-handed<00:00:31.380> quarterback<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.040> laces<00:00:32.369> are

right-handed quarterback the laces are
facing<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> right<00:00:33.239> sideline<00:00:33.860> left-handed

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
facing the right sideline left-handed

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.270 
facing the right sideline left-handed
quarterback<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:36.059> ask<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.450> referee<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.280> spot

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
quarterback you ask the referee to spot

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.400 
quarterback you ask the referee to spot
the<00:00:38.460> ball<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.540> laces<00:00:39.870> are<00:00:39.989> facing<00:00:40.320> to

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the ball so that the laces are facing to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.139 
the ball so that the laces are facing to
the<00:00:40.469> left<00:00:40.739> sideline<00:00:41.010> let's<00:00:41.879> say<00:00:42.030> it's

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
the left sideline let's say it's

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.400

right-handed<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:43.890> index<00:00:44.250> finger<00:00:44.930> goes<00:00:45.930> right

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
right-handed the index finger goes right

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.940 
right-handed the index finger goes right
down<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.860> lace<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.780> seam<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.050> ball<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
you get a good wide handed grip on the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.479 
you get a good wide handed grip on the
end<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> ball<00:00:52.680> lift<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.280> off<00:00:53.460> the

ground and then he'll just snap it back
through<00:00:55.770> his<00:00:55.890> legs<00:00:56.160> now<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.059> protective

self a good pop right in the goodies and
that<00:01:06.570> should<00:01:06.780> guarantee<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> bowl

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
that should guarantee that the bowl

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.500 
that should guarantee that the bowl
doesn't<00:01:07.740> go<00:01:08.010> too<00:01:08.070> high<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.270> snap

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
doesn't go too high and that the snap

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.289 
doesn't go too high and that the snap
isn't<00:01:09.840> too<00:01:09.990> hard<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.100> nice<00:01:11.250> firm<00:01:11.549> 5-yard

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
isn't too hard it's a nice firm 5-yard

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.320 
isn't too hard it's a nice firm 5-yard
end-over-end<00:01:12.869> snap<00:01:13.729> so<00:01:14.729> let's<00:01:14.880> see<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.150> can

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
end-over-end snap so let's see if we can

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.960 
end-over-end snap so let's see if we can
manage<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.750> with<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.080> practice<00:01:16.530> drives

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:33.960 

perfect<00:01:24.970> one<00:01:25.420> more<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.860> was<00:01:26.979> great

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.900 

there<00:01:34.750> we<00:01:34.840> go<00:01:34.960> that's<00:01:35.650> it<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.280> practice<00:01:36.670> tries

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
there we go that's it to practice tries

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.970 
there we go that's it to practice tries
and<00:01:37.240> he's<00:01:37.330> perfected<00:01:37.870> it<00:01:37.960> it's<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.500> slight<00:01:38.740> bit

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
and he's perfected it it's a slight bit

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.220 
and he's perfected it it's a slight bit
slower<00:01:39.280> than<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.580> spiral<00:01:40.060> snap<00:01:40.300> but<00:01:40.840> given

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
slower than the spiral snap but given

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.900 
slower than the spiral snap but given
the<00:01:41.260> accuracy<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:42.100> doesn't<00:01:42.580> really<00:01:42.700> matter

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
the accuracy that doesn't really matter

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.030 
the accuracy that doesn't really matter
this<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:43.600> much<00:01:43.720> easier<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:44.230> do<00:01:44.410> and<00:01:44.620> the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
this is so much easier to do and the

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.010 
this is so much easier to do and the
other<00:01:45.070> good<00:01:45.400> point<00:01:45.700> is<00:01:45.880> it's<00:01:46.120> so<00:01:46.330> simple<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.840> do

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
other good point is it's so simple to do

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.260 
other good point is it's so simple to do
that<00:01:47.230> you<00:01:47.920> can<00:01:48.070> practice<00:01:48.520> your<00:01:48.550> blocking<00:01:49.120> as

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
that you can practice your blocking as

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.630 
that you can practice your blocking as
well<00:01:49.450> once<00:01:50.050> you<00:01:50.170> perfect<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:50.620> snap<00:01:50.890> then<00:01:51.550> the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
well once you perfect the snap then the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.800 
well once you perfect the snap then the
next<00:01:51.850> thing<00:01:51.940> that<00:01:52.000> Center<00:01:52.270> works<00:01:52.480> on<00:01:52.660> is

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
next thing that Center works on is

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.470 
next thing that Center works on is
snapping<00:01:53.200> step<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:54.370> have<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.550> defender<00:01:55.270> in

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480
