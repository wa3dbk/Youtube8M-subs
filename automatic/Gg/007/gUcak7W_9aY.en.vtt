00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
at all like I was just in an elevator

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.889 
at all like I was just in an elevator
throughout<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> entire<00:00:32.579> process<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
throughout the entire process and the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.650 
throughout the entire process and the
entire<00:00:34.320> time<00:00:34.770> my<00:00:35.160> screen<00:00:35.640> was<00:00:36.030> shaking<00:00:36.480> like

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
entire time my screen was shaking like

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.970 
entire time my screen was shaking like
it<00:00:36.780> was<00:00:36.899> Armageddon<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:37.800> was<00:00:37.890> an

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
it was Armageddon like there was an

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.889 
it was Armageddon like there was an
earthquake<00:00:38.129> going<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.790> around<00:00:39.059> me<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.780> it

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
earthquake going on around me like it

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.600 
earthquake going on around me like it
was<00:00:40.020> ridiculous<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.950> amount<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.370> screen

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
was ridiculous the amount of screen

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.270 
was ridiculous the amount of screen
shaking<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.180> was<00:00:42.329> happening<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.500> my

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
shaking that was happening and so my

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.260 
shaking that was happening and so my
first<00:00:44.610> question<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.300> how<00:00:46.079> does<00:00:46.620> anyone<00:00:47.270> enjoy

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
first question is how does anyone enjoy

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.360 
first question is how does anyone enjoy
this<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.170> get<00:00:49.350> operation<00:00:49.920> Metro<00:00:50.219> when

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
this like I get operation Metro when

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.369 
this like I get operation Metro when
you're<00:00:50.489> playing<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.030> smaller<00:00:51.629> server<00:00:52.110> count

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
you're playing on a smaller server count

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.819 
you're playing on a smaller server count
like<00:00:52.649> 16<00:00:53.129> players<00:00:53.460> or<00:00:53.789> 34<00:00:54.360> or<00:00:54.570> 32<00:00:54.930> players<00:00:55.199> it's

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
like 16 players or 34 or 32 players it's

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.740 
like 16 players or 34 or 32 players it's
a<00:00:55.980> fun<00:00:56.160> experience<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.360> not<00:00:57.539> as

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750

ammo bags I get that appeal but is that
the<00:01:35.100> sole<00:01:35.340> reason<00:01:35.579> why<00:01:35.850> people<00:01:36.479> are<00:01:36.720> doing

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900

for an authentic feel like if a grenade

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.820 
for an authentic feel like if a grenade
is<00:02:23.910> happening<00:02:24.360> right<00:02:24.540> next<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.140> you're

is happening right next to you you're
through<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.310> ground<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.760> probably<00:02:27.060> gonna

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
through the ground is probably gonna

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.550 
through the ground is probably gonna
shake<00:02:27.450> around<00:02:27.600> you're<00:02:27.990> probably<00:02:28.230> gonna<00:02:28.440> get

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
shake around you're probably gonna get

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.190 
shake around you're probably gonna get
yossel<00:02:28.980> around<00:02:29.250> but<00:02:29.730> at<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.850> same<00:02:30.060> time<00:02:30.360> for<00:02:30.780> a

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
yossel around but at the same time for a

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.810 
yossel around but at the same time for a
gameplay<00:02:31.740> experience<00:02:32.220> when<00:02:32.340> I'm<00:02:32.430> playing<00:02:32.610> a

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
gameplay experience when I'm playing a

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.330 
gameplay experience when I'm playing a
video<00:02:33.120> game<00:02:33.230> having<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.380> constant<00:02:34.650> screen

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
video game having that constant screen

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.580 
video game having that constant screen
shaking<00:02:35.850> at<00:02:36.030> least<00:02:36.540> for<00:02:36.750> me<00:02:36.870> two<00:02:37.050> tracks<00:02:37.380> from

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
shaking at least for me two tracks from

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.350 
shaking at least for me two tracks from
the<00:02:37.680> experience<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.310> little<00:02:38.430> bit<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:39.060> I

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
the experience a little bit and so I

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.390 
the experience a little bit and so I
don't<00:02:40.110> know<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.530> more<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.100> plea

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
don't know this is a more of a plea

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.800 
don't know this is a more of a plea
because<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.820> don't<00:02:41.970> necessarily<00:02:42.060> think<00:02:42.720> that

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
because I don't necessarily think that

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.320 
because I don't necessarily think that
it<00:02:43.140> ruins<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.770> game<00:02:43.950> by<00:02:44.190> any<00:02:44.370> means<00:02:44.490> but<00:02:44.940> it

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
it ruins the game by any means but it

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.670 
it ruins the game by any means but it
would<00:02:45.450> be<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.750> little<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.170> would<00:02:46.230> be<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.380> little

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
would be a little it would be a little

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.190 
would be a little it would be a little
nice<00:02:46.860> if<00:02:47.160> there<00:02:47.400> was<00:02:47.640> just<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:48.090> little<00:02:48.600> bit<00:02:48.780> less

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
nice if there was just a little bit less

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.160 
nice if there was just a little bit less
of<00:02:49.500> screen<00:02:50.400> shaking<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.120> game<00:02:51.360> hopefully

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
of screen shaking in the game hopefully

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.470 
of screen shaking in the game hopefully
it's<00:02:52.650> going<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.950> be<00:02:53.040> relatively<00:02:53.880> solved<00:02:54.270> in

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
it's going to be relatively solved in

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.510 
it's going to be relatively solved in
the<00:02:54.870> upcoming<00:02:55.230> patch<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.830> know<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.130> dice<00:02:56.340> has

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
the upcoming patch I know that dice has

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.220 
the upcoming patch I know that dice has
gone<00:02:56.700> in<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.150> they've<00:02:57.360> made<00:02:57.570> some<00:02:57.810> changes<00:02:58.110> to

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
gone in and they've made some changes to

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.810 
gone in and they've made some changes to
the<00:02:58.320> grenade<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:58.950> can't<00:02:59.190> replenish<00:02:59.550> them

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
the grenade so you can't replenish them

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.699 
the grenade so you can't replenish them
as<00:03:00.030> quickly<00:03:00.240> if<00:03:00.510> you're<00:03:00.630> standing<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.080> on<00:03:01.380> an

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
as quickly if you're standing on a on an

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.199 
as quickly if you're standing on a on an
ammo<00:03:01.860> bag<00:03:02.100> which<00:03:02.340> i<00:03:02.430> think<00:03:02.490> is<00:03:02.700> great<00:03:02.850> like<00:03:03.120> i

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
ammo bag which i think is great like i

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.370 
ammo bag which i think is great like i
think<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.660> great<00:03:03.900> step<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.290> right

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
think that is a great step in the right

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.590 
think that is a great step in the right
direction<00:03:04.550> but<00:03:05.550> at<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.700> same<00:03:05.850> time<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.390> don't

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
direction but at the same time I don't

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.300 
direction but at the same time I don't
think<00:03:06.810> it's<00:03:07.080> going<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.290> completely<00:03:07.590> solve<00:03:08.070> the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
think it's going to completely solve the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.610

guys think about this not only grenade

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.820 
guys think about this not only grenade
spam<00:03:12.390> but<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.720> amount<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.230> screen<00:03:13.470> shaking

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
spam but the amount of screen shaking

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.590 
spam but the amount of screen shaking
that<00:03:14.100> happens<00:03:14.459> in<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.640> game<00:03:14.670> would<00:03:15.270> you<00:03:15.420> like

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
that happens in the game would you like

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.270 
that happens in the game would you like
it<00:03:15.720> so<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.020> they<00:03:16.140> may<00:03:16.290> be<00:03:16.350> toned<00:03:16.769> it<00:03:17.010> down<00:03:17.040> a

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
it so that they may be toned it down a

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.860 
it so that they may be toned it down a
little<00:03:17.580> bit<00:03:17.820> maybe<00:03:18.000> made<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.570> it

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
little bit maybe made it so that it

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.199 
little bit maybe made it so that it
wasn't<00:03:19.140> as<00:03:19.440> severe<00:03:19.980> as<00:03:20.160> it<00:03:20.430> currently<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.940> I

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
wasn't as severe as it currently is I

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.729 
wasn't as severe as it currently is I
don't<00:03:21.510> think<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.840> ruins<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.290> game<00:03:22.440> by<00:03:22.620> any

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
don't think it ruins the game by any

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.290 
don't think it ruins the game by any

has been annoying me for a while and

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.240 
has been annoying me for a while and

operation Metro it becomes abundantly
