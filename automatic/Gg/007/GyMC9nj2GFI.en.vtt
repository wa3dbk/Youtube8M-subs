into it okay so the first thing I'm
really<00:00:40.739> enjoying<00:00:40.829> about<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.579> mode<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
really enjoying about this mode is the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.810 
really enjoying about this mode is the
fact<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.780> its<00:00:42.960> unpredictability<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:44.489> minute

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
fact of its unpredictability one minute

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.220 
fact of its unpredictability one minute
you<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.210> fighting<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> middle<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
you can be fighting in the middle of the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.139 
you can be fighting in the middle of the
map<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.739> next<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.309> can<00:00:47.399> be<00:00:47.520> fighting<00:00:47.879> out<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
map the next you can be fighting out the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.479 
map the next you can be fighting out the
in<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> outskirts<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.200> somewhere<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.770> depends

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
in the outskirts of somewhere it depends

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.160 
in the outskirts of somewhere it depends
where<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> flag<00:00:51.000> Falls<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.750> kill<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
where the flag Falls if you kill the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.930 
where the flag Falls if you kill the
flag<00:00:52.379> carrier<00:00:52.800> you'll<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.640> fight<00:00:53.910> for

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
flag carrier you'll be in a fight for

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.450 
flag carrier you'll be in a fight for
that<00:00:54.239> flag<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.469> unlike<00:00:55.800> any<00:00:55.949> game<00:00:56.219> mode

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that flag and it's unlike any game mode

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.250 
that flag and it's unlike any game mode
because<00:00:56.670> normally<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.510> battlefield<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.140> have

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
because normally in battlefield you have

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260 
because normally in battlefield you have
your<00:00:58.379> set<00:00:58.620> positions<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.340> conquest<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.180> have

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
your set positions in conquest you have

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.840 
your set positions in conquest you have
your<00:01:00.390> ABC<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.620> PC<00:01:02.070> you've<00:01:02.280> obviously<00:01:02.399> got

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
your ABC and on PC you've obviously got

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.719 
your ABC and on PC you've obviously got
the<00:01:02.910> five<00:01:03.619> and<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:04.920> rush<00:01:05.159> you've<00:01:05.369> got<00:01:05.549> your

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the five and with rush you've got your

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.780 
the five and with rush you've got your
RM<00:01:06.210> comms<00:01:06.540> which<00:01:06.869> are<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.110> set<00:01:07.470> em<00:01:07.680> comes<00:01:07.979> what

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
RM comms which are all set em comes what

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.609 
RM comms which are all set em comes what
I<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.119> about<00:01:09.150> capture<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> flag<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
I like about capture the flag is the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.590 
I like about capture the flag is the
bases<00:01:11.070> change<00:01:11.490> even<00:01:11.909> though<00:01:12.119> you've<00:01:12.299> got<00:01:12.330> you

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
bases change even though you've got you

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.770 
bases change even though you've got you
two<00:01:12.810> main<00:01:13.140> bases<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.330> it<00:01:15.330> sort<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.720> changes

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
two main bases the it sort of changes

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.170 
two main bases the it sort of changes
because<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> go<00:01:17.850> from<00:01:18.000> one

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
because that you have to go from one

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.969 
because that you have to go from one
location<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.869> other<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.860> you

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
location to the other and if you

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.249 
location to the other and if you
intercept<00:01:20.520> them<00:01:20.729> then<00:01:21.270> there's<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> automatic

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
intercept them then there's a automatic

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.320 
intercept them then there's a automatic
fight<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.009> flag<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.580> flag<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.299> be

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
fight for that flag and that flag can be

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330 
fight for that flag and that flag can be
anywhere<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.049> map<00:01:25.229> that's<00:01:25.740> what<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> really

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
anywhere on the map that's what I really

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.170 
anywhere on the map that's what I really
draw<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.670> very<00:01:27.049> unreliable<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.860> that's<00:01:29.579> one

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
draw it's very unreliable and that's one

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.120 
draw it's very unreliable and that's one
thing<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.630> like<00:01:30.930> about<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.560> next<00:01:31.890> is

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
thing I really like about it the next is

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.670 
thing I really like about it the next is
the<00:01:32.369> vehicles<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.150> really<00:01:33.960> enjoy<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.320> vehicles

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the vehicles I really enjoy the vehicles

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.710 
the vehicles I really enjoy the vehicles
overall<00:01:35.159> because<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.610> feel<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.180> they've<00:01:36.509> got

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
overall because I feel like they've got

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.020 
overall because I feel like they've got
it<00:01:36.900> pretty<00:01:37.170> much<00:01:37.409> balanced<00:01:37.950> almost<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> tee

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
it pretty much balanced almost to a tee

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.679 
it pretty much balanced almost to a tee
every<00:01:40.020> vehicle<00:01:40.799> has<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.549> role<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.820> play<00:01:41.970> you've

every vehicle has a role to play you've

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.600 
every vehicle has a role to play you've
got<00:01:42.899> your<00:01:43.020> tanks<00:01:43.409> which<00:01:43.590> are<00:01:43.770> obviously<00:01:43.890> heavy

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
got your tanks which are obviously heavy

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.120 
got your tanks which are obviously heavy
armor<00:01:45.030> they<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.509> take<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.720> lot<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.990> damage<00:01:46.290> give

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130

a<00:01:47.159> lot<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.399> damage<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.060> they<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.140> be

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
a lot of damage and they can just be

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.929 
a lot of damage and they can just be
great<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.860> way<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.070> they're<00:01:50.369> very<00:01:50.399> slow

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
great in that way but they're very slow

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.510 
great in that way but they're very slow

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
going to be defending your own base

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.480 
going to be defending your own base
that's<00:02:04.530> what<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.740> feel<00:02:05.040> they<00:02:05.219> look<00:02:05.340> like

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that's what I feel they look like

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.270 
that's what I feel they look like
they've<00:02:05.700> used<00:02:05.909> their<00:02:06.149> useful<00:02:07.039> motorbikes<00:02:08.039> are

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
they've used their useful motorbikes are

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.150 
they've used their useful motorbikes are
more<00:02:08.429> used<00:02:08.700> for<00:02:09.360> attacking<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.830> flag

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
more used for attacking the flag

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.010 
more used for attacking the flag
attacking<00:02:11.970> your<00:02:12.060> opposition<00:02:12.300> flag<00:02:12.750> and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
attacking your opposition flag and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.460 
attacking your opposition flag and
bringing

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
bringing

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.650 
bringing
to<00:02:13.590> your<00:02:13.710> own<00:02:13.830> base<00:02:14.040> while<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.610> tanks<00:02:15.390> almost

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
to your own base while the tanks almost

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.590 
to your own base while the tanks almost
defend<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.010> base<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.760> feel<00:02:18.570> like

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
defend the base so I feel like

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.320 
defend the base so I feel like
everything's<00:02:19.350> got<00:02:19.590> its<00:02:19.710> role<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.100> play<00:02:20.330> the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
everything's got its role to play the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.480 
everything's got its role to play the
helicopters<00:02:21.930> always<00:02:22.260> are<00:02:22.590> great<00:02:22.980> i<00:02:23.010> mean<00:02:23.160> it's

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
they've done pretty well balanced was in

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.570 
they've done pretty well balanced was in
terms<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.210> all<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.170> vehicles<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:29.400> yeah

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
terms of all the vehicles and yeah

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.980 
terms of all the vehicles and yeah
that's<00:02:29.820> something<00:02:30.180> I'm<00:02:30.270> really<00:02:30.300> enjoying<00:02:30.660> as

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
well okay now let's go over a couple of

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.660 
well okay now let's go over a couple of
the<00:02:32.910> negatives<00:02:33.390> I've<00:02:33.710> seen<00:02:34.710> from<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.460> far

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
the negatives I've seen from this so far

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.100 
the negatives I've seen from this so far
the<00:02:36.150> first<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.870> obviously<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.820> base<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.870> base

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
the first is obviously the base the base

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.980 
the first is obviously the base the base
reaping<00:02:40.740> as<00:02:40.860> they<00:02:40.980> like<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.340> call<00:02:41.460> it<00:02:41.670> the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
reaping as they like to call it the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.410 
reaping as they like to call it the
problem<00:02:42.990> is<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.760> enemies<00:02:44.760> can<00:02:45.030> get<00:02:45.180> into

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
problem is is that enemies can get into

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.449 
problem is is that enemies can get into
your<00:02:45.510> base<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.020> take<00:02:46.170> your<00:02:46.350> tanks<00:02:46.709> thank<00:02:47.310> you

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
everything you have your base and it's

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.010 
everything you have your base and it's

a<00:03:02.730> huge<00:03:03.000> one<00:03:03.120> but<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.959> can't<00:03:04.530> be<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.890> point

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
a huge one but it can't be to the point

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.620 
a huge one but it can't be to the point
where<00:03:05.370> people<00:03:05.760> are<00:03:05.850> coming<00:03:05.880> into<00:03:06.240> your<00:03:06.420> base

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
where people are coming into your base

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.630 
where people are coming into your base
and<00:03:06.900> taking<00:03:07.530> your<00:03:07.620> choppers<00:03:08.070> taking<00:03:08.520> your

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
and taking your choppers taking your

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.720 
and taking your choppers taking your
tanks<00:03:09.080> that's<00:03:10.080> just<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.410> lot<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.680> rubbish<00:03:11.430> in<00:03:11.640> my

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
tanks that's just a lot of rubbish in my

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.220 
tanks that's just a lot of rubbish in my
opinion<00:03:11.940> that's<00:03:12.270> something<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:12.720> needs<00:03:12.870> to

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
opinion that's something that needs to

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.710 
opinion that's something that needs to
be<00:03:13.350> sorted<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.730> yeah<00:03:15.000> that's<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.390> first<00:03:15.600> thing
