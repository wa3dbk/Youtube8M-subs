 14 In my people, let's talk now. 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.340
 on this issue of Cuban doctors 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.279
 itamaraty our patriot our 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.100
 Minister right in our chancellor our 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.490
 mate wants Brazil to import people see 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.640
 in dilma 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.599
 import to supply the deficiency 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.950
 our health 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.660
 around six thousand doctors in Cuba 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.360
 he is well I am seeing here in the comment 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.879
 the Estado some interesting the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.789
 Cuban doctors would come as a provider of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.800
 service to the Brazilian government with 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.750
 temporary contract of two to three years 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.100
 signed by the Pan American organization 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.079
 opas 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.910
 as the law requires the revalidation of 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.440
 diploma of these professionals so that 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.600
 they can work here 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.829
 This is what health care has been trying since the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.680
 last year negotiate with the board 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.739
 Federal medicine is a 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.040
 cooperation which has great potential and 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.780
 we contribute a great strategic value 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.340
 and tell me what you said patriot 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.270
 I am understanding that the strategic value 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.549
 is the one that both strategically important 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.409
 would those doctors who would have 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.110
 should see here since we have deficits 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.150
 net lack of doctors inside wanted 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.030
 be only in Cuba because it is important 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.250
 also Spain is missing there 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.500
 left over, people are missing Brazil 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.600
 We can import from other Latin countries. 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.880
 Americans who want to send hand over 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.909
 because it's your fault and 6 thousand 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.600
 a lot of people, that does not make me think 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.540
 And to remind you, all of you are 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.560
 watching now under the following 6 thousand 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.020
 cubans 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.829
 a few years ago or less than 20 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.610
 years in African countries as well. 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:02:00.030
 angola is not like like mozambique 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.479
 have had Cuban medical advisors and 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.009
 other people and even had clutches 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.580
 with assistance from such people 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.000
 we are also at risk of 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.660
 see these people these professionals 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.840
 concentrates from a single country 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.910
 so that our Brazil in the whole interior 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.630
 have spread end to end 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.230
 nation or the nation of notes the leixÃµes 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:30.670
 of our nation 6 thousand people of one 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.180
 Country was thinking right? 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.110
 I think we have a strategic and 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.190
 I'm patriot 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.440
 our beginning likes to remember that this 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.620
 phrase here is dangerous is still behind 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.490
 cooperation has great potential to 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.220
 4 have a great strategic value 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.290
 strategic because someone is thinking 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.310
 something strategy there 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:01.530
 the strategy can be anything 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.530
 Also, who can put it, we can talk 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.780

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.340
 Cad Lips 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.489
 but not only Cubans also ask attention 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:21.620
