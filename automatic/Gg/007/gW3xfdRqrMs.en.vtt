00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.510
 here 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:23.470
 it happens that they love to cut wood somewhere 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.330
 the trees it could be the city limits even 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:30.780
 somewhere near you a tray 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:33.460
 and suddenly you see that cut down for example 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.190
 some tree from which you would like 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.870
 cut and respectively of course if 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:45.280
 you understand what to cut it now 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:48.430
 just in the trash in fact possible 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:53.350
 most likely it is in general, then probably even 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.420
 and it would be good to use it all here 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.830
 some good things and just 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.500
 humanly with me this 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:04.500
 if you need to do the same sculptural work 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:07.690
 where you can get it 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.220
 you can buy loads and stick together 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.850
 were looking to cut out 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:17.020
 logs here is accordingly if the raw 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:24.760
 log then as a procurement option and water 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:31.230
 it is to remove the bark from it so that it can 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:35.050
 be their ends paint over 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:38.020
 on the contrary so that she does not owl very quickly 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.350
 because otherwise there will be quickly 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.400
 cracks and in general she 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.940
 everything can crack so dances and 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.740
 can be painted with oil paint 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.110
 aqa.ru of course remove because if 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.180
 Garudo remove and paint over the ends then she 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.990
 just be procure 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.550
 or from all sides and well, it's probably 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.890
 heat will likely 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:13.290
 or at least the devil will dry 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:17.790
 knows how much at the end we leave 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:22.280
 somewhere probably 15 10 15 20 centimeters 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.570
 to again butt 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.959
 protect as if there is a side 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.140
 here 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.140
 protects against drying too fast and 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.739
 respectively from shook 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:04.130
 I know all my life with a brush in general 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.080
 but why is it when the log paint over 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.840
 the ends 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.140
 I want to take a spatula and because 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.930
 the best there is a spatula to wipe then 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.630
 much easier than 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:24.230
 brush to wash well because if 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:28.530
 I understand that you have not washed your brush 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:32.460
 as follows and then they can 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.610
 throw out could be a long wrap 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:41.760
 solvent and own version of such 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:43.850
 moth of course here is just an ordinary artist 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:50.280
 there may not be enough thinner 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:52.590
 or there we are water and acetone is either 646 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.310
 any x go long enough from 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.560
 a little good smell like dog and all 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.820
 there is no guarantee that you will wash off 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.580
 should unless you put a fool 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:08.040
 so if there is a possibility with a spatula 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.819
 It seems to be obtained of course in this 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.739
 respect 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.739
 these are much simpler
