but now that the show's survived against
all<00:02:12.080> other<00:02:12.680> shows<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.280> we<00:02:13.370> succeeded<00:02:14.050> not

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
all other shows and we succeeded not

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.559 
all other shows and we succeeded not
because<00:02:15.379> we're<00:02:15.560> Latino<00:02:15.680> but<00:02:16.330> because<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.420> adds

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
because we're Latino but because it adds
