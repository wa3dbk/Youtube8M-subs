been<00:05:04.390> out<00:05:04.540> there<00:05:04.660> for<00:05:04.720> a<00:05:04.900> while<00:05:05.020> so<00:05:05.890> maybe<00:05:06.070> not

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
been out there for a while so maybe not

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:18.060

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
available you might want to check that

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.760
