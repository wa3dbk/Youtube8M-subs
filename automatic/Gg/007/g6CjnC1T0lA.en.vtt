00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
tutorials for the game engine we're

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.860 
tutorials for the game engine we're
going<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:14.969> be<00:00:15.059> printing<00:00:15.330> stuff<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.750> the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
up with this python console stuff we're

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.799 
up with this python console stuff we're
working<00:00:41.700> with<00:00:41.820> isn't<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.360> show<00:00:42.540> up<00:00:42.690> in

working with isn't going to show up in

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.389 
working with isn't going to show up in
there<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.260> for<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.530> run<00:00:43.770> commands

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
there this is for you to run commands

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.630 
there this is for you to run commands
and<00:00:44.610> test<00:00:45.270> out<00:00:45.450> scripts<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:47.219> might<00:00:47.430> be

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and test out scripts that you might be

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.540 
and test out scripts that you might be
running<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.660> not<00:00:48.840> actually<00:00:49.309> warning<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
running but not actually warning in the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.100 
running but not actually warning in the
game<00:00:50.789> already<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:53.000> let's<00:00:54.000> go<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.539> open<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.960> our

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
game already so let's go and open up our

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.900 
game already so let's go and open up our
text<00:00:55.530> editor<00:00:55.649> here<00:00:56.100> once<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.610> create<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
text editor here once we can create a

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.729 
text editor here once we can create a
new<00:00:56.940> text<00:00:57.329> we'll<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.440> call<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.969> my<00:00:59.969> print

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
new text we'll just call this my print

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.250 
new text we'll just call this my print
and<00:01:01.739> we<00:01:01.949> will<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.149> enable<00:01:03.600> those<00:01:03.750> things

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
and we will like to enable those things

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.670 
and we will like to enable those things
okay<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.880> we're<00:01:06.030> going<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> do<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.900> we<00:01:07.650> are

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
okay so we're going to do here is we are

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.510 
okay so we're going to do here is we are
going<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.280> once<00:01:09.150> again<00:01:09.740> import<00:01:10.740> under<00:01:11.340> game

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
going to once again import under game

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.740 
going to once again import under game
engine<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:14.119> that's<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> only<00:01:15.390> way<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
engine and that's not the only way to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.960 
engine and that's not the only way to
import<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> that's<00:01:17.189> I'm<00:01:17.460> trying<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.790> stay

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
import it that's I'm trying to stay

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.539 
import it that's I'm trying to stay
consistent<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.780> another<00:01:19.170> two<00:01:19.350> relevant<00:01:19.860> just

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
consistent in another two relevant just

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.090 
consistent in another two relevant just
you<00:01:20.640> know<00:01:20.700> what<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:21.090> said<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.990> define<00:01:22.439> main

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
you know what I just said so define main

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.260 
you know what I just said so define main
we're<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> define<00:01:23.700> our<00:01:23.729> main<00:01:24.000> function

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
we're going to define our main function

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.310 
we're going to define our main function
for<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.290> script<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.930> then<00:01:27.930> we're<00:01:28.140> going<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
for this script and then we're going to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.590 
for this script and then we're going to
create<00:01:28.890> our<00:01:29.070> controller<00:01:29.579> once<00:01:30.240> again<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.540> is

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
create our controller once again this is

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.819 
create our controller once again this is
like<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.350> 4th<00:01:31.530> or<00:01:31.770> 5th<00:01:31.799> video<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.329> series

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
like the 4th or 5th video in this series

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.830 
like the 4th or 5th video in this series
so<00:01:34.829> if<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.030> don't<00:01:36.180> understand<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> stuff

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
so if you don't understand the stuff

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.249 
so if you don't understand the stuff
that<00:01:37.020> I'm<00:01:37.079> typing<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.799> far<00:01:40.040> be<00:01:41.040> sure<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:42.259> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
that I'm typing so far be sure to to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.030 
that I'm typing so far be sure to to
watch<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.649> previous<00:01:43.890> tutorials

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
watch the previous tutorials

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.390 
watch the previous tutorials
current<00:01:47.320> controller<00:01:50.800> so<00:01:51.800> we<00:01:51.890> created<00:01:52.280> our

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
current controller so we created our

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.530 
current controller so we created our
controller<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.420> uh<00:01:54.850> really<00:01:55.850> for<00:01:56.090> now<00:01:56.210> let's

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
controller and uh really for now let's

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.670 
controller and uh really for now let's
just<00:01:56.600> do<00:01:57.520> print<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:58.820> inside<00:01:59.510> parentheses<00:02:00.230> and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
just do print and inside parentheses and

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.600 
just do print and inside parentheses and
inside<00:02:01.190> quotation<00:02:01.460> silver<00:02:02.240> string<00:02:03.610> hello

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
inside quotation silver string hello

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.100 
inside quotation silver string hello
world<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:08.710> then<00:02:09.710> we'll<00:02:09.890> run<00:02:10.100> our<00:02:10.250> main

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
world and then we'll run our main

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.920 
world and then we'll run our main
function<00:02:12.110> here<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:13.390> what<00:02:14.390> we're<00:02:14.510> going<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:14.810> do

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
function here and what we're going to do

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.130 
function here and what we're going to do
is<00:02:17.050> just<00:02:18.050> like<00:02:18.230> any<00:02:18.260> other<00:02:18.470> tutorials<00:02:20.140> split

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
is just like any other tutorials split

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.170 
is just like any other tutorials split
this<00:02:21.410> make<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.130> our<00:02:22.370> logic<00:02:22.850> editor<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:25.180> then

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
this make this our logic editor and then

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.090 
this make this our logic editor and then
we're<00:02:26.510> going<00:02:26.690> with<00:02:26.930> our<00:02:26.959> cube<00:02:27.320> select<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:27.950> and

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
we're going with our cube select it and

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.530 
we're going with our cube select it and
really<00:02:28.340> at<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:28.820> point<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.180> doesn't<00:02:29.300> matter

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
really at this point it doesn't matter

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.970 
really at this point it doesn't matter
what<00:02:29.720> objects<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.380> just<00:02:30.530> want<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.740> run<00:02:30.860> the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
what objects I just want to run the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.460 
what objects I just want to run the
script<00:02:31.310> what<00:02:32.270> I'm<00:02:32.360> going<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.510> say<00:02:32.690> always<00:02:33.170> I'm

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
script what I'm going to say always I'm

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.930 
script what I'm going to say always I'm
going<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.680> connect<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.160> our<00:02:34.580> Python

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
going to connect that to our Python

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.380 
going to connect that to our Python
script<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.580> I'm<00:02:37.580> going<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.820> connect<00:02:38.090> that

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
script and I'm going to connect that

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.410 
script and I'm going to connect that
there<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.400> now<00:02:40.400> at<00:02:40.760> this<00:02:40.940> point<00:02:41.120> I'm<00:02:41.270> not

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
there and now at this point I'm not

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.030 
there and now at this point I'm not
going<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.900> put<00:02:42.890> on<00:02:43.010> pulse<00:02:43.430> mode<00:02:43.760> but<00:02:44.890> here<00:02:45.890> is

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
going to put on pulse mode but here is

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.540 
going to put on pulse mode but here is
our<00:02:46.190> terminal<00:02:46.760> oh<00:02:47.440> there<00:02:48.440> we<00:02:48.560> go<00:02:48.590> our<00:02:48.950> terminal

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
our terminal oh there we go our terminal

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.220 
our terminal oh there we go our terminal
so<00:02:50.480> now<00:02:50.720> when<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.560> go<00:02:52.010> into<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:53.630> game<00:02:53.810> mode<00:02:54.200> here

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
so now when I go into the game mode here

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.940 
so now when I go into the game mode here
and<00:02:54.830> press<00:02:55.220> P<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:56.630> we<00:02:56.810> tab<00:02:57.200> over<00:02:57.500> here<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:57.830> can

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
and press P and we tab over here you can

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.590 
and press P and we tab over here you can
see<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.130> printed<00:02:58.519> hello<00:02:59.030> world<00:02:59.269> in<00:02:59.480> the

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
see a printed hello world in the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.530 
see a printed hello world in the
terminal<00:03:00.310> now<00:03:01.310> if<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:01.549> tab<00:03:01.730> back<00:03:01.970> here<00:03:02.239> I'll<00:03:02.330> end

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
terminal now if I tab back here I'll end

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.330 
terminal now if I tab back here I'll end
that<00:03:02.840> game<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:03.290> I'll<00:03:03.410> turn<00:03:03.590> on<00:03:03.739> pulse<00:03:04.040> mode

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
that game and I'll turn on pulse mode

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.150 
that game and I'll turn on pulse mode
and<00:03:05.140> start<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.260> game<00:03:06.380> up<00:03:06.530> again<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:07.010> you'll

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
and start the game up again and you'll

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.910 
and start the game up again and you'll
see<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:07.580> it's<00:03:08.060> constantly<00:03:08.720> writing<00:03:09.500> hello

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
see that it's constantly writing hello

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.350 
see that it's constantly writing hello
world<00:03:10.310> over<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.700> over<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.000> over<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.239> over

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
world over and over and over and over

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.680 
world over and over and over and over
and<00:03:11.570> over<00:03:11.660> again<00:03:12.220> so<00:03:13.220> that<00:03:13.549> is<00:03:14.239> how<00:03:14.330> we<00:03:14.390> print

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
and over again so that is how we print

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.789 
and over again so that is how we print
something<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.049> console<00:03:15.440> but<00:03:15.620> let's

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
something to the console but let's

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.650 
something to the console but let's
that's<00:03:16.040> just<00:03:16.220> printing<00:03:16.519> a<00:03:16.580> string<00:03:16.970> let's

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
that's just printing a string let's

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.259 
that's just printing a string let's
print<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:18.019> little<00:03:18.230> bit<00:03:18.470> more<00:03:18.709> information

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
print a little bit more information

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.259 
print a little bit more information
let's<00:03:20.269> print<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:22.100> location<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.989> the

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
let's print the location of the

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.789 
let's print the location of the
exposition<00:03:26.269> of<00:03:26.450> our<00:03:26.870> cube<00:03:27.260> or<00:03:27.500> whatever

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
exposition of our cube or whatever

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.520 
exposition of our cube or whatever
object<00:03:28.250> we<00:03:28.370> link<00:03:28.580> this<00:03:28.790> script<00:03:28.850> to<00:03:29.360> so<00:03:30.350> what

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
object we link this script to so what

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.990 
object we link this script to so what
we'll<00:03:30.620> do<00:03:30.769> here<00:03:30.799> is<00:03:31.489> before<00:03:32.030> print<00:03:32.360> will<00:03:32.540> say

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
we'll do here is before print will say

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.470 
we'll do here is before print will say
owner<00:03:35.530> equals<00:03:36.530> control<00:03:37.310> dot<00:03:37.610> owner<00:03:37.910> once

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
owner equals control dot owner once

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.539 
owner equals control dot owner once
again<00:03:38.630> this<00:03:38.870> is<00:03:39.220> going<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.280> be<00:03:40.370> whatever

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
again this is going to be whatever

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.640 
again this is going to be whatever
object<00:03:41.150> we've<00:03:41.360> linked<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:42.019> this<00:03:42.140> script<00:03:42.560> in

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
object we've linked to this script in

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.740 
object we've linked to this script in
this<00:03:42.769> case<00:03:42.980> our<00:03:43.280> cube<00:03:44.239> there<00:03:44.570> and<00:03:46.510> then<00:03:47.510> what

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
this case our cube there and then what

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.860 
this case our cube there and then what
we<00:03:47.840> can<00:03:47.870> do<00:03:48.080> is<00:03:48.350> we<00:03:48.590> can<00:03:48.620> say<00:03:48.980> print<00:03:49.870> inside

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
we can do is we can say print inside

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.680 
we can do is we can say print inside
parentheses<00:03:51.530> we<00:03:51.860> can<00:03:52.040> put

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
parentheses we can put

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:01.080 
parentheses we can put
owner<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:55.010> object<00:03:56.140> dot<00:03:57.160> local<00:03:59.290> position<00:04:00.290> I

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
owner the object dot local position I

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.580 
owner the object dot local position I
spells<00:04:02.090> position<00:04:02.630> right<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:02.990> think<00:04:03.230> I<00:04:03.350> did

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
spells position right I think I did

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.270 
spells position right I think I did
let's<00:04:03.920> find<00:04:04.160> out<00:04:05.140> there<00:04:06.140> we<00:04:06.350> go<00:04:06.530> its<00:04:07.040> position

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
let's find out there we go its position

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.600 
let's find out there we go its position
is<00:04:07.990> 00000<00:04:11.110> move<00:04:12.110> it<00:04:12.230> up<00:04:12.350> there<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.860> we<00:04:13.430> will

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
is 00000 move it up there and we will

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.420 
is 00000 move it up there and we will
run<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:14.750> script<00:04:15.050> or<00:04:15.320> run<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.620> game<00:04:15.770> again<00:04:16.160> and

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
run the script or run the game again and

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.680 
run the script or run the game again and
now<00:04:16.640> you<00:04:16.700> can<00:04:16.880> see<00:04:17.090> it's<00:04:17.209> in<00:04:17.360> a<00:04:17.450> different

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
now you can see it's in a different

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.260 
now you can see it's in a different
position<00:04:19.510> okay<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:21.400> we<00:04:22.400> can<00:04:22.520> also<00:04:22.670> combine

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
position okay and we can also combine

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:30.010 
position okay and we can also combine
that<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:24.020> we<00:04:24.260> can<00:04:24.410> say<00:04:24.800> a<00:04:28.540> string<00:04:29.540> such<00:04:29.810> as

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
that and we can say a string such as

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:39.010 
that and we can say a string such as
object's<00:04:32.230> position<00:04:34.690> is<00:04:36.970> and<00:04:37.970> then<00:04:38.210> we'll<00:04:38.420> do<00:04:38.690> a

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
object's position is and then we'll do a

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.070 
object's position is and then we'll do a
comma<00:04:39.440> here<00:04:39.590> I<00:04:40.450> think<00:04:41.450> that<00:04:41.510> will<00:04:41.780> work<00:04:43.420> yes<00:04:44.420> so

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
comma here I think that will work yes so

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.990 
comma here I think that will work yes so
it<00:04:45.170> says<00:04:45.380> object's<00:04:45.920> position<00:04:46.100> that<00:04:46.790> says

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
it says object's position that says

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.900 
it says object's position that says
vector<00:04:47.570> blah<00:04:48.080> blah<00:04:48.290> blah<00:04:48.320> blah<00:04:48.500> blah<00:04:48.920> now<00:04:49.850> we

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
vector blah blah blah blah blah now we

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.860 
vector blah blah blah blah blah now we
can<00:04:50.240> also<00:04:50.390> you<00:04:50.960> know<00:04:51.430> narrow<00:04:52.430> that<00:04:52.670> down<00:04:52.870> we

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
can also you know narrow that down we

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.710 
can also you know narrow that down we
can<00:04:54.020> save<00:04:54.490> objects<00:04:57.910> exposition<00:04:58.910> and<00:04:59.090> then<00:04:59.570> do

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
can save objects exposition and then do

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.250 
can save objects exposition and then do
not<00:04:59.930> X<00:05:00.230> here<00:05:00.800> for<00:05:01.610> our<00:05:01.880> object's<00:05:02.419> location<00:05:02.480> X

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
not X here for our object's location X

can<00:05:13.870> have<00:05:14.870> that<00:05:15.050> object<00:05:15.560> slowly<00:05:16.160> moves<00:05:16.520> so<00:05:16.850> we

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
can have that object slowly moves so we

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:27.360 
can have that object slowly moves so we
can<00:05:17.180> say<00:05:18.820> owner<00:05:20.200> dot<00:05:22.210> local<00:05:23.919> position<00:05:25.540> dot<00:05:26.540> x

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:33.699 
to the terminal so this is going to

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:35.909 
to the terminal so this is going to
become<00:06:33.789> useful<00:06:34.089> in<00:06:34.479> future<00:06:34.809> tutorials<00:06:35.079> for
