00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
that because it is a little bit

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.560 
that because it is a little bit
different<00:01:41.990> than<00:01:42.109> the<00:01:42.200> factory<00:01:42.670> bushing<00:01:43.670> what

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
different than the factory bushing what

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.569 
different than the factory bushing what
you'll<00:01:44.719> do<00:01:44.899> first<00:01:45.590> off<00:01:45.829> is<00:01:46.009> make<00:01:46.219> sure<00:01:46.369> that

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
you'll do first off is make sure that

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.969 
you'll do first off is make sure that
your<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:47.180> can<00:01:47.329> see<00:01:47.570> clean<00:01:48.289> aluminum<00:01:48.799> right

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
your you can see clean aluminum right

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.010 
your you can see clean aluminum right
here<00:01:49.280> sometimes<00:01:50.240> pieces<00:01:50.509> of<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.930> original

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
here sometimes pieces of the original

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.139 
here sometimes pieces of the original
bushing<00:01:51.770> will<00:01:51.950> will<00:01:52.280> sit<00:01:52.520> down<00:01:52.549> in<00:01:52.670> there<00:01:53.030> and

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
bushing will will sit down in there and

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.149 
bushing will will sit down in there and
not<00:01:53.299> allow<00:01:53.539> the<00:01:53.600> new<00:01:53.840> one<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.590> sit<00:01:54.829> all<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.039> way

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
not allow the new one to sit all the way

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.940 
not allow the new one to sit all the way
down<00:01:55.429> in<00:01:55.640> place<00:01:56.229> so<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:57.320> just<00:01:57.500> drop<00:01:57.710> that<00:01:57.740> in

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
down in place so you just drop that in

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.810 
down in place so you just drop that in
upside<00:01:58.579> down<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.229> put<00:02:00.229> it<00:02:00.320> on<00:02:00.439> those<00:02:00.820> shifter

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
upside down and put it on those shifter

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.149 
upside down and put it on those shifter
pins<00:02:02.119> there<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.570> then<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:03.439> rotate<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.039> around

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
pins there and then you rotate it around

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.480 
pins there and then you rotate it around
those<00:02:04.549> pins<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.619> should<00:02:06.799> snap<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.130> little

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
those pins and it should snap a little
