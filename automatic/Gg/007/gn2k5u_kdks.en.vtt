00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.140
 human attention limited two 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.519
 songs 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.190
 it's seven minutes more people 7 minutes 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.350
 listening to you will be no clear that 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.080
 if you are in your company of friends 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.010
 if you can switch them 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.560
 attention it is clear that if you can 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.289
 engage the audience and use it 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:34.590
 because when a person gets involved he 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.500
 Of course it will be with you for a long time, but if you 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.809
 become and sing 2 slow songs 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.120
 believe you nobody 2 songs slowly 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.239
 listening will not be the most ideal option 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.750
 1 slow 2 fast but again if you 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.270
 do not know how to attract the attention of the audience 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.920
 switch attention use reception 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.930
 performing arts which we 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.530
 at the trainings we work each of them 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.109
 you lose public attention and not because 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.719
 that you are bad but because it works 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.860
 human attention if you do not know how 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.140
 you cannot control him 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.540
 hold onto 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.909
 so if you are new and recently 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.270
 do sing my advice don't sing 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.939
 songs where more than three verses 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:25.049
 don't sing the songs please where is 56 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.130
 couplets if you know that you have this song 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.030
 not processed 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.009
 not made of it can be a performance yes 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.680
 have you not done it interesting not 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.610
 use modulations do not change 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.259
 The accompaniment in one song is not 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.720
 use and dynamic shades 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.950
 pause slowdown t t t t t 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.520
 do not sing more than three verses and better 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.610
 two 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.619
 with the refrain if you see that the audience 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.750
 loses attention 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.329
 stop if you see that you 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.950
 listen carefully and ask continue 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:03.899
 but be sure to involve the third song 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:07.170
 audience you process involve the audience 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.619
 into the process and she will remember the impressions of 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.370
 you as he was at that moment when 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.790
 he sang he will remain forever and he 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.409
 will say this man sings here he is 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.560
 so cool 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.989
 He's playing guitar and you played on 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.480
 3 chords and sang this song just as he 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.299
 screamed and and with you and you sing class 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.819
 that he screamed with you because 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:36.510
 that he was involved in this process 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.579
 and you understand cool he does not understand 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.610
 why are you cool new cool because 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:45.620
 what did you make him take part he 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:50.450
 enjoyed this delicate moment 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.700
 but it is the knowledge of him knowing these 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.329
 subtleties of our human psychology you 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.290
 know how to control yourself and you know how to be 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:04.970
 interesting and you know how to attract 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.970
 the audience and you are always welcome
