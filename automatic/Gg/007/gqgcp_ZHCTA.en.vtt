not<00:00:58.170> make<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> loop<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.520> say<00:00:59.850> oh<00:00:59.879> it's<00:00:59.969> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
not make a loop that just say oh it's a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.420 
not make a loop that just say oh it's a
younger<00:01:00.600> look<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:01.050> think<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:01.770> too<00:01:01.920> quiche<00:01:02.160> in

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
younger look I think it's too quiche in
