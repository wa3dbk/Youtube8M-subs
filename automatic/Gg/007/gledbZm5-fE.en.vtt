00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
nezam is another minecraft video for you

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.109 
nezam is another minecraft video for you
today<00:00:24.769> recently<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.829> posted<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.310> video<00:00:26.429> of<00:00:26.640> a

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
today recently I posted a video of a

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.489 
today recently I posted a video of a
bomber<00:00:27.390> plane<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.929> I<00:00:27.960> showed<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.259> how<00:00:28.439> to

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:28.499 
bomber plane that I showed you how to

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.319 
bomber plane that I showed you how to
build<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.009> so<00:00:29.159> in<00:00:29.339> the<00:00:29.400> comments<00:00:29.820> below<00:00:29.939> so

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:30.329 
build and so in the comments below so

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.120 
build and so in the comments below so
that<00:00:30.480> while<00:00:30.989> you<00:00:31.140> make<00:00:31.319> other<00:00:31.529> planes<00:00:31.890> like

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
that while you make other planes like

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.430 
that while you make other planes like
b-29<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.600> made<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.289> b-29<00:00:35.149> I've<00:00:36.149> done<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> pretty

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
b-29 so I made a b-29 I've done a pretty

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.170 
b-29 so I made a b-29 I've done a pretty
good<00:00:37.559> job<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:38.160> making<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.550> look<00:00:38.789> like<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
good job of making it look like the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.970 
good job of making it look like the
original<00:00:39.660> plane<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.109> scaled<00:00:40.410> down<00:00:40.620> slightly

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
original plane it's scaled down slightly

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.650 
original plane it's scaled down slightly
in<00:00:41.250> Minecraft<00:00:41.699> just<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.390> wouldn't<00:00:42.600> be

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
in Minecraft just so it wouldn't be

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.650 
in Minecraft just so it wouldn't be
massive<00:00:43.109> I<00:00:43.289> have<00:00:44.039> the<00:00:44.190> back<00:00:44.430> fins<00:00:44.730> here<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.300> I

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
massive I have the back fins here and I

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.810 
massive I have the back fins here and I
have<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.079> tapering<00:00:46.590> out<00:00:46.859> like<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.429> original

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
have it tapering out like the original

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.990 
have it tapering out like the original
plane<00:00:48.030> does<00:00:49.010> back<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.340> had<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.789> rear

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
plane does back here I had the rear

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.790 
plane does back here I had the rear
gunner<00:00:51.269> seat<00:00:51.570> even<00:00:51.989> though<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.320> can't<00:00:52.590> shoot

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
gunner seat even though you can't shoot

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.009 
gunner seat even though you can't shoot
arrows<00:00:53.129> from<00:00:53.429> a<00:00:53.489> boat<00:00:53.699> sadly<00:00:54.210> well<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.809> can

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
arrows from a boat sadly well you can

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.419 
arrows from a boat sadly well you can
but<00:00:55.260> they<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.589> hit<00:00:55.679> the<00:00:55.829> wall<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.280> pick

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
but they just hit the wall and you pick

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.599 
but they just hit the wall and you pick
them<00:00:56.489> up<00:00:56.640> again<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.039> mainly<00:00:59.339> for

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
them up again so it's just mainly for

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.369 
them up again so it's just mainly for
show<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.239> were<00:01:00.359> standing<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:01.019> if<00:01:01.230> you

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
show but if you were standing up if you

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.989 
show but if you were standing up if you
could<00:01:01.499> manage<00:01:01.679> to<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.190> stand<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.850> this

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:02.999 
could manage to like stand up in this

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:05.479 
could manage to like stand up in this
thing<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.390> could<00:01:03.539> shoot<00:01:03.690> out<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.929> it<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.949> over

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
thing you could shoot out of it but over

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.920 
thing you could shoot out of it but over
here<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.730> just<00:01:05.880> another<00:01:06.090> passenger<00:01:06.450> seat<00:01:06.810> if

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
here it's just another passenger seat if

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.560 
here it's just another passenger seat if
I<00:01:06.990> don't<00:01:07.170> push<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.680> boat<00:01:08.040> off<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.250> edge

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
I don't push the boat off the edge

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.870 
I don't push the boat off the edge
nothing<00:01:09.570> much<00:01:09.810> going<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.140> there<00:01:10.610> these<00:01:11.610> two

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
nothing much going on there these two

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.969 
nothing much going on there these two
segments<00:01:12.360> right<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:12.659> are<00:01:12.810> where<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.740> main

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
segments right here are where the main

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.859 
segments right here are where the main
part<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.640> bomber<00:01:14.880> plane<00:01:15.240> goes<00:01:15.630> on

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
part of this bomber plane goes on

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.370 
part of this bomber plane goes on
they're<00:01:16.710> both<00:01:16.890> bomber<00:01:17.250> seats<00:01:18.079> very<00:01:19.079> similar

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
they're both bomber seats very similar

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.160 
they're both bomber seats very similar
to<00:01:19.649> my<00:01:19.950> latest<00:01:20.159> design<00:01:20.570> of<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> bomber<00:01:21.899> plane

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to my latest design of the bomber plane

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.010 
to my latest design of the bomber plane
how<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.409> drop<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> bombs<00:01:22.890> there<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.729> there's

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
how you drop the bombs there so there's

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.410 
how you drop the bombs there so there's
each<00:01:25.020> segment<00:01:25.950> has<00:01:26.189> six<00:01:26.520> bombs<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.000> there's<00:01:27.180> 12

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
each segment has six bombs so there's 12

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.420 
each segment has six bombs so there's 12
bombs<00:01:27.630> total<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.229> need<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.860> bomb<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.250> years

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
bombs total so you need to bomb in years

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.249 
bombs total so you need to bomb in years
or<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.939> needs<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.270> move<00:01:30.390> back<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.659> forth<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
or so needs to move back and forth and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.429 
or so needs to move back and forth and
in<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.219> front<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.299> cockpit<00:01:33.659> seat<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
in the front I have a cockpit seat and

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.270 
in the front I have a cockpit seat and
this<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:36.439> you<00:01:37.439> know<00:01:37.469> where<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> pilot

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
this is just you know where the pilot

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.550 
this is just you know where the pilot
would<00:01:38.340> set<00:01:38.579> there<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.850> no<00:01:39.060> copilot<00:01:39.869> or<00:01:39.899> radio

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
would set there is no copilot or radio

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.100 
would set there is no copilot or radio
controller<00:01:41.460> navigator<00:01:42.149> in<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.570> plan<00:01:43.079> I

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
controller navigator in this plan I

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.830 
controller navigator in this plan I
didn't<00:01:43.439> leave<00:01:43.590> any<00:01:43.890> seats<00:01:44.159> with<00:01:44.369> them<00:01:44.490> because

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
didn't leave any seats with them because

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.179 
didn't leave any seats with them because
like<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.960> said<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.320> scaled<00:01:46.590> down<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.070> it's

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
like I said it's scaled down and it's

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.330 
like I said it's scaled down and it's
also<00:01:47.340> necessary<00:01:48.060> minecraft<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.130> want

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
also necessary minecraft so if you want

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.069 
also necessary minecraft so if you want
to<00:01:50.430> check<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.759> out<00:01:50.969> in<00:01:51.119> closer<00:01:51.329> detail<00:01:51.450> there

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
to check this out in closer detail there

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.170 
to check this out in closer detail there
will<00:01:52.259> be<00:01:52.289> a<00:01:52.439> download<00:01:52.890> description<00:01:53.070> below<00:01:53.670> but

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
will be a download description below but

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.969 
will be a download description below but
sadly<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.780> will<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.350> teaching<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.770> how<00:01:55.799> to

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
sadly I will not be teaching you how to

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.260 
sadly I will not be teaching you how to
build<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:56.969> probably<00:01:57.119> guess

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
build this and you can probably guess

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.499 
build this and you can probably guess
why<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.840> rather<00:01:58.500> large<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.399> let's<00:02:00.180> go<00:02:00.359> ahead

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
why is rather large so let's go ahead

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.929 
why is rather large so let's go ahead
and<00:02:00.930> see<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.350> action<00:02:01.640> alright<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:02.909> I

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
and see this in action alright so I

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.090 
and see this in action alright so I
place<00:02:03.240> down<00:02:03.539> this<00:02:04.020> blocker<00:02:04.500> redstone<00:02:05.070> here

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
place down this blocker redstone here

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.190 
place down this blocker redstone here
just<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.119> run<00:02:06.329> now<00:02:06.570> because<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.990> didn't

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
just so it can run now because I didn't

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.919 
just so it can run now because I didn't
want<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.439> fly<00:02:07.649> off<00:02:07.799> without<00:02:07.950> me<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.910> once<00:02:09.810> I

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
want to fly off without me so once I

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.479 
want to fly off without me so once I
start<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.319> up<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.709> think<00:02:10.769> I'm<00:02:10.979> going<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.160> start

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
start this up I think I'm going to start

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.150 
start this up I think I'm going to start
in<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:12.000> Bombers<00:02:12.930> seat<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.379> so<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:13.980> one

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
in the Bombers seat and so this one

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.350 
in the Bombers seat and so this one
steel<00:02:14.430> will<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.940> to

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
steel will have to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.030 
steel will have to
since<00:02:15.690> starting<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.080> plane<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:16.620> saying<00:02:16.920> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
since starting the plane and saying the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.320 
since starting the plane and saying the
bomber<00:02:17.250> seat<00:02:17.550> I'm<00:02:17.700> not<00:02:17.880> going<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.090> do<00:02:18.180> any

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
bomber seat I'm not going to do any

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.000 
bomber seat I'm not going to do any
fancy<00:02:18.600> things<00:02:19.080> because<00:02:19.380> I'm<00:02:19.620> going<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.800> jump

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
fancy things because I'm going to jump

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.980 
fancy things because I'm going to jump
seat<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.550> seat<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.330> I'm<00:02:21.450> going<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.630> stay<00:02:21.840> and

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
seat to seat so I'm going to stay and

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.780 
seat to seat so I'm going to stay and
creative<00:02:22.350> for<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.710> but<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.100> can<00:02:23.280> do<00:02:23.490> this<00:02:23.610> in

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
creative for this but you can do this in

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.180 
creative for this but you can do this in
survival<00:02:24.240> mode<00:02:24.270> also<00:02:25.200> turned<00:02:25.740> down<00:02:25.950> my

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
survival mode also turned down my

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.090 
survival mode also turned down my
all-around<00:02:26.880> sounds<00:02:27.360> 2:10<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.530> hopefully<00:02:28.920> we

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
all-around sounds 2:10 so hopefully we

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.210 
all-around sounds 2:10 so hopefully we
won't<00:02:29.220> be<00:02:29.630> bombarded<00:02:30.630> with<00:02:30.980> Pistons<00:02:31.980> firing

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
won't be bombarded with Pistons firing

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.500 
won't be bombarded with Pistons firing
and<00:02:32.700> hopefully<00:02:33.270> this<00:02:34.020> will<00:02:34.200> not<00:02:34.520> lag<00:02:35.520> horribly

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
and hopefully this will not lag horribly

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.230 
and hopefully this will not lag horribly
so<00:02:36.990> let's<00:02:37.770> start<00:02:38.160> er<00:02:38.250> up<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.910> might<00:02:42.060> look

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
so let's start er up so it might look

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.940 
so let's start er up so it might look
like<00:02:42.300> it's<00:02:42.570> not<00:02:42.750> going<00:02:43.080> in<00:02:43.200> some<00:02:43.380> places<00:02:43.620> but

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
like it's not going in some places but

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.170 
like it's not going in some places but
it<00:02:44.040> really<00:02:44.130> is<00:02:44.340> going<00:02:44.550> just<00:02:44.820> take<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.030> while

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
it really is going just take the while

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.640 
it really is going just take the while
to<00:02:45.360> update<00:02:45.660> yeah<00:02:45.930> see<00:02:46.230> there<00:02:46.440> we<00:02:46.530> go<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:48.660> I'm

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
to update yeah see there we go so I'm

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.790 
to update yeah see there we go so I'm
going<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.830> hop<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.220> conceit<00:02:51.470> magic<00:02:52.470> getting

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
going to hop the conceit magic getting

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.350 
going to hop the conceit magic getting
all<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.430> stuff<00:02:53.910> going

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.070 

right<00:02:58.930> there

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
right there

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
so I'm just going to go ahead and drop a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.690 
so I'm just going to go ahead and drop a
couple<00:03:02.330> bombs<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:03.470> floor<00:03:03.770> moves<00:03:04.070> a<00:03:04.430> little

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
couple bombs the floor moves a little

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.850 
couple bombs the floor moves a little
faster<00:03:05.240> than<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.450> wall<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.020> you<00:03:06.410> can't<00:03:06.680> see

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
faster than the wall so you can't see

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:17.670 
faster than the wall so you can't see
the<00:03:06.980> wall<00:03:07.190> fluctuate<00:03:07.790> appears

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
world because it was easier than

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.330 
world because it was easier than
