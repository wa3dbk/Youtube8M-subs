00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.779
 as we can see here we have here 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.650
 a bmw z4 35i and i want you here 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.549
 the comfort access speak keyless go 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.980
 Imagine you see I have that 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.179
 key here now beats or stuck 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.220
 because now just in my 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.200
 trouser pocket and do not look at it 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.410
 do and if I go here now 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.720
 that is quite interesting to see here 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.510
 I hope the camera the net of course 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.250
 not right where I test times 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:34.079
 not installed so if here 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.519
 devices and with this one can 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.969
 open and close the car 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.499
 that is, you see , tie up 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.649
 and if I'm here now only briefly 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:45.449
 he wants to touch again so close 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.960
 about it is only complete the sorry 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.059
 my mistake 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.800
 and now if I shake hands here 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.690
 handle recess I've seen directly 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.379
 peter knopp high to finish easy 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.339
 only touch again says goes 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:04.140
 directly and close again 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:06.330
 yes and it did not react that way then 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.230
 fits that directly and accordingly 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.910
 Of course, we have those too 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.540
 possibility conclusions as I said here 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:16.340
 continue in the trouser pocket just to 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.040
 tapping the city ​​states navi is coming up 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.720
 Of course there is the error message 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.990
 Ignition turned on clearly that one door 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.100
 close in this case also not 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.080
 Of course, now start easily 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.490
 that's not a topic I want now 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.280
 Do not necessarily do that because I'm straight 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.750
 not negotiated yes but accordingly 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.190
 it works really great and when 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.870
 get off and complete as you can see 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.600
 I deliberately leave the navi up 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:47.220
 almost not 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.420
 now the door press the button and if 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.220
 he purely looks then drives 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.650
 navigation system down and the whole 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.910
 system is switched off 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.800
 So that's really the case with the fiasco 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.210
 a fine thing you need the 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.520
 really not even stronger 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.500
 Protecting can really be full 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.860
 and very free with hands so much fun 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.860
 in order to
