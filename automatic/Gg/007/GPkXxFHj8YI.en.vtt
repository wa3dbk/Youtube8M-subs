00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.139
 hello and welcome to roto 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.250
 Today we have a generator again 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.640
 recipe namely green chips chips not 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:28.019
 from potatoes but chips from cabbage 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:30.330
 and curly co looks like that when 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.030
 you paint it so often you tried 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.700
 does not taste very interesting 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.020
 maybe interesting but not so 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.440
 Somewhere you say I 'm glad 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.350
 even if I can get out again 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.280
 It is more of a tedious task then 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.050
 brewery but if you have this cabbage 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.850
 marinated then he is the same 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.670
 softer and then when you have the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.280
 marinated cabbage still indicator sets 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.160
 this is a usa as fried 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.120
 version is often offered namely no 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.010
 chip scale is cool in English and we 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.580
 make a version with one now 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.970
 I already have vinaigrette 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:17.299
 that is easy 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:22.860
 just lemon juice vinegar lemon juice 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:25.530
 olive oil apple cider vinegar and a herbal mixa 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.970
 dried herbs of provence pinch 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.970
 salt and that 's it 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.270
 Now you have to learn about these 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.390
 cabbage leaves only the games off 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.190
 they are quite thick and they will 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.200
 also dry but then I did not like that 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.190
 important that chips experience because of that 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.010
 you just leave the leaves from the 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.830
 For example, we can combine rods in one 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.710
 juice will continue to be used in gentler 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.260
 should have or mixa and too 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.890
 A must have milk bag sales 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.960
 to do 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.470
 otherwise they just come on the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.470
 compost 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:11.340
 the rate is set to 45 degrees and will 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.890
 then look over in 25 hours and 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.340
 see if the chips are already crispy 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.020
 dry 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.720
 I wish you much fun 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.090
 imitate and it should succeed 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.960
 hard to be and acknowledged and still 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.960
 a beautiful day
