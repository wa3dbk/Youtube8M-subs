00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.670 
but I mean it was just like it's just
like<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.219> day<00:03:30.079> only<00:03:31.079> there<00:03:31.379> was<00:03:31.469> more

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
like that day only there was more

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.140 
like that day only there was more
engines<00:03:32.069> trend<00:03:32.310> behind<00:03:32.609> it<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:32.879> they<00:03:33.090> were

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
engines trend behind it and they were

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.710 
engines trend behind it and they were
actually<00:03:33.389> pretty<00:03:33.599> good<00:03:33.870> engines

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
actually pretty good engines

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.610
