00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
be deeply flawed probably I mean it's

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.440

just<00:02:35.280> kind<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.700> feeling<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.030> get<00:02:36.180> from<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
just kind of a feeling I get from the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.030 
just kind of a feeling I get from the
trailer<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.050> looks<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.620> short<00:02:37.920> on

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040

story<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.850> also<00:02:39.390> cheap<00:02:40.260> for<00:02:40.530> some<00:02:40.710> reason<00:02:41.010> I

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
story and also cheap for some reason I

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.320 
story and also cheap for some reason I
mean<00:02:41.190> obviously<00:02:41.340> they<00:02:41.670> spend<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:41.940> lot<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.150> money

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
mean obviously they spend a lot of money

it<00:02:42.510> has<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.660> lot<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.870> special<00:02:43.080> effects<00:02:43.590> but

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250
