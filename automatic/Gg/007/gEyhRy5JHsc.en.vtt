00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.369 
about I mean you can you can break it
all<00:02:20.190> up<00:02:20.220> but<00:02:20.580> there's<00:02:20.940> no<00:02:21.569> need<00:02:21.750> usually<00:02:22.140> just

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
all up but there's no need usually just

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.199 
all up but there's no need usually just
leave<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.069> there<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.430> just<00:02:23.790> cover<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.060> up

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
leave it there and just cover it up

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.150 
leave it there and just cover it up
maybe<00:02:25.550> another<00:02:26.550> thing<00:02:26.819> with<00:02:27.120> about<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.599> minor

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
maybe another thing with about the minor

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.350 
maybe another thing with about the minor
by<00:02:29.160> taking<00:02:29.760> out<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.569> mining<00:02:31.049> pipe<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:32.360> all

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
by taking out the mining pipe and all

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.830 
by taking out the mining pipe and all
the<00:02:33.510> stuff<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:34.019> can<00:02:34.400> retract<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:39.690> rest

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
the stuff you can retract the the rest

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.940 
the stuff you can retract the the rest
of<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.959> mining<00:02:40.170> pipe<00:02:40.319> and<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.560> will<00:02:40.680> go<00:02:40.769> in<00:02:40.860> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
of the mining pipe and I will go in the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.820 
of the mining pipe and I will go in the
chest<00:02:41.160> if<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.120> want<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.450> retrieve<00:02:43.200> your<00:02:43.379> items

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
chest if you want to retrieve your items

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.039 
chest if you want to retrieve your items
so<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.010> can<00:02:44.160> reuse<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.540> mining<00:02:45.540> pipe<00:02:47.569> then<00:02:48.569> we

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
so you can reuse the mining pipe then we

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.319 
so you can reuse the mining pipe then we
have<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.260> quarry<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:50.180> very<00:02:51.180> powerful<00:02:51.420> tool

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
have the quarry a very powerful tool

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:59.420 
have the quarry a very powerful tool
from<00:02:55.040> BuildCraft<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.940> also<00:02:57.209> requires<00:02:57.950> my<00:02:58.950> my

made a included one of those things in
there<00:07:06.550> there<00:07:07.550> we<00:07:07.640> go<00:07:07.790> and<00:07:08.000> it<00:07:08.750> will<00:07:09.170> go<00:07:09.380> in<00:07:09.620> this

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:09.980 
there there we go and it will go in this

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.650 
there there we go and it will go in this
direction<00:07:10.040> now<00:07:10.490> you<00:07:10.970> can<00:07:11.120> fill<00:07:11.270> around<00:07:11.570> with

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:11.660 
direction now you can fill around with

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.930 
direction now you can fill around with
it<00:07:11.780> and<00:07:11.990> control<00:07:12.830> it<00:07:12.950> however<00:07:13.130> you<00:07:13.490> wish<00:07:13.640> and

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
it and control it however you wish and

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.630 
it and control it however you wish and
it<00:07:14.930> will<00:07:15.080> just<00:07:15.320> keep<00:07:15.680> going<00:07:16.010> and<00:07:16.100> mining<00:07:16.490> down

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:16.640 
it will just keep going and mining down

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.530 
it will just keep going and mining down
I<00:07:16.880> made<00:07:17.360> this<00:07:17.870> cavern<00:07:18.650> here<00:07:18.770> before<00:07:19.180> but<00:07:20.180> see

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:20.540 
I made this cavern here before but see

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.570 
I made this cavern here before but see
as<00:07:20.780> you<00:07:20.900> can<00:07:21.020> see<00:07:21.169> here<00:07:21.380> it<00:07:21.560> simply<00:07:22.100> mines<00:07:22.310> down

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.580 
as you can see here it simply mines down

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.550 
as you can see here it simply mines down
and<00:07:23.440> puts<00:07:24.440> the<00:07:25.360> things<00:07:26.360> and<00:07:26.510> mines<00:07:26.690> out<00:07:26.930> into
