grounds<00:02:26.650> not<00:02:26.770> bad<00:02:26.980> at<00:02:27.100> all<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:27.940> pushed<00:02:28.210> this

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
grounds not bad at all so I pushed this

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.950 
grounds not bad at all so I pushed this
in<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.690> ground

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
in the ground

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.740 
in the ground
about<00:02:29.080> 4<00:02:29.350> feet<00:02:29.710> and<00:02:30.070> I've<00:02:30.330> tugged<00:02:31.330> on<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.720> a

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
about 4 feet and I've tugged on it a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.230 
about 4 feet and I've tugged on it a
little<00:02:31.930> bit<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.890> shouldn't<00:02:33.280> go<00:02:33.370> anywhere<00:02:33.550> I'm

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
little bit it shouldn't go anywhere I'm

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.620 
little bit it shouldn't go anywhere I'm
going<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.570> attach<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:37.860> fencing<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.300> and

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
going to attach that fencing to it and

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.200 
going to attach that fencing to it and
stretch<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.350> will<00:02:41.830> be<00:02:41.950> back<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.790> tapped<00:02:43.060> it

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
stretch it will be back so I tapped it

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.130 
stretch it will be back so I tapped it
down<00:02:44.040> all<00:02:45.040> around<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.400> pole<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.910> also<00:02:46.150> filled

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
down all around the pole I also filled

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.500 
down all around the pole I also filled
in<00:02:47.320> dirt<00:02:48.310> on<00:02:48.550> this<00:02:48.730> side<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.210> foot<00:02:49.390> before

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
in dirt on this side of the foot before

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.270 
in dirt on this side of the foot before
stamped<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.350> down<00:02:50.500> good<00:02:50.770> tempted<00:02:51.460> where<00:02:52.060> this

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
stamped it down good tempted where this

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.250 
stamped it down good tempted where this
is<00:02:54.280> touching<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.240> shore<00:02:55.480> before<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:55.960> pushing

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
is touching the shore before so pushing

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.620 
is touching the shore before so pushing
against<00:02:56.560> foot<00:02:56.770> before<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.910> most<00:02:58.210> stretch<00:02:58.390> fans

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
against foot before so most stretch fans

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.050 
against foot before so most stretch fans
we'll<00:02:58.840> see<00:02:58.990> how<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.200> goes

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
we'll see how it goes

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.350 
we'll see how it goes
it<00:03:01.060> looks<00:03:01.240> pretty<00:03:01.360> good<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.910> there's<00:03:04.090> fence

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
it looks pretty good so there's fence

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
it looks pretty good so there's fence
post<00:03:04.630> got<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.650> all<00:03:05.740> stretched<00:03:06.900> down<00:03:07.900> there<00:03:08.260> and

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
post got it all stretched down there and

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.350 
post got it all stretched down there and
it's<00:03:11.380> about<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.590> 90<00:03:12.250> foot<00:03:12.280> stretch<00:03:12.700> not<00:03:13.090> much

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
it's about a 90 foot stretch not much

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.050 
it's about a 90 foot stretch not much
but<00:03:13.750> sometimes<00:03:14.290> those<00:03:14.500> small<00:03:15.460> stretches<00:03:15.760> can

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
but sometimes those small stretches can

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.260 
but sometimes those small stretches can
be<00:03:16.180> even<00:03:16.450> harder<00:03:16.800> on<00:03:17.800> a<00:03:18.100> post<00:03:18.430> because<00:03:19.120> you're

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
trying to get them so tight because they

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.320 
trying to get them so tight because they

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
spring back a little bit and the post

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.260 
spring back a little bit and the post

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
a wedge down there like I did before

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.510 
a wedge down there like I did before
it's<00:03:37.510> really<00:03:37.660> not<00:03:37.900> much<00:03:38.140> it's<00:03:38.440> almost<00:03:39.750> almost

it's really not much it's almost almost

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.150 
it's really not much it's almost almost

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160

there<00:03:59.520> that<00:04:00.520> in<00:04:00.700> lock<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.360> down<00:04:01.480> I<00:04:01.780> put<00:04:02.500> some

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
there that in lock it down I put some

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.770 
there that in lock it down I put some
kind<00:04:02.890> of<00:04:02.920> Locker<00:04:03.160> mechanism<00:04:04.150> right<00:04:04.330> there<00:04:04.600> I

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
kind of Locker mechanism right there I

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.350 
kind of Locker mechanism right there I
think<00:04:05.770> I've<00:04:06.160> got<00:04:06.370> all<00:04:06.400> that<00:04:06.760> had<00:04:06.940> been<00:04:07.090> given

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
put it to use one of these days you

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.240 
put it to use one of these days you
never<00:04:11.320> know<00:04:11.550> anyway<00:04:12.550> I<00:04:12.700> think<00:04:12.820> this<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.240> uh<00:04:13.270> I

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250

never know anyway I think this is uh I
think<00:04:15.250> this<00:04:15.580> is<00:04:15.640> good<00:04:16.140> again<00:04:17.140> it's<00:04:17.380> just<00:04:17.650> as

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
think this is good again it's just as

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.430 
think this is good again it's just as
maybe<00:04:18.489> a<00:04:18.609> little<00:04:18.880> bit<00:04:19.030> off<00:04:19.210> but<00:04:19.690> not<00:04:19.960> a<00:04:20.200> whole

maybe a little bit off but not a whole

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.260 
maybe a little bit off but not a whole
lot<00:04:20.680> not<00:04:21.340> a<00:04:21.400> whole<00:04:21.730> lot

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270
