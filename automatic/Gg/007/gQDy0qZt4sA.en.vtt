00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
believe it was a scripted incident where

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.160 
believe it was a scripted incident where
they<00:00:43.860> were<00:00:44.160> supposed<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.539> different

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
they were supposed to in a different

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.470 
they were supposed to in a different
segment<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.120> script<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.270> what

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
segment they have a script on what

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.680 
segment they have a script on what
they're<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.840> talk<00:00:49.079> about<00:00:50.480> what<00:00:51.480> issue

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
they're going to talk about what issue

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.790 
they're going to talk about what issue
or<00:00:52.110> what<00:00:52.260> they<00:00:52.379> want<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> go<00:00:52.800> into<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.579> I

or what they want to go into then I

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.799

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
think it led what we never saw what

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.979 
think it led what we never saw what
meant<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> artery<00:00:58.680> they<00:00:58.890> anything<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.120> it

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
television I don't agree that floors

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.780 
television I don't agree that floors
should<00:01:58.680> have<00:01:58.800> went<00:01:59.010> that<00:01:59.190> heart<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.640> his

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
should have went that heart of his

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.570 
should have went that heart of his
father<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.510> don't<00:02:01.320> think<00:02:01.380> none<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:01.890> father<00:02:02.160> said

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
father I don't think none as father said

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.550 
father I don't think none as father said
from<00:02:02.850> what<00:02:02.880> they<00:02:03.180> showed<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.720> television<00:02:04.410> was

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
from what they showed on television was

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.280 
from what they showed on television was
enough<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.010> make<00:02:05.040> him<00:02:05.310> go<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.510> level<00:02:06.900> I

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
enough to make him go to that level I

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.230 
enough to make him go to that level I
think<00:02:08.070> he<00:02:08.130> took<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.490> little<00:02:08.610> too<00:02:08.760> far<00:02:11.240> didn't

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
think he took it a little too far didn't

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.670 
think he took it a little too far didn't
probably<00:02:12.540> work<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.810> all<00:02:12.930> out<00:02:12.959> if<00:02:13.290> they<00:02:13.410> haven't
