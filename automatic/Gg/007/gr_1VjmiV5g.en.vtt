00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.270
 hello everyone or here you thought for 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.639
 I'm all Jorge and finally finally you 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.650
 we bring an adn with sniper to the good channel 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.480
 it is a DNA with the sniper 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.619
 dead on the einstein map and good 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.030
 I'm going to tell you a couple of little things 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.830
 about the gameplay since they seem to me 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.080
 quite interesting but 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.429
 first of all we upload an adn with sniper 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.170
 because you told us a long time ago 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.599
 time and in addition I personally also 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.009
 I wanted to see an adn with schnyder and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.170
 I think it was jordi we as an 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.910
 comment for frank click and nothing then 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.100
 I told him a week ago olives that 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.810
 will take out the gameplay and said and done is 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.750
 that gameplay in a couple of days what 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.460
 true is that he fucked up because not only 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.430
 fourth in sneijder and is not bad 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.410
 as you are going to see but it did not cost him 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.510
 it cost a few tests but at a 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.400
 easy as always the bastard plays 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.380
 bitch mother so whatever I asked her I would 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.700
 is going to take out is a bastard and good what 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.650
 I was coming to comment on the gameplay 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.000
 this map or this map is bestial 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.980
 to get the sade in is with 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.049
 snipers I think it's the way 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.270
 easier to remove the DNA with 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.009
 sniper because as you can see is the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.570
 zone is intermediate of the zone map 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.150
 that is completely in the middle of 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.380
 map above is a very high area and 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.520
 the only thing you have to worry about is 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.229
 that nobody comes up 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.149
 you see right now he has uploaded someone 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.700
 to olives and has totally burst 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.770
 a jump and fuck does not seem very 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.659
 simple the idea and very effective at the same time 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.460
 because it is an elevated area which for 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.590
 play with sniper is perfect 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.569
 you have areas of very long bone vision 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.270
 very large zones of vision zones 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.920
 effective long distances and it is not 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.110
 only that you understand almost the whole 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.270
 of the map if you have a 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.310
 respawn and behind you have the other answer 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.200
 the map the only thing that you really do not see in 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.719
 this position are the two corridors of 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.399
 the sides that are simply the two 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.679
 aisles be the people pass from one side to 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.079
 another one on the map for them and really not 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.610
 It is the busiest map so no 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.289
 I know you are seeing the two parts more 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.149
 transited from the map simply for being 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.189
 the two response and in an elevated area 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.659
 in which if you go with a long weapon 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.369
 distance as that card is not you 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.810
 they can do a lot against you just 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.819
 you have to worry as I said 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.500
 that do not rise and not fail many 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.390
 bullets but that's already part of each 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.130
 one and good after this introduction that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.349
 I hope you serve some if you want 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.060
 take out osuna adn with sniper that I do not know is 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.950
 a very easy area and that's why I wanted 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.569
 highlight the advantages that I have 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.530
 I would like to comment a little over the 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.360
 wisco theme but in a way 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.250
 in a different way explaining the 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.390
 how it's supposed to have been patched in 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.800
 this game that really is not 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.600
 patched can still be done 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.220
 quietly but good I'm going to 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.200
 comment a little bit what they have changed 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.180
 with respect to other call of duty 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.160
 because I find it interesting to know 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.020
 exactly what they have done and good 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.330
 really what they have done in order to 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.890
 patch the quiz cop in this game is 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.060
 make the weapon move 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.709
 regardless of who you are 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.000
 pointing or the swing of the weapon is 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.980
 keep producing even if you're not 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.989
 pointing and this you can check very 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.630
 easily if you go to the shooting range 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.400
 and you start to point and stop pointing 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.440
 and you will see that the weapon is still moving 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.820
 when you are not aiming and well this 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.290
 in the other carlos cities it did not happen and 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.209
 that's why it was much easier to do the 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.250
 whiskey although there really is a little trick 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.660
 that I will not explain and nothing to tell you 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.550
 simply that is the way they have 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.080
 had to avoid the quiz code and to 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.700
 To tell you the truth, it works quite well 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.590
 because if you have an enemy to quite 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.569
 long distance with the movement this 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.550
 I'm telling you the bullet is usually 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.170
 go to take for ass however as already 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.030
 I told you before there is a trick to 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.069
 make the bullet go exactly to 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.260
 center of the screen and well this is what 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.329
 that facilitates so to speak of a 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.310
 way pretty pretty beast the subject 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.230
 of whiskey 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.440
 and they use it enough enough 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.780
 players of competitive players 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.459
 clans sniper such as face and 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.890
 in fact its discoverer I think it was 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.380
 face cross or daniel cross can be me 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.270
 it sounds with director's help it seems to me 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.650
 who discovered it cross and then already 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.090
 they did the tests with director that is 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.500
 a youtuber that climbs enough guides and 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.510
 he plays youtuber fucking mother in 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.769
 English by the way that is what it is that 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.360
 you do not understand English by the way 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.950
 massacre is being marked to which olives he 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.330
 is that you do not understand English you have a 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.010
 bit fucked but can not explain it 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.989
 very well very didactic so those who 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.760
 you understand, you get serious and good 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.100
 try that there are a few thousandths of 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.930
 second between that you happen to be out 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.370
 from the sight to aim with the look there 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.350
 a few thousandths of a second that stays 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.970
 the screen in black not a few 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.610
 frames in which the screen remains 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.870
 black and during those frames the bullet goes 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.610
 to the center of the screen 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.530
 absolutely the same the swing that I've 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.450
 commented when it is without aiming the 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.040
 technique is called black scout obviously 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.479
 because the screen stays in black 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.070
 all olive forms do not use it 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.720
 during the gameplay and good is a 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.970
 very very useful technique and I encourage you to 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.680
 use it does not cost much to get used to 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.270
 using it is fairly easy to control and 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.979
 of driving and for that reason I encourage you to 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.610
 try it a little bit and see how it works 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.409
 you can do 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.849
 in the shooting range what you want like that 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.439
 that in this call of duty is quite 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.849
 easy to check these things but not 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:40.680
 use of it since it is a failure of the 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.539
 game and if not what to patch an and good 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.159
 As you can see, the DNA has been removed, so 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.319
 I have to go saying goodbye, I hope that 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.889
 you liked this piece of DNA goal 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.930
 net 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.199
 morse or anything we see in the next 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.199
 video
