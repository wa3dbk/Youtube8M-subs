00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
I'm just from here it feels it feels

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.840 
I'm just from here it feels it feels
very<00:01:57.659> thin<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:57.990> when<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.320> your<00:01:58.350> foot

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
very thin but when it's on your foot

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.740 
very thin but when it's on your foot
it's<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.939> leather<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.360> point<00:02:00.630> where

there's almost no padding on the shoe so

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.700 
there's almost no padding on the shoe so
keep<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.540> mind<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.049> very<00:02:04.439> thin

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
that does add a little bit of thickness

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.539 
that does add a little bit of thickness

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
feel very agile they don't dig in too

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.199 
feel very agile they don't dig in too
far<00:03:39.750> I'm<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.799> truly<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:41.370> old-school<00:03:41.849> feel<00:03:42.030> if

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
far I'm a truly that old-school feel if

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.339 
far I'm a truly that old-school feel if
you<00:03:42.269> never<00:03:42.449> warrants<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:42.810> pattern<00:03:43.199> like

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
you never warrants that pattern like

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.449 
you never warrants that pattern like
this<00:03:43.379> it's<00:03:43.650> probably<00:03:43.919> something<00:03:44.099> you<00:03:44.280> should

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
this it's probably something you should

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.360 
this it's probably something you should
do<00:03:44.609> should<00:03:44.939> do<00:03:45.180> at<00:03:45.900> some<00:03:46.169> point<00:03:46.409> it's<00:03:47.009> really<00:03:47.220> a

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
do should do at some point it's really a

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.979 
do should do at some point it's really a
step<00:03:47.849> pattern<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.299> would<00:03:48.449> recommend<00:03:48.810> for

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
step pattern that I would recommend for

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.629 
step pattern that I would recommend for
use<00:03:49.139> on<00:03:49.319> turf<00:03:49.620> or<00:03:49.859> something<00:03:50.159> like<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.310> it

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
use on turf or something like that it

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.710 
use on turf or something like that it
really<00:03:50.909> does<00:03:51.180> work<00:03:51.209> well<00:03:51.620> even<00:03:52.620> on<00:03:52.769> on<00:03:53.509> soft<00:03:54.509> on

the way around so they're gonna dig in a
little<00:04:21.719> bit<00:04:21.840> more<00:04:21.959> you're<00:04:22.139> still<00:04:22.289> getting

that kind of freedom of movement that
you<00:04:24.840> get<00:04:25.050> with<00:04:25.580> conical<00:04:26.580> step<00:04:26.849> at<00:04:27.000> urns

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.820 
you get with conical step at urns
what<00:04:27.750> makes<00:04:27.930> this<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.080> little<00:04:28.260> bit<00:04:28.500> different

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
what makes this a little bit different

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.320 
what makes this a little bit different
is<00:04:28.920> that<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.160> sons<00:04:29.400> are<00:04:29.490> actually<00:04:29.940> angled

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
is that the sons are actually angled

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.480 
is that the sons are actually angled
slightly<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.840> outside<00:04:31.070> I'm<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.220> best<00:04:32.370> way

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
slightly to the outside I'm the best way

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.130 
slightly to the outside I'm the best way
to<00:04:32.520> show<00:04:32.730> it<00:04:32.850> is<00:04:32.940> right<00:04:33.120> here<00:04:33.420> because<00:04:34.050> either

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
to show it is right here because either

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.780 
to show it is right here because either
the<00:04:34.380> studs<00:04:34.620> are<00:04:34.740> slightly<00:04:34.980> angled<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.670> the

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
the studs are slightly angled to the

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.840 
the studs are slightly angled to the
outside<00:04:36.180> so<00:04:37.050> basically<00:04:37.860> what<00:04:38.400> this<00:04:38.640> is<00:04:38.700> doing

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
outside so basically what this is doing

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.650 
outside so basically what this is doing
is<00:04:39.180> creating<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.600> wider<00:04:39.840> stance<00:04:41.360> which<00:04:42.360> is<00:04:42.390> a

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
is creating a wider stance which is a

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.930 
is creating a wider stance which is a
really<00:04:43.650> good<00:04:43.860> idea<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:44.430> something<00:04:44.670> that<00:04:44.880> I

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
really good idea and something that I

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.760 
really good idea and something that I
think<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.210> lot<00:04:45.360> of<00:04:45.390> shoes<00:04:45.660> are<00:04:46.410> probably<00:04:46.530> gonna

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
think a lot of shoes are probably gonna

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.800 
think a lot of shoes are probably gonna
have<00:04:47.010> copying<00:04:47.490> off<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.820> because<00:04:47.940> it's<00:04:48.390> not

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
have copying off of because it's not

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.530 
have copying off of because it's not
even<00:04:49.020> something<00:04:49.170> I've<00:04:49.380> ever<00:04:49.440> even<00:04:49.710> thought<00:04:49.950> of

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
even something I've ever even thought of

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.180 
even something I've ever even thought of
in<00:04:51.540> creating<00:04:51.960> a<00:04:52.020> wider<00:04:52.230> stance<00:04:52.590> basically

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
in creating a wider stance basically

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.340 
in creating a wider stance basically
when<00:04:54.030> you<00:04:54.150> think<00:04:54.360> about<00:04:54.570> how<00:04:54.660> you<00:04:54.720> run<00:04:55.020> you

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
when you think about how you run you

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.930 
when you think about how you run you
never<00:04:55.470> land<00:04:55.800> on<00:04:55.950> your<00:04:56.070> foot<00:04:56.280> you<00:04:56.310> let<00:04:56.640> never

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
never land on your foot you let never

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.330 
never land on your foot you let never
land<00:04:57.270> on<00:04:57.450> your<00:04:57.540> studs<00:04:57.810> exactly<00:04:58.320> flat<00:04:58.560> you're

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
land on your studs exactly flat you're

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.830 
land on your studs exactly flat you're
always<00:04:59.430> gonna<00:04:59.610> land<00:04:59.910> slightly<00:05:00.660> to<00:05:00.810> the

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
always gonna land slightly to the

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.780 
always gonna land slightly to the
outside<00:05:01.080> or<00:05:01.680> maybe<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:01.980> inside<00:05:02.340> of<00:05:02.490> your<00:05:02.580> foot

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
outside or maybe the inside of your foot

depending<00:05:03.000> on<00:05:03.300> how<00:05:03.420> you<00:05:03.480> run<00:05:04.220> so<00:05:05.220> if<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.940> studs

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
depending on how you run so if the studs

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.990 
depending on how you run so if the studs
are<00:05:06.330> actually<00:05:06.830> perfectly<00:05:07.830> flat<00:05:08.130> you're<00:05:08.850> never

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
are actually perfectly flat you're never

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.070 
are actually perfectly flat you're never
going<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:09.210> land<00:05:09.450> on<00:05:09.600> them<00:05:09.720> but<00:05:09.810> if<00:05:09.930> they're

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
going to land on them but if they're

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.200 
going to land on them but if they're
slightly<00:05:10.260> angle<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:10.920> outside<00:05:11.310> when<00:05:12.090> you

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
slightly angle to the outside when you

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.510 
slightly angle to the outside when you
do<00:05:12.390> step<00:05:12.780> and<00:05:13.020> land<00:05:13.740> on<00:05:13.920> the<00:05:14.010> outside<00:05:14.370> of<00:05:14.460> your

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
do step and land on the outside of your

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.400 
do step and land on the outside of your
foot<00:05:14.730> ever<00:05:14.970> so<00:05:15.210> slightly<00:05:15.450> you're<00:05:16.140> gonna<00:05:16.260> land

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
foot ever so slightly you're gonna land

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.080 
foot ever so slightly you're gonna land
flat<00:05:16.740> on<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:17.070> stuff<00:05:17.280> as<00:05:17.400> opposed<00:05:17.700> to<00:05:17.790> on<00:05:17.970> an

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
flat on the stuff as opposed to on an

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.010 
flat on the stuff as opposed to on an
angle<00:05:18.450> on<00:05:18.570> a<00:05:18.600> side<00:05:18.890> which<00:05:19.890> is<00:05:20.630> gonna<00:05:21.630> allow<00:05:21.990> for

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
angle on a side which is gonna allow for

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.050 
angle on a side which is gonna allow for
a<00:05:22.350> little<00:05:22.710> bit<00:05:22.800> better<00:05:22.950> traction<00:05:23.250> which<00:05:23.850> in

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
a little bit better traction which in

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.760 
a little bit better traction which in
long<00:05:24.270> run<00:05:24.420> is<00:05:24.510> a<00:05:24.570> great<00:05:24.690> thing<00:05:24.930> and<00:05:25.470> of<00:05:25.560> course

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
long run is a great thing and of course

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.790 
long run is a great thing and of course
I<00:05:25.830> have<00:05:25.920> to<00:05:25.950> talk<00:05:26.130> about<00:05:26.280> the<00:05:26.460> soleplate<00:05:26.670> which

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
I have to talk about the soleplate which

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.860 
I have to talk about the soleplate which
for<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:28.890> Neo<00:05:29.070> had<00:05:29.400> just<00:05:29.610> has<00:05:29.730> to<00:05:29.880> be<00:05:29.940> done<00:05:30.180> it

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
for the Neo had just has to be done it

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.980 
for the Neo had just has to be done it
is<00:05:31.110> very<00:05:31.620> similar<00:05:32.010> to<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.490> adizero<00:05:32.880> it's<00:05:33.120> a<00:05:33.270> is

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
is very similar to the adizero it's a is

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.480 
is very similar to the adizero it's a is
something<00:05:34.500> that<00:05:34.620> really<00:05:34.890> can't<00:05:35.100> be<00:05:35.190> avoided

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
something that really can't be avoided

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.480 
something that really can't be avoided
here<00:05:36.200> but<00:05:37.200> at<00:05:37.320> the<00:05:37.440> end<00:05:37.470> of<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.710> day<00:05:37.860> I<00:05:37.890> do<00:05:38.130> find

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
here but at the end of the day I do find

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.580 
here but at the end of the day I do find
this<00:05:38.640> soleplate<00:05:39.450> to<00:05:39.660> be<00:05:39.750> probably<00:05:40.260> a<00:05:40.380> little

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
this soleplate to be probably a little

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.890 
this soleplate to be probably a little
bit<00:05:40.800> better<00:05:41.060> it<00:05:42.060> seems<00:05:42.240> to<00:05:42.390> be<00:05:42.510> a<00:05:42.540> little<00:05:42.780> bit

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
bit better it seems to be a little bit

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.710 
bit better it seems to be a little bit
more<00:05:43.050> flexible<00:05:43.500> in<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:43.710> front<00:05:43.920> here<00:05:44.160> but<00:05:45.000> what

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
more flexible in the front here but what

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.300 
more flexible in the front here but what
really<00:05:45.900> makes<00:05:46.170> this<00:05:46.320> for<00:05:46.620> me<00:05:46.710> better<00:05:46.950> is<00:05:47.130> it's

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
really makes this for me better is it's

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.850 
really makes this for me better is it's
much<00:05:47.670> stiffer<00:05:47.940> through<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.390> mid<00:05:48.570> foot<00:05:48.860> which

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
much stiffer through the mid foot which

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.530 
much stiffer through the mid foot which
for<00:05:50.280> me<00:05:50.370> is<00:05:50.400> a<00:05:50.520> huge<00:05:50.790> thing<00:05:51.060> with<00:05:51.090> lightweight

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
for me is a huge thing with lightweight

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.990 
for me is a huge thing with lightweight
shoes<00:05:51.780> a<00:05:52.290> lot<00:05:53.160> of<00:05:53.250> lightweight<00:05:53.550> shoes<00:05:53.790> gonna

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
shoes a lot of lightweight shoes gonna

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.550 
shoes a lot of lightweight shoes gonna
go<00:05:54.150> out<00:05:54.240> there<00:05:54.420> and<00:05:54.540> they<00:05:54.630> don't<00:05:55.110> keep<00:05:55.380> that

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
go out there and they don't keep that

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.440 
go out there and they don't keep that
stiffness<00:05:55.920> through<00:05:56.250> the<00:05:56.370> mid<00:05:56.520> foot<00:05:56.700> this<00:05:57.240> one

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
stiffness through the mid foot this one

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:58.610 
stiffness through the mid foot this one
does<00:05:57.600> a<00:05:57.630> really<00:05:57.840> good<00:05:58.020> job<00:05:58.080> at<00:05:58.380> that

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
does a really good job at that

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.040 
does a really good job at that
but<00:05:59.250> other<00:05:59.340> than<00:05:59.490> that<00:05:59.580> this<00:05:59.850> I<00:06:00.180> would<00:06:00.870> say

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
but other than that this I would say

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.770 
but other than that this I would say
it's<00:06:01.200> exactly<00:06:01.320> the<00:06:01.710> same<00:06:01.920> as<00:06:02.100> the<00:06:02.250> i-20<00:06:02.540> as<00:06:03.540> far

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
it's exactly the same as the i-20 as far

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.170 
it's exactly the same as the i-20 as far
as<00:06:03.900> how<00:06:04.080> it<00:06:04.110> feels<00:06:04.620> as<00:06:05.490> far<00:06:05.670> as<00:06:05.760> weight<00:06:05.940> goes

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
as how it feels as far as weight goes

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.610 
as how it feels as far as weight goes
there's<00:06:06.420> a<00:06:06.510> huge<00:06:06.930> difference<00:06:07.320> between<00:06:07.410> the

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
there's a huge difference between the

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.400 
there's a huge difference between the
Morelia<00:06:08.010> Pro<00:06:08.310> on<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:08.580> merlion<00:06:09.000> neo<00:06:09.180> as<00:06:10.110> you

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
Morelia Pro on the merlion neo as you

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.350 
Morelia Pro on the merlion neo as you
probably<00:06:10.590> would<00:06:10.860> expect<00:06:11.310> um<00:06:11.700> keep<00:06:12.120> in<00:06:12.210> mind

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
probably would expect um keep in mind

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.810 
probably would expect um keep in mind
these<00:06:12.450> are<00:06:12.510> both<00:06:12.750> size<00:06:13.080> 9<00:06:13.380> US<00:06:13.740> and<00:06:14.040> they<00:06:14.610> both

these are both size 9 US and they both

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.700 
these are both size 9 US and they both
are<00:06:15.030> used<00:06:15.360> so<00:06:15.570> the<00:06:15.660> way<00:06:15.780> it<00:06:15.840> might<00:06:15.960> be<00:06:16.140> ever<00:06:16.410> so

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
are used so the way it might be ever so

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.210 
are used so the way it might be ever so

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
slightly higher than from brand-new but

slightly higher than from brand-new but

if<00:06:24.300> you<00:06:24.360> guys<00:06:24.480> can<00:06:24.690> see<00:06:24.810> that<00:06:25.640> which<00:06:26.640> is<00:06:26.790> about

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
if you guys can see that which is about

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.670 
if you guys can see that which is about
average<00:06:27.510> for<00:06:27.750> this<00:06:28.050> kind<00:06:28.230> of<00:06:28.290> shoe<00:06:28.410> a<00:06:28.440> little

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
average for this kind of shoe a little

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.620 
average for this kind of shoe a little
bit<00:06:28.800> lighter<00:06:29.010> if<00:06:29.730> you<00:06:29.910> consider<00:06:30.210> this<00:06:30.450> is

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
bit lighter if you consider this is

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.420 
bit lighter if you consider this is
really<00:06:30.900> classic<00:06:31.230> design<00:06:31.770> there's<00:06:31.980> no<00:06:32.100> really

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
really classic design there's no really

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.890 
really classic design there's no really
modern<00:06:32.910> soleplate<00:06:33.300> or<00:06:33.510> anything<00:06:33.660> like<00:06:33.840> that

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
modern soleplate or anything like that

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.930 
modern soleplate or anything like that
so<00:06:34.320> it's<00:06:34.860> definitely<00:06:35.160> on<00:06:35.280> the<00:06:35.370> average<00:06:35.730> side

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
so it's definitely on the average side

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.520 
so it's definitely on the average side
of<00:06:36.060> things<00:06:36.270> it's<00:06:36.630> definitely<00:06:36.990> not<00:06:37.320> going<00:06:37.440> to

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
of things it's definitely not going to
