hem<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.119> edges<00:01:27.539> if<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.929> fold<00:01:28.200> over<00:01:28.619> about<00:01:28.770> a

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
hem the edges if we fold over about a

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.679 
hem the edges if we fold over about a
quarter<00:01:29.159> inch<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.520> fabric<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.060> iron<00:01:30.450> that

quarter inch of the fabric and iron that

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.899 
quarter inch of the fabric and iron that
flat<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.350> then<00:01:31.679> we<00:01:31.710> fold<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.130> over<00:01:32.249> again<00:01:32.399> and

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
flat and then we fold it over again and

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.239 
flat and then we fold it over again and
iron<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.509> once<00:01:33.719> more<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.289> we're<00:01:34.799> doing<00:01:35.039> about<00:01:35.219> a

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
iron it once more so we're doing about a

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:37.550 
iron it once more so we're doing about a
quarter<00:01:35.609> inch<00:01:35.640> hem<00:01:36.149> on<00:01:36.390> all<00:01:36.749> of<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> raw<00:01:37.320> edges

right<00:02:18.990> at<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.200> shoulder<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.040> can<00:02:20.190> see

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
right at the shoulder so you can see

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.980 
right at the shoulder so you can see
with<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.610> all<00:02:20.700> laid<00:02:20.880> out<00:02:20.910> how<00:02:21.390> we're<00:02:21.780> kind<00:02:21.960> of

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
with it all laid out how we're kind of

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.270 
with it all laid out how we're kind of
putting<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.320> together<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.830> how<00:02:22.950> it's

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
putting it together and how it's

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.030 
putting it together and how it's
together<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:24.150> right<00:02:24.450> here<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:25.170> just<00:02:25.200> overlap

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
together so right here we just overlap

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.140 
together so right here we just overlap
that<00:02:26.490> lace

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
that lace

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.660 
that lace
directly<00:02:27.569> over<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.200> hem<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.920> fabric<00:02:29.340> so

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
directly over the hem of the fabric so

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.130 
directly over the hem of the fabric so
basically<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.209> just<00:02:30.420> kind<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.630> hiding<00:02:31.020> that

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
basically it's just kind of hiding that

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.230 
basically it's just kind of hiding that
him<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.800> don't<00:02:32.520> forget<00:02:32.790> when<00:02:32.940> you're<00:02:33.030> sewing

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
him and don't forget when you're sewing

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.610 
him and don't forget when you're sewing
to<00:02:33.420> make<00:02:33.569> sure<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.020> have<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.290> pretty

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
to make sure that you have the pretty

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.980 
to make sure that you have the pretty
clean<00:02:35.040> side<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.580> hem<00:02:35.730> facing<00:02:36.240> outward<00:02:36.720> and

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
clean side of the hem facing outward and

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.900 
clean side of the hem facing outward and
they're<00:02:37.530> not<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:37.830> clean<00:02:38.040> Bart<00:02:38.250> facing<00:02:38.640> inwards

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
they're not so clean Bart facing inwards

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.880 
they're not so clean Bart facing inwards
you<00:02:39.060> don't<00:02:39.240> see<00:02:39.390> that<00:02:39.540> part<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:40.020> want<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.650> trim

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
trim plot just a tiny little bit and

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.090 
trim plot just a tiny little bit and
we're<00:03:06.959> gonna<00:03:07.050> go<00:03:07.230> ahead<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.500> him<00:03:07.860> that

we're gonna go ahead and him that

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.490 
we're gonna go ahead and him that
because<00:03:08.519> this<00:03:08.880> part<00:03:09.239> of<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.480> trim<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:10.019> going

because this part of the trim is going

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.350 
because this part of the trim is going
to<00:03:10.620> be<00:03:10.709> visible<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.730> we<00:03:11.819> want<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.060> make<00:03:12.150> sure<00:03:12.180> it

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.510 
of my kimono yes indeed because I
realized<00:04:38.719> that<00:04:38.930> I<00:04:39.080> wanted<00:04:39.619> it<00:04:39.800> to<00:04:39.919> be<00:04:40.009> a<00:04:40.039> little

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
realized that I wanted it to be a little

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.700 
realized that I wanted it to be a little
more<00:04:40.789> narrow<00:04:41.029> so<00:04:41.449> I'm<00:04:41.779> just<00:04:41.990> taking<00:04:42.259> out<00:04:42.409> about

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
more narrow so I'm just taking out about

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.679 
more narrow so I'm just taking out about
two<00:04:42.979> and<00:04:43.129> a<00:04:43.189> half<00:04:43.369> inches<00:04:43.819> and<00:04:44.149> we're<00:04:44.419> gonna<00:04:44.509> go

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:44.689 
two and a half inches and we're gonna go

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.439 
two and a half inches and we're gonna go
ahead<00:04:44.779> and<00:04:44.960> him<00:04:45.289> that<00:04:45.499> or<00:04:45.830> sew<00:04:46.430> it<00:04:46.580> so<00:04:47.180> it's

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
ahead and him that or sew it so it's

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.600 
ahead and him that or sew it so it's
gonna<00:04:47.599> be<00:04:47.779> one<00:04:48.139> piece<00:04:48.409> again<00:04:48.649> so<00:04:49.189> that's<00:04:49.399> why<00:04:49.580> I

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
gonna be one piece again so that's why I

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.950 
gonna be one piece again so that's why I
said<00:04:49.759> at<00:04:50.089> the<00:04:50.149> beginning<00:04:50.240> that<00:04:50.539> I<00:04:50.719> was<00:04:50.839> gonna

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
said at the beginning that I was gonna

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.230 
said at the beginning that I was gonna
give<00:04:51.169> you<00:04:51.199> those<00:04:51.529> exact<00:04:52.249> dimensions<00:04:52.789> later<00:04:52.999> on

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
give you those exact dimensions later on

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.329 
give you those exact dimensions later on
because<00:04:53.659> it<00:04:54.080> was<00:04:54.199> all<00:04:54.409> kind<00:04:54.680> of<00:04:54.740> an<00:04:54.830> experiment

00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:55.339 
because it was all kind of an experiment

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:57.100 
because it was all kind of an experiment
but<00:04:55.999> I<00:04:56.059> had<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.449> share<00:04:56.569> this<00:04:56.719> with<00:04:56.869> you<00:04:56.960> guys

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.290 
but I had to share this with you guys
cuz<00:04:57.439> it's<00:04:57.800> just<00:04:58.039> it<00:04:58.430> was<00:04:58.639> just<00:04:58.849> too<00:04:58.969> much<00:04:59.089> fun

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
cuz it's just it was just too much fun

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.329 
cuz it's just it was just too much fun
so<00:04:59.629> here<00:05:00.169> we<00:05:00.259> go<00:05:00.349> I'm<00:05:00.589> just<00:05:00.740> finishing<00:05:00.919> it<00:05:01.189> up

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.209 
so you can see that middle part is
stitched<00:05:02.839> and<00:05:03.169> I<00:05:03.319> actually<00:05:03.499> really<00:05:03.860> like<00:05:04.009> the
