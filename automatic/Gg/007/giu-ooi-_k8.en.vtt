part 1 let's put back in check out part

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.440 
part 1 let's put back in check out part
1<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.460> we've<00:00:17.460> already<00:00:17.640> explained<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
1 so we've already explained that the

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.480 
1 so we've already explained that the
bench<00:00:18.840> press<00:00:19.020> may<00:00:19.349> not<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.040> King<00:00:20.220> Kong

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
bench press may not be the King Kong

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.729 
bench press may not be the King Kong
exercise<00:00:21.090> for<00:00:21.330> your<00:00:21.450> particular<00:00:21.779> anatomical

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:22.739 
exercise for your particular anatomical

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:23.929 
exercise for your particular anatomical
leverage<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.610> something<00:00:23.730> that

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
leverage and this is something that

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.729 
leverage and this is something that
needs<00:00:24.149> to<00:00:24.239> be<00:00:24.419> addressed<00:00:24.509> but<00:00:25.410> there's<00:00:25.619> also

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:25.739 
needs to be addressed but there's also

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.350 
needs to be addressed but there's also
another<00:00:25.950> lion<00:00:26.310> current<00:00:26.669> there<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.239> the

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
another lion current there that the

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.109 
another lion current there that the
bench<00:00:27.570> press<00:00:27.810> especially<00:00:28.619> for<00:00:29.250> neophytes<00:00:29.579> and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
bench press especially for neophytes and

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.089 
bench press especially for neophytes and
beginners<00:00:30.570> intermediate<00:00:30.750> level<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:31.860> not

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
beginners intermediate level it's not

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.280 
beginners intermediate level it's not
done<00:00:32.160> actually<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.180> build<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> chest<00:00:33.809> it's

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
done actually to build the chest it's

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.979 
done actually to build the chest it's
done<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.980> innervate<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.730> upper<00:00:36.420> body<00:00:36.600> in

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
done to innervate the upper body in

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.450 
done to innervate the upper body in
other<00:00:37.140> words<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.620> bench<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.070> kind<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.400> like

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
other words the bench is kind of like

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.000 
other words the bench is kind of like
the<00:00:38.670> squad<00:00:39.060> for<00:00:39.330> the<00:00:39.450> upper<00:00:39.660> body<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.260> we

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the squad for the upper body in that we

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.950 
the squad for the upper body in that we
use<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.490> to<00:00:41.520> establish<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:42.630> we<00:00:42.780> call

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
use it to establish what we call

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.530 
use it to establish what we call
neurological<00:00:43.800> pathways<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.970> innervates

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
neurological pathways that innervates

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.480 
neurological pathways that innervates
the muscles<00:00:46.290> of<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> upper<00:00:46.500> body<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.310> the

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490 
the muscles of the upper body in the

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.450 
the muscles of the upper body in the
pushing<00:00:48.120> musculature<00:00:48.630> so<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.560> may<00:00:49.800> not<00:00:49.830> be

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
pushing musculature so it may not be

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.930 
pushing musculature so it may not be
used<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.870> build<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.350> chest<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.640> can

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
used to build the chest but it can

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.470 
used to build the chest but it can
definitely<00:00:54.180> be<00:00:54.750> used<00:00:55.290> to<00:00:55.920> establish

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
definitely be used to establish

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.700 
definitely be used to establish
neurological<00:00:57.480> pathways<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:58.140> make<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> rest

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
neurological pathways to make the rest

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.319 
neurological pathways to make the rest
of<00:00:58.860> the<00:00:58.950> training<00:00:59.220> actually<00:00:59.520> more<00:00:59.880> effective

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
of the training actually more effective

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.780 
of the training actually more effective
so<00:01:00.540> people<00:01:00.870> are<00:01:01.079> actually<00:01:01.590> using<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.550> bench

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
so people are actually using a bench

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.100 
so people are actually using a bench
press<00:01:03.060> but<00:01:03.540> they're<00:01:03.720> getting<00:01:03.960> their

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
press but they're getting their

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.350 
press but they're getting their
development<00:01:04.769> not<00:01:05.309> from<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.729> direct<00:01:06.090> bench

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
development not from the direct bench

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.060 
development not from the direct bench
press<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.020> overall<00:01:07.320> effects<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.950> an

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
press but the overall effects of an

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.210 
press but the overall effects of an
overtime<00:01:09.080> added<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> other<00:01:10.590> exercises

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
overtime added to the other exercises

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.649 
overtime added to the other exercises
that<00:01:11.520> they're<00:01:11.729> doing<00:01:11.850> coach<00:01:12.240> yeah

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that they're doing coach yeah

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.899 
that they're doing coach yeah
essentially<00:01:13.409> what<00:01:13.620> they're<00:01:13.860> teaching<00:01:14.580> their

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
essentially what they're teaching their

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.480 
essentially what they're teaching their
body<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.840> used<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.350> handling<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.920> load<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.340> it

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
body to be used to handling a load of it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.580 
body to be used to handling a load of it
of<00:01:17.670> any<00:01:17.790> kind<00:01:18.090> right<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.479> they're<00:01:19.080> complete

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
of any kind right if they're complete

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.730 
of any kind right if they're complete
beginners<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.870> what<00:01:21.870> may<00:01:22.080> seem<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.560> not

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
beginners and what may seem like not

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.260 
beginners and what may seem like not
much<00:01:22.890> below<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.280> somebody<00:01:23.700> else<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.150> you've

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
much below to somebody else if you've

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.240 
much below to somebody else if you've
never<00:01:24.450> held<00:01:24.840> something<00:01:25.200> over<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:25.620> face<00:01:25.920> like

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
never held something over your face like

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.010 
never held something over your face like
that<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.510> develop<00:01:27.750> some

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
that it's going to develop some

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.050 
that it's going to develop some
neurological<00:01:28.350> pathways<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:29.729> same<00:01:29.940> as

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
neurological pathways and the same as

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.190 
neurological pathways and the same as
like<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> said<00:01:30.299> having<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.810> bar<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.080> your

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
like you said having the bar on your

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.660 
like you said having the bar on your
back<00:01:31.380> having<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.830> bar<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.010> your<00:01:32.220> hands<00:01:32.430> getting

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
back having a bar on your hands getting

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.730 
back having a bar on your hands getting
deadness<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.870> may<00:01:34.020> not<00:01:34.170> be<00:01:34.350> using<00:01:34.530> those

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
deadness you may not be using those

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.740 
deadness you may not be using those
those<00:01:35.100> lists<00:01:35.430> specifically<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.330> build<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
those lists specifically to build the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.420 
those lists specifically to build the
body<00:01:37.290> at<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.619> time<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.100> you're<00:01:38.250> still

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
body at that time but you're still

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.550 
body at that time but you're still
teaching<00:01:38.700> your<00:01:39.030> body<00:01:39.240> how<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.540> how<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.320> lift

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
teaching your body how to how to lift

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.350 
teaching your body how to how to lift
weights<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.040> how<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.190> work<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> muscles<00:01:41.520> so

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
weights and how to work the muscles so

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.780 
weights and how to work the muscles so
as<00:01:42.540> we've<00:01:42.840> said<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.229> Med<00:01:43.500> training<00:01:43.950> often

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
as we've said in the Med training often

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.300 
as we've said in the Med training often
we<00:01:45.330> focus<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.229> innovation<00:01:46.740> training<00:01:47.159> is

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
we focus and innovation training is

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.930 
we focus and innovation training is
trained<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> muscle<00:01:48.570> not

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
trained the muscle not
