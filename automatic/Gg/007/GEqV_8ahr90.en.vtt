they're<00:00:09.550> just<00:00:09.580> heartwarming<00:00:10.480> and<00:00:10.629> so

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
me sideways emotionally just to think

be difficult for your child it's hard

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.289 
be difficult for your child it's hard
for<00:01:17.110> Leo<00:01:17.290> to<00:01:17.530> be<00:01:17.680> independent<00:01:18.490> it's<00:01:18.820> hard<00:01:19.090> for

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
for Leo to be independent it's hard for

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.200 
for Leo to be independent it's hard for
him<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.630> self-direct<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:21.340> with<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.640> iPad<00:01:22.060> you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
him to self-direct but with the iPad you

him to self-direct but with the iPad you
know<00:01:22.360> it<00:01:22.570> may<00:01:22.840> just<00:01:23.020> makes<00:01:23.200> him<00:01:23.320> happy<00:01:23.680> and

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
know it may just makes him happy and

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.830 
know it may just makes him happy and
independent<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:25.119> he<00:01:25.329> didn't<00:01:25.659> have<00:01:25.810> that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
independent and he didn't have that

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.010 
independent and he didn't have that
ability<00:01:26.110> before<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:28.119> is<00:01:28.299> something<00:01:28.689> that<00:01:28.719> my

ability before this is something that my

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.570 
ability before this is something that my
son<00:01:29.289> can<00:01:29.469> do<00:01:29.740> and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
son can do and

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.150 
son can do and
he<00:01:31.120> doesn't<00:01:31.420> need<00:01:31.510> me<00:01:31.720> you<00:01:32.590> know<00:01:32.710> I<00:01:32.740> don't<00:01:32.980> want

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
he doesn't need me you know I don't want

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:46.050 
he doesn't need me you know I don't want
him<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.400> have<00:01:33.490> to<00:01:33.670> need<00:01:33.790> me<00:01:34.000> all<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.270> time

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.140 

we<00:01:46.360> created<00:01:46.720> a<00:01:46.840> device<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:48.250> is<00:01:48.490> going<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:49.060> be

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
we created a device that is going to be

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.760 
we created a device that is going to be
indispensable<00:01:49.630> of<00:01:49.990> things<00:01:50.140> we<00:01:50.290> do<00:01:50.409> every<00:01:50.619> day

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
indispensable of things we do every day

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.969 
indispensable of things we do every day
and<00:01:51.520> not<00:01:51.940> only<00:01:52.000> do<00:01:52.299> we<00:01:52.330> achieve<00:01:52.479> that<00:01:52.990> but<00:01:53.740> it's

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
and not only do we achieve that but it's

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.010 
and not only do we achieve that but it's
going<00:01:54.159> further<00:01:54.640> deeper<00:01:55.330> faster<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:55.869> our

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
going further deeper faster and our

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.340 
going further deeper faster and our
lives<00:01:56.320> than<00:01:56.500> we<00:01:56.560> ever<00:01:56.650> imagined<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:59.110> this<00:01:59.229> is

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
lives than we ever imagined and this is

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.250 
lives than we ever imagined and this is
just<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.860> beginning
