00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
running back 50 to run blocking so it's

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.690

not really

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.180

expensive I bought it for 1.3 now the

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.810 
expensive I bought it for 1.3 now the
reason<00:05:08.560> why<00:05:08.800> I<00:05:08.830> got<00:05:09.220> rid<00:05:09.370> of<00:05:09.400> him<00:05:09.550> is<00:05:09.670> because

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
reason why I got rid of him is because

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.600 
reason why I got rid of him is because
you<00:05:10.180> could<00:05:10.330> do<00:05:10.510> so<00:05:10.810> much<00:05:10.990> more<00:05:11.070> by<00:05:12.070> selling

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
you could do so much more by selling

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.490 
you could do so much more by selling
them<00:05:12.730> getting<00:05:12.970> a<00:05:13.030> million<00:05:13.360> coins<00:05:13.720> and<00:05:13.930> getting

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
them getting a million coins and getting

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.100 
them getting a million coins and getting
maybe<00:05:14.620> 99<00:05:15.160> to<00:05:15.310> DeMarco<00:05:15.940> Murray<00:05:15.970> 97<00:05:16.720> DeMarco

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.170 
maybe 99 to DeMarco Murray 97 DeMarco
Murray<00:05:17.290> even<00:05:17.680> 99<00:05:18.070> Barry<00:05:18.310> Sanders<00:05:18.730> who's<00:05:18.940> half

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
Murray even 99 Barry Sanders who's half

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.360 
Murray even 99 Barry Sanders who's half
its<00:05:19.420> price<00:05:19.690> and<00:05:19.960> you'll<00:05:20.350> still<00:05:20.740> get<00:05:21.100> a<00:05:21.340> decent

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
its price and you'll still get a decent

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.060 
its price and you'll still get a decent
back<00:05:22.150> that's<00:05:22.420> just<00:05:22.780> like<00:05:22.960> him<00:05:22.990> he<00:05:23.620> will<00:05:23.770> break

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
back that's just like him he will break

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.570 
back that's just like him he will break
the<00:05:24.220> extra<00:05:24.520> tackles<00:05:24.940> but<00:05:25.540> I<00:05:25.810> would<00:05:26.650> just<00:05:26.860> get

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
the extra tackles but I would just get

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.740
