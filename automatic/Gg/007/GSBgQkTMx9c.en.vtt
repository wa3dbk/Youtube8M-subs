00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.420
Helix, I have to ask you

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.640
Why do you want to find Randi?

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.980
Actually, he was the first person with whom I became friends after the apocalypse

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.520
I feel that I have to help him

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.040
I understand

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.460
After the apocalypse, I lost many friends... and family

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.680
Don't be sad

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.800
Now you have us

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I found something interesting

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.800
Come on, just be careful

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.100
This city is not safe

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.920
Okey, we follow you

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.440
Is it a...?

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.600
Yeah... a tank

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.420
Come on

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.940
One of us has to go inside

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.700
Great...

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.480
I found a few things

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.000
Go down

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.340
I have some ammunition...

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.000
two magazines and granades

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.300
Granades for me of course:)

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.600
Thanks

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.320
We have to hide, faster!

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.960
Catch him!

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.600
We're going to help him?

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.900
No, we need to keep ammunition to the rescue Randi

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160
He is right, let's wait

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.560
It's here Helix

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.820

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.080
Let's do it

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.240
To be continued...
