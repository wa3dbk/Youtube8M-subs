00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.229
 fed up with comics that pont 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.030
 sometimes with its hidden meaning 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.710
 I want to think about why 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.659
 gang leader blue tie they 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.189

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.650
 three paragraphs explanation 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.530
 your daredevil tells you straight I 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.729
 simple but from this even steeper stories in 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.159
 hengoingy is for the most part 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.700
 detective superhero is not without humor and 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.530
 dramas 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.750
 each subsequent story echoes 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.090
 with the previous some storyline about 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.549
 which you learn yourself in the course of reading and 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.409
 from this story intrigues even stronger and 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.899
 sometimes turnover really make 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.909
 sweat your palms whole comics gives 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.130
 the spirit of the eighties it is 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.820
 rather not the story itself x in heroes and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.770
 pattern 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.229
 villains daredevil this characters 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.820
