00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.050 
they're going to survive on all winter
let's<00:01:30.780> take<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> look<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.619> Gary<00:01:32.220> pop<00:01:32.880> open

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
let's take a look at this Gary pop open

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.109 
let's take a look at this Gary pop open
the<00:01:33.240> top<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.869> guys<00:01:34.020> look<00:01:34.290> at<00:01:34.409> these<00:01:34.560> bees

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
the top you guys look at these bees

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.310 
the top you guys look at these bees
they're<00:01:36.119> all<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.509> there<00:01:36.689> getting<00:01:36.869> ready<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
they're all in there getting ready and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.230 
they're all in there getting ready and
like<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.740> said<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.189> already<00:01:38.220> took<00:01:38.640> off<00:01:38.850> some

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
like you said you already took off some

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.730 
like you said you already took off some
of<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> honey<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.780> let's<00:01:39.990> take<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> look<00:01:40.500> at<00:01:40.619> one

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
of the honey so let's take a look at one

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.460 
of the honey so let's take a look at one
of<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.920> combs<00:01:41.189> if<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.610> can

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.050 

yeah<00:01:45.100> we've<00:01:45.250> taken<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.580> lot<00:01:45.640> of<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.790> extra

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
yeah we've taken a lot of the extra

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.370 
yeah we've taken a lot of the extra
honey<00:01:46.210> off<00:01:46.420> but<00:01:46.570> there's<00:01:46.750> still<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.990> lot<00:01:47.350> of

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
honey off but there's still a lot of

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.770 
honey off but there's still a lot of
honey<00:01:47.740> left<00:01:48.010> in<00:01:48.280> here<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:49.420> they'll<00:01:49.600> need<00:01:49.750> to

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
honey left in here that they'll need to

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.820 
honey left in here that they'll need to
survive<00:01:50.050> on<00:01:50.260> all<00:01:50.530> winter<00:01:50.710> and<00:01:52.590> let's<00:01:53.590> talk

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
survive on all winter and let's talk

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.260 
survive on all winter and let's talk
about<00:01:54.010> another<00:01:54.160> thing<00:01:54.760> too<00:01:54.940> while<00:01:55.150> we're

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
about another thing too while we're

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.690 
about another thing too while we're
pulling<00:01:55.510> this<00:01:55.780> out<00:01:56.020> how<00:01:56.470> was<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.920> this<00:01:57.190> summer

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
pulling this out how was it this summer

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.540 
pulling this out how was it this summer
compared<00:01:58.330> to<00:01:58.540> last<00:01:58.780> summer<00:01:59.290> well<00:01:59.800> as<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.370> know

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
compared to last summer well as you know

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.300 
compared to last summer well as you know
we've<00:02:00.790> had<00:02:00.820> record<00:02:01.180> rainfall<00:02:01.390> this<00:02:02.230> year

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
we've had record rainfall this year

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.580 
we've had record rainfall this year
which<00:02:03.310> means<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.910> lot<00:02:04.480> less<00:02:04.720> of<00:02:05.050> a<00:02:05.320> nectar

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
which means a lot less of a nectar

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.230 
which means a lot less of a nectar
source<00:02:05.890> out<00:02:06.130> there<00:02:06.340> for<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.580> bees<00:02:06.730> they<00:02:07.090> don't

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
source out there for the bees they don't

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.969 
source out there for the bees they don't
fly<00:02:07.420> when<00:02:07.630> it's<00:02:07.750> raining<00:02:07.960> there<00:02:08.259> Fairweather

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
fly when it's raining there Fairweather

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.750 
fly when it's raining there Fairweather
insects<00:02:09.729> so<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:11.830> really<00:02:12.010> hurt<00:02:12.310> honey

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
insects so it's really hurt honey

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.460 
insects so it's really hurt honey
production<00:02:13.090> this<00:02:13.390> year<00:02:13.450> locally<00:02:14.170> for<00:02:14.320> us

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
production this year locally for us

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.860 
production this year locally for us
anyway<00:02:14.920> as<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.790> can<00:02:16.060> see<00:02:16.240> here<00:02:16.510> there<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.840> a

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
anyway as you can see here there is a

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.080 
anyway as you can see here there is a
honey<00:02:17.770> that's<00:02:18.040> been<00:02:18.250> kind<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.610> opened<00:02:18.880> up<00:02:18.940> in

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
honey that's been kind of opened up in

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.240 
honey that's been kind of opened up in
the<00:02:19.180> cells<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.660> it's<00:02:19.780> dripping<00:02:20.080> out<00:02:20.200> okay<00:02:20.830> and

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
the cells and it's dripping out okay and

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.740 
the cells and it's dripping out okay and
they'll<00:02:21.640> usually<00:02:21.790> store<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.209> lot<00:02:22.390> of<00:02:22.510> honey<00:02:22.660> on

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
they'll usually store a lot of honey on

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.030 
they'll usually store a lot of honey on
the<00:02:22.900> perimeter<00:02:23.110> of<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.380> box<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:23.770> kind<00:02:23.950> of

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
the perimeter of the box that kind of

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.680 
the perimeter of the box that kind of
acts<00:02:24.160> as<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.340> bit<00:02:24.520> of<00:02:24.580> an<00:02:24.670> insulator<00:02:25.120> for<00:02:25.510> them

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
acts as a bit of an insulator for them

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.510 
acts as a bit of an insulator for them
and<00:02:25.900> then<00:02:26.530> they'll<00:02:26.680> consume<00:02:26.980> that<00:02:27.160> all<00:02:27.340> winter

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
and then they'll consume that all winter

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.920 
and then they'll consume that all winter
long<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:28.030> you're<00:02:28.300> going<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.450> leave<00:02:28.630> them<00:02:28.780> in

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
long and you're going to leave them in

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.449 
long and you're going to leave them in
here<00:02:29.110> these<00:02:29.290> guys<00:02:29.350> are<00:02:29.830> good<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.190> stain

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
here these guys are good to stain

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.340 
here these guys are good to stain
absolutely<00:02:31.300> they're<00:02:31.600> good<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.930> go<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.110> the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
absolutely they're good to go to the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.830 
absolutely they're good to go to the
spring<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.640> that's<00:02:34.090> like<00:02:34.300> another<00:02:34.570> thing

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
spring and so that's like another thing
