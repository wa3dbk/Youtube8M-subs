00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.260 

there<00:04:33.610> we<00:04:33.670> go<00:04:33.820> that's<00:04:34.480> a<00:04:34.600> quick<00:04:34.840> sample<00:04:35.410> there

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.390 

we<00:04:40.270> can<00:04:40.420> also<00:04:40.570> divide<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.230> loop<00:04:41.410> by<00:04:41.920> pressing

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
we can also divide the loop by pressing

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.480 
we can also divide the loop by pressing
the<00:04:42.670> minus<00:04:43.030> button<00:04:43.210> here<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.860> that<00:04:45.070> divides

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
the minus button here and that divides

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.240 
the minus button here and that divides
and<00:04:46.030> increases<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.660> beats<00:04:46.990> in<00:04:47.200> the<00:04:47.290> bar<00:04:47.500> and

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
and increases the beats in the bar and

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.820 
and increases the beats in the bar and
pressing<00:04:48.760> the<00:04:48.850> plus<00:04:49.090> button<00:04:49.300> will<00:04:50.260> return<00:04:50.590> it

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
pressing the plus button will return it

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.620 
pressing the plus button will return it
so<00:04:51.640> we've<00:04:51.820> got<00:04:52.000> an<00:04:52.390> eight

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:02.300

out<00:05:12.330> of<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.630> loop<00:05:12.780> we<00:05:13.110> simply<00:05:13.320> press<00:05:14.000> reloop

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
out of the loop we simply press reloop

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:25.430 
out of the loop we simply press reloop
exit<00:05:22.430> to<00:05:23.430> store<00:05:23.700> a<00:05:23.730> loop<00:05:24.000> what<00:05:24.960> we<00:05:25.110> need<00:05:25.230> to<00:05:25.320> do

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
exit to store a loop what we need to do

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:33.260 
exit to store a loop what we need to do
is<00:05:25.590> set<00:05:25.860> a<00:05:25.890> loop<00:05:31.490> so<00:05:32.490> now<00:05:32.640> we've<00:05:32.790> set<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.120> loop

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
is set a loop so now we've set the loop

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.370 
is set a loop so now we've set the loop

this in the memory now we record the

this in the memory now we record the

the stored loop what we have to do is

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.270 
the stored loop what we have to do is

press Q to start the track and then keep

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
couple of seconds and you'll show it

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.870 
couple of seconds and you'll show it
says<00:06:36.180> it's<00:06:36.450> deleted<00:06:36.840> our<00:06:37.230> loop<00:06:39.140> ok<00:06:40.140> happy<00:06:40.380> days

says it's deleted our loop ok happy days
that's<00:06:41.880> my<00:06:42.090> take<00:06:42.390> on<00:06:42.540> the<00:06:42.660> pioneer<00:06:43.050> CDJ<00:06:43.650> 400

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
that's my take on the pioneer CDJ 400

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.510 
that's my take on the pioneer CDJ 400
it's<00:06:44.880> a<00:06:45.060> great<00:06:45.240> piece<00:06:45.540> of<00:06:45.750> kit<00:06:46.020> i<00:06:46.310> would<00:06:47.310> say

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
it's a great piece of kit i would say

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.980 
it's a great piece of kit i would say
practice<00:06:47.760> enjoy<00:06:48.210> but<00:06:48.420> that's<00:06:48.540> probably<00:06:48.810> been

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
practice enjoy but that's probably been

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.270 
practice enjoy but that's probably been
trademarked<00:06:50.570> so<00:06:51.570> from<00:06:51.810> me<00:06:51.990> Britta's<00:06:52.380> I'll

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 
trademarked so from me Britta's I'll

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.760 
trademarked so from me Britta's I'll
catch<00:06:53.580> you<00:06:53.730> later
