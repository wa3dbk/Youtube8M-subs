00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.439
 Yes, welcome again here 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.810
 they blame you country 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.820
 I have the earth and may you 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.490
 show how to put it together in the report 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.529
 There are always a few questions from 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.910
 few of us, of course, the 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.830
 question of meaning, I'm tinkering now 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.650
 skateboard together and there you catch 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.000
 Of course, one with a prepaid and we 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.269
 Of course we have a skateboard 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.610
 her part to katar shops to but 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:49.350
 later and we'll start with 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:52.059
 Just make a skateboard on it 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.549
 very easy to ask how many more wars 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.199
 I actually have the script on it 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:01:01.290
 Do I need glue or something? 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:06.520
 no you are lucky because it is 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:08.740
 self-adhesive so the skater look 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.799
 skrzypek are pretty glue too 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.799
 pretty much you can see a little bit 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.159
 do it and then you have it in first 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.560
 of course, that's not the case 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.179
 Great but it does not do any stress that way 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.390
 Now pay attention to that, of course if 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:30.310
 her son skater luxe dings on this 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.229
 have whatever you call it help to 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.719
 jumps 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.249
 correct the logo if you have a skater 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.229
 lux logo has on it then it is quite 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:39.219
 important to stick it on properly yes 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.570
 I had it before that it'll 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.520
 of course, on it and then have 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.380
 a problem therefore always first time 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.179
 how is my board so it must be 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.890
 be forward 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.539
 Here is the house and you can tell 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.039
 because it is in the page profile namely 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.049
 clearly sees that the cans piece 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.520
 bigger is longer and higher than 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.700
 estelle and now I'll do that 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:03.000
 script on it with two fingers 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:05.220
 left and right zack zack on it 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.750
 and now it's different every one of them 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:15.270
 buying pressure that no bubbles arise 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:17.880
 so just be careful and 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.500
 then you already have mine 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:26.310
 trick is always with your feet on it 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.600
 just put some down 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.910
 know the trick already then it is 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.040
 usually stays already you know 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.040
 maybe that older video from us 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.150
 of course it is a bit dirty 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.850
 But it does not matter because he should use 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.450
 So now the tool comes 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.480
 behind the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.450
 so if you bought the complete then 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.830
 do you have in surabaya He could thus so 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.720
 some while now here comes this 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.790
 small in the bus with cross always turn and 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:00.420
 he is actually very practical because 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.890
 if you take it right you can do it that way 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.709
 a brand if you have to 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.000
 later with the hangover you have to completely 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.850
 important are these sick ones 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.980
 always a bit stupid to meet if 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.400
 We too far out makes printing something 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.400
 just here 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:29.549
 if you do not quite come see this 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.910
 first so that no 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:36.180
 stress now it starts 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.900
 caution we small with a knife, it is 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.579
 really sharp 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.829
 of course I have already here now 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.030
 of course what about a cut 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.370
 advantage is because then I can you 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.190
 really nice and now easy 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.549
 supple it would have to be in the squad, of course 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:55.430
 be that which is sharp and then go 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.430
 just go around 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.110
 zack zack zack away with it 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:09.480
 and then it is already 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:12.379
 Of course you can finish that fine 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.970
 can do work up to look up here 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.199
 many among us skate to make 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.729
 then mostly here are still scratching 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.109
 something like that is yours 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.639
 leave it up to you as you can 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.290
 Also a cafÃ© that can do something with it 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.340
 template draufspielt so sees the 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.590
 script first off it was the first park 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.800
 before the walk together a lot of fun 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.800
 there
