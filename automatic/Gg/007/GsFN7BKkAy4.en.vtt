00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.730
 hello to all windows log readers 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:13.099
 Italy from travel this day we want 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.589
 show you the news present in the last one 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.310
 build of windows 10 for the insider 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:21.170
 we are talking about the bild 10 thousand 166 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.330
 the goal of this version is that 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.880
 to clean up the interface and to fix 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.699
 any consumption stability problems 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.460
 and compatibility and recall from microsoft 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.020
 the browser is now more stable 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.420
 compared to the previous version is 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.910
 grows less in this version are 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.010
 been corrected the inevitable ball is 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.340
 the look back is enabled by default 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.050
 localhost remember that to access the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.260
 local host just type in the bar 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.120
 of addresses about two flex points and 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.879
 these you see are all the options 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.440
 currently available 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.140
 moreover the support has been improved 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.590
 to the organ you hope from countries other than the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.590
 United States 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:08.780
 as for the apps as you can 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.689
 see open faster 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.220
 they also seem more fluid and faster 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.210
 in short, they are already completed 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.210
 really a great job 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.640
 the music suffered a few days ago a 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.369
 we changed the brand to xbox 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.810
 there were no music citrus music 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.329
 other changes compared to the version 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.450
 previous we find however to execute 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.450
 a track 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.090
 we now turn to the picture still has some 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.010
 problemino unfortunately shows 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.230
 correctly the photos present in the 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.960
 collection allows you to make all the 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.160
 change operations exactly 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.170
 the ones we saw in the video 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.700
 previous one 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.370
 unfortunately there is some problem 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.110
 in album management as you can 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.600
 see despite the photos are 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.250
 catalog several gaps in folders 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.600
 show only a few days ago is 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.210
 an update was also released 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.250
 for OS 2016 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.500
 many improvements have been made 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.050
 under the hood there was however some 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.690
 small graphic retouching in the box what 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.330
 you want to do in the user first 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.710
 in fact the avatar was present 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.870
 of the account near the name 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.420
 now instead it is only visible 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.990
 clicking on it and also changed 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.850
 return the share button icon 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.650
 there is no other news in 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.270
 this version and let's see though 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.870
 quickly what are the icons of 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.560
 system 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.780
 this is the calendar these are 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.120
 notifications was finally resolved on 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.520
 bug that did not show correctly 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.560
 quick actions 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:06.860
 the volume already from some version 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:10.140
 changed the feeding network animation 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.900
 one drive and has not changed and 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:19.380
 now I show you the defender icon 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:21.470
 Also here it is with regard cortana 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.470
 no news compared to the version 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.470
 previous one 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.220
 also this time before finishing the 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.650
 video I would like to show you a little trick 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.660
 if you, like me, own a 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.849
 device where you can adjust the 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.390
 brightness and you are tired of the usual 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:43.090
 25 percent defaults 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.340
 Fifty percent to 75 percent percent 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.810
 percent or solution 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.900
 click on settings of 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.959
 power supplies and screen suspension 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:57.010
 brightness level and set the 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.069
 level that suits you we put it 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.220
 so 2 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.230
 and here is 2 percent 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.569
 well and all for this short video 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.099
 to the next a greeting from the whole 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.099
