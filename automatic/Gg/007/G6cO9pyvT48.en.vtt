of course he gets the kill with the
commander<00:05:38.910> lunge<00:05:39.270> so<00:05:40.050> I<00:05:40.350> don't<00:05:41.010> know<00:05:41.070> why<00:05:41.280> he

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
commander lunge so I don't know why he

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.910 
commander lunge so I don't know why he
would<00:05:41.490> do<00:05:41.670> that<00:05:41.700> oh<00:05:42.030> my<00:05:42.870> you<00:05:42.930> every<00:05:43.350> I<00:05:43.380> got<00:05:43.800> the

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
clothes for the UAV he didn't even touch

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.530 
clothes for the UAV he didn't even touch
the<00:05:47.040> guy<00:05:47.160> up<00:05:47.340> there<00:05:47.490> so<00:05:47.820> I<00:05:48.000> don't<00:05:48.270> know<00:05:48.330> what<00:05:48.450> he

the guy up there so I don't know what he

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.980 
the guy up there so I don't know what he
was<00:05:48.630> thinking<00:05:48.690> but<00:05:49.050> look<00:05:49.740> this<00:05:49.920> is<00:05:50.780> this<00:05:51.780> is

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
was thinking but look this is this is

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.290 
was thinking but look this is this is
the<00:05:52.290> commando<00:05:52.830> lunge<00:05:53.100> a<00:05:53.490> little<00:05:54.120> bit<00:05:54.210> of

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
the commando lunge a little bit of

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.010 
the commando lunge a little bit of
modern<00:05:54.540> warfare<00:05:54.690> 2<00:05:55.110> still<00:05:55.860> in<00:05:56.010> black<00:05:56.730> ops

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
modern warfare 2 still in black ops

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.910 
modern warfare 2 still in black ops
probably<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.140> only<00:05:58.260> thing<00:05:58.560> i<00:05:58.650> don't<00:05:58.710> like

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
probably the only thing i don't like

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.460 
probably the only thing i don't like
about<00:05:59.040> black<00:05:59.460> ops<00:05:59.670> is<00:05:59.880> just<00:06:00.090> the<00:06:00.690> range<00:06:01.170> on

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
about black ops is just the range on

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.770 
about black ops is just the range on
that<00:06:01.620> blue<00:06:01.860> orange<00:06:02.160> and<00:06:02.460> the<00:06:02.640> knife<00:06:02.880> is<00:06:03.090> just

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
that blue orange and the knife is just

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.670 
that blue orange and the knife is just
ridiculous<00:06:04.380> same<00:06:04.620> time

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
ridiculous same time

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.660 
ridiculous same time
it<00:06:06.680> actually<00:06:06.920> happens<00:06:07.310> at<00:06:07.370> the<00:06:07.460> end<00:06:07.490> of<00:06:07.610> this

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
it actually happens at the end of this

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.860 
it actually happens at the end of this
round<00:06:07.850> two<00:06:08.410> unfortunately<00:06:09.410> but<00:06:10.420> right<00:06:11.420> here<00:06:11.540> I

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
round two unfortunately but right here I

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.340 
round two unfortunately but right here I
take<00:06:12.350> out<00:06:12.500> the<00:06:12.620> UAV<00:06:13.040> nice<00:06:13.580> and<00:06:13.790> quick<00:06:14.350> without

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
take out the UAV nice and quick without

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.710 
take out the UAV nice and quick without
if<00:06:15.680> I<00:06:15.980> didn't<00:06:16.280> take<00:06:16.370> out<00:06:16.550> this<00:06:16.670> UAV<00:06:16.880> I<00:06:17.360> don't

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
if I didn't take out this UAV I don't

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.120 
if I didn't take out this UAV I don't
think<00:06:17.780> I<00:06:17.930> would<00:06:18.080> have<00:06:18.110> been<00:06:18.260> able<00:06:18.350> to<00:06:18.530> get<00:06:19.010> this

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
think I would have been able to get this

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.190 
think I would have been able to get this
clip<00:06:19.460> because<00:06:19.700> I<00:06:20.150> think<00:06:20.960> they<00:06:21.020> would<00:06:21.170> have

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
clip because I think they would have

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.480 
clip because I think they would have
just<00:06:21.290> turned<00:06:21.650> around<00:06:21.830> and<00:06:22.010> killed<00:06:22.280> in<00:06:22.370> right

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
just turned around and killed in right

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.870 
just turned around and killed in right
here<00:06:22.720> but<00:06:23.720> just<00:06:23.870> a<00:06:23.960> pointer<00:06:24.350> if<00:06:25.070> you<00:06:25.460> see<00:06:25.670> a<00:06:25.700> guy

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
here but just a pointer if you see a guy

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.850 
here but just a pointer if you see a guy
like<00:06:26.060> right<00:06:26.240> there<00:06:26.390> if<00:06:27.020> you<00:06:27.230> shoot<00:06:27.560> at<00:06:27.710> him

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
like right there if you shoot at him

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.650 
like right there if you shoot at him
while<00:06:28.490> he's<00:06:28.670> sprinting<00:06:28.940> you<00:06:29.240> don't<00:06:29.390> kill<00:06:29.570> him

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660 
while he's sprinting you don't kill him

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.180 
while he's sprinting you don't kill him
he's<00:06:29.990> going<00:06:30.110> to<00:06:30.170> turn<00:06:30.470> around<00:06:30.620> and<00:06:30.920> probably

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
he's going to turn around and probably

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.430 
he's going to turn around and probably
go<00:06:31.340> prone<00:06:31.640> and<00:06:32.060> kill<00:06:32.600> you<00:06:32.720> so<00:06:32.930> don't<00:06:32.960> shoot<00:06:33.140> at

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
go prone and kill you so don't shoot at

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.930 
go prone and kill you so don't shoot at
them<00:06:33.560> unless<00:06:33.920> you<00:06:34.070> know<00:06:34.340> you<00:06:34.580> can<00:06:34.730> get<00:06:34.820> the

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
them unless you know you can get the

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.870 
them unless you know you can get the
kill<00:06:35.140> flak<00:06:36.140> jacket<00:06:36.590> probably<00:06:37.190> one<00:06:37.490> saving

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
kill flak jacket probably one saving

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.700

right there and got me those three kills

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.780 
right there and got me those three kills
and<00:06:39.950> we<00:06:40.730> win<00:06:41.080> but<00:06:42.340> yeah<00:06:43.340> so<00:06:43.550> that's<00:06:43.669> basically

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:43.790 
and we win but yeah so that's basically

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.880 
and we win but yeah so that's basically
it<00:06:44.150> I<00:06:44.919> just<00:06:45.919> quick<00:06:46.580> recap<00:06:47.410> don't<00:06:48.410> go<00:06:48.560> the<00:06:48.710> same

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
it I just quick recap don't go the same

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.560 
it I just quick recap don't go the same
route<00:06:49.100> every<00:06:49.280> single<00:06:49.669> time<00:06:49.850> change<00:06:50.240> it<00:06:50.360> up<00:06:50.480> a

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570 
route every single time change it up a

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.980 
route every single time change it up a
bit<00:06:51.460> you<00:06:52.460> still<00:06:52.700> use<00:06:53.300> the<00:06:53.510> knife<00:06:53.690> when<00:06:53.960> you

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
bit you still use the knife when you

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.240 
bit you still use the knife when you
