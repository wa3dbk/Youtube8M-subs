number<00:00:04.290> 8<00:00:04.740> this<00:00:05.549> week<00:00:05.759> I'm<00:00:05.910> going<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.120> talk

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
number 8 this week I'm going to talk

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.820 
number 8 this week I'm going to talk
about<00:00:06.799> trigger<00:00:07.799> voltages<00:00:08.370> for<00:00:08.550> flashes<00:00:09.830> so

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
about trigger voltages for flashes so

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.799 
about trigger voltages for flashes so
the<00:00:11.130> wait<00:00:11.280> flash<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.480> triggered<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:14.070> has<00:00:14.809> at

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
the wait flash is triggered is it has at

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.950 
the wait flash is triggered is it has at
least<00:00:16.080> two<00:00:16.379> pins<00:00:16.710> modern<00:00:17.490> like<00:00:18.000> TTL<00:00:18.539> flashes

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
least two pins modern like TTL flashes

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.260 
least two pins modern like TTL flashes
have<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> lot<00:00:19.320> more<00:00:19.500> but<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.670> older<00:00:20.910> flashes

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
have a lot more but the older flashes

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.349 
have a lot more but the older flashes
had<00:00:21.449> two<00:00:21.660> different<00:00:21.810> pins<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:23.060> one<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.180> those

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
had two different pins and one of those

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.450 
had two different pins and one of those
would<00:00:24.600> output<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> voltage<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.099> other<00:00:26.250> one

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
would output a voltage and the other one

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.990 
would output a voltage and the other one
would<00:00:26.580> be<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.910> common<00:00:27.710> pin<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.000> basically

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
would be the common pin and basically

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.429 
would be the common pin and basically
when<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.300> circuit<00:00:30.660> was<00:00:30.779> completed<00:00:31.289> between

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
when the circuit was completed between

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.780 
when the circuit was completed between
those<00:00:31.890> pins<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:33.450> flash<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:34.020> be<00:00:34.140> triggered

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
those pins the flash would be triggered

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.240 
those pins the flash would be triggered
so<00:00:35.790> different<00:00:36.630> flashes<00:00:37.110> will<00:00:37.440> use<00:00:37.800> different

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
so different flashes will use different

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.010 
so different flashes will use different
trigger<00:00:38.670> voltages<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:40.170> old<00:00:40.500> Vivitar<00:00:41.399> flash

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
trigger voltages this old Vivitar flash

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.979 
trigger voltages this old Vivitar flash
has<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> very<00:00:43.559> high<00:00:43.829> trigger<00:00:44.219> voltage<00:00:44.780> way<00:00:45.780> over

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
has a very high trigger voltage way over

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.720 
has a very high trigger voltage way over
a<00:00:46.020> hundred<00:00:46.379> volts<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.610> actually

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
a hundred volts and that can actually

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.450 
a hundred volts and that can actually
damage<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.420> lot<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.690> modern<00:00:48.980> cameras<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.190> you

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
damage a lot of modern cameras and you

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.500 
damage a lot of modern cameras and you
know<00:00:50.579> if<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.789> look<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.090> your<00:00:51.210> user<00:00:51.390> guide

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
know if you look in your user guide

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.790 
know if you look in your user guide
they'll<00:00:51.930> say<00:00:52.140> don't<00:00:52.379> use<00:00:52.590> high<00:00:52.770> voltage

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
they'll say don't use high voltage

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.060 
they'll say don't use high voltage
flashes<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:53.879> with<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.480> camera<00:00:54.860> it<00:00:55.860> could

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
flashes with with this camera it could

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.099 
flashes with with this camera it could
damage<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.579> flash<00:00:56.850> or<00:00:57.210> won't<00:00:57.360> function<00:00:57.629> or

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
damage the flash or won't function or

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.900 
damage the flash or won't function or
damage<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.859> camera<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.399> won't<00:00:59.640> function

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
damage the camera or won't function

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.299 
damage the camera or won't function
properly<00:01:00.149> with<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.899> camera<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.440> make<00:01:02.280> sure

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
properly with the camera so make sure

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.609 
properly with the camera so make sure
you<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.390> know<00:01:03.690> you're<00:01:03.870> careful<00:01:04.290> about<00:01:04.409> that

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
you you know you're careful about that

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.010 
you you know you're careful about that
definitely<00:01:05.040> don't<00:01:05.280> want<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> damage<00:01:06.479> your

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
definitely don't want to damage your

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.719 
definitely don't want to damage your
camera<00:01:09.020> here<00:01:10.020> are<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.229> couple<00:01:10.290> more<00:01:11.220> modern

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
camera here are a couple more modern

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.700 
camera here are a couple more modern
flashes<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.600> use<00:01:12.780> much<00:01:13.020> lower<00:01:13.380> trigger

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
flashes that use much lower trigger

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.539 
flashes that use much lower trigger
voltages<00:01:15.140> this<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> Canon<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.430> an

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
voltages this is a Canon this is an

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.210 
voltages this is a Canon this is an
often<00:01:17.790> named<00:01:18.270> one<00:01:18.780> from<00:01:19.110> China<00:01:19.710> I've<00:01:20.040> used

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
often named one from China I've used

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.679 
often named one from China I've used
both<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.640> these<00:01:20.729> with<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.000> camera<00:01:21.420> acts<00:01:21.540> as

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
both of these with the camera acts as

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.450 
both of these with the camera acts as
well<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.200> these<00:01:22.380> are<00:01:22.530> safe<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> camera

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
well and these are safe on the camera

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.780 
well and these are safe on the camera
acts<00:01:24.530> with<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.560> camera<00:01:26.009> wraps<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.549> say

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
acts with the camera wraps I can say

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.399 
acts with the camera wraps I can say
that<00:01:27.140> it's<00:01:28.140> safe<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.310> 35<00:01:30.060> volts<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.079> if<00:01:31.320> you

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
that it's safe up to 35 volts so if you

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.640 
that it's safe up to 35 volts so if you
go<00:01:31.530> higher<00:01:31.860> than<00:01:32.310> 35<00:01:33.060> volts<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.780> may<00:01:34.110> damage<00:01:34.380> a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
go higher than 35 volts you may damage a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.069 
go higher than 35 volts you may damage a
chip<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.579> camera<00:01:36.270> acts<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.600> actually<00:01:36.720> put<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
chip in the camera acts I actually put a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.319 
chip in the camera acts I actually put a
protection<00:01:37.500> chip<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.400> there<00:01:38.549> called<00:01:38.820> an<00:01:38.939> opto

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
protection chip in there called an opto

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.080 
protection chip in there called an opto
isolator<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.220> can't<00:01:41.430> damage<00:01:41.729> your

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
isolator so that you can't damage your

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.760 
isolator so that you can't damage your
camera<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.689> accidentally<00:01:43.229> plug<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> high

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
camera if you accidentally plug a high

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.830 
camera if you accidentally plug a high
voltage<00:01:43.979> flash<00:01:44.549> into<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.210> camera<00:01:45.540> acts<00:01:45.630> but

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
voltage flash into the camera acts but

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.800 
voltage flash into the camera acts but
you<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.710> could<00:01:46.950> damage<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.610> camera<00:01:48.180> acts<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you you could damage the camera acts and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.950 
you you could damage the camera acts and
usually<00:01:49.799> all<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.490> replace<00:01:50.759> a

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
usually all you have to do is replace a

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.319 
usually all you have to do is replace a
50<00:01:51.960> cent<00:01:52.170> chip<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.860> I'll<00:01:52.979> actually<00:01:53.250> go<00:01:54.180> into

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
50 cent chip and I'll actually go into

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.200 
50 cent chip and I'll actually go into
that<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.960> little<00:01:55.200> bit<00:01:55.409> now<00:01:56.210> I'll

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
that in a little bit now I'll

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.149 
that in a little bit now I'll
demonstrate<00:01:57.329> how<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.899> measure<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.799> actual

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
demonstrate how to measure the actual

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.730 
demonstrate how to measure the actual
trigger<00:01:59.369> voltages<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.149> your<00:02:00.299> flashes<00:02:00.840> all

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
trigger voltages for your flashes all

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.700 
trigger voltages for your flashes all
you<00:02:02.009> need<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.479> multimeter<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.840> some<00:02:04.439> sort

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
you need is a multimeter of some sort

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.059 
you need is a multimeter of some sort
like<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.520> measure<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.030> voltage<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:07.069> set

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
like this to measure the voltage and set

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.199 
like this to measure the voltage and set
it<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.220> DC<00:02:08.550> voltage<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:10.709> then<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.209> hot

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
it to DC voltage and then I have a hot

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.800 
it to DC voltage and then I have a hot
shoe<00:02:12.480> for<00:02:12.750> my<00:02:12.840> flash<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:13.560> that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
shoe for my flash so that

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.320 
shoe for my flash so that
I<00:02:13.870> can<00:02:14.140> measure<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.760> voltage<00:02:16.120> across

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
I can measure the the voltage across

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.089 
I can measure the the voltage across
those<00:02:16.660> two<00:02:16.720> terminals<00:02:17.410> more<00:02:17.620> easily<00:02:17.920> without

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
those two terminals more easily without

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.610 
those two terminals more easily without
actually<00:02:18.670> test<00:02:18.940> touching<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.959> terminals<00:02:20.500> on

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
actually test touching the terminals on

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.729 
actually test touching the terminals on
the<00:02:20.650> flash<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.390> plug<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.420> in<00:02:22.900> this<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
the flash I plug that in this is the

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.740 
the flash I plug that in this is the
high<00:02:23.950> voltage<00:02:24.459> vivitar<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:25.300> can<00:02:25.480> see

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
high voltage vivitar and you can see

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.809 
high voltage vivitar and you can see
that<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:26.650> know<00:02:26.739> just<00:02:26.920> sitting<00:02:27.310> there<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.640> was

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
that you know just sitting there it was

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.670 
that you know just sitting there it was
sitting<00:02:28.150> at<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.300> hundred<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.780> thirty<00:02:29.349> six

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
sitting at a hundred and thirty six

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.330 
sitting at a hundred and thirty six
volts<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.400> when<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.420> turn<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:31.810> on<00:02:31.900> it'll<00:02:32.290> go<00:02:32.470> to

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
volts and when I turn it on it'll go to

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.009 
volts and when I turn it on it'll go to
an<00:02:33.489> even<00:02:33.730> higher<00:02:33.760> voltage<00:02:34.660> so<00:02:36.540> yeah<00:02:37.540> it's<00:02:37.720> it's

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
an even higher voltage so yeah it's it's

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.949 
an even higher voltage so yeah it's it's
over<00:02:38.349> two<00:02:38.560> hundred<00:02:38.590> volts<00:02:39.190> now<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.610> it's<00:02:39.959> now

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
over two hundred volts now and it's now

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.720 
over two hundred volts now and it's now
ready<00:02:41.260> for<00:02:41.410> trigger<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.099> says<00:02:42.310> but<00:02:42.580> its

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
ready for trigger it says but its

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.580 
ready for trigger it says but its
voltage<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.630> still<00:02:43.900> climbing

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
voltage is still climbing

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.759 
voltage is still climbing
I<00:02:46.680> think<00:02:47.680> it'll<00:02:47.830> stabilize<00:02:48.150> around<00:02:49.230> there<00:02:50.230> so

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
I think it'll stabilize around there so

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.080 
I think it'll stabilize around there so
that's<00:02:50.950> two<00:02:51.160> hundred<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.489> fifty<00:02:51.910> two<00:02:52.060> hundred

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
that's two hundred and fifty two hundred

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.449 
that's two hundred and fifty two hundred
and<00:02:52.390> sixty<00:02:52.780> volts<00:02:53.049> that's<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:54.040> lot<00:02:54.220> more<00:02:54.400> than

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
and sixty volts that's a lot more than

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.610 
and sixty volts that's a lot more than
the<00:02:55.090> camera<00:02:55.450> axe<00:02:55.630> can<00:02:55.930> handle<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:56.530> you

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
the camera axe can handle so you

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.170 
the camera axe can handle so you
shouldn't<00:02:57.010> use<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.459> kind<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:57.819> a<00:02:57.940> flash

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
shouldn't use this kind of a flash

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.420 
shouldn't use this kind of a flash
directly<00:02:58.840> with<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.110> camera<00:02:59.410> axe<00:02:59.560> you'd<00:03:00.130> want

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
directly with the camera axe you'd want

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.500 
directly with the camera axe you'd want
to<00:03:00.549> put<00:03:01.540> some<00:03:01.780> kind<00:03:02.019> of<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.549> voltage<00:03:03.549> limiting

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
to put some kind of a voltage limiting

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.630 
to put some kind of a voltage limiting
circuit<00:03:04.989> between<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.769> camera<00:03:06.099> axe<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.489> this

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
circuit between the camera axe and this

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.850 
circuit between the camera axe and this
flash<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.330> I'll<00:03:07.989> discuss<00:03:08.319> how<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.530> do<00:03:08.739> that

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
flash and I'll discuss how to do that

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.949 
flash and I'll discuss how to do that
maybe<00:03:09.069> in<00:03:09.250> a<00:03:09.310> future<00:03:09.670> blog<00:03:10.890> but<00:03:12.690> let's<00:03:13.690> take<00:03:13.930> a

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
maybe in a future blog but let's take a

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:22.650 
maybe in a future blog but let's take a
look<00:03:14.260> at<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:16.180> canon<00:03:16.480> flash<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:21.400> reads<00:03:22.299> zero

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
look at the canon flash so reads zero

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.229 
look at the canon flash so reads zero
volts<00:03:23.049> until<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:23.380> turn<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.769> on<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:27.000> this<00:03:28.000> one's

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
volts until I turn it on and this one's

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.830 
volts until I turn it on and this one's
4.5<00:03:29.140> volts<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:30.069> that's<00:03:30.670> perfectly<00:03:31.359> safe<00:03:31.600> like

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
4.5 volts so that's perfectly safe like

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.930 
4.5 volts so that's perfectly safe like
I<00:03:31.989> said<00:03:32.200> anything<00:03:32.440> up<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.829> 35<00:03:33.370> volts<00:03:33.790> on<00:03:33.910> the

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
I said anything up to 35 volts on the

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.930 
I said anything up to 35 volts on the
camera<00:03:34.299> axe<00:03:34.510> is<00:03:34.720> safe<00:03:35.310> obviously<00:03:36.310> this<00:03:36.489> Canon

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
camera axe is safe obviously this Canon

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.860 
camera axe is safe obviously this Canon
flash<00:03:37.180> is<00:03:37.480> safe<00:03:37.780> for<00:03:38.680> all<00:03:38.709> Canon<00:03:39.609> cameras<00:03:40.060> so

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
flash is safe for all Canon cameras so

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.319 
flash is safe for all Canon cameras so
as<00:03:41.079> long<00:03:41.230> as<00:03:41.319> you<00:03:41.500> stay<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:41.829> know<00:03:42.160> around<00:03:42.549> 4.5

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
as long as you stay you know around 4.5

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.789 
as long as you stay you know around 4.5
or<00:03:43.569> less<00:03:43.690> volts<00:03:44.019> you<00:03:44.079> know<00:03:44.260> you're<00:03:44.440> safe<00:03:44.650> on

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
or less volts you know you're safe on

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.949 
or less volts you know you're safe on
Canon<00:03:45.190> but<00:03:45.310> most<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:46.389> them<00:03:46.510> can<00:03:46.690> go<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.840> bit

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
Canon but most of them can go a bit

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.490 
Canon but most of them can go a bit
higher<00:03:47.319> than<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.650> so<00:03:49.019> now<00:03:50.019> let's<00:03:50.230> say<00:03:50.440> you

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
higher than that so now let's say you

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.979 
higher than that so now let's say you
accidentally<00:03:51.040> plug<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.940> Vivitar<00:03:52.630> flash

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
accidentally plug that Vivitar flash

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.420 
accidentally plug that Vivitar flash
with<00:03:53.319> its<00:03:53.639> 250<00:03:54.639> volts<00:03:55.090> DC<00:03:56.220> flowing<00:03:57.220> through

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
with its 250 volts DC flowing through

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.030 
with its 250 volts DC flowing through
this<00:03:57.549> camera<00:03:58.030> flash<00:03:58.299> port<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:59.260> mentioned

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
this camera flash port I mentioned

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.410 
this camera flash port I mentioned
before<00:04:00.130> that<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:00.730> camera<00:04:00.970> axe<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.269> only

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
before that the camera axe is only

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.819 
before that the camera axe is only
designed<00:04:01.900> for<00:04:02.790> 35<00:04:03.790> volts<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:05.410> nice<00:04:05.590> thing

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
designed for 35 volts the nice thing

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.650 
designed for 35 volts the nice thing
about<00:04:05.859> the<00:04:06.160> camera<00:04:06.459> axe<00:04:06.609> is<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:06.940> designed<00:04:07.359> it

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
about the camera axe is I designed it

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.599 
about the camera axe is I designed it
with<00:04:08.109> the<00:04:08.500> idea<00:04:08.769> that<00:04:08.829> maybe<00:04:09.069> somebody<00:04:09.519> would

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
with the idea that maybe somebody would

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.550 
with the idea that maybe somebody would
accidentally<00:04:10.120> do<00:04:10.359> that<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.750> damage<00:04:11.380> the

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
accidentally do that and damage the

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.440 
accidentally do that and damage the
camera<00:04:11.769> axis<00:04:12.190> so<00:04:12.310> I<00:04:12.340> made<00:04:12.519> it<00:04:12.639> really<00:04:12.850> easy<00:04:13.000> to

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
camera axis so I made it really easy to

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.620 
camera axis so I made it really easy to
fix<00:04:14.220> all<00:04:15.220> you<00:04:15.370> do<00:04:15.519> is<00:04:15.670> pop<00:04:15.910> open<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.389> camera

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
fix all you do is pop open the camera

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.670 
fix all you do is pop open the camera
axe<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.109> there's<00:04:17.709> this<00:04:17.889> chip<00:04:18.220> here<00:04:18.489> labeled<00:04:19.030> L

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
axe and there's this chip here labeled L

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.450 
axe and there's this chip here labeled L
T<00:04:20.680> V<00:04:21.390> 847<00:04:22.390> and<00:04:22.539> that's<00:04:22.900> an<00:04:23.050> opto<00:04:23.560> isolator<00:04:23.740> chip

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
T V 847 and that's an opto isolator chip

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.390 
T V 847 and that's an opto isolator chip
that's<00:04:24.970> what<00:04:25.360> can<00:04:25.510> handle<00:04:25.810> up<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.080> 35<00:04:27.010> volts

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
that's what can handle up to 35 volts

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.640 
that's what can handle up to 35 volts
and

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
and

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.320 
and
basically<00:04:27.860> if<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.370> plug<00:04:28.729> something<00:04:28.759> else

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
basically if you plug something else

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.600 
basically if you plug something else
that's<00:04:29.990> much<00:04:30.229> higher<00:04:30.440> hundreds<00:04:31.100> of<00:04:31.280> volts

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
that's much higher hundreds of volts

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.760 
that's much higher hundreds of volts
this<00:04:32.060> chip<00:04:32.360> will<00:04:32.509> protect<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.320> rest<00:04:33.500> of<00:04:33.710> the

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
this chip will protect the rest of the

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.060 
this chip will protect the rest of the
camera<00:04:34.160> acts<00:04:34.340> along<00:04:35.180> with<00:04:35.449> any<00:04:36.380> camera<00:04:36.919> or

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
camera acts along with any camera or

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.499 
camera acts along with any camera or
anything<00:04:37.280> else<00:04:37.550> that<00:04:37.669> might<00:04:37.880> be<00:04:37.940> plugged<00:04:38.300> into

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
anything else that might be plugged into

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:40.840 
anything else that might be plugged into
the<00:04:38.690> camera<00:04:38.990> act<00:04:39.169> so<00:04:39.650> all<00:04:39.800> you<00:04:39.949> need<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.130> do<00:04:40.400> is

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
the camera act so all you need to do is

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.960 
the camera act so all you need to do is
use<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.120> little<00:04:41.419> screwdriver<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.729> pop<00:04:43.729> that

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
use a little screwdriver and pop that

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.180 
use a little screwdriver and pop that
chip<00:04:44.240> out<00:04:44.389> and<00:04:44.660> then<00:04:45.350> you<00:04:45.500> can<00:04:45.650> pop<00:04:45.889> in<00:04:46.100> a

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
chip out and then you can pop in a

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.520 
chip out and then you can pop in a
replacement<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:47.030> chips<00:04:47.660> you<00:04:48.020> know<00:04:48.139> fifty
