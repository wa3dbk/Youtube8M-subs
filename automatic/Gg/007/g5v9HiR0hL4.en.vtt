00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.090
 yes this situation is commonplace for a photographer 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.979
 you are standing in front of a big building 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:12.769
 now a wide angle lens has to use all of this building on the 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:13.959
 Get picture 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.380
 and in retrospect, you realize that the building you are photographing 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.400
 Has 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.119
 threatens to overthrow 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.550
 these rushing the lines 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.089
 thereby perspective continuation of the objective 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.819
 produced 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:34.600
 that is why the team moves the horizontal between the objective and the 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.600
 the building has a shorter distance 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.530
 between the objective and the highest or most distant edge of the building 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.800
 and to correct the whole there is only simple way we were this 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.290
 Program Siepi Kilometer Car This is freeware and can be pulled on the internet 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.890
 will be free 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.000
 and we will do that, so first I go to the picture area 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.390
 in the menu item 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.830
 and looking to align this point with the one I can now on this 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.220
 Photo lying that serves the navigation of the orientation 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.100
 so and now you can see well too 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.840
 the picture 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.530
 a goose strong prospects distortion market 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.510
 Uni I have on the left 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.560
 Window side some sliders 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.540
 and now start to correct it on the right side 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.540
 by sliding the slider to the right 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.190
 as strange as that sounds 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.579
 and the slider Mullings Fiebig to the right around the left image page 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.210
 adjust 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.210
 everyone had moved back a bit 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.390
 but that can follow suit 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.570
 where and how you can recognize it 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.860
 Percent is the horizontal one 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.500
 not given that must also be corrected so it can with the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.720
 Regulator and make 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.520
 by going 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.520
 easy to move 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.429
 and adapt the structure 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.729
 that's the way it should have been 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.729
 Momo I just press on align picture 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:23.489
 and I have the Berlin Gate in front of me as I have really seen 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.219
 and to finish it all because here are now 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:28.769
 black 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.689
 The tips were still created 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.689
 I have to write off with the mouse pointer 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.259
 a right corner 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:39.409
 but the picture is in frame 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.409
 Press and hold the mouse pointer 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.049
 subject 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.389
 let go 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.799
 its is shaded the part of the behind is shaded 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:52.909
 shown 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.239
 if I now press crop on picture I have the finished photo 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.599
 I am corrected lines 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.539
 that was it 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:06.779
 the program offers much more 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:09.089
 but then we come back later
