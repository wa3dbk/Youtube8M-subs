00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 Hello today I show you how to enter 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.460
 create field effect 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.950
 First, I'll show you how to play them 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.719
 Pictures of a white or black 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.719
 surface are blended 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.320
 open the slide show and see it 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.210
 chapter from the toolbox to the timeline 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.910
 Now they move into the chapter 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.519
 picture object then select a picture 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.040
 when crossfading, no one intervene 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.570
 Under position you choose to cut 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.520
 pull the object from the toolbox 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.510
 colored background and set it 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.290
 under the image what they do then 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.290
 a second time 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.219
 Now you can set the objects for all objects 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.050
 duration and distance a 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.879
 the duration of the picture rises to 8 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.440
 seconds the distance to two seconds 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.219
 climb took the colored background 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.219
 me in 4 seconds 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.649
 Now I create for the first colored 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.960
 background a transparency curve the 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.409
 curve should be from second to zero 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.409
 sink 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.539
 at the second colored background becomes 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.729
 The transparency curve is exactly the opposite 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.569
 The curve rises from 0 to 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.709
 second 2 now we can get one 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.709
 first preview 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.649
 she still lacks something about the picture 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.110
 to make you feel more alive 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:02:01.250
 I hope the video and add about that 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:03.110
 camera symbol a tracking shot should I 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.450
 set a new brand of movement with the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.420
 plus symbol of the first brand I give 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.250
 the value of 2 seconds 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.290
 the second movement brand receives one 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:20.900
 worth 6 seconds and will be something 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:23.450
 now I want that 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.060
 first colored background and give 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.730
 give them a new color I choose for that 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.850
 white on the color scale for the second 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.170
 home of the reason I feel the same way 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.170
 I'll take a look at the preview again 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:49.030
 I am satisfied with the effect and 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.560
 existing ones save themselves that 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.180
 chapter in the cooler 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.700
 I give a title and a 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.909
 description 1 class a check mark 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.530
 The others are removed from the photo 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.819
 Now my effect in the toolbox is me 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.370
 can keep him in the timeline 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.370
 Drag and paste other pictures
