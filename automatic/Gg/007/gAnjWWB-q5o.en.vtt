00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:32.480
Make some noise for every couples, please. You guys sure ship them so hard. Why don’t you (refers to March and Tou) kiss each other for real?

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.020
Should we make it real?

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.350
Oh! Oh! The real man never changes his word, right!

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.430
I warn you no one will help you if you are saying like that.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.330
We aren’t doing rehearsal now, you know.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.630
Kiss him! Kiss him!

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.700
*couldn’t hear what Peach and Gunn said clearly*

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.000
If I were you, I would kiss him already!

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.480
*Tou suddenly kisses March*

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:23.160
Happy? Are you guys happy?

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.450
YES!!!

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.500
That’s it!

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.840
The kiss wasn’t in the script, you know!

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.180
Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.500
Wait..  You want us to do it again, don’t you?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Wait.. We should locate a bed here, so this issue will end finally. P’March seems not want to do it, but Tou really does!
