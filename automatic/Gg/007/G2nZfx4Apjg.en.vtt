00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.860
 mexiquense students were created a 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.650
 aerial police robot 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.000
 the artifact performs custody duties 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.190
 monitoring and monitoring of 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.570
 people and pre-delimited areas like 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.420
 parking lots and parking areas 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.390
 Recreation makes a flight of 360 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.550
 degrees identifying the object and going 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.010
 towards him until he reaches him when he arrives 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.710
 he already descends in the market there are 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.989
 this type of equipment but we try to 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.960
 build one for certain activities 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.210
 already very specific your project has already generated 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.010
 interest in police corporations without 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.109
 But they still work in the development of 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.940
 own technology to improve the 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.739
 performance and the functions for which 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.199
 it is thought as they could be observed 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.350
 in flight the air makes these 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.660
 engines have a certain error in the 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.370
 point where you want to place by 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.520
 so control what is being 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.620
 designing is to change this this control 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.640
 so that this engine 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.970
 have a greater effectiveness would be a 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.670
 tool of many we see that already in 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.369
 equal to 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.890
 they are using these trunks but they are 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.290
 saw are those in the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.870
 market that are not made to doc for 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.830
 do functions already in this case of 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.270
 intelligence 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.860
 these young people I am giving the last 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.330
 semester of your career and you already learn 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.280
 will constitute a company that offers 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.200
 advanced security services and 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.030
 also rent their devices for the 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.030
 topographic and construction sector 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.480
