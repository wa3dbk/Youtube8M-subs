00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
I've been digging over this and I just

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.039 
I've been digging over this and I just
remembered<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.519> for<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.540> 21st<00:00:15.990> century

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
remembered and for the 21st century

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.080 
remembered and for the 21st century
there<00:00:16.590> are<00:00:16.800> some<00:00:17.070> cartoons<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.760> found<00:00:18.000> they

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
were very good but the problem is these

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.519 
were very good but the problem is these
shows<00:00:20.760> didn't<00:00:21.060> stay<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.300> long<00:00:21.539> which<00:00:22.230> are<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
ones that should have stayed on for

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.070 
ones that should have stayed on for
