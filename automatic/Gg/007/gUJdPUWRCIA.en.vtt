00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.370
 for all recently, lg has released its new 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:11.250
 flagship lg g3 and you know well, until it comes 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.990
 he is on sale then while i make at him 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.509
 video review will come quite a lot 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.359
 time i would just share with 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.000
 you top 5 chips and features 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.939
 which I liked in the new flagship 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.670
 so let's consider them now 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.109
 the first thing I want to say is stunning 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.730
 and plays crane and a half inch 538 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.309
 dots per inch 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.649
 as well as a resolution of 2560 by 1440 this 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.379
 just mega awesome very cool 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.390
 looks mega spectacular this year 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.390
 of course 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:52.320
 gg3 bypasses its competitors such as 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.690
 samsung galaxy s5 and honor it on 8 themes 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.500
 that produce super clear cool 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.870
 display 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.050
 The second chip that I really 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.260
 liked this shell or loggia oh 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.049
 what can you call she became 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.540
 more pleasant but I won't say that to me 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.850
 previous did not like at all but somehow 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.040
 she was not very good 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.170
 tested in jyp dressed in 92 which 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.439
 was i can say that she is very strong 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.650
 still depended on the previous shell this 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.490
 the bun has become more flat more beautiful 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.950
 and of course you can say that she is there 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.960
 reminds with that is, well, in principle, everything 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.409
 what the flat probably already reminds 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.630
 with and the first touch phones which 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.729
 also resembled an iphone and but the essence is not 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.280
 the bottom line is that this works 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.509
 the shell just looks awesome she 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.280
 mega cool and has a variety of software 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.329
 killer feature is more thoughtful 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.840
 the keyboard is a well-known code but 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.610
 also double tap which still took into account all 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.920
 those people who used at least 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.219
 a day or two products on a loggia with 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.570
 double tap begins to drip wherever 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.890
 in a row and even me on and make too 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.850
 trample because she really 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.130
 habit works very quickly because 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.680
 that this is a convenient feature and the next killer 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.450
 a candle is a laser autofocus which 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.959
 allows you to focus camier 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.840
 so fast that you don't even have time 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.520
 blink an eye how fast 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.010
 focusing happens of course what 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.270
 As for the camera itself, then some 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.970
 supernatural 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.840
 updates did not happen that is she 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.530
 learned how to shoot video 4k hdr slow 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.209
 motion 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.370
 that is, all these features that 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.010
 have other smartphones she got 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.370
 as for fast focusing it 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.680
 really cool chip and it's a hit 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.190
 below the belt of the samsung company which is 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.150
 This accentuated his attention 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.090
 they are very fast focus but what is not 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.940
 very fast focus and of course where 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.570
 Performance has no 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.890
 snapdragon 800 processor 13 gigabytes 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.100
 random access memory 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.530
 adreno 330 graphics chip say what 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.489
 according to these characteristics they are straight 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.850
 gone to a distant top in contrast to lg g2 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:26.079
 No, but you will agree that most likely 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.310
 elji guys developers who work there 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.769
 over the third 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.410
 worked very hard on optimization 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.709
 because the shell itself works 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.930
 really good and if after 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.410
 samsung galaxy s5 presentations 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.959
 almost all bloggers have noticed 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.930
 slowing down in touch wiz then in angie 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.750
 she has no slow down 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.459
 it seems that guys and rather all the same 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.290
 begin to guess what it is 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.110
 optimization and the last thing i would like 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.020
 mark it externally 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.020
 and the view of course yes we all expected some 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.300
 there is some kind of metal 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.250
 waterproof some well 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.160
 fantastic look there with everyone 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.110
 There are lotions that can be of the type 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.420
 fingerprint touch and so 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.609
 further and the like here all this not 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.370
 plastic case has occurred 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.800
 but I want to note that at 5 5 inches with 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.920
 oil no more than example 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.170
 five-inch stove Sevan im 8 or not 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.120
 much more than the previous ones 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.919
 generations is lg g2 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:37.260
 you know it seems to me that all the same lg 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.840
 understand that the framework and must be dad 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.870
 Earlier, the smartphone should be easier and 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.120
 prettier and they did everything 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.860
 but as it should also just want to note that 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.370
 added to the plastic cover 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.919
 wireless charging and made removable 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.140
 3000mAh battery last 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.930
 I want to thank the staff of the company 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.510
 geely that they did not this year 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.280
 add waterproof case not 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.260
 began to add fingerprint sensor 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.410
 fingers so did it 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.140
 other guys and not very well wish 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.810
 lg company break through lg g3 and make 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.090
 compete with other well-known companies and 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.350
 with you I was vladimir czech 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.720
