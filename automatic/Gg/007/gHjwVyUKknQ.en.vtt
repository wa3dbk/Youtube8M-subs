so what we've got here is an old

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.650 
so what we've got here is an old
worn-out<00:00:06.260> spindle<00:00:07.260> and<00:00:07.500> there's<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.660> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
worn-out spindle and there's the the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.180 
worn-out spindle and there's the the
spindle<00:00:10.230> bearing<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.620> don't<00:00:10.769> know<00:00:10.860> if<00:00:10.950> you<00:00:11.039> can

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
spindle bearing I don't know if you can

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.069 
spindle bearing I don't know if you can
see<00:00:11.459> it<00:00:11.580> but<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.820> looks<00:00:12.059> like<00:00:12.150> they<00:00:12.480> normally

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:13.079 
see it but it looks like they normally

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.980 
see it but it looks like they normally
do<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.589> a<00:00:13.620> bunch<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.160> grease<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.329> sand<00:00:15.690> and

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
do with a bunch of grease and sand and

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.769 
do with a bunch of grease and sand and
mud<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.289> crud<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:17.010> there<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:18.210> we're<00:00:18.359> gonna<00:00:18.449> pop

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
mud and crud in there so we're gonna pop

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:38.319 
mud and crud in there so we're gonna pop
that<00:00:18.810> dude<00:00:19.349> out<00:00:33.680> and<00:00:35.210> that's<00:00:36.559> how<00:00:37.559> they<00:00:37.770> look

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
that dude out and that's how they look

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.510 
that dude out and that's how they look
the<00:00:39.329> grease<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.930> worn<00:00:40.289> out<00:00:40.500> there's<00:00:41.160> mud

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
the grease is worn out there's mud

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.630 
the grease is worn out there's mud
there's<00:00:41.550> sand<00:00:42.449> there's<00:00:42.989> pits<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:44.039> basically

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
there's sand there's pits it's basically

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.840 
there's sand there's pits it's basically
useless<00:00:45.020> so<00:00:47.300> what<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.480> want<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:49.460> is<00:00:50.460> show

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
useless so what we want to do is show

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.340 
useless so what we want to do is show
you<00:00:50.910> something<00:00:51.629> new<00:00:53.690> we've<00:00:54.690> come<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
you something new we've come up with a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.450 
you something new we've come up with a
nylon<00:00:56.359> bushing<00:00:57.359> that<00:00:57.769> goes<00:00:58.769> in<00:00:59.070> there<00:00:59.309> and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
nylon bushing that goes in there and

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.110 
nylon bushing that goes in there and
replaces<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:01.170> spindle<00:01:01.620> bearing<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
replaces the spindle bearing this is a

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.530 
replaces the spindle bearing this is a
self<00:01:03.480> lubricating<00:01:03.860> bushing<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:06.030> axle

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
self lubricating bushing as the axle

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.679 
self lubricating bushing as the axle
front<00:01:06.960> axle<00:01:07.320> spins<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.950> there<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:09.150> self

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
front axle spins in there it just self

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.609 
front axle spins in there it just self
lubricates<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.710> totally<00:01:11.280> gets<00:01:11.549> rid<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.619> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
lubricates this totally gets rid of the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.100 
lubricates this totally gets rid of the
spindle<00:01:13.920> bearing<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.150> let's<00:01:15.299> pop<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.570> puppy

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
spindle bearing so let's pop that puppy

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.649 
spindle bearing so let's pop that puppy
in<00:01:17.119> now<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.180> get<00:01:18.659> your<00:01:18.869> bushing<00:01:19.320> go<00:01:20.159> ahead

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
in now you get your bushing go ahead

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.899 
in now you get your bushing go ahead
check<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:22.020> your<00:01:22.350> axle<00:01:23.009> shaft<00:01:23.310> use<00:01:23.670> their

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
check it on your axle shaft use their

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:32.210 
check it on your axle shaft use their
new<00:01:29.600> okay<00:01:30.600> basically<00:01:30.899> I've<00:01:31.409> replaced<00:01:31.890> that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
new okay basically I've replaced that

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.590 
new okay basically I've replaced that
crusty<00:01:32.820> old<00:01:33.140> used<00:01:34.140> spindle<00:01:35.240> with<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> new

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
crusty old used spindle with the new

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.960 
crusty old used spindle with the new
Dana<00:01:37.200> 60<00:01:37.560> spindle<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.460> those<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.880> earth

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
Dana 60 spindle for those of you earth

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.460 
Dana 60 spindle for those of you earth
that<00:01:39.210> are<00:01:39.329> paying<00:01:39.540> attention<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.229> just

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that are paying attention but I just

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.010 
that are paying attention but I just
want<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.829> show<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:43.189> essentially<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
want to show you essentially the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.620 
want to show you essentially the
installation<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.219> the<00:01:47.219> new<00:01:47.399> nylon<00:01:47.909> bushing<00:01:48.479> in

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
installation of the new nylon bushing in

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.529 
installation of the new nylon bushing in
there<00:01:48.899> pretty<00:01:53.509> pretty<00:01:54.619> straightforward

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
there pretty pretty straightforward

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.969 
there pretty pretty straightforward
basically<00:01:57.539> just<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:57.990> putting<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> spindle

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
basically just like putting the spindle

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.230 
basically just like putting the spindle
bearing<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.049> there<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.229> have

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
bearing in and there you have

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.609 
bearing in and there you have
and<00:02:02.930> that's<00:02:03.170> how<00:02:03.409> we<00:02:03.470> want<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:04.990> nice<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.049> firm

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
and that's how we want it nice and firm

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.090 
and that's how we want it nice and firm
because<00:02:07.040> that's<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.430> spins<00:02:07.820> around<00:02:08.000> and

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
because that's the spins around and

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.120 
because that's the spins around and
heats<00:02:10.100> up<00:02:10.399> it's<00:02:10.880> self<00:02:11.240> lubricating<00:02:11.890> this<00:02:12.890> is

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
heats up it's self lubricating this is

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.760 
heats up it's self lubricating this is
not<00:02:13.340> going<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.730> allow<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:14.600> lot<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.470> those<00:02:15.620> little

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
not going to allow a lot of those little

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.380 
not going to allow a lot of those little
particles<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:17.090> get<00:02:17.270> in<00:02:17.450> between<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:18.050> axle<00:02:18.650> and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
particles to get in between the axle and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.380 
particles to get in between the axle and
the<00:02:20.390> bushing<00:02:20.870> where<00:02:21.350> as<00:02:21.709> before<00:02:22.610> with<00:02:23.180> the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
the bushing where as before with the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.240 
the bushing where as before with the
bearing<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:24.080> just<00:02:24.290> seemed<00:02:24.470> like<00:02:24.500> everything

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
bearing it just seemed like everything

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.540 
bearing it just seemed like everything
gets<00:02:25.400> in<00:02:25.670> there<00:02:25.850> that's<00:02:26.650> essentially<00:02:27.650> new

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
gets in there that's essentially new

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.380 
gets in there that's essentially new
products<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:30.130> for<00:02:31.130> all<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.640> hardcore

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
products and for all you hardcore

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.300 
products and for all you hardcore
wheelers<00:02:32.780> it's<00:02:33.410> something<00:02:33.920> you're<00:02:34.069> going<00:02:34.100> to

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
wheelers it's something you're going to

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.470 
wheelers it's something you're going to
want<00:02:34.519> to<00:02:34.610> do<00:02:35.510> your<00:02:35.690> spindle<00:02:36.140> bearings
