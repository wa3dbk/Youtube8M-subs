00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.490
 well there's everybody guys 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.110
 it is zebi I hope you are well 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.790
 for me it's really great 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.830
 released today we find ourselves for 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.199
 my first little slaughter and I'm putting 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.520
 well the focus on the little because 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.050
 you do not expect to see gameplay from 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.760
 phew during the first weeks see 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.230
 the first month because it's a game 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.699
 which is very very difficult to take in 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.949
 hand which explains why I do not 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.269
 still outstanding scores on everything 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.679
 who just came out so most of 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.540
 people who have it are fans of call of 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.489
 and as for a fan of a game in general 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.110
 not too bad so there is a lot of 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.520
 players hard enough and it's very hard to 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.960
 to release gameplay in its gameplay 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.160
 I was lucky he was not very 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.530
 very strong opposite that allowed me to 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.660
 to do my first small massacre 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.309
 so I did it quiet I believe stack 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.480
 all quiet pile so at the same time 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.219
 here I would try to move me I was not going 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.989
 do not over 80 kills so I have so much 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.190
 dreamed better as I just said in 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.170
 solo here I played alone 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.699
 today and on the solar map of which 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.170
 kingdom is my favorite because we can 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.059
 really much around enemies 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.890
 and even if there are quite a few buildings 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.480
 a lot of campers we can really 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.680
 well work around and it's really a 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.820
 very very good gameplay I took 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.200
 a lot of fun on this part 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.490
 I did not score but I nani 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.110
 took a lot of fun and I 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.340
 unlocked twice the goliath so it's okay 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.260
 allow you to see pretty much what 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.850
 looks like the goliath block the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.350
 new behemoths of the game he does 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.540
 really a crazy sound it is great 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.280
 stylish to control so for class 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.360
 for all of them I would not know you 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.100
 to say it because I do not know yet 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.240
 pretty good the game for that by cons 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.189
 to put it back it's pretty simple 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.619
 that's where I had the silent 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.960
 the stick and the stove is there as well as 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.520
 secondary the atlas 45 so I believe the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.710
 little basic pistol and at the level of 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.360
 strict scores I had the drone the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.850
 missile so the predator missile which 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.140
 looks a little like that of mw3 well 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.850
 that it is very very difficult to 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.350
 control and then down the goliath 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.130
 as I just explained it in 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.079
 this video i will make you a 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.790
 Medal without mercy if I'm wrong 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.170
 for now I have not gone further 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.460
 I have not done in pitiful so for 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.399
 tell you how bad I am not a 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.250
 pgm on this game I did about 500 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.360
 kg freaks box 200 on ps3 because I have 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.250
 a little played on both for now 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.020
 I prefer he wants on xbox because I 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.430
 can only film on xbox I see 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.049
 not the interest that I play on ps3 if I 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.579
 can not offer you but gameplay it 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.710
 would disgust me a lot of dna flour 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.360
 bomb on ps3 and that I can not the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.619
 to film in the passage of blockages of the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.760
 so goliath tears when gerard basset 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.230
 she is really not bad 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.879
 pace but there a very bad 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.650
 accuracy of the shot I did a lot of 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.360
 kiel with but it's not an arm that 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.379
 I will use in my classes it is 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.519
 really a paddle I pick up ray 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.530
 from time to time but I will not use 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.090
 often so I think I have to little 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.140
 almost everything says agent sail predator 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.180
 look at how hard it is to 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.870
 actually control even if you move 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.519
 your joystick 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.170
 he is very hard because he is going to lose 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.790
 ahead he loses Paris ahead of the shot 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.290
 You really bring it back and 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.489
 even when you think you're on 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.260
 nubas you're not often on 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.950
 so already he's making markers like 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.659
 you will be able 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.159
 I just made a marker and in addition 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.689
 there are with the number of buildings kia 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.220
 touch you really do not recommend this 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.019
 which is strict there I advise you more 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.609
 the system ac so a kind of bomb 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.200
 ayem but in better better better 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.280
 it really pisses the wingmen I 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.750
 advise you what the mind that there if 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.709
 you want to make alarm kills so 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.450
 there I unlock the goliath 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.980
 I might have increased a 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.269
 just the sound of the bronze game 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.500
 two of the blocks so you can 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.609
 hear the noise that makes when you 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.420
 go inside because it does 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.909
 a crazy sound 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.590
 they unfold there is the minigun that 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.510
 goes out on the side it really looks like 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.190
 transformers it looks like but will spoil it 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.989
 really great style but that is not 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.159
 not at all but really not at all 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.139
 site and it's even a useless 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.239
 it does not do a lot of it is hyper 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.650
 hyper low you can see that I have 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.040
 he will be destroyed in less than one 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.569
 minute 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.340
 I will only make three or four 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.370
 which with so already you can not 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.540
 jump with my it's logical but that's it 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.829
 there are many posts on the maps 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.389
 so you're much handicapped you 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.280
 can not go to many places 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.199
 you must stay on the ground suddenly the 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.400
 dudes in height bavoux the m you have 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.079
 that the mini gun and you can put 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.250
 punches with besides shot 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.019
 of fist that I love a lot on his 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.400
 edward dance I much prefer I 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.989
 prefers far better than that 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.209
 knives simply cola power 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.459
 they are 2 in front of me I almost duck 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.389
 50 bullets on an enemy but he has a vest 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.069
 bulletproof and suddenly I can not even 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.239
 not to kill him so when an enemy to 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.889
 bulletproof vest it's pretty much a 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.269
 killer and with this strict score the de 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.190
 finally I destroy myself by pressing 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.389
 on x maybe pursues enemies 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.709
 but unfortunately he was too far 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.220
 so no style with the car 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.290
 destruction 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.879
 So this is a pretty good score strict 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.199
 even if he is not immediately 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.310
 and we think he left because he 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.319
 makes a crazy sound it's pretty 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.790
 huge compared to basic players but 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.889
 frankly it is convenient too much to abuse 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.120
 it is even pretty bad but hey that's 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.669
 nice to have small scores strict 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.530
 from time to time so I'm going in real 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:15.359
 books before the end of the game 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.549
 so there the gameplay that makes you I 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.510
 just realized it Tuesday morning I had 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.799
 a short break of two hours where 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.180
 I was not running so I got you 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.260
 did his little gameplay I did not 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.270
 wrong of mm e 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.120
 about thirty I did on 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.100
 these 30 mm e 4 super drinking gameplay of 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.810
 that kind of thing with several goliath and 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.400
 more tranquil a more than 40 kilos 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.080
 but I think so if you want 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.700
 seeing them guide you is all about 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.990
 different maps but with the same 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.400
 class so that's kind of the problem 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.690
 by talking about weapons or 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.180
 class if you want to see a gameplay 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.380
 with one to one sniper that is strict 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.120
 special if you want you to watch 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.110
 for example the bread in the hand I believe 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.610
 that's the biggest strict score of 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.230
 game you tell me all this in comment 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.790
 and try to show you all that so 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.650
 you do not expect good edena either 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.670
 as I wanted to say the first days 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.200
 the first few weeks it's going to be pretty 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.270
 complicated going out this kind of gameplay 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.830
 so here I see I was level 33 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.040
 that's why I did not have a class 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.630
 super advanced so my opinion on the game 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.280
 it's a pretty good game where there is when 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.410
 even a lot of lag and 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.850
 connections the connection is good 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.770
 near all a bar on the same game 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.150
 the other if by chance there would be another 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.350
 because frankly when we see the 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.360
 collections I wonder sometimes if he 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.100
 there is another one of the party so much that 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.620
 bug also compared to the consoles 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.340
 old generation wii ps3 and 360 that 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.450
 egg bug 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.670
 so when you die there are lakes 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.720
 crazy and yeah there was curled 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.040
 outright when they last 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.390
 several seconds when you die 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.290
 from what I was told there is no 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.480
 prove the blast on the news 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.710
 consoles so here is more the game 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.330
 which is too powerful I think for the 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.080
 old wii consoles that's going to be 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.420
 a lot of lag 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.530
 there are already some and here are the collections 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.330
 I hope they will be improved 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.970
 because for now it's really 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.980
 not terrible at all and that's all 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.480
 just my opinion on the game I love 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.290
 the double job even if it's not not 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.150
 more too my dada 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.960
 because that's it for me jump is everything 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.640
 time all the time all the time 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.200
 it's a bit abused already because you 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.870
 point out on the radar so it 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.370
 loses some of his discretion if we can 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.900
 say and besides everyone else you 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.640
 see jumping so you are not very 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.410
 discreet so I advise you to 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.240
 not jump too much when you have to 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.040
 really do it to speed up or for 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.780
 go up by do building because 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.250
 Djabou is spotted and in place 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.210
 it's a bit it sucks everyone 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.220
 in fact because if you jump 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.570
 non-stop me I thought in the game 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.010
 we would be once then we should 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.900
 wait 10 to 20 seconds to resauter 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.760
 now we can jump non-stop and 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.260
 shot jump nonstop down we can 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.370
 to do but it's really disabling 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.020
 for the player who has in front of you 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.160
 because it happened to me already 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.170
 falling against guys that was that 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.730
 but what to jump and the guy is 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.350
 very hard to adjust it and even when you 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.580
 just if there is a second one 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.510
 arrive over steep rhodium 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.940
 lorrain ever because it's 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.780
 impossible to adjust them all so 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.420
 that's the part 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.740
 we won but very little here 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.880
 I made the pile but my allies 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.570
 have not done so much 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.639
 on a 29 for 6.99 for 4 I see it 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.300
 not too much when the brightness is enough 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.100
 important 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.900
 if the gameplay you liked you secular and 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.040
 the video if you did not like it for 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.480
 any reason you tell me why 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.960
 in comment and onlike is not everything 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.460
 simply 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.360
 it was from the guys we found ourselves 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.860

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.210
 video do not hesitate to tell me in
