00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.130
 responsibly as ps crowded people 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:12.120
 surroundings for pets here so she will 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.889
 see me here chair I promised him 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.609
 did past issues we will go today 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:22.380
 him doing this need again 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.420
 bead glue spoke in last issue 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.609
 that we need them for almost everyone 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.990
 the release of what color to 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.990
 Immediately close it will not be visible 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.050
 for the sofa we need brushes for 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.760
 shoes such garbage is desirable 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.329
 undercut so that it was not very high 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:50.969
 and for the money we need a cork 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:01:13.500
 round milk first she all 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:17.930
 there is a piece of cloth a toilet 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.930
 paper or 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:29.509
 sticky tip and super glue is all that 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:33.110
 we will need a cap from milk and 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:36.540
 roll of common toilet paper 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.350
 so approximately put off 3 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.360
 centimeters cut off so that neatly 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.460
 if you never rose either 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.460
 against we cut off put off and we cut off 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.689
 I also cut off the sofa 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.110
 about here three centimeters from here 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.110
 a spoon 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:12.090
 I will cut you understand and show the hall wand and 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.480
 I already swim if its since I donâ€™t 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.900
 enough 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.370
 to actively our entire cap 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.110
 I fully introduced here a small 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:30.150
 square 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:31.620
 a rectangle of 5 meters behind what was 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.150
 short distance because when we 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:41.579
 estimate when we pull our sponge 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.190
 cloth fabric is very dense so from i 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.810
 was able to climb 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.709
 you see here I drew a small 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.549
 quarters war 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.790
 u what it will look like this forward 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.750
 flush 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:03:00.200
 the lid itself needs to be sweated smoothly 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:04.220
 go 3 centimeters and a half 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.810
 here the same thing is branches 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.810
 centimeter and then two and a half 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.230
 a small spinochku it can of course 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.989
 make her more wrong 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.450
 uncomfortable wrapped in cloth 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:22.560
 It turns out so now I will cut and 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:28.160
 show to see and it turned out like that 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:31.200
 Now here he is, here's the back and 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:37.459
 must not be very dry for example 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.609
 sweep a little lower middle in general 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.889
 recount 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.400
 we take our caps and how my 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:46.290
 last video take and flip and and 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.639
 the horse is also turned upside down 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.220
 more that could be like this 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:54.900
 glue well, I looked at the crib 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:58.139
 learns so now i have done and you 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.069
 see how to divide the three cases and 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:10.280
 I came here and so I did on 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:19.280
 crib next stage avira back 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:19.280
 we take this fabric here we press 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:49.620
 and paste so here u10 we cut 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.990
 unstick see abortion not on the court 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:57.860
 very firmly backrest dial even if you 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:05:00.569
 immediately fabric and glue right here here 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.259
 here I already glued the boards 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:05.490
 crawled into one and stuck because we 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:11.039
 this is a drawing and it is very strong 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:16.560
 shone now we take do 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:17.719
 fold pulling here as if we fix 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.650
 bye for now 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:26.779
 then again and here we are gluing 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.779
 Deal another fold in to the children 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.180
 glue on like this 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:38.039
 the perimeter of our crisis also by 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.330
 the sofa turns here and so now these 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.930
 I'll paste everything and show you how it will be 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.279
 to look like 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.779
 I got a sore report, understand, take it 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:48.830
 fold and glue it to 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:51.539
 inside our cork 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.580
 glue on one and fix here 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.370

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.750

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.529
 beautiful best one is such a 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.509
 A brief and leisurely here and so here at 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:06.270
 the bar is not very neat so 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:13.529
 glued but it is inside and there is nothing 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:15.810
 it turns out here and now finally 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:19.949
 I did finish this mide and see what 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:22.770
