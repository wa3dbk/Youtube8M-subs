00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 hello again to all the friends and 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.640
 subscribers of the commercial channel 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.140
 he wanted 1886 and nothing distracted ones a 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.540
 boxing in this case it's about 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.340
 motorola moto gp I think it's the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.620
 mobile right now most demanded in the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.139
 market is quite complicated thing 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.660
 to get one, I've had to 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.460
 move pretty and nothing I have finally 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.170
 got one to prove it had 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.600
 really want to have one and see that this one 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.000
 you know, you know, an average range of 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.439
 motorola that will give the welcome google but 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.150
 It has some pretty characteristics 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.660
 interesting is hd processor screen 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.880
 four cores a gig of ram so 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.010
 nothing let's see the unboxing and see what 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.170
 such works in this case I have taken the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.850
 8 GB version that is the unit 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.530
 found and nothing the problem of this 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.469
 phone is that you can not expand it 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.579
 the memory memory as the nexus do not 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.309
 has the possibility of expansion with 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.899
 microsd cards therefore if you can 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.210
 I recommend you buy the version of 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.010
 16 since it varies little the price passes 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.870
 face is even more complicated 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.820
 get and nothing like this mobile what 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.219
 I want for work and that with 8 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.660
 gigas I'm going to have to spare and well let's go 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.010
 to see what the box brings 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.780
 understood that it brings practically nothing 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.850
 it has an end 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.850
 you can see a very simple packaging 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.740
 and we have what the phone is and according to 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.740
 I content you rather little 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.700
 you see here comes the usb cable 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:34.350
 and it's already bring nothing nothing more paper 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.759
 motorola warranty I imagine that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.520
 it will also be from this start guide 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.590
 quick and little else because you will see adjust the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.439
 maximum price that only brings in 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.259
 what is the microusb cable so if 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.990
 you have as many you will have an adapter 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.729
 You will have to use it since it does not come 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.619
 the included usb charger seems like a 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.000
 sovereign stupidity because it is a charger 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.250
 these people are worth it 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.200
 cents and not including it what a 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.329
 little absurd but well you do not bring 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.459
 something more common headphones for example 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.810
 in those he does not bring them either but 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.939
 simply this is all the content 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.310
 that has and well here you have the 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.019
 phone now it seems small to me that 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.629
 clear that in connecting with the motorola 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.069
 with the bq aquarium 5.7 and that will give us 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.250
 everything seems small but good as 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.230
 you can see 4.5 inch screen 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.630
 here on the right side you have the button 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.950
 Lock and lock screen button 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.950
 of volume more and less 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.549
 at the bottom you have the entrance 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.610
 right lateral microusb you do not have anything 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:38.510
 and the section you have 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.260
 headset and jack input and here in 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.670
 the back because you have the speaker 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.560
 the camera that I think was 5 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.390
 megapixels the led flash and nothing here 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.600
 came the logo with a kind of 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.280
 motor slits the truth that a 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.470
 simple view when you take it you have a 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.520
 very very nice touch the back 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.470
 very I do not know I like the touch and the truth 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.390
 that does not look like a range phone so 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.360
 cheap I know how to say it looks like a phone 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.920
 more expensive than it looks good we go 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.920
 I think you could open the lid 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.940
 you can remove the stage as you know 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.130
 you have interchangeable housings 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.630
 colors that sell them apart and here 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.940
 you have what is the phone 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.510
 this is the battery but you can not 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.060
 extract only comes here so that it 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.130
 can see but can not remove what 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.770
 is the battery and here you have the entrance 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.360
 for micro sd cards 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.630
 so we're going to proceed to a first 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.630
 switched on 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.920
 to see how we are going to take off 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.209
 well I remove 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.209
 and let's turn it on 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.830
 the screen like this at first glance looks 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.209
 pretty good a 720p screen the sim 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.100
 that in principle has to be seen with 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.530
 good quality 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.900
 and nothing the front glass is with 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.210
 gorilla glass is to say that the three 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.680
 It is one of the most resistant and good 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.970
 forgot to comment that they arrive also had 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.000
 a front camera that I think is from 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.860
 1.2 million something like that and good now 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.750
 you would have to configure it and test them and 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.220
 that there is not in another video because what 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.110
 you will understand a little review for 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.610
 that you see it and nothing since I have it here 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.050
 next if you want to see a comparison 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.990
 of sizes 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.190
 Nothing here you can see the engine or the 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.040
 motorcycle 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.940
 ge and here the fnac 5.7 so you can see a 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.170
 little differences 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.170
 of size 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.350
 the engine or the motorcycle gp for me is the 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.320
 ideal measure because we after being 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.240
 all these days with him with the efra 5.7 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.490
 it seems to me a little small and good 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.070
 do not worry soon there will be a review 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.110
 Full motor or motorcycle gp 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.410
 user experiences and also 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.270
 surely a versus between the 5.7 sna and 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.980
 the engine of the motorcycle hero so nothing 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.540
 we are attentive and soon they will be 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.169
 uploading the videos a greeting to 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.169
 everyone, see you later
