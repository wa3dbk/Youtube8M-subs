see here is the thing that they have

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.519 
see here is the thing that they have
changed<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.360> color<00:00:15.599> so<00:00:15.900> they<00:00:15.990> have<00:00:16.109> matching

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
changed the color so they have matching

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.550

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
color there at the top so you can see

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.679 
color there at the top so you can see
this<00:00:19.740> color<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.160> blue<00:00:20.640> I'm<00:00:21.240> sure<00:00:21.480> if<00:00:21.570> that

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
this color is blue I'm sure if that

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.269 
this color is blue I'm sure if that
changes<00:00:22.260> depending<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.779> where<00:00:24.779> ever<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.080> are

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
changes depending on where ever you are

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.089 
changes depending on where ever you are
no<00:00:26.720> maybe<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.050> color<00:00:28.410> all<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.590> time<00:00:28.920> I

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
no maybe it's that color all the time I

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.420 
no maybe it's that color all the time I
think<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.570> has<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> new<00:00:30.990> like<00:00:31.199> flaps<00:00:31.590> kind<00:00:32.340> of

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
think so it has a new like flaps kind of

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.530 
think so it has a new like flaps kind of
look<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.420> think<00:00:33.950> so<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.149> here

1,000 times now and go into place here

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.510 
1,000 times now and go into place here
one<00:04:57.900> more<00:04:58.080> time<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.710> see<00:04:58.740> when<00:04:59.280> you<00:04:59.310> are

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
one more time to see when you are

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.330 
one more time to see when you are
following<00:05:00.120> me<00:05:00.240> I<00:05:01.700> just<00:05:02.700> go<00:05:02.940> down<00:05:03.650> you<00:05:04.650> load<00:05:05.160> up

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
following me I just go down you load up

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.030 
following me I just go down you load up
stuff<00:05:05.580> can<00:05:05.820> we<00:05:05.910> go<00:05:06.030> back<00:05:06.180> like<00:05:06.240> this<00:05:06.740> that<00:05:07.740> also

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
stuff can we go back like this that also

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.159 
stuff can we go back like this that also
might<00:05:08.190> be<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.430> new<00:05:08.610> thing<00:05:08.880> that<00:05:09.210> you<00:05:09.870> will<00:05:10.050> be

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
might be a new thing that you will be

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.000 
might be a new thing that you will be
able<00:05:10.260> to<00:05:10.470> go<00:05:10.590> back<00:05:10.770> like<00:05:11.010> that<00:05:11.220> I<00:05:12.800> would<00:05:13.800> like<00:05:13.980> a

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
able to go back like that I would like a

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.680 
able to go back like that I would like a
feature<00:05:14.340> that<00:05:14.490> you<00:05:14.820> don't<00:05:15.030> have<00:05:15.120> to<00:05:15.210> go<00:05:15.450> back

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
feature that you don't have to go back

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.080 
feature that you don't have to go back
like<00:05:16.050> you<00:05:16.380> can<00:05:16.620> change<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.250> next<00:05:17.580> image<00:05:17.790> at

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
like you can change the next image at

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.880 
like you can change the next image at
least<00:05:18.240> I<00:05:18.360> think<00:05:18.570> that<00:05:18.810> there<00:05:19.380> is<00:05:19.470> no<00:05:19.590> feature

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
least I think that there is no feature

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.110 
least I think that there is no feature
like<00:05:20.550> that<00:05:21.800> but<00:05:22.800> this<00:05:22.950> is<00:05:23.130> probably<00:05:23.790> a<00:05:23.970> new

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
like that but this is probably a new

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.990 
like that but this is probably a new
feature<00:05:24.830> but<00:05:25.830> I'm<00:05:26.100> not<00:05:26.280> one<00:05:26.550> hundred<00:05:26.760> percent

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
feature but I'm not one hundred percent

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.680 
feature but I'm not one hundred percent
sure<00:05:27.270> on<00:05:27.630> that<00:05:27.660> this<00:05:28.470> is<00:05:28.860> how<00:05:29.220> when<00:05:30.060> okay<00:05:30.510> of

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
sure on that this is how when okay of

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.840 
sure on that this is how when okay of
course<00:05:31.050> you<00:05:31.169> can<00:05:31.290> also<00:05:31.440> use<00:05:31.560> this<00:05:31.979> so<00:05:32.790> you

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
course you can also use this so you

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.880 
course you can also use this so you
don't<00:05:33.150> have<00:05:33.419> the<00:05:33.570> grid<00:05:33.810> option<00:05:34.229> usually<00:05:34.710> I

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
don't have the grid option usually I

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.760 
don't have the grid option usually I
don't<00:05:35.010> think<00:05:35.370> that<00:05:35.520> much<00:05:35.669> about<00:05:35.729> it<00:05:36.260> but<00:05:37.260> this

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
don't think that much about it but this

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.240 
don't think that much about it but this
could<00:05:38.010> be<00:05:38.160> good<00:05:38.310> if<00:05:38.640> you<00:05:38.910> like<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:40.200> go<00:05:40.350> down<00:05:40.830> and

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
could be good if you like to go down and

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.700 
could be good if you like to go down and
down<00:05:41.490> and<00:05:41.790> down<00:05:41.880> and<00:05:42.419> down<00:05:42.600> and<00:05:43.020> down<00:05:43.110> and<00:05:43.620> down
