00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
like I guess is that I find it hard like

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.310 
like I guess is that I find it hard like
that<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.370> can't<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:38.760> do<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.149> well<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.420> so

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
that I can't really do it as well so so

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.319

get something like that I like it might

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.999 
get something like that I like it might
squeak<00:01:48.030> or<00:01:48.210> something<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.009> it's

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
squeak or something like that so it's

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.289 
squeak or something like that so it's
quite<00:01:50.220> hard<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.399> do<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> sound<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.240> you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
quite hard to do a sound like that you

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.090 
quite hard to do a sound like that you
can<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.110> mess<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.439> up<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:52.710> maybe<00:01:52.950> you

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
can do and like mess it up but maybe you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.109 
can do and like mess it up but maybe you
should<00:01:53.280> get<00:01:53.399> something<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.119> like

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
should get something like this like

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.609 
should get something like this like
something<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.200> all<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.500> need

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
something like that so then all you need

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.770 
something like that so then all you need
to<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:59.790> just<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.299> clean<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.600> up<00:02:00.659> and

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
to do it's just like to clean it up and

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.569 
to do it's just like to clean it up and
stuff<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.290> do<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.710> really<00:02:01.920> quickly<00:02:02.219> so

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
stuff just do it like really quickly so

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.469 
stuff just do it like really quickly so
like<00:02:03.390> instead<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.750> holding<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.290> going

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
like instead of holding it and going

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.719 
like instead of holding it and going
like<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:06.840> do<00:02:07.320> like<00:02:07.590> pop<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.190> just

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
like that you just do like pop and just

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.490 
like that you just do like pop and just
pop<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> sound<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.569> like

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.600 

dislike<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:14.770> you<00:02:14.860> just<00:02:14.980> took<00:02:15.100> really<00:02:15.310> fast

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
dislike so you just took really fast

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.010 
dislike so you just took really fast
instead<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.030> like<00:02:16.150> holding<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.630> because<00:02:16.750> then

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
instead of like holding it because then

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.800 
instead of like holding it because then
you<00:02:17.320> get<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.560> long<00:02:17.740> longer<00:02:18.250> version<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:19.300> the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
you get the long longer version so the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.390 
you get the long longer version so the
second<00:02:20.140> way<00:02:20.230> as<00:02:20.290> well<00:02:20.530> some<00:02:21.070> people<00:02:21.280> might

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
second way as well some people might

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.250 
second way as well some people might
find<00:02:21.460> it's<00:02:21.760> easier<00:02:22.030> but<00:02:22.210> I<00:02:22.330> can't<00:02:22.870> do<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:23.170> as

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
find it's easier but I can't do it as

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.220 
find it's easier but I can't do it as
well<00:02:23.470> so<00:02:23.610> most<00:02:24.610> I'll<00:02:24.790> show<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.000> two<00:02:25.120> ways<00:02:25.230> no

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
well so most I'll show you two ways no

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.410 
well so most I'll show you two ways no
the<00:02:26.380> second<00:02:26.680> way<00:02:26.740> is<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:27.280> normal<00:02:28.030> position<00:02:28.180> in

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
the second way is a normal position in

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.050 
the second way is a normal position in
so<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.600> describe<00:02:29.580> like<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.910> then<00:02:31.000> you

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
so you describe like that and then you

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.260 
so you describe like that and then you
go<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.240> like<00:02:32.400> sort<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.490> like<00:02:33.550> that<00:02:33.760> basically

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
go to like sort of like that basically

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.650 
go to like sort of like that basically
so<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.840> go<00:02:34.960> like<00:02:36.150> something<00:02:37.150> like<00:02:37.240> that<00:02:37.270> and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
so you go like something like that and

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.230 
so you go like something like that and
then<00:02:38.020> you<00:02:38.470> push<00:02:39.010> air<00:02:39.310> on<00:02:39.580> both<00:02:39.790> sides<00:02:40.060> each

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
then you push air on both sides each

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.310 
then you push air on both sides each
cheek<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.720> get<00:02:40.900> something<00:02:41.170> out<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:44.170> that

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
cheek so you get something out like that

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.740 
cheek so you get something out like that
and<00:02:45.010> then<00:02:45.190> basically<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.210> same<00:02:46.390> thing<00:02:46.720> you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
and then basically the same thing you

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.440 
and then basically the same thing you
just<00:02:47.050> like<00:02:47.500> push<00:02:47.770> air<00:02:48.010> out<00:02:48.040> but<00:02:48.490> while<00:02:48.730> you've

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
just like push air out but while you've

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.370 
just like push air out but while you've
got<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:49.780> position<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:50.500> should<00:02:50.680> go<00:02:50.770> out

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
got that position so you should go out

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.850 
got that position so you should go out
something<00:02:53.380> like<00:02:53.470> that

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
something like that

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.100 
something like that
and<00:02:54.430> then<00:02:54.700> once<00:02:55.240> you've<00:02:55.450> got<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.810> just

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
and then once you've got that you just

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.040 
and then once you've got that you just
want<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.290> like<00:02:56.470> Sean<00:02:56.770> out<00:02:56.980> again<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:57.520> you<00:02:57.640> go<00:03:01.050> so

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
want to like Sean out again so you go so

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.660 
want to like Sean out again so you go so
that<00:03:02.080> should<00:03:02.650> produce<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:03.100> same<00:03:03.250> sound<00:03:03.520> but<00:03:03.580> I

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
that should produce the same sound but I

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.800 
that should produce the same sound but I
don't<00:03:03.910> really<00:03:04.000> practice<00:03:04.240> it<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.630> way<00:03:04.750> so

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
don't really practice it that way so

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.050 
don't really practice it that way so
obviously<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.500> doesn't<00:03:05.710> sound<00:03:05.890> as<00:03:06.100> good<00:03:06.250> but

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
obviously it doesn't sound as good but

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.370 
obviously it doesn't sound as good but
if<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.240> practice<00:03:07.600> you<00:03:07.750> do<00:03:07.870> practice<00:03:08.020> it<00:03:08.260> that

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
if you practice you do practice it that

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.110 
if you practice you do practice it that
way<00:03:08.500> then<00:03:08.710> you<00:03:08.800> do<00:03:08.920> get<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.250> same<00:03:09.430> sound<00:03:09.790> so

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
way then you do get the same sound so

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.380 
way then you do get the same sound so
yeah<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.490> that's<00:03:12.490> basically<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.940> really<00:03:13.150> is

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
yeah and that's basically it really is

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.180 
yeah and that's basically it really is
it's<00:03:13.780> pretty<00:03:14.020> once<00:03:14.620> you've<00:03:14.740> got<00:03:14.890> like<00:03:15.040> that

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
it's pretty once you've got like that

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.820 
it's pretty once you've got like that
squeaky<00:03:15.580> sound<00:03:15.610> are<00:03:16.000> like<00:03:16.180> somewhat<00:03:16.810> close<00:03:17.680> to

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
squeaky sound are like somewhat close to

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.020 
squeaky sound are like somewhat close to
resembling<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.280> song<00:03:18.550> then<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:18.880> just

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
resembling that song then you just

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.400 
resembling that song then you just
practice<00:03:19.330> it<00:03:19.390> and<00:03:19.570> make<00:03:19.720> it<00:03:19.840> char<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.290> then

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
practice it and make it char and then

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.800 
practice it and make it char and then
you've<00:03:20.590> basically<00:03:20.770> got<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:21.910> yeah<00:03:22.270> hope

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
you've basically got it so yeah hope

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.970 
you've basically got it so yeah hope
