I<00:02:06.360> imagine<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.260> place<00:02:07.440> is<00:02:07.590> insanely<00:02:08.070> busy

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
I imagine that place is insanely busy

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.730 
I imagine that place is insanely busy
during<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> summer<00:02:09.780> months<00:02:09.840> but<00:02:10.320> right<00:02:10.380> now

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
during the summer months but right now

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.970 
during the summer months but right now
in<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.490> fall<00:02:11.730> we<00:02:12.480> were<00:02:12.750> pretty<00:02:13.350> calm<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.800> there

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
in the fall we were pretty calm in there

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.010 
in the fall we were pretty calm in there
actually<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.580> was<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> great<00:02:15.000> time<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.600> think

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
actually and it was a great time I think

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.270 
actually and it was a great time I think
it<00:02:16.080> would<00:02:16.170> be<00:02:16.260> perfect<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.950> middle<00:02:17.220> of

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
it would be perfect in the middle of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.340 
it would be perfect in the middle of
winter<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.850> want<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.300> cool<00:02:18.510> rainy<00:02:18.930> day<00:02:19.170> like

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
winter you want a cool rainy day like

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:29.770 
winter you want a cool rainy day like
today<00:02:19.500> perfect<00:02:20.220> time<00:02:20.370> let's<00:02:20.940> get<00:02:21.060> out<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.209> here

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.790 

so<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.870> weather<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.200> actually<00:02:31.350> getting<00:02:31.650> a

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
so the weather is actually getting a

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.949
