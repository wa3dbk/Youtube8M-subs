00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.480
 but 

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:15.689
 in this first episode of this information space managed by the congress there 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.490
 we will deal with the various types of home boilers 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.470
 ellen of the rules for the correct installation rates photos which are the 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.349
 types of boilers goes family let's say so 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.419
 % age well specify that we are talking about diet hair boilers for 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.130
 heating of individual apartments and therefore no power hotels 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.470
 tele water and therefore the domestic plant basically that 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.410
 there are basically two types of boilers 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.520
 tel which are called oppaa camera ahahah open little to combustion chamber 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.479
 watertight 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:55.079
 depending on the type of boiler the room offers the possibility of installation 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.190
 of the appliances 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.150
 those with an open chamber have constraints with regard to installation 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.830
 in the bedrooms and in the bathrooms and for the others in the watertight room these kind of 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.830
 however, there are no general lines, all aga appliances know that 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.040
 both boilers that are hot water that are other types of appliance not 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.250
 however, premises with a fire hazard can be installed such as 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.830
 are considered via radius car garage and even in common areas for example 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.370
 common areas a stairwell a condominium attic 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.590
 is an installation not allowed 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.920
 this thing we have here in front of what kind it is 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.619
 mt-3 this room-sealed boiler and we say hahaha what goes d 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.590
 if you succeed on the other hand the fact that the combustion area hair differs 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.479
 it is taken directly from the outside so it is not taken from 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.550
 this place 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.810
 but through the duct that goes outside the combustion fumes 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.010
 obviously those go from the outside to the open chamber boiler instead if 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.090
 if it were open the combustion chamber would be removed 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.110
 directly from this place would be the same air that we breathe 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.830
 i'm better as there could be problems related to the discharge of 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.519
 fumes 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.049
 inter eventual anomalies problems therefore there could be problems 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.150
 potential dangers related above all to possible mushroom poisoning 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.420
 most famous problems due to carbon monoxide which is then the source 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:29.169
 main nice teeth and sometimes unfortunately they turn out to be photos 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:30.779
 then with network type 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:35.480
 combustion like this antipodes of heat like this one surely more 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:41.199
 sure if in this it is safe from this by this type of 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.729
 all internal problems can be installed as we have said not 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.030
 is that the moon forbidden the other allowed 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.280
 there are limits, surely this has the advantages of 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.630
 security superior to the other 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.880
 let us hear what they are 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.289
 the rules for a correct installation 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.879
 then the hot one to be installed in a calibratable room 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.700
 this means that I have to have a window and then a window 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.930
 door that gives towards 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.290
 external to ventilate the room or a permanent ventilation opening 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.480
 the famous hole on the wall that is often seen in other homes 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.429
 important the appliance must be provided if 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:21.659
 of the valve for closing the gas placed immediately below the 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.409
 wall itself 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:25.459
 today we have seen then are 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.140
 the rules for the correct installation of a family gas system as in 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.500
 this case but who is the plumber who does his own hotel work 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.269
 trusted installer or another installer is not 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.009
 portability. 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.189
 but
