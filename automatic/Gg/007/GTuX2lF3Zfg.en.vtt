steel<00:01:13.229> -<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.220> 500<00:01:15.090> grit<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:15.570> 2,000

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
steel - I have a 500 grit then 2,000

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.340 
steel - I have a 500 grit then 2,000
grit<00:01:17.030> edge<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.299> here<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.750> basically<00:01:18.869> just

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
grit edge on here it basically just

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.560 
grit edge on here it basically just
touched<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.890> 2000<00:01:20.460> shortly<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:21.360> very

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
touched up on 2000 shortly it's very

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.660 
touched up on 2000 shortly it's very
very<00:01:22.049> sharp<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.439> steel<00:01:22.860> will<00:01:23.100> get<00:01:23.250> sharper

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
very sharp this steel will get sharper

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.570 
very sharp this steel will get sharper
than<00:01:24.229> almost<00:01:25.229> anything<00:01:25.530> else<00:01:25.770> you've<00:01:25.920> used<00:01:26.159> so

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
than almost anything else you've used so

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.789 
than almost anything else you've used so
uh<00:01:27.500> there<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.560> go<00:01:29.960> see<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.020> got<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> very<00:01:31.500> thin

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
uh there we go see I got a very thin

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.859 
uh there we go see I got a very thin
grind<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.280> these<00:01:32.400> edge<00:01:32.610> full<00:01:32.970> convex<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
grind on these edge full convex the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.450 
grind on these edge full convex the
whole<00:01:34.020> way<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:36.590> go<00:01:37.590> through<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> five-step

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
whole way and go through a five-step

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.830 
whole way and go through a five-step
normalization<00:01:39.240> process<00:01:40.880> with<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.060> steel<00:01:42.479> it

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
normalization process with this steel it

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.080 
normalization process with this steel it
gets<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.470> very<00:01:43.770> very<00:01:44.100> fine<00:01:44.399> grain<00:01:44.729> state

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
gets it in a very very fine grain state

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.929 
gets it in a very very fine grain state
before<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.479> heat<00:01:45.750> treat<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.610> really

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
before I heat treat it and it really

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.270 
before I heat treat it and it really
just<00:01:48.240> takes<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.600> screaming<00:01:49.049> sharp<00:01:49.530> edge<00:01:49.829> inside

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
just takes a screaming sharp edge inside

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.780 
just takes a screaming sharp edge inside
of<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> few<00:01:50.729> strokes<00:01:51.710> if<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.979> like<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.369> spend<00:01:53.670> a

of a few strokes if you like to spend a
lot<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.000> time<00:01:54.240> sharpening<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.079> won't<00:01:55.259> like

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
lot of time sharpening you won't like
