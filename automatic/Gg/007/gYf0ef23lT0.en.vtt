for five minutes at least because if you
do<00:01:53.640> since<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.630> filament<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.110> still<00:01:55.350> hot<00:01:55.500> it

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
do since the filament is still hot it

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.620 
do since the filament is still hot it
might<00:01:55.860> break<00:01:56.070> off<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.030> bulbs<00:01:57.329> for<00:01:57.509> these

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.080 
might break off and the bulbs for these
things<00:01:57.869> counts<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:58.290> $30<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.820> bulb

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
things counts like $30 for just a bulb

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.700 
things counts like $30 for just a bulb
which<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:00.810> almost<00:02:01.140> half<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.439> price<00:02:01.680> of

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
on it okay the big controversy is the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.130 
on it okay the big controversy is the
LED<00:02:38.420> version<00:02:38.600> versus<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.740> original<00:02:41.140> picots

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
LED version versus the original picots

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.640

halogen<00:02:42.500> just<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.770> original<00:02:43.340> bulb<00:02:43.730> on<00:02:44.650> my

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
halogen just a original bulb on my

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.370 
halogen just a original bulb on my
opinion<00:02:46.209> LED<00:02:47.209> is<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.540> little<00:02:47.900> more<00:02:48.050> expensive

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
opinion LED is a little more expensive

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.080 
opinion LED is a little more expensive
and<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.800> lasts<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.070> little<00:02:49.130> bit<00:02:49.250> longer<00:02:49.340> but<00:02:49.820> I

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
and it lasts a little bit longer but I

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.090 
and it lasts a little bit longer but I
think<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:51.170> don't<00:02:51.620> really<00:02:51.770> know<00:02:51.920> if<00:02:51.950> the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
think this I don't really know if the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.400 
think this I don't really know if the
niversity<00:02:52.340> an<00:02:52.459> actual<00:02:52.730> vertigo<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.410> like

I've seen action in real life so I don't

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.670 
I've seen action in real life so I don't
