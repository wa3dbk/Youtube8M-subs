00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.220
 started playing better on a computer or on 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.470
 consoles these disputes do not subside and end 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.109
 they can't see me as a user 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.539
 By the way, of course, long ago itâ€™s clear that 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.119
 better, well, I can't figure out how to 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.690
 to play shooters on gamepads so decided 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.460
 check 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.320
 and share yours with you 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.480
 hello everyone this is 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.830
 online photo store today we 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.410
 get acquainted with razer 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.410
 he is for and razer he is methodically on the internet 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.420
 reserve he for and raiser he for tornamenta 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.879
 deshin almost identical except one 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.979
 here in these analog sticks yet 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.329
 called mushrooms can be regulated 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:53.699
 stiffness routing back and forth and 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.829
 set up all those who are not lazy compared 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.199
 this gamepad with standard on kraz 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.059
 I do not do this by the controller 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.629
 I will tell only the results of these 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.409
 comparisons and what it gives the first 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.870
 improved ergonomics 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.030
 gamepad is much more comfortable sitting in your hand 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.650
 plus rubberized coating 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.230
 because of what the controller will not 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.060
 slip out of your hands for indesign here 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.580
 much cooler second 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.470
 razer he for wired and therefore time 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.290
 response faster than default 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.480
 controller besides razer is easier because 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.000
 that there is no battery pack and cable 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.640
 contrary to all expectations easy and does not pull 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.980
 gamepad down by the way due to the cable 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.320
 gamepad compatible Spokane two 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.360
 additional programmable bumper 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.000
 on the one hand it's great anymore 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.040
 buttons more features only here 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.060
 When I press, I constantly cling 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.610
 the remaining two 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.090
 maybe because I'm a noob this is a matter of habit 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.550
 bypassed no buttons are made with technology 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.300
 fast-pressing highbist fans they 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.570
 already respond by half pressing this 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.970
 absolute plus 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.920
 the run and start buttons are located to me 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.259
 they say it is cool because 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.509
 conveniently pressing with fingers others shout 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.880
 that fall of duty and battlefield play 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.000
 uncomfortable to each his own for me for example 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.150
 like where is subdivided into 4 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.069
 independent buttons here too who as with 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.790
 on the one hand, this excludes random 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.980
 pressing 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.890
 on the other hand fighting games are not very 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.750
 convenient to play there are many combinations 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.880
 suggest clicking on if on the internet 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.099
 there are such rumors that triggers with 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.440
 frequent pressing for example when shooting from 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:33.750
 gun in games just doesn't work 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.750
 I won't say for everyone, but I'm fine 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.830
 comparison with the original maycroft 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.500
 gamepad is nice and judging by 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.540
 all razer wins significantly but 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.100
 I personally doubt that even if I 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.990
 clearly demonstrate all 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.880
 advantages of the raiser owner 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.850
 original controller it will run 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.640
 buy razer he for the whole thing in the habit 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.710
 me as a player on pk in general at first 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.870
 it was inconvenient to play not that shooters 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.880
 but in general in anything but with time I 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.490
 used to being silly to say what to play 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.650
 not at all really very real but 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.870
 I will tell you a secret that for me to play 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.180
 personal shooters nothing better old 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.140
 good ligaments clavu mice but again 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.850
 this is a matter of habit and so we will summarize 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.280
 in comparison with the standard 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.740
 Microsoft's gamepad razer he's for 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.690
 wins in many cases and from the point 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.430
 view of ergonomics and in terms of 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.950
 opportunities but in terms of 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.260
 hardened player violently denying 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.150
 all that remind of consoles say no 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.850
 so underestimate the consoles 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.320
 gamepads especially razer he for 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.540
 that's all with you was an online store
