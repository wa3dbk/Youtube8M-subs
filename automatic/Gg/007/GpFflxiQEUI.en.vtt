00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.789
 Stream beer decided it would be better 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.099
 win back season here main reasons 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.490
 such a solution can be called seem me 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.969
 I think it's early and there is such a team with 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:40.410
 very decent team 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:44.910
 there to climb to without shields to very hard 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.640
 will be like hunting all season 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.780
 wrestle me tugging 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.829
 and a complete restructuring passed and well 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.559
 more teams were not as usual but 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.440
 all the time traveling with the team is wrong 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.610
 often without a reason the water guitar is hard 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.960

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.960

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:18.690
 strength remains of course there is london through 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:24.440
 Season of course wanted to frame like that 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:29.580
 you can declare yourself last season season 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:34.470
 such a field is a minicar silver medal 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.229
 fade theme played me very much like 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.119
 I think yes, and here, as if the team 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.390
 hit you bad at the end of the season well 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.810
 were playing 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.940
 I hope also with how the end of the session get along 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.270
 in our team completed the task question 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.270
 about the goals for the season the future thought 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:02.840
 the main thing that the team won and there everything 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:07.619
 it will be easier to shape and 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.000
 statistics I think you need to be and because 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.010
 what can 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.430
 you can form and but I hope the task 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.170
 feasible there further the last question is 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.120

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.270
