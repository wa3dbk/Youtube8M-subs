00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:23.300
 hello everybody has been responding to more 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.000
 questions left on our portal site 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.310
 bersch dot com link here below in 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.400
 description of the video if you want 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.130
 leave some suggestion ok just enter the 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.520
 link and leave suggestion of the video theme 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.680
 that if it was a cool topic I'll make one 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.430
 video especially still thanking 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:48.380
 you and me today alisson scallop 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.660
 asked if it's worth doing a use 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.590
 to have a modified cure that they have there 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.840
 custom curves on video card 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.070
 well alisson and all interested in the 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.300
 subject matter 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:06.500
 not so much worth it because the 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.080
 video is one of the most eh eh parts 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.189
 It's changing on the computer 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:17.230
 because every year there was a new dispute 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:22.400
 between amd nvidia is so fierce that 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:24.770
 this is a significant shift 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.980
 and another does not mean that you 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.290
 It has to be changed every year but it is a 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.440
 which has to be replaced with a 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.930
 higher frequency if your computer 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.740
 well balanced in the other pieces 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.200
 his 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.229
 so you have to do this to have cooler 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.979
 mode on the video card the cost is well 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:50.540
 where only the control board block 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:54.680
 video costs on average 500 600 700 thousand 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.049
 only the block the price of this block and 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.770
 plus the board you would buy a board 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.229
 better in several cases out of 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.380
 risk that has not been 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.869
 you can leak it right there 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.830
 wetting equipment and burning your 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.220
 computer 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.580
 so there is a risk you will do 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.709
 system is good and efficient aid in 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:26.209
 refrigeration yes yes yes but the cost 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.319
 high cost-effectiveness ratio is not 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.959
 viable 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.469
 It's where I've seen people blocking 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.200
 video that is where in my 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:39.469
 opinion is completely irrelevant will 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:44.030
 locating facim high performance boards and 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:51.109
 make use of sln crossfire nÃ© pro something 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:54.290
 more enthusiastic than it really is right 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:56.810
 It's good that you can increase overclocking. 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.620
 have a higher performance but remember 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.200
 game is not just fps 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.250
 not only has a fps to sometimes you have 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.889
 a board that gives a high fps but there are 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.769
 graphical resources that were 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:15.230
 added in the newer models that 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.659
 your card will not be supported then you 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.239
 end up having to change the board because the 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:23.299
 yours is not compatible with those 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.599
 features like own direct x 12 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.599
 It's coming up on windows 10 and bringing 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.729
 graphic novels there only exists 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.280
 compatible cards sometimes you have a 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:35.870
 and excellent plate is locked right 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.579
 you have a peculiar one with a 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.699
 performance but you will not have 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.379
 certain graphical resources because the 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.689
 Your card is not compatible. 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:47.120
 Then you 'll change my hair, I'll have to 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.909
 change the board buy another block 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.030
 Ride it all over again. 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:56.870
 all that cooling then one in the 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.870
 practice is not so useful so do 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.620
 molds on video card only cooling 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.569
 liquid 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.709
 on the video card because of the 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.400
 How often do we change license plates? 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.889
 video 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.500
 Okay, I hope the video was useful.
