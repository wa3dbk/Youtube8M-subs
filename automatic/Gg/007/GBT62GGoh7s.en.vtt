it's a trend or a fat like I don't I
don't<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> issue<00:01:15.780> especially<00:01:16.290> since

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
don't see the issue especially since

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.340 
don't see the issue especially since
most<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.250> what<00:01:17.490> everybody<00:01:18.240> does<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.689> life<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
most of what everybody does in life is a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.740 
most of what everybody does in life is a
fad<00:01:19.950> or<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.280> trend<00:01:20.729> or<00:01:20.939> something<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.600> you've

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
fad or a trend or something that you've

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.990 
fad or a trend or something that you've
seen<00:01:21.960> from<00:01:22.140> someone<00:01:22.560> else<00:01:22.740> nothing<00:01:23.640> new<00:01:23.759> Under

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
seen from someone else nothing new Under

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.300 
seen from someone else nothing new Under
the<00:01:24.030> Sun<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.720> especially<00:01:25.590> considering<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the Sun and especially considering the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.240 
the Sun and especially considering the
fact<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.640> um<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.619> natural<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
fact that um I think going natural is a

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.700 
fact that um I think going natural is a
positive<00:01:29.490> thing<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.320> want<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
positive thing so if you do want to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.039 
positive thing so if you do want to
follow<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.070> positive<00:01:32.759> trend<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.600> don't<00:01:33.840> see

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
follow a positive trend I don't see

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.200 
follow a positive trend I don't see
where<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> issue<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:35.070> guess<00:01:35.880> that's<00:01:36.090> a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
where the issue is I guess that's a

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.999 
where the issue is I guess that's a
little<00:01:36.450> bit<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> Nazism<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.710> creeps

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
little bit of the Nazism that creeps

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.499 
little bit of the Nazism that creeps
into<00:01:38.189> some<00:01:38.460> people<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.000> don't<00:01:39.180> even<00:01:39.270> know

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
into some people and I don't even know

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.840 
into some people and I don't even know
if<00:01:39.540> they<00:01:40.200> realize<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.070> that's<00:01:41.430> what<00:01:41.700> they're

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
if they realize that that's what they're

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.090 
if they realize that that's what they're
doing<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.450> they're<00:01:42.509> trying<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.170> force

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
doing that they're trying to force

journey and let me just explain that for

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.260 
journey and let me just explain that for
a<00:03:06.490> second<00:03:06.850> if<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:07.600> go<00:03:07.780> natural<00:03:08.790> because<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:10.060> a

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
a second if you go natural because of a

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.680 
a second if you go natural because of a
fad<00:03:10.620> then<00:03:11.620> you're<00:03:11.920> more<00:03:12.190> likely<00:03:12.460> to<00:03:13.060> return<00:03:13.450> to

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
fad then you're more likely to return to

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.960 
fad then you're more likely to return to
relaxed<00:03:14.140> hair<00:03:14.440> because<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.340> will<00:03:15.490> want<00:03:15.790> to

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
relaxed hair because you will want to

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.660 
relaxed hair because you will want to
change<00:03:16.300> if<00:03:16.600> you<00:03:16.930> go<00:03:17.320> natural<00:03:17.920> because<00:03:18.190> you

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
change if you go natural because you

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.540 
change if you go natural because you
feel<00:03:18.970> like<00:03:19.240> you're<00:03:19.990> betraying<00:03:20.350> yourself<00:03:21.010> if

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
feel like you're betraying yourself if

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.030 
feel like you're betraying yourself if
you're<00:03:21.730> not<00:03:21.940> then<00:03:22.480> you'll<00:03:22.690> probably<00:03:23.020> not<00:03:23.500> go

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
you're not then you'll probably not go

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.760 
you're not then you'll probably not go
