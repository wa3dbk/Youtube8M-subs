00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.840
 the 13 inch variant of macbook air the 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.799
 hardest has a maximum thickness of 17 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:17.960
 centimeters while it is here from above 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:20.570
 is going 32 5 inches wide and 22.7 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.560
 centimeters deep and all at one 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.970
 weight of 135 kilograms 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.859
 so that you get the size of macbook air 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.380
 in the 13 inch version even better 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.000
 I have an acer here 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:37.990
 aspire one with 10 1 inch from the 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.940
 dug and looks here 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.310
 huge difference in height from the side 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.930
 pretty good 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.860
 the screen the macbook is here with 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:53.000
 13 inches is much larger than the 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:56.000
 acer aspire one with 10 1 and the point 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.380
 with the buttons gaps on the me 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.880
 will go into detail later 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.680
 this animal is bigger than the macbook 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.699
 despite the low altitude over 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.729
 some connections 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.189
 you have the sd on the very left 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.450
 card slot next to a usb 3 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.909
 connection and another 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.060
 Thunderbolt connection is used 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.990
 to connect displays 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.819
 one knows this connection now 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.219
 maybe not necessarily there is 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.049
 matching adapters convert this one here 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:29.420
 For example, from thunderbolt I can 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:32.240
 he always converts too 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.670
 vga something you should then on each 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.020
 set case 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.270
 on the left side of the macbook air has 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.749
 one more connections for a 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.359
 magsafe two mains cool at the 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:47.060
 is that when I load the card here 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:48.469
 Insert the time that one sees that the 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.299
 Magnetic field I do not use a single cable 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.450
 simply drag so up and out and 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.310
 nothing happens next to it 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.229
 USB port the second of total 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.090
 2 1 am mikro he next to an audio output 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.829
 the one with the normal apple headphones 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.570
 insofar as it is compatible that one too 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.500
 the volume can regulate 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.420
 or next to two microphones that 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.280
 macbook air also features wireless 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.690
 There are no connections here 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.160
 especially exciting to film 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.280
 that 's why i just show you on the 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.410
 apple-website times here just wlan quite 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.820
 normally has no lan connection and 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.650
 still bluetooth 4.0 what you see here 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.810
 can is the keyboard of macbook air 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.070
 in the dark 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.140
 the cool thing about it, of course 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.560
 adjustable key light up here 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.290
 the buttons are so on now 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.070
 the maximum brightness and can it 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.300
 then downshift continuously 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.880
 I personally think keyboard very much 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.580
 pleasant one has the normal width 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.770
 between the keys so not like the 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.720
 make up like netbooks that one here 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.390
 another one gropes larger and first 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.980
 awkward to get used to this 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.880
 complete standard accordingly one man 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.540
 can be good ten finger system here 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.470
 on writing contribution can be 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.209
 In addition, very well recognize that here 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.700
 only very small gaps next to the buttons 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.470
 are therefore hardly any dirt get inside 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.840
 can 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.790
 at normal with most notebooks 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.670
 I know there are major gaps here 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.220
 which then really crumbles it possible 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.480
 make it under the keys to come and there 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.560
 any sabotage actions 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.840
 perform 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.540
 there's no macbook here 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.250
 If you have otherwise the normal 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.560
 buttons up there are these diverse 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.400
 Function keys for music for example 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.070
 as you can see here 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.269
 volume and turn off that the 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.709
 Lawyer button directly into the keyboard 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.680
 I like that 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.930
 personally very good next 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.730
 I to trackpad the trackpad is 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.350
 completely multitouchfÃ¤hig I can here 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.920
 different gestures with several fingers 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.280
 do 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.350
 zoom everything possible I think 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.850
 quite cool that even this pressure button 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.920
 you usually are down here 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.780
 would expect that everywhere 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.970
 I is available can therefore so if am 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.530
 I'm using my music on the mac 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.040
 move and then just here 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.230
 to press 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.090
 we totally wolf the button it 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.790
 I find it so pleasant everywhere 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.549
 otherwise multitouch very class with the 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.430
 many available gestures the one 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.289
 in the settings can look 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.759
 I find that extremely pleasant 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.530
 close the macbook air 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.120
 one has one here continuously 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.370
 consistent resistance and can do that 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.990
 macbook so synonymous you can do it 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.350
 With a hand on you have to make it down 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.100
 the main body is not the macbook 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.120
 hold down 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.949
 I find that very convenient as it is 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.690
 then about and as I said just this 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:45.320
 on equal resistance a word 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.600
 still to the battery of the manufacturer applies 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.870
 the on the website with up to 12 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.039
 hours of surfing in the wifi 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.080
 one knows that so often that the 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.389
 manufacturer write twelve hours on it 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.310
 In fact , then a quarter of it stops 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.160
 or so in the case I have then 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.729
 not another experience twelve hours the 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.440
 fit very well maybe a bit 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.520
 less like eight hours or so wirelessly 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.500
 depends then just from the 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.870
 screen brightness from 30 days standby 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.820
 here is still inaccurate capacity with 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.840
 54 watts hours so a very good battery 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.250
 disadvantage, of course, that the battery 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.710
 can not exchange yourself 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:26.120
 the bottom is completely there you can 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.250
 itself not so easy 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.740
 There's no such a battery the man 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.210
 can expand or something 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.470
 the startup speed of the macbook air 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:41.180
 thanks to the ssd is very fast like me 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:43.400
 press attention now we get up 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.099
 the beautiful welcome stone the in 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.240
 mondovi can not turn off 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.409
 good that is not pure hardware now 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.349
 test more that is of course 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.419
 software specific but now i can 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:58.520
 Sign up for me so extremely 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:59.780
 performant so still a sentence to the camera 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.090
 you can see them up here in the middle 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.800
 nicely centered right next to it 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.810
 small led indicating whether the camera 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.520
 I'm active, I'll just show you 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.960
 for example a picture in the dark or by 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.699
 example picture that under better 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.050
 light conditions was recorded 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:15.039
 So that you get a picture of the quality 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.039
 can do
