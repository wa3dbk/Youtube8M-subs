00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
or whatever people like to call it is

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.359 
or whatever people like to call it is
felt<00:01:47.130> too<00:01:47.899> now<00:01:48.899> it's<00:01:49.079> tail<00:01:49.350> some<00:01:49.979> people<00:01:50.250> wish

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369

they<00:01:50.549> were<00:01:50.610> loose<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:51.659> again<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.170> think

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
they were loose but then again I think

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.350 
they were loose but then again I think
this<00:01:53.040> keeps<00:01:53.310> his<00:01:53.430> tail<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.759> place<00:01:53.970> that's<00:01:54.180> not

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
this keeps his tail in place that's not

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.020 
this keeps his tail in place that's not
flip-flopping<00:01:54.659> everywhere<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:56.820> looks

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
flip-flopping everywhere but it looks

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.300 
flip-flopping everywhere but it looks
almost<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.420> candy<00:01:57.750> cane

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310
