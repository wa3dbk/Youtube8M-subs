the way that it handles through these

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.060 
the way that it handles through these
corners<00:04:33.910> just<00:04:34.449> wants<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.410> go<00:04:35.500> faster<00:04:35.949> and

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
corners just wants to go faster and

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.090 
corners just wants to go faster and
faster<00:04:36.870> although<00:04:37.870> I<00:04:38.289> do<00:04:38.470> have<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:38.889> remember

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
faster although I do have to remember

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.210

that<00:04:39.930> I'm<00:04:40.930> on<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.229> street<00:04:41.500> tires<00:04:41.740> right<00:04:42.070> now

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
that I'm on the street tires right now

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.969 
that I'm on the street tires right now
then<00:04:42.580> when<00:04:42.759> I'm<00:04:42.850> on<00:04:42.970> track<00:04:43.560> we've<00:04:44.560> got<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.830> art

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
then when I'm on track we've got the art

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.010 
then when I'm on track we've got the art
competitions<00:04:45.580> on<00:04:45.759> it<00:04:46.440> big<00:04:47.440> big<00:04:47.949> extra<00:04:49.020> grip

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
competitions on it big big extra grip

00:04:50.020 --> 00:05:01.510 
competitions on it big big extra grip
factor<00:04:50.530> there

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.990 

so<00:05:02.180> planted<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.169> honestly<00:05:04.069> if<00:05:04.220> it<00:05:04.460> was<00:05:04.699> much

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
so planted and honestly if it was much

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.400 
so planted and honestly if it was much
more<00:05:05.150> horsepower

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.320 

but<00:05:10.410> it<00:05:11.160> would<00:05:11.310> be<00:05:11.430> much<00:05:11.610> more<00:05:11.820> likely<00:05:12.060> that

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
but it would be much more likely that

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.750 
but it would be much more likely that
you<00:05:12.870> lose<00:05:13.170> it<00:05:13.440> mid<00:05:13.710> corner<00:05:14.010> or<00:05:14.310> something<00:05:14.490> like

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
you lose it mid corner or something like

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.910 
you lose it mid corner or something like
that<00:05:14.820> very<00:05:15.570> progressive<00:05:15.960> where<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.740> power

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
that very progressive where the power

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:36.110 
that very progressive where the power
comes<00:05:17.280> through<00:05:17.550> it's<00:05:18.180> really<00:05:18.660> really<00:05:18.960> nice

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.120 

everything's<00:05:36.960> shaking<00:05:37.260> and<00:05:37.590> rattling<00:05:37.800> around

I<00:06:29.150> read<00:06:29.720> a<00:06:29.750> post<00:06:29.990> on<00:06:30.200> Jalopnik<00:06:30.650> yesterday

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
I read a post on Jalopnik yesterday

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.020 
I read a post on Jalopnik yesterday
talking<00:06:32.630> about

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:42.500 

an<00:06:36.420> old<00:06:36.810> 911<00:06:37.250> the<00:06:38.250> best<00:06:38.520> parlor<00:06:38.820> non<00:06:39.590> and<00:06:41.510> my

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 
an old 911 the best parlor non and my

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.610 
an old 911 the best parlor non and my
first<00:06:42.810> thought<00:06:43.080> was<00:06:43.530> that<00:06:43.670> if<00:06:44.750> every<00:06:45.750> new

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
first thought was that if every new

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.410 
first thought was that if every new
driver<00:06:46.980> was<00:06:47.880> forced<00:06:48.300> to<00:06:48.390> not<00:06:48.690> just<00:06:49.020> drive<00:06:49.710> but

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.420 
driver was forced to not just drive but

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.330 
driver was forced to not just drive but
totally<00:06:51.420> pushed<00:06:51.750> to<00:06:51.930> the<00:06:52.050> limit

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
totally pushed to the limit

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.140 
totally pushed to the limit
