reason I don't know why so first I
convert<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.579> which<00:01:41.790> takes<00:01:42.060> about<00:01:42.210> 45<00:01:43.110> minutes

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
convert it which takes about 45 minutes

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.190 
convert it which takes about 45 minutes
to<00:01:44.130> an<00:01:44.579> hour<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> half<00:01:45.479> if<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> video<00:01:46.020> is

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
to an hour and a half if the video is

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.050 
to an hour and a half if the video is
really<00:01:46.470> long<00:01:46.710> which<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.700> pain<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
really long which is like a pain in the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.760 
really long which is like a pain in the
ass<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> first<00:01:48.659> place<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.079> converting<00:01:49.710> it

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
ass in the first place and converting it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.700 
ass in the first place and converting it
for<00:01:50.040> some<00:01:50.250> reason<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.670> lose<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> ton<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.899> quality

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
for some reason I lose a ton of quality

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.920 
for some reason I lose a ton of quality
like<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.640> really<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.240> big<00:01:54.659> chunk

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
like it's it's a really really big chunk

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.450 
like it's it's a really really big chunk
of<00:01:55.020> quality<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.500> lose<00:01:55.680> their<00:01:55.920> when<00:01:56.430> I

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
of quality that I lose their when I

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.880 
of quality that I lose their when I
convert<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.140> actually<00:01:58.229> see<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.680> I

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
convert it and you can actually see it I

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.859 
convert it and you can actually see it I
actually<00:01:59.310> streaming<00:01:59.759> 1080p<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.719> like

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
actually streaming 1080p and it's like

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.289 
actually streaming 1080p and it's like
Chris<00:02:01.110> that's<00:02:01.320> clear<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.770> beautiful<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:02.880> on

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
Chris that's clear it's beautiful but on

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.899 
Chris that's clear it's beautiful but on
the<00:02:03.390> stream<00:02:03.630> vods<00:02:03.840> up<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.680> YouTube<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.670> can't

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
the stream vods up on YouTube you can't

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.760 
the stream vods up on YouTube you can't
even<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.210> read<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.930> text<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.590> see

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
even like read the text that you see

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.469 
even like read the text that you see
like<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.099> game<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.459> stuff<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.849> pretty<00:02:08.940> bad

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
like in game and stuff it's pretty bad

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.410 
like in game and stuff it's pretty bad
so<00:02:10.289> that's<00:02:10.679> one<00:02:10.950> reason<00:02:11.430> why<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:12.030> kind<00:02:12.360> of

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
so that's one reason why it kind of

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.580 
so that's one reason why it kind of
sucks<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.900> then<00:02:12.959> after<00:02:13.349> that

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
sucks and then after that

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.380 
sucks and then after that
I<00:02:13.620> go<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.099> I<00:02:14.160> put<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.430> into<00:02:14.640> Sony<00:02:14.849> Vegas<00:02:15.060> which

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
I go and I put it into Sony Vegas which

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.199 
I go and I put it into Sony Vegas which
is<00:02:15.420> my<00:02:15.720> video<00:02:16.050> editing<00:02:16.590> software<00:02:17.209> video

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
is my video editing software video

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.470

editing stuff you know and I go and I
chop<00:02:21.690> out<00:02:21.870> all<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.140> breaks<00:02:22.379> all<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.769> times<00:02:23.129> I

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
chop out all the breaks all the times I

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.619 
chop out all the breaks all the times I
took<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.489> break<00:02:23.670> all<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:23.910> times<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.209> was<00:02:24.300> like<00:02:24.420> be

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
took a break all the times I was like be

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.360 
took a break all the times I was like be
right<00:02:24.780> back<00:02:24.900> guys<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.860> beginning<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.310> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
right back guys in the beginning and the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.800 
right back guys in the beginning and the
end<00:02:26.519> when<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.790> run<00:02:26.879> commercials<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.450> take<00:02:27.629> all<00:02:27.780> of

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
end when I run commercials I take all of

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.300 
end when I run commercials I take all of
that<00:02:28.019> out<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.170> then<00:02:28.769> i<00:02:28.830> squish<00:02:29.069> it<00:02:29.220> all

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
that out and then i squish it all

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.430 
that out and then i squish it all
together<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.849> cut<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.480> up<00:02:30.569> into<00:02:30.750> sections<00:02:31.019> two

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
together and cut it up into sections two

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.110 
together and cut it up into sections two
or<00:02:31.560> three<00:02:31.739> parts<00:02:32.069> depending<00:02:32.489> on<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.940> length

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
or three parts depending on the length

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.759 
or three parts depending on the length
of<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.480> video<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.980> then<00:02:35.790> render<00:02:36.269> them<00:02:36.450> and

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
of the video so I then render them and

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.580 
of the video so I then render them and
rendering<00:02:37.769> each<00:02:38.010> video<00:02:38.400> takes<00:02:38.910> about<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:40.019> would

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
rendering each video takes about I would

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.850 
rendering each video takes about I would
say<00:02:40.769> another<00:02:41.730> good<00:02:42.660> an<00:02:43.019> hour<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.410> half<00:02:43.590> to

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
say another good an hour and a half to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.190 
say another good an hour and a half to
three<00:02:44.069> hours<00:02:44.099> for<00:02:44.940> each<00:02:44.970> video<00:02:45.390> which<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:45.810> like

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
three hours for each video which is like

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.330 
three hours for each video which is like
terrible<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.040> during<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.150> time<00:02:48.450> not

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
terrible so during this time not

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.140 
terrible so during this time not
necessarily<00:02:50.340> as<00:02:50.430> much<00:02:50.610> for<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.880> conversion

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
necessarily as much for the conversion

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.089 
necessarily as much for the conversion
but<00:02:51.690> for<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.290> actual<00:02:52.530> rendering<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:53.010> the

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
but for the actual rendering of the

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.059 
but for the actual rendering of the
video<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.549> pretty<00:02:54.450> much<00:02:54.540> cannot<00:02:55.019> play<00:02:55.260> games<00:02:55.650> I

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
video I pretty much cannot play games I

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.520 
video I pretty much cannot play games I
can't<00:02:56.970> even<00:02:57.150> really<00:02:57.420> use<00:02:57.630> any<00:02:57.780> other<00:02:57.930> flash

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
can't even really use any other flash

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.619 
can't even really use any other flash
type<00:02:59.040> things<00:02:59.370> like<00:02:59.819> do<00:03:00.150> farmville<00:03:00.480> or

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
type things like do farmville or

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.199 
type things like do farmville or
anything<00:03:01.049> it<00:03:01.470> kind<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.680> just<00:03:01.860> takes<00:03:02.129> up<00:03:02.340> all<00:03:02.579> of

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
anything it kind of just takes up all of

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.509 
anything it kind of just takes up all of
everything<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:04.170> cpu<00:03:04.650> usage<00:03:04.829> everything<00:03:05.340> in<00:03:05.430> my

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
everything a cpu usage everything in my

everything a cpu usage everything in my
computer<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.090> for<00:03:07.079> that<00:03:07.170> amount<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.799> time<00:03:07.950> I

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
computer so for that amount of time I

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.539 
computer so for that amount of time I
can't<00:03:08.910> do<00:03:09.120> shit<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.660> then<00:03:10.319> I<00:03:10.650> have<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.010> upload
