Hi, I am Vidya Tikari and I am a makeup artist
and in this video I will be talking about

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.710
some bridal makeup tips for summer.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.880
So now that we are out of the winter months
and we are getting into summer months so the

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.980
same with our makeup and same with our skin
care.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.230
In winter we end up using heavier products
and more cream based products now for summer

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.830
that all has to change we cannot use anything
which is heavy on our skin.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.070
We have to use products which are more non
transfer products which are less creamy.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.190
That means more aqua based products.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.520
Because we don't want our skin to be overloaded
with unnecessary products and we don't want

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.360
our skin to feel that sticky residue all the
time because summer just means a lot of heat

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.370
and a lot of humidity.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.200
So just tone down on the layers and keep your
base absolutely light.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.900
So I like the focal point to be on the eyes.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.240
I like the products to be water resistant
or water proof.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.850
You can use your eye liners.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.870
You can use your crayon pencils, your paint
pots.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.170
So anything which you can use either with
your fingers or with a small brush which has

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.700
a lot of control.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.150
So the colours you can go in for are your
deep dark charcoal browns, your plums, you

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.979
can go in for your purples and of course your
blacks.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.140
So keep your eyes strong.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.020
Keep them smokey and keep them like a statement
for your whole face.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.740
Now eyebrows are also really strong this summer.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.060
It has to be well shaped, first and foremost,
trimmed and you can use either a nice brown

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.079
mascara which leaves beautiful shine on the
hair or you can use a pencil.

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:55.670
You can use a brown flat eyeshadow or my favourite
is a little bit of tint, like a tinted colour

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.670
on the eyebrow.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.430
So it just gives a little colour a filling
in and also a little bit of shine.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.909
Now the mascara also has to be really important.

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.549
It has to be voluminous and it has to be water
proof for sure.

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.099
My favourite one is They're Real by Benefit.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.879
Now for the cheeks, keep the cheeks a little
lighter than the eyes.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.459
I would like to use a product which is either
gel based because it's really light or something

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.310
which is more liquid like the Benetint, you've
got those colours which are corral, you've

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.739
got the pinks.

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.780
You've got the raspberry colours.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.540
You've got the slight colour which has a bronze
tone in it.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.540
So basically the cheeks are going to be underplayed
this summer.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.319
It has to be really light.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.099
Something which is not going to melt off your
skin and run down the face.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:52.132
So keep it light and be very careful with
the selection of the product which you use

00:02:52.132 --> 00:02:54.129
on the cheeks.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.840
So lips.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.550
Really important to use the primer which has
an SPF in it because you want your lips to

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.469
look luscious and not dry and chapped because
you have just come out of winters and everyone

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:06.849
has got dry lips.

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.269
So please condition your lips everyday.

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.780
Use a primer with an SPF, first and foremost.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.329
Now with summers I prefer using colours which
are non glossy and non creamy.

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.950
So you can either use your tints.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.330
Or you can use a lip stain.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.690
Now stains are all over the place.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.950
Everyone is using a matte colour on their
lips.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.569
So for brides we do exactly the same we're
gonna be using a bright colour on their lips

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.069
like a lip stain.

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.819
So for you brides who are not confident enough
wearing a bright colour, there is a solution.

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.950
You can wear a lip tint which is more a skin
tone colour all the way through an just use

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.659
a pop of colour which is your bright lip tint
right in the centre and you can also look

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.090
absolutely stunning as a bride.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.930
So also the key thing is your SPF products
in all of your cosmetics which you are using.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.430
From your skin care to your eye care, cheek
care, lip care also your hair care and body

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.430
care.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.930
So just make sure that it has an SPF because
it has to be protective on your skin and hair.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.500
