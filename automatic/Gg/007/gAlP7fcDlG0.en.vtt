00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
good players and that's been the reason

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.000 
good players and that's been the reason
why<00:00:45.570> you've<00:00:45.750> been<00:00:45.780> doing<00:00:46.440> well<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> last

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
why you've been doing well for the last

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.190 
why you've been doing well for the last
12<00:00:47.520> years<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.059> i<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.390> see<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:48.989> still

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
12 years and i can see that we can still

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.010 
12 years and i can see that we can still
keep<00:00:49.649> doing<00:00:49.980> well<00:00:50.190> because<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.660> number<00:00:51.899> of

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
keep doing well because the number of

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.900 
keep doing well because the number of
quality<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.469> play<00:00:53.070> players<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
quality of play players we have in the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.700 
quality of play players we have in the
team<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> reason<00:00:55.110> why<00:00:55.230> we're<00:00:55.410> doing<00:00:55.500> well

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
team is the reason why we're doing well

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.889 
team is the reason why we're doing well
so<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.760> will<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:56.940> very<00:00:57.030> unfair<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.750> name

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
so it will be very unfair to just name

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.360 
so it will be very unfair to just name
one<00:00:57.930> because<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:58.620> we've<00:00:58.859> got<00:00:59.039> do<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.280> know
