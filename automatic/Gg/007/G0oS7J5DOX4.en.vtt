mini classics I had the many classics
first<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:27.240> guess<00:00:27.779> my<00:00:27.960> philosophy<00:00:28.230> has<00:00:28.740> just

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
first I guess my philosophy has just

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.679 
first I guess my philosophy has just
been<00:00:29.189> de<00:00:29.400> if<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.730> already<00:00:29.849> own<00:00:30.060> one<00:00:30.300> version

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
been de if I already own one version

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.910 
been de if I already own one version
then<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.960> kind<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.230> check<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.590> off<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.769> list

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
then I kind of check that off the list

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.520 
then I kind of check that off the list
for<00:00:32.219> now<00:00:32.550> but<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.660> Mario<00:00:33.930> summit<00:00:34.200> fact<00:00:34.410> I

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
for now but the Mario summit fact I

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.139 
for now but the Mario summit fact I
wasn't<00:00:34.770> actively<00:00:35.160> really<00:00:35.520> looking<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
wasn't actively really looking for it

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.930 
wasn't actively really looking for it
and<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.420> came<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.780> my<00:00:36.809> 7<00:00:37.320> pack<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:38.520> game<00:00:38.760> was

French guide puts it at a rarity of for

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.340 
French guide puts it at a rarity of for
which<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.300> would<00:00:51.360> say<00:00:51.600> again<00:00:51.930> really

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
which I would say again really

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.680 
which I would say again really
optimistic<00:00:52.949> at<00:00:53.309> least<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> US<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.629> is

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
optimistic at least in the US this is

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.020 
optimistic at least in the US this is
not<00:00:54.989> an<00:00:55.170> uncommon<00:00:55.530> game<00:00:55.920> they're<00:00:56.579> all<00:00:56.760> over

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
not an uncommon game they're all over

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.910 
not an uncommon game they're all over
the<00:00:57.120> place

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the place

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.610 
the place
the<00:00:59.520> gameplay<00:00:59.850> pretty<00:01:00.629> much<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.320> really

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the gameplay pretty much it's a really

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.619 
the gameplay pretty much it's a really
fun<00:01:01.829> game<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:03.000> mini<00:01:03.180> classic<00:01:03.570> is

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
fun game and the mini classic is

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.420 
fun game and the mini classic is
actually<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> pretty<00:01:04.170> faithful<00:01:04.799> translation

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
actually a pretty faithful translation

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.320 
actually a pretty faithful translation
of<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.840> point<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.229> game<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.500> you

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
of it but the point of this game is you

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.719 
of it but the point of this game is you
are<00:01:09.330> Mario<00:01:09.900> working<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.470> cement<00:01:10.770> factory<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
are Mario working in a cement factory so

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.580 
are Mario working in a cement factory so
in<00:01:12.180> case<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> name<00:01:12.689> didn't<00:01:12.960> make<00:01:13.140> sense

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
in case the name didn't make sense

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.530 
in case the name didn't make sense
there's<00:01:14.070> conveyor<00:01:14.460> belts<00:01:14.880> with<00:01:15.090> cement

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
there's conveyor belts with cement

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.300 
there's conveyor belts with cement
moving<00:01:15.900> across<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> top<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:17.220> they

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
moving across the top and when they

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.070 
moving across the top and when they
reach<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.670> ends<00:01:18.030> they<00:01:18.150> pour<00:01:18.479> down<00:01:18.659> into<00:01:18.990> these

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
reach the ends they pour down into these

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.560 
reach the ends they pour down into these
hoppers<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:19.890> there's<00:01:20.100> four<00:01:20.340> hoppers<00:01:20.850> so

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
hoppers and see there's four hoppers so

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.109 
hoppers and see there's four hoppers so
they'll<00:01:22.229> pour<00:01:22.500> down<00:01:22.740> three<00:01:23.130> doses<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.700> cement

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.850 
they'll pour down three doses of cement
and<00:01:24.299> then<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> hopper<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.960> full<00:01:24.990> now<00:01:25.740> what

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
and then the hopper is full now what

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.289 
and then the hopper is full now what
you've<00:01:26.009> got<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.580> keep<00:01:26.790> running<00:01:27.180> around

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299
