00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hi to all the guys after 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.470
 some requests we decided to make 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.250
 this tutorial that will be the first of a 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.559
 series and then in the first tutorial vi 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.560
 we will show the various settings of 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.220
 video in the lake pro 04 and in the next one 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:25.680
 video those of eurotrade here is for you 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.320
 this is GoPro 04 and now we will do it 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.099
 see how to change the setting of 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.289
 video 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.000
 then you first turn on work 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.180
 holding down the power button for 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.680
 a few seconds then press the key 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.210
 the settings button is on the side 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:47.450
 here it is now 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.640
 press the mode key once 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.160
 here on this screen you can 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.070
 change video settings 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.370
 the first of these is the revolution of 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.070
 usually we use the 1080p of that 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.890
 it was more common resolution for example 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.600
 tablet phones or most of the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:13.350
 computer and the hd not in 4k 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:16.850
 now we press the world key and there 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.060
 we will find in the fps setting ie 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.439
 frames per second we usually do 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.810
 we use the largest number of 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.380
 frames per second available to 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.150
 example on rho 4 with 1080p for 120 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.990
 frames per second 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.900
 so you can do a moviola ie one 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.900
 perfect slow motion 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.150
 now taking back the fast food you will arrive 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.880
 to a function already more advanced ie 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.399
 that of deciding to put it or not 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.040
 put the wide angle board of 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.119
 put the wide angle though when you do 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:58.020
 they have to do sports like for example 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:00.390
 in motor racing and motor racing instead 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.440
 I continue not to use the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.050
 wide angle for whom 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.020
 he must take back landscapes above all 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.670
 the sea because when you resume the 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.870
 sea in lorenzo with the wide angle 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.140
 the horizon is completely a headset e 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.930
 then selecting n the wide angle e 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.570
 removed by selecting concerts on 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.960
 wide angle as you have seen 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.690
 there are other functions that we will go to 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.630
 watch the next tutorial like 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.670
 we will see the same functions and that 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.670
 we did see atria online today
