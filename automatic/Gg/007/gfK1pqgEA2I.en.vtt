00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello here is the knit link I show 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.330
 you guys today how to mesh right 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.330
 this is a video for beginners 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.109
 the stitches of the simple cross 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.199
 Attempts are made with two threads 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.570
 worked the working phase that is the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.199
 which leads to the ball knoll and the thread 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.480
 The End 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.820
 that's the thread between the ground 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.160
 mesh and the end of the thread is me 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.750
 Show yourself how you let go of the thread 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.750
 and how do you do the basic mass 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.969
 For that I take a needle for my needle 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.629
 length of the thread is enough for about ten 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.760
 mesh 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:51.160
 I take here three needle lengths at the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.550
 I measure mine now 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:01:00.040
 I will do this for you 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:03.010
 thread around a forefinger puts the 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.799
 Sling over the work phases and you 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.950
 the work phases through the sling and 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.840
 makes a knot now I take mine 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.399
 needle puts it through the mesh and 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.399
 see the stitch on the needle 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.940
 I'll show you the work of the reason 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.640
 Do it again very slowly 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.510
 that's my sling I'll put that down 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.780
 Over the work phases, the sling 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:35.280
 work thread through the loop now 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.930
 I take my needle puts the loop 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.520
 on the needle and pull the mesh tightly 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.520
 Now I'll show you the second stitch 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.229
 I take the work as for 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.070
 knit up and wrap it around once 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.070
 the index finger 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.720
 the thread end for me from the outside to the 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.490
 thumb and hold it with the middle finger 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.590
 and the ring finger 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.810
 Now I am working my second stitch 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.850
 from below into the thumb sling 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.610
 Get the thread of the index finger 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.020
 comes through for him and pulls the mesh 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.270
 I firmly show that again very slowly 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.640
 from below into the thumb sling a hol 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.550
 pull the thread through the thumb 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.550
 sling off and hold her tight 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.570
 from below a sting the thread to get 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.760
 the sling pull through the sling 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:41.190
 Release the thumb tighten 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.880
 get a stinging thread below 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.340
 by pulling the loop let go 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.020
 tighten 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.840
 I'll show you a sting again 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.350
 threading pull through the mesh 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.450
 tighten 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.400
 I repeat that now until so long 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.360
 I mean number of stitches 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.360
 achieved 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.520
 on the front of the mesh 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.370
 you see a lot of little chain 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.400
 limbs on the back 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.360
 lots of little beads we start now 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.690
 a return 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.910
 that was the easy cross stop me 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.510
 Thank you for watching this was the 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.510
 knit link
