this now the way the way these children
are<00:04:23.300> taught<00:04:23.979> rhythmically<00:04:24.979> is<00:04:25.789> by<00:04:26.330> using

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
are taught rhythmically is by using

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.310 
are taught rhythmically is by using
words<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:27.669> that<00:04:28.669> is<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:29.030> easiest<00:04:29.600> way<00:04:29.960> to

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
words and that is the easiest way to

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.129 
words and that is the easiest way to
learn<00:04:30.889> about<00:04:31.280> rhythm<00:04:31.970> because<00:04:32.690> as<00:04:32.840> soon<00:04:33.020> as

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
learn about rhythm because as soon as

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.740 
learn about rhythm because as soon as
you<00:04:33.289> speak<00:04:33.590> you're<00:04:33.949> speaking<00:04:34.460> with<00:04:34.490> mcli<00:04:35.030> only

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
you speak you're speaking with mcli only

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.330 
you speak you're speaking with mcli only
when<00:04:35.900> we<00:04:36.020> speak<00:04:36.260> normally<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.860> rhythms<00:04:37.190> are

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
when we speak normally the rhythms are

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.960 
when we speak normally the rhythms are
highly<00:04:37.729> complex<00:04:38.180> now<00:04:39.169> if<00:04:39.440> we<00:04:39.979> just<00:04:40.010> use<00:04:40.610> words

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
highly complex now if we just use words

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.020 
highly complex now if we just use words
rhythmically<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.020> say<00:04:42.500> them<00:04:42.800> we<00:04:43.550> can<00:04:43.760> play

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
rhythmically and say them we can play

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.950 
rhythmically and say them we can play
them<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.690> then<00:04:45.380> we<00:04:45.500> can<00:04:45.680> transfer<00:04:46.660> to<00:04:47.660> a

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
them and then we can transfer to a

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.310 
them and then we can transfer to a
bucket<00:04:48.199> or<00:04:48.620> a<00:04:49.099> drum<00:04:49.580> or<00:04:49.849> a<00:04:50.270> xylophone<00:04:50.570> or

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
bucket or a drum or a xylophone or

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.360 
bucket or a drum or a xylophone or
whatever<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:52.490> rhythm<00:04:53.240> could<00:04:54.050> really<00:04:55.039> easily

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
whatever so rhythm could really easily
