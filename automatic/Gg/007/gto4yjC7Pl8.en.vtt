00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.510
 now get to know the keys on 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.019
 piano 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:13.919
 as you see on the piano alternate 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:21.449
 white and black keys of black keys and 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:26.490
 there is then 2 tapas 3 then 2 tapas 3 before 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.870
 two black keys is yes here 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:42.880
 she's cute misha 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:45.640
 and then D E F G A B in order 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.940
 to remember the name of the keys you can 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.150
 come up with images of a fairy tale for yourself and then 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.090
 these names will be remembered very easily but 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.570
 Here, for example in one kingdom state 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.920
 there were 2 black mountains and 3 black mountains between 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:06.400
 two black mountains flowed river 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.250
 so the key is well natural that the river 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.300
 between three mountains cannot flow she 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.270
 flowing between two mountains here it is uah 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.030
 uah 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.740
 or that above two mountains or three mountains 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.119
 of course three mountains 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.950
 so over all three mountains is blue 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.950
 sky 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:38.860
