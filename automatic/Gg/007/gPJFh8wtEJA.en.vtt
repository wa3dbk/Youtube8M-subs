00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.449
 good morning everyone, let's talk about a 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.210
 nice tool that is this bass 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.820
 dixon model and b 4 strings that 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.849
 revives the splendor of the gibson brand 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.000
 towards us poor inhabitants of the 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.619
 harmonic subscale that is those that 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.899
 produce foundation on which ours 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.370
 friends citaristi then later visano 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.590
 Suddenly in CHIAPPANO reading 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.719
 this tool unlike others 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.809
 nixon bass and characterizing from a 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.520
 line so to speak unmistakable different 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.499
 from what has been done previously even if e 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.780
 overturning the crate and looking at it below 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:49.659
 a certain light could also remember 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.800
 partly the average keep on the rp la model 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:52.989
 famous electric guitar whose 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.050
 electronics had been signed by boruc 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.640
 for example, but the funniest thing about 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.159
 this tool and that uses two of 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.659
 designer garments with cola stripes coming up among the 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.100
 because they can be used in 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.620
 single winding world more 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.420
 winding this means that the three 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.250
 controls refer to the tone 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.760
 general of the instrument volume and push 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.040
 pull to get the change from a 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.570
 wrapping only two and also in the other 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.180
 If darker volume for each other 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.180
 manners this said you can listen 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.420
 a double winding are 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:41.100
 individually same game also for 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:43.260
 the other but nothing when it opens 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.580
 all the fair and put on 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.830
 manors working twice as much 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.080
 winding to the instrument and puts the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.350
 largest woman and powerful voice she is 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.350
 to be able 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.200
 however one can also differentiate the 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.200
 peel 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:23.720
 working by highlighting the individual items 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.060
 given by the combinations of 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.040
 windings the wood is easily 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.189
 recognizable ash for the case 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.739
 unique large table na that mounted a 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.599
 she is not dead she holds the handle still 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.180
 in maple with a rosewood fretboard 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.489
 marks mechanical positions 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.950
 are the classic sealed krugers 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.109
 common to use and stable held 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.420
 can be adjusted in hardness 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:50.239
 of the rotation grace blacks by 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.000
 because there is here on the head they opened the 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.970
 himba peak bridge is a pleasant enter 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.590
 in the world of the very low of a certain 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.030
 level also because the section this 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.400
 tool does not cost so much it costs 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.840
 perhaps less than it should and therefore 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.099
 what it costs and for what it is written 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.299
 here and where it was built 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.930
 objectively it's a splash 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.549
 significant from the point of view 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.079
 commercial what to say should only be 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.599
 unfortunately he could play in this 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.099
 moment happened in the wrong hands 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.019
 but at this point in life in the 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.669
 camera follow the broad gesture of the 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.129
 because I'm about to introduce a guest 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:24.829
 of exception air directed by alfredo 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.680
 romeo of the trans and marche magazine that 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.540
 can act as a guinea pig in the employment of the 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.940
 electric bass never played by 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.370
 subscribed but more or less aligned 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.459
 a battery case that is the famous one 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.230
 low and battery duality that produces the 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.069
 rhythm section at the base of each 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.799
 success 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.639
 what could something happen 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.760
 exciting 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.949
 thanks to the soft penetrating round 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.840
 significant rumors of this great beauty 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:53.290
 master instrument make us feel 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.290
 something
