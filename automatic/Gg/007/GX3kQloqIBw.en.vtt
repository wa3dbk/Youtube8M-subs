have an injector problem on a Chrysler
3.8<00:00:19.980> liter<00:00:21.199> particular<00:00:22.199> mine<00:00:22.590> was<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.930> injector

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
3.8 liter particular mine was a injector

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.910 
3.8 liter particular mine was a injector
for<00:00:26.420> malfunction<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:30.410> here<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:31.529> are<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
for malfunction and here we are in the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.990 
for malfunction and here we are in the
motor<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.989> notice<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.590> top<00:00:35.450> I've

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
motor so you notice on the top I've

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.799 
motor so you notice on the top I've
taken<00:00:39.000> off<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.450> intake<00:00:41.149> which<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.540> part

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
taken off the intake which is this part

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.540 
taken off the intake which is this part
here<00:00:48.079> I've<00:00:49.079> disconnected<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:50.010> connections

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
here I've disconnected the connections

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.850 
here I've disconnected the connections
which<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.940> two<00:00:51.120> plugs<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.660> tube<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
which is two plugs and tube and the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.330 
which is two plugs and tube and the
throttle<00:00:53.129> cables<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.860> back<00:00:56.070> there

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
throttle cables and on the back there

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:11.750 
throttle cables and on the back there
was<00:00:56.430> two<00:00:56.640> tubes<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:58.340> map<00:00:59.340> sensor<00:01:07.820> so<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:10.760> over

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
was two tubes and map sensor so and over

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.340 
was two tubes and map sensor so and over
here<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.150> had<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.330> take<00:01:12.479> out<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> fuel<00:01:13.080> rail

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
here we had to take out the fuel rail

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.249 
here we had to take out the fuel rail
which<00:01:14.189> goes<00:01:14.430> across<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.850> middle<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.960> is

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
which goes across the middle and that is

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.520 
which goes across the middle and that is
this<00:01:17.130> here<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:18.600> injectors<00:01:19.110> there<00:01:19.350> was<00:01:19.500> a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
this here the injectors there was a

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.429 
this here the injectors there was a
connector<00:01:20.009> here<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:22.220> one<00:01:23.220> here

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
connector here and one here

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.140 
connector here and one here
and<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.650> bulk<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.100> right<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:26.670> which<00:01:26.939> goes

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
and a bulk one right here which goes

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.770 
and a bulk one right here which goes
down<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> back<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.960> motor<00:01:29.689> it<00:01:30.689> is

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
down to the back of the motor it is

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.969 
down to the back of the motor it is
located<00:01:32.930> one<00:01:33.930> right<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:35.299> it's<00:01:36.299> located<00:01:36.979> down

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
located one right here it's located down

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.170 
located one right here it's located down
the<00:01:38.009> back<00:01:39.110> you'll<00:01:40.110> see<00:01:42.170> right<00:01:43.170> here<00:01:44.180> metal

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the back you'll see right here metal

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.450 
the back you'll see right here metal
plate<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:46.700> then<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.030> connector<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:49.369> put<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
plate and then the connector is put the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.520 
plate and then the connector is put the
light<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.670> it

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.100 

you'll<00:01:57.530> see<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.860> right<00:01:58.010> down<00:01:58.280> here<00:01:59.020> and<00:02:00.020> I

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
you'll see it right down here and I

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.930 
you'll see it right down here and I
connect<00:02:00.410> this<00:02:00.620> metal<00:02:01.040> bracket<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:01.700> then<00:02:01.820> it

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
connect this metal bracket and then it

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.290 
connect this metal bracket and then it
comes<00:02:02.120> down<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.480> backside<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:04.120> travels<00:02:05.120> up

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
comes down the backside and travels up

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.770 
comes down the backside and travels up
through<00:02:05.330> this<00:02:05.690> valley<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:07.180> here<00:02:08.180> this<00:02:08.660> is

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
through this valley to here this is

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.050 
through this valley to here this is
where<00:02:08.960> the<00:02:08.990> rail<00:02:09.200> comes<00:02:09.530> in

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
where the rail comes in

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.580 
where the rail comes in
so<00:02:13.030> put<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.060> noid<00:02:14.270> light<00:02:14.570> on<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:14.960> and<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.350> didn't

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
so put a noid light on it and I didn't

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.670 
so put a noid light on it and I didn't
get<00:02:15.680> any<00:02:15.890> pulse<00:02:16.160> signal<00:02:19.930> if<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:21.110> need<00:02:21.320> to<00:02:21.410> inject

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
get any pulse signal if I need to inject

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.820 
get any pulse signal if I need to inject
honest<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:24.050> got<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.230> full<00:02:24.380> range<00:02:24.560> there's

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
honest you got the full range there's

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.949 
honest you got the full range there's
not<00:02:25.070> many<00:02:25.160> cars<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.490> wouldn't<00:02:25.820> suit<00:02:26.030> all<00:02:26.900> the

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
not many cars that wouldn't suit all the

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:40.500 
not many cars that wouldn't suit all the
different<00:02:27.440> style<00:02:27.650> injector<00:02:28.040> pins

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.750 

so<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.540> took<00:02:41.690> this<00:02:42.080> harness<00:02:42.320> apart<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.100> as<00:02:43.610> I'm

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
so I took this harness apart and as I'm

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.590 
so I took this harness apart and as I'm
taking<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.150> apart

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
taking it apart

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:53.700 
taking it apart
I<00:02:44.630> noticed<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:46.190> ends<00:02:47.710> were<00:02:48.710> toasted<00:02:51.580> focus

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
I noticed the ends were toasted focus

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.170 
I noticed the ends were toasted focus
and<00:02:54.710> I<00:02:54.830> noticed<00:02:55.250> just<00:02:55.370> by<00:02:55.550> looking<00:02:55.940> at<00:02:56.060> the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
and I noticed just by looking at the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.720 
and I noticed just by looking at the
very<00:02:56.480> plug<00:02:57.470> end<00:02:57.740> I<00:02:57.950> noticed<00:02:58.280> they<00:02:58.400> were<00:02:58.430> all

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
very plug end I noticed they were all

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.300 
very plug end I noticed they were all
messed<00:02:59.210> up<00:03:00.460> that's<00:03:01.460> all<00:03:02.560> I'm<00:03:03.560> going<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:03.980> try<00:03:04.280> to

at a little over two hundred dollars for
a<00:03:09.800> new<00:03:09.920> injector<00:03:10.580> harness<00:03:11.020> but<00:03:12.020> I'm<00:03:12.170> pretty

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380
