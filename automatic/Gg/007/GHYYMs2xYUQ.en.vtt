00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.240 

and<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:09.580> thing<00:02:09.789> to<00:02:09.940> shut<00:02:10.149> this<00:02:10.270> like<00:02:10.509> that

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
and this thing to shut this like that

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.940 
and this thing to shut this like that
very<00:02:12.250> secure<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:16.230> not<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.260> whole<00:02:17.410> bunch<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.800> the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
very secure so not a whole bunch to the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.550 
very secure so not a whole bunch to the
spirit<00:02:18.340> box<00:02:18.550> but<00:02:18.850> it's<00:02:19.240> probably<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.350> best

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
spirit box but it's probably the best

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.170 
spirit box but it's probably the best
way<00:02:20.680> I've<00:02:20.860> seen<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.790> can<00:02:21.819> fit<00:02:22.240> them<00:02:22.390> I

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
way I've seen that you can fit them I

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.930 
way I've seen that you can fit them I
usually<00:02:25.180> use<00:02:25.600> these<00:02:25.810> Flambeau<00:02:26.410> boxes<00:02:26.940> these

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
usually use these Flambeau boxes these

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.630 
usually use these Flambeau boxes these
are<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.270> 36<00:02:29.140> series<00:02:29.500> box<00:02:29.709> but<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.190> single

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
are the 36 series box but the single

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.460 
are the 36 series box but the single
size<00:02:31.080> as<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.350> can<00:02:32.500> see<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:33.010> same<00:02:33.220> size<00:02:34.470> so

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
size as you can see the same size so

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.570 
size as you can see the same size so
