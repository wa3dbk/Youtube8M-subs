00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:15.240
 what do i need for my red 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.570
 bratwurst so their pork belly then 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.210
 pork shoulder or send meat 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.859
 the relationship in here belly or 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.119
 ham free shoulder meat so lean 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.599
 too fat too lean , you can even constantly 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.560
 to change 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.750
 Here I now have 40 percent belly and 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.850
 60% lean meat you can also 30 here 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.700
 take a percent of the belly or 20 percent 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.960
 only one can do that too 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.770
 within 50 to 50 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.450
 Anyway that does not matter 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.070

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.469

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.750

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.520

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.620
 data is clear 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:15.070

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:27.570
