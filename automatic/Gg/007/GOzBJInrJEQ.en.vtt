roof you're not generating a bunch of

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.660 
roof you're not generating a bunch of
runoff<00:01:09.320> which<00:01:09.740> will<00:01:09.890> hurt<00:01:10.009> the<00:01:10.189> plants<00:01:10.549> and

they<00:05:03.780> take<00:05:03.960> a<00:05:04.020> step<00:05:04.409> mid<00:05:04.740> stroke<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:06.780> what

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
they take a step mid stroke and what

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.290 
they take a step mid stroke and what
that<00:05:07.169> does<00:05:07.440> is<00:05:07.770> that<00:05:08.009> creates<00:05:08.310> a<00:05:08.580> zig<00:05:08.849> zag<00:05:08.879> on

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
that does is that creates a zig zag on

that does is that creates a zig zag on
the<00:05:09.389> roof<00:05:09.539> you<00:05:09.720> get<00:05:09.870> a<00:05:09.900> heavy<00:05:10.169> area<00:05:10.650> treated
