 of ankara in turkey and they are called in 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.519
 bora because when we discovered them 

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:04.769
 so in turkey under the Ottoman empires in 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.560
 quarters to be called angora so we have 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.330
 brought back the angora rabbits and the term is 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.090
 stayed then they were always white 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.890
 the one before me not originally he was 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.810
 black to gray but in fact we have 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.090
 selected a mutant in a door and 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.159
 little rabbits who was albino for 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.630
 to make it a purebred because it 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.460
 allowed to dye the color that 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.880
 we wanted with their hair and well 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.280
 you make pure scarves and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.270
 socks gloves socks to 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.610
 do a lot of things 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.819
 the raw material is in great demand 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.979
 she is very beautiful very light sweet and 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:41.310
 as here we are in a region of 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.060
 spinning mills and well actually this pole 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.759
 encourage had the idea to transform it 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.739
 hell of the water yarn knit and 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.259
 turn it off now if you want I 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:53.759
 can show you with pleasure how 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.020
 it's happening between and the technique for 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.020
 proste pretty rabbit 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.399
 m 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.329
 I 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.329
 the parties 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.159
 jager technique to brush a rabbit 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.459
 angora 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:20.579
 we can brush it to the sea says what we 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.010
 did before so we simply 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:26.430
 catches and rabbits and with the roofs have 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.170
 pulled on the stove and let that make him 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.730
 not bad it does not hurt him because 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.340
 that he knows how to react and that's it 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.540
 it is a natural moult so the hair and 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.519
 detached from their roots 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.290
 it does not hold anymore and so they come off 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.390
 very easily and see the animal does not 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.519
 move absolutely not just do like 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.030
 it's just now how 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.579
 now we have a comb done that 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.940
 we are using wii bros and we're going 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.920
 rabbit salt and we will remove the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.269
 hair everywhere and finally there is a 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.900
 third technique to the east that is 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.489
 the tent 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.650
 this is practiced in most 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.239
 countries must be ten minutes yet 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.190
 in pain it takes practically a 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.989
 time to brush it but that we 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.970
 allows to harvest a hair of very beautiful 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.810
 quality that is very long 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.269
 which is what we would take over 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.099
 yachting was when the bros is 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.750
 Ben real name when the weather 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.299
 is much shorter he elects do not there 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.430
 felt and I was told that this is a 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.650
 jar hair that is very long which is 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.519
 very good quality and so it is 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.510
 holds the mesh well it's sweet there 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.120
 what is it to give you for my 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.720
 amazing little bunny so I'm going 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.720

 Helen and all this matter 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.250
 first we will bring him to a 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.140
 wii spinners who will do everything 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.580
 just the son and he and you 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.620
 give back the pilots like this is the 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.690
 color of the rabbit thieuleux knits and 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.190
 after i the theme how do you do 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.900
 to dyes in that they are organic 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.480
 the dyes are natural so 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.110
 mainly herbal so 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.220
 I use ipic man from plants and 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.410
 the plants they are out of the garden 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.790
 yes we can go see some of them 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:19.209
 if you want the baths with pleasure 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.209
 we will not know in the round 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.060
 gala we will see the traveler madder 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.889
 it is a plant that grows 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.480
 naturally in places a little 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.550
 little shade the undergrowth 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.820
 she's going to give us the orange that's the 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.160
 root that contains lisa rim and 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.770
 so that gives us this famous orange and 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.360
 red very well and you said indigo 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.969
 absolutely 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.879
 it's this when it's monday gauthier 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:45.110
 so he who supplanted the pastel and 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:47.210
 in the leaves does not give Monday 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.689
 when very well then we go in your 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.729
 workshop 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:53.050
 here we are going to reach a balaclava 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.050
 more you go go 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.140
 and the sea 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:15.180
 it's a tube huy had found an island 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:18.040
 exit how do we achieve it? 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.680
 then we will first wet the wool 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.210
 why it 's better and better for 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.360
 allow the material to better 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.430
 soak up the dye so that's it 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.120
 so now we're going to put it in 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.630
 this basin 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:35.020
 yes there is dyeing so there is the 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:38.680
 blue there is pastel so that's it 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.960
 crushed it and we put it on 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:45.220
 inside of them in the water then 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:50.950
 first of all it's towards there while she's going 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:53.710
 go out then after little by little at 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:58.060
 awesome air touch she'll take 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:00.880
 this color a little bit blue we're going 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:04.150
 soaked to bring out the evidence 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.100
 a little more live these scenery and 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.900

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.760
 used in the manufacture of textiles 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.350
 high-end these rabbits are the only ones
