00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.859
 hello I will try to show you 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.110
 how do I get off a stone 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.679
 in a safe exit with strawberries 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.350
 so this ring and a ring in the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.949
 ring body was cut into a 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.670
 plate 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.619
 we can see here pretty well but 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.960
 imagine how the plate was 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.529
 cut to become a body of rings 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.710
 and then the exit on summer done with 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.989
 the technique of a washer 2025 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.320
 thick which was stamped and then 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.460
 hunted in a hole that is 10 mm and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.489
 the stone I'm going to adjust is a 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.620
 8 mm moonstone then the first 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.200
 thing 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.850
 the first thing to do is the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.100
 first step the latter is to 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.260
 mill at an angle so that this point here 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.570
 this weight here exactly match 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.329
 to the diameters of the stone so for 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.989
 do this I'm going to mill a strawberry 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.989
 conical 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.439
 so from time to time I check for 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:43.299
 see if I have reached the diameter of the 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:51.479
 stone so not quite yet a 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:51.479
 checking a few more tenths 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.510
 [Music] 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.570
 so here I have something that is 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.360
 very close that is to say that the 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.190
 little stop inside tells me the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.140
 exact diameter of the stone and 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.460
 now i will go to step 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:29.630
 number 2 which is this one which consists of 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.110
 dig at right angles with like point 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.990
 landmark 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.760
 this little point here that I found with 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.650
 the first milling so here I go 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.820
 milling with a would do if he likes for 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.820
 to be able to go down the stone 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.439
 [Music] 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.429
 [Music] 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.340
 [Music] 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.090
 6 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:04:03.699
 [Music] 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.660
 [Music] 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.870
 c 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:30.089
 [Music] 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:46.490
 [Music] 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.869
 [Music] 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.639
 [Music] 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.580
 I 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.289
 [Music] 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.289
 this 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.029
 [Music] 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.550
 so here I am going to check to see if I 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.770
 am steep good dimensions so the 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.380
 stone does not fit yet but he does not 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.460
 not miss much so I continue 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.460
 to grow a little bit 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.230

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.329
