00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
tricks to consider when building one for

tricks to consider when building one for
yourself

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:33.769

you<00:00:48.120> ever<00:00:48.239> build<00:00:48.510> dock<00:00:48.750> ponds<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.469> if<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.339> what

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
you ever build dock ponds and if so what

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.420 
you ever build dock ponds and if so what
do<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.729> do<00:00:50.879> differently<00:00:51.089> and<00:00:52.339> you<00:00:53.339> know

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
do you do differently and you know

do you do differently and you know
there's<00:00:53.609> something<00:00:53.820> very<00:00:54.030> different<00:00:54.329> about

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
there's something very different about

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.689 
there's something very different about
building<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.229> big<00:00:55.680> beautiful<00:00:56.129> pond<00:00:56.430> that

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
building a big beautiful pond that

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.279 
building a big beautiful pond that
attracts<00:00:57.089> the<00:00:57.359> ducks<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.839> just<00:00:58.019> show<00:00:58.140> up

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
attracts the ducks that just show up

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.310 
attracts the ducks that just show up
naturally<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.890> then<00:00:59.899> building<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.049> pond

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
naturally and then building a pond

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.020 
naturally and then building a pond
specifically<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.070> ducks<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.609> let's<00:01:02.850> say

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
specifically for ducks like let's say

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.359 
specifically for ducks like let's say
that<00:01:03.180> your<00:01:03.510> pets<00:01:03.839> because<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.100> built

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
that your pets because we have built

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.359 
that your pets because we have built
ponds<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.090> both<00:01:06.720> both<00:01:07.409> situations<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.250> you're

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
ponds in both both situations if you're

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.490 
ponds in both both situations if you're
doing<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.759> very<00:01:08.940> large<00:01:09.119> pond<00:01:09.509> say<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.289> a<00:01:10.350> half

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
doing a very large pond say it's a half

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.430 
doing a very large pond say it's a half
acre<00:01:10.710> pond<00:01:11.069> I<00:01:11.569> very<00:01:12.569> frequently<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.229> Ducks

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
acre pond I very frequently the Ducks

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.169 
acre pond I very frequently the Ducks
will<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.799> show<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.369> migrate<00:01:14.759> in<00:01:14.940> they

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
will just show up they migrate in they

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:16.789 
will just show up they migrate in they
hang<00:01:15.360> out<00:01:15.539> they<00:01:15.600> raise<00:01:15.960> babies<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.619> then<00:01:16.710> they

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
hang out they raise babies and then they

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.109 
hang out they raise babies and then they
come<00:01:16.979> back<00:01:17.009> year<00:01:17.369> after<00:01:17.429> year

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
come back year after year

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.930 
come back year after year
now<00:01:18.979> one<00:01:19.979> thing<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.250> consider<00:01:20.340> when<00:01:20.700> building

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
now one thing to consider when building

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.440 
now one thing to consider when building
a<00:01:21.299> duck<00:01:21.539> pond<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:22.080> yourself<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.679> have<00:01:22.950> to

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
a duck pond for yourself you have to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.160 
a duck pond for yourself you have to
realize<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.479> they<00:01:24.750> put<00:01:24.959> an<00:01:25.049> incredible

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
realize that they put an incredible

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.039 
realize that they put an incredible
strain<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.100> ecosystem<00:01:26.399> because<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.959> know

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
strain on the ecosystem because you know

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.419 
strain on the ecosystem because you know
they're<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> bathroom<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.159> there

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
they're going to the bathroom in there

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.190 
they're going to the bathroom in there
they're<00:01:29.700> going<00:01:29.819> on<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> edges<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.840> they're

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
they're going on the edges and they're

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.090 
they're going on the edges and they're
very<00:01:31.440> card<00:01:31.830> on<00:01:32.009> aquatic<00:01:32.490> plants<00:01:32.970> so

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
very card on aquatic plants so

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.559 
very card on aquatic plants so
oftentimes<00:01:35.100> you're<00:01:35.310> using<00:01:35.580> aquatic<00:01:36.119> plants

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
oftentimes you're using aquatic plants

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.109 
oftentimes you're using aquatic plants
in<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:37.079> natural<00:01:37.530> balanced<00:01:37.979> ecosystem<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
in a natural balanced ecosystem to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.029 
in a natural balanced ecosystem to
manage<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.899> water<00:01:40.049> quality<00:01:40.350> for<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.829> Ducks

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
manage the water quality for the Ducks

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.740 
manage the water quality for the Ducks
so<00:01:41.430> that's<00:01:41.909> something<00:01:42.149> that<00:01:42.390> needs<00:01:42.539> to<00:01:42.689> be

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
so that's something that needs to be

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.569 
so that's something that needs to be
considered<00:01:42.990> when<00:01:43.350> you're<00:01:43.770> building<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.399> pond

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
considered when you're building a pond

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.310 
considered when you're building a pond
for<00:01:44.759> them<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.270> I'll<00:01:45.630> tell<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.930> we've<00:01:46.109> done<00:01:46.289> a

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
for them and I'll tell you we've done a

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.490 
for them and I'll tell you we've done a
few<00:01:46.500> duck<00:01:46.740> ponds<00:01:47.219> where<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.840> homeowner

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
few duck ponds where the homeowner

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.649 
few duck ponds where the homeowner
already<00:01:50.070> has<00:01:50.280> ducks<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.850> they<00:01:51.179> maybe<00:01:51.359> had<00:01:51.630> a

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
already has ducks and they maybe had a

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.510 
already has ducks and they maybe had a
preformed<00:01:52.259> pond<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.829> they<00:01:52.920> put<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> ducks<00:01:53.369> in

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
preformed pond and they put the ducks in

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.099 
preformed pond and they put the ducks in
there<00:01:53.729> they<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> hard<00:01:54.299> time<00:01:54.359> keeping<00:01:54.840> the

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
there they have a hard time keeping the

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.349 
there they have a hard time keeping the
water<00:01:55.590> clean<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:56.189> them<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.549> they're<00:01:56.939> dumping

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
water clean for them and they're dumping

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.569 
water clean for them and they're dumping
it<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.659> filling<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.829> what<00:01:58.979> happens<00:01:59.429> is

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
it and filling it and so what happens is

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.940 
it and filling it and so what happens is
they<00:02:00.149> asked<00:02:00.479> us<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.600> come<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.259> build<00:02:01.829> a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
they asked us to come in and build a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.029 
they asked us to come in and build a
duck<00:02:02.159> pond<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.549> my<00:02:02.670> first<00:02:02.880> tip<00:02:03.210> for<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.619> if

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
duck pond so my first tip for you is if

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.940 
duck pond so my first tip for you is if
you<00:02:05.280> can<00:02:05.609> build<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.570> pond<00:02:06.869> prior<00:02:07.499> to<00:02:07.770> getting

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
you can build the pond prior to getting

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.340 
you can build the pond prior to getting
the<00:02:08.190> ducks<00:02:08.459> that's<00:02:08.850> critical<00:02:09.509> because<00:02:09.989> once

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
the ducks that's critical because once

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.670 
the ducks that's critical because once
you<00:02:10.470> already<00:02:10.769> have<00:02:11.540> some<00:02:12.540> ducks<00:02:12.810> usually<00:02:13.350> you

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
you already have some ducks usually you

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.170 
you already have some ducks usually you
might<00:02:13.799> have<00:02:14.010> babies<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.609> might<00:02:14.820> be

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
might have babies you might be

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.020 
might have babies you might be
collecting<00:02:15.750> more<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.079> them<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.670> it's<00:02:17.670> really

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
collecting more of them and it's really

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.069 
collecting more of them and it's really
hard<00:02:18.239> on<00:02:18.359> the<00:02:18.450> system<00:02:18.750> when<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:18.959> a

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
hard on the system when you have a

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.569 
hard on the system when you have a
brand-new<00:02:19.560> pond<00:02:19.829> to<00:02:19.980> throw<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.220> ducks<00:02:20.430> in

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
brand-new pond to throw the ducks in

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:21.710 
brand-new pond to throw the ducks in
there<00:02:20.730> they're<00:02:21.120> really<00:02:21.359> hard<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:21.660> the

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
there they're really hard on the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.630 
there they're really hard on the
nitrogen<00:02:22.170> cycle<00:02:22.200> which<00:02:22.650> means<00:02:22.890> it's<00:02:23.100> cycling

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
nitrogen cycle which means it's cycling

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.120 
nitrogen cycle which means it's cycling
and<00:02:23.970> as<00:02:24.870> they<00:02:25.109> go<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.410> bathroom<00:02:25.799> in<00:02:25.890> there

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
and as they go to the bathroom in there

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.890 
and as they go to the bathroom in there
the<00:02:26.579> water<00:02:26.760> quality<00:02:26.970> gets<00:02:27.420> off<00:02:27.569> really<00:02:27.870> bad

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
the water quality gets off really bad

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.720 
the water quality gets off really bad
but<00:02:28.200> if<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.470> can<00:02:28.650> build<00:02:28.859> the<00:02:28.950> pond<00:02:29.160> prior<00:02:29.489> to

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
but if you can build the pond prior to

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.910 
but if you can build the pond prior to
getting<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.180> ducks<00:02:30.450> which<00:02:31.109> I<00:02:31.230> know<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.650> really

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
getting the ducks which I know is really

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.009 
getting the ducks which I know is really
hard<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.160> do<00:02:32.370> but<00:02:32.790> if<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:32.970> can<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.720> can<00:02:33.750> get

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
hard to do but if you can you can get

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.870 
hard to do but if you can you can get
the<00:02:34.109> pond<00:02:34.319> really<00:02:34.680> balanced<00:02:35.250> out<00:02:35.370> then<00:02:35.700> you

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
the pond really balanced out then you

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.759 
the pond really balanced out then you
introduce<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.450> ducks<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:37.109> a<00:02:37.230> big<00:02:37.530> big

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
introduce the ducks it's a big big

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.979 
introduce the ducks it's a big big
difference<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.420> that's<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.630> first<00:02:39.840> thing

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
difference so that's the first thing

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.350 
difference so that's the first thing
that<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.200> want<00:02:40.410> you<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.560> do<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.790> second<00:02:42.180> thing

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
that I want you to do the second thing

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360 
that I want you to do the second thing
is<00:02:42.569> I'll<00:02:43.530> tell<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.799> about<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.010> duck<00:02:44.159> pond

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
is I'll tell you about the duck pond

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.550 
is I'll tell you about the duck pond
that<00:02:44.489> we<00:02:44.580> did<00:02:44.760> once<00:02:44.970> we<00:02:45.299> built

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
that we did once we built

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.430 
that we did once we built
this<00:02:45.650> really<00:02:45.920> cool<00:02:46.099> pond<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:47.060> we<00:02:47.870> put<00:02:48.200> some

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
this really cool pond and we put some

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.500 
this really cool pond and we put some
marginal<00:02:48.800> plants<00:02:49.220> on<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.430> sides<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:50.030> which

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
marginal plants on the sides of it which

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.050 
marginal plants on the sides of it which
were<00:02:50.810> annihilated<00:02:51.230> immediately<00:02:52.040> but<00:02:52.610> we<00:02:52.849> had

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
were annihilated immediately but we had

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.850 
were annihilated immediately but we had
this<00:02:53.239> stream<00:02:53.720> coming<00:02:53.989> into<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.380> pond<00:02:54.620> and

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
this stream coming into the pond and

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.520 
this stream coming into the pond and
they<00:02:55.340> built<00:02:55.580> an<00:02:55.730> aviary<00:02:56.239> around<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.230> pond

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
they built an aviary around the pond

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.309 
they built an aviary around the pond
section<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.370> of<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.209> duck<00:02:59.360> pond<00:02:59.630> and<00:02:59.870> we<00:03:00.200> had

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
section of of the duck pond and we had

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.040 
section of of the duck pond and we had
the<00:03:00.440> stream<00:03:00.770> come<00:03:01.099> out<00:03:01.310> of<00:03:01.819> it<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.269> up<00:03:02.780> on<00:03:02.959> this

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
the stream come out of it and up on this

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.030 
the stream come out of it and up on this
little<00:03:03.230> hillside

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
little hillside

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.370 
little hillside
we<00:03:04.310> installed<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.819> bog<00:03:05.060> filter<00:03:05.360> with<00:03:06.110> all<00:03:06.230> the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
we installed a bog filter with all the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.500 
we installed a bog filter with all the
different<00:03:06.560> aquatic<00:03:07.099> plants<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:07.819> we<00:03:08.209> pumped

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
different aquatic plants and we pumped

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.180 
different aquatic plants and we pumped
water<00:03:08.780> from<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.260> main<00:03:09.410> body<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:09.890> pond

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
water from the main body of the pond

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.420 
water from the main body of the pond
outside<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:11.269> Avery<00:03:11.599> up<00:03:12.050> into<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.500> bog<00:03:12.739> and<00:03:13.040> we

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
outside the Avery up into the bog and we

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.770 
outside the Avery up into the bog and we
sent<00:03:13.700> all<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:13.970> water<00:03:14.150> up<00:03:14.390> through<00:03:14.420> these

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
sent all the water up through these

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.570 
sent all the water up through these
marginal<00:03:15.560> plants<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:15.980> help<00:03:16.130> manage<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.459> water

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
marginal plants to help manage the water

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.309 
marginal plants to help manage the water
quality<00:03:16.819> back<00:03:17.300> down<00:03:17.540> through<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.810> stream<00:03:18.140> and

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
quality back down through the stream and

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.970 
quality back down through the stream and
into<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.590> pond

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
into the pond

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.830 
into the pond
the<00:03:19.280> pond<00:03:19.489> balance<00:03:20.000> is<00:03:20.120> really<00:03:20.390> nice<00:03:20.569> like

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
the pond balance is really nice like

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.440 
the pond balance is really nice like
that<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:21.980> second<00:03:22.370> thing<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.910> tip<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.390> I

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
area outside of the pond where maybe the

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.789 
area outside of the pond where maybe the
Ducks<00:03:27.980> aren't<00:03:28.190> gonna<00:03:28.430> mess<00:03:28.670> with<00:03:28.700> then<00:03:29.799> that's

last final tip is to put some kind of
enclosure<00:03:40.250> around<00:03:40.519> it<00:03:40.910> if<00:03:41.390> I<00:03:41.660> was<00:03:41.810> gonna<00:03:41.930> be

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
enclosure around it if I was gonna be

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.050 
enclosure around it if I was gonna be
building<00:03:42.319> a<00:03:42.650> duck<00:03:43.099> pond<00:03:43.400> which<00:03:43.760> I've

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
building a duck pond which I've

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.420 
building a duck pond which I've
contemplated<00:03:44.630> many<00:03:45.110> times<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:46.040> Ducks<00:03:46.250> I

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
contemplated many times the Ducks I

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.039 
contemplated many times the Ducks I
would<00:03:46.580> have<00:03:46.700> probably<00:03:46.940> more<00:03:47.299> rare<00:03:47.599> ducks<00:03:47.870> in

all the marginal plants to keep the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.250 
all the marginal plants to keep the
water<00:04:22.639> clear<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.240> then<00:04:23.750> I<00:04:23.840> would<00:04:23.990> put<00:04:24.169> an

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
water clear and then I would put an

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.900 
water clear and then I would put an
enclosure<00:04:24.590> around<00:04:24.889> it<00:04:25.310> and<00:04:25.460> make<00:04:25.580> that<00:04:25.789> little

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
enclosure around it and make that little

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.460 
enclosure around it and make that little
habitat<00:04:26.479> where<00:04:26.660> they<00:04:26.750> can<00:04:26.870> get<00:04:26.990> out<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.350> walk

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
habitat where they can get out and walk

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.080 
habitat where they can get out and walk
around<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:28.160> they<00:04:28.280> can<00:04:28.430> come<00:04:28.610> back<00:04:28.729> into<00:04:28.910> the

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
around and they can come back into the

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.240 
around and they can come back into the
pond<00:04:29.300> that<00:04:29.510> would<00:04:29.930> probably<00:04:30.080> be<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:30.320> best<00:04:30.590> the

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
pond that would probably be the best the

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.670 
pond that would probably be the best the
best<00:04:31.370> way<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.580> do<00:04:31.760> it<00:04:32.080> it's<00:04:33.080> gonna<00:04:33.200> bring<00:04:33.410> me<00:04:33.530> to

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
best way to do it it's gonna bring me to

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.500 
best way to do it it's gonna bring me to
