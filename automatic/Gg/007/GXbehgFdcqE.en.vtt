00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.110
 hello guys and girls how are you today 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.460
 I bring from my finished products that to 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.890
 themselves and to make a video of this 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.570
 but there were always so many things 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.919
 and I did not want to make the giant video by 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.110
 I changed house and in the end to not 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.270
 so as not to bring less katiba desire 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.820
 things since they were in using the 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.680
 boats and whose people some little things like that 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.870
 that I 'm going to start immediately with 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.460
 the video one of the first things arrives 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.460
 as basic with our typical 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.110
 petals of the button to make up and 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.480
 I always buy these from the same 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.790
 mark sometimes they come to me there are times that I 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.070
 they come better than others like 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.110
 so they have me all super clueless 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.610
 and again and they come all together 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.990
 But anyway, I always buy them and they cost 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.830
 with about 300 pesos two packages that is 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.830
 100 between 1 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.259
 finish these three masters of my bicrim 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.170
 the violet I loved I feel that it has 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.030
 a much more natural tone or more 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.250
 skin color than the others that are with 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.460
 less other more gray 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.150
 the is nike nutrition I did not like 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.850
 month 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.470
 I feel that it dries my skin or that I 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.450
 remark are elkin will continue I knew that 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:34.900
 I had them dry so I did not like it and the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.690
 bicrim that is this x the pink 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.120
 If I liked it, it's not bad, but I do not like it 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.570
 the psuv tone that does not stop staying 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.540
 good lips here showy 2 balms 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.430
 this one of these ones 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.970
 this is what these are called 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.430
 I do not remember but hey it's over me 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.830
 I passed it and scraped 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.800
 and I was surprised I thought I bought it in the 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.330
 jumbo cost me 1,500 pesos 3 dollars and 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.510
 I thought to make a barÃ§a like that 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.460
 difficult to extend medium hard but 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.840
 super soft really that treats me 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.960
 of the lips and I like it a lot so 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.450
 maybe I'll buy it again 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.520
 another that ends is this that is of the 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.060
 sad mark 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.190
 and the smell is rich but none of the 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.620
 three that came I feel like I hydrated and 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.170
 apart they are as hard then I do not know 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.820
 it has good on the lip and I do not like 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.200
 feeling like half goop so 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.200
 I am I would not buy it again 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.140
 another thing that ends this leftover 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.819
 garnier and the video clarify want that 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.090
 Always used until they 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.250
 I said lent me leave 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.959
 and that's so I would not buy it again 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.360
 because I already have another one that if it serves me 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.010
 but I liked it a lot because not better 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.200
 I said the armpits and that I got caught 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.730
 with these plate and these machines that 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.250
 they are with hair by hair and this makes 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.920
 it occurs to you with a little armpits and 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.480
 with this it did not happen so in that 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.560
 meaning is good but I would not go back to 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.019
 buy for the fact that now I 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.629
 abandon a bis support tabs 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.150
 I finished the colossal that you already know is 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:12.330
 my favorite mask of life and that already 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.000
 I have two more spare parts and it fascinates me 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.230
 I think that an excellent way if it's a 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.270
 water test will not lower the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.050
 eyelashes always ask me what mask 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.840
 I recomend you 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.640
 it's at first I did not like it very much but 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.500
 I kind of felt like grabbing the 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.810
 technique the best way to apply it and 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.000
 all of that so it's thing like 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.550
 grab the thread to the application or to 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.460
 what's best for you and all that and good 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.710
 I would go all and all know and I 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.200
 love 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:45.160
 another thing that I will not continue using is this 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.410
 ryan braun of that that good part that 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.900
 It's filthy but I use it only 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:54.550
 in me it does not fix my eyelashes or the 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.870
 the eyebrows of the eyelashes lower them 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.940
 therefore it does not help me to do it 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.100
 natural either 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.700
 and it takes a lot very much 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.770
 very much in drying or is it fixed but 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.500
 already when they are already fixed after a 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.440
 while you feel you put in common like that 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.820
 if my students layer so I do not like 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.410
 today I am testing the ebook that I will 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.360
 much better than this one 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.070
 another thing that fits was also the 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.930
 neutrogena makeup remover that already 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.970
 I have another one also fascinates me back 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.050
 to buy of course and what can 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.450
 find generally in all 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.900
 pharmacies here in supermarkets and 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.370
 those things and I love bouquet of all the 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.150
 makeup and it does not irritate my eyes nor 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.100
 none of that and super also this cream 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.100
 Garnier is in the form of huevito this 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.960
 it's for mixed fat skin and not the 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.120
 I would buy again because I feel that 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.720
 I moisturizes the skin by rubbing me 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.480
 I get very far from lejitos 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.450
 which is not pretty is not very comfortable 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.530
 finish using it at night 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.000
 before sleep and good and good was the 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.680
 only way that you can finish 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.900
 use it and that form was recommended to me 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.190
 nati from porsche land olc I think your 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.340
 channel leaves him in the Box 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.400
 information and so that's how I end up 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.110
 use it but we did not like anything else 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.940
 also that already issued as a 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.610
 application is the micellar water of vichy 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.580
 I already said it fascinates me I would return to 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.140
 buy yes but since I have other tonics 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.260
 I want to finish earlier because this 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.060
 I use as a tonic more than anything has been 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.640
 finished the tonics that I have and then 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.810
 go back to buy it but I love super 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.040
 soft removes super long as the 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.500
 excess makeup or the rest 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.300
 after I applied makeup 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.460
 micellar water and I finished taking out what 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.460
 that's how cool 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.240
 and finally these are max powders 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.480
 just preset selection that they have left a 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:55.370
 I'm still trying to 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:58.070
 use is that picadillo are very 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.840
 good they make the tone in that 30 already 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.480
 I have others already are also 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.580
 with the giant hole down so I'll see 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.920
 if I get well then and I really like 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.990
 because they are a part are not translucent 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.460
 but they are super light then with the 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.960
 makeup bases or I had a 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.450
 Unclear for example I lived with 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.910
 my partner the super super skin tone 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.440
 super good so I like them too 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.970
 a lot and I would also repeat them 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.460
 although I already have another type of using 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.630
 and good guys and girls that was the video 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.000
 of the finished 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.130
 I hope telling more things and follow 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.450
 making this video so if they want 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.730
