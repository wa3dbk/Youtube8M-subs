00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:21.140
 photography today is extremely 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.900
 widespread especially for the advent of 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.240
 digital 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.810
 practically everyone even takes pictures with 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.810
 phone 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:40.250
 however the photographs have a purpose 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.010
 photographs are always taken for each 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.110
 opportunity of life 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:52.010
 the growth of children travel with the 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:56.120
 family events are photographed 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.980
 to which we assist is photographing all that 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.980
 that happens to us and that we want to photograph 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:13.060
 these are the most common purposes and more 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:15.670
 then there is another category a 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.300
 part of the professional ones that don't 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.300
 interest 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:31.890
 there is another category of photographs and 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:37.860
 that's what amateur photographers do 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:43.250
 dedication to amateur photography is to 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.250
 search for an aesthetic photograph 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.940
 that says something that at least is 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.320
 nice to be nice though sometimes 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.070
 dramatic in certain situations that 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.070
 they can happen 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:10.740
 the photograph of the amateur photographer is 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:15.930
 especially a photograph of 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:22.890
 aesthetic amateurs i 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:27.870
 amateur photographers know that photographing for 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:34.530
 its for their aesthetic purposes have 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:38.000
 need to follow certain rules though 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:44.130
 sometimes they can be ignored 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:49.130
 or they need to follow all 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:52.320
 a series of teachings visions by 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:56.480
 considerations on the images because 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:02.570
 these are the most pleasing possible 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:07.170

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:11.060
