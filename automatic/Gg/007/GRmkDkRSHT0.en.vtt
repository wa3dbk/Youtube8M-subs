00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:12.610
 Tell me about your dreams 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.610
 I dream people 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.449
 there is this girl in a red 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.599
 Dress also looks the labile most elaborate 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.830
 wait until 10 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.720
 what happens to the girl in that 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.380
 dream 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.380
 I do not know that anymore 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.730
 there is one in every crime story 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:33.460
 psychological component but so in 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.140
 as a core topic of a series too 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.730
 I find it very interesting to install 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.170
 that can not be our people 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.650
 So know a celebrity on his 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.809
 area 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.269
 we are cut short not painted 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.110
 barely make-up little jewelry reasonably 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.900
 practical clock 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.220
 I would say she was average 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.290
 or a bit above average 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.129
 Smart then turns out that 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.800
 peculiar in this murder case 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.290
 parallel to one of his 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.920
 patients with whom he works the 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.239
 psychiatrist gradually realizes that 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.379
 the whole story with himself 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.460
 he does and he will be there himself 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.990
 Being pulled in is also possible 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.280
 suspect they killed her 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.750
 you knowingly have information 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.250
 held back and then they wanted it 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.630
 Push one of her patient shoes 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.729
 they are not a good light 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.770
 They should do their job ordinary 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.780
 I do not want ours 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.049
 Family may use every bass 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.150
 becomes 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.830
 Of course, the attraction is that 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.110
 We try the spirit of the template too 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.850
 meet it in the highly exciting books and 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.150
 I can only hope that will 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.190
 reasonably meet lisa is dead 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.720
 somebody wants to ride me in as 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.910
 you have read the book we have 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.560
 instantly reminds us just remembered 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.600
 film the ones we big with 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.490
 have become good thriller the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.490
 to have a strong emotion too 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.450
 You really do not remember
