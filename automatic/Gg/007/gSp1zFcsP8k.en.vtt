00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:56.160
 do not surprise 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.440
 we will do the beating work 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.699
 square root so talent will be called 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.129
 cigars and simple with your team that has 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.690
 found the name that's it with them it's 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:25.740
 a little tender handsome brother cain break 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:27.479
 tries to impose his titles treated well 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.100
 very well to do an interview at 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.229
 figaro this morning on hit radio so we 're going 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.060
 do the square root of everything and it 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.040
 was titles that are on the album this is 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.790
 to say we will do for example if the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.409
 title you did 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.820
 it's two minutes 52 we're going and that's 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.860
 approximately that I do not leave 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.649
 each title mr the dallara if khaled the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.210
 duration of the title I do not know how much 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.100
 are busy with cigarettes from his accounts 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.100
 of two minutes 52 seconds of you have 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.990
 did you do it that's it effect 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.990
 2052 effect two minutes 52 exactly 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.370
 obviously we are not far 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.010
 in fact what we want to do is that you 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.510
 did you give me square root that 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.400
 you tell me about the title why a little 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.180
 the title story and why present 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.180
 a fact it was 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.540
 so low 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.680
 I 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.680
 I would like to do you 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.000
 stupor 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.910
 also no 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:46.150
 the racing and TAF is too thin and it 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:47.440
 this is the case of relapse there is well 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.920
 to roll for problem start there 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.960
 must go out 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.340
 and then finally as it is when 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.100
 even my friend the guy who is doing publish 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.570
 to go out to have fun but at one point he 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.790
 will come back to reality because your 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.410
 mother the sus tt everyone will come 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.180
 this one you come back no reality 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.800
 so it's a little bit against the foot 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.950
 it's me remember me I'm not starting 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:13.300
 it's time united time to think 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:16.530
 it's actually a lot of these instruments 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.030
 lately but it's also so 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.340
 addition can be dangerous and when 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.680
 we're going out too dangerous and all of us never 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:29.770
 going out did not know how to have fun at least 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.720
 force the 70-year-old company to let go 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.290
 and then think of something else I think 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.910
 that I never think it can we 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.190
 go crazy too I think it takes a 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.880
 just friends of the ventoux ok the root 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.880
 square of dad with tea 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:53.730
 wow, where are you dead? 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.440
 fatherhood is that paternity on 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.520
 the little bath that is not much like 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.220
 they are not talking since they are in 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.050
 contact with the time that pirates get 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.390
 are also told that his daddy access him 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.100
 to do one's best and that 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.950
 today is no longer there and who is going 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.430
 grow and tell yourself that it's doing 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.020
 of his competent that the shrink is 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.540
 happy or not happy in any case he 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.010
 be normal and yannick and get 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.810
 would remember to do for his senses 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.760
 offspring and all this work is going to us 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.130
 blame his level helped me to us 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.420
 to reproduce a bad father a moment 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.760
 and he needs 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.470
 we put them in place and that's it 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.730
 is called the Bible 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.350
 the radical will interview if carey this 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.240
 morning very tight series the explanation of 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.080
 stromae by himself from his album the 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.080
 bastard square root 

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:50.909
 I think a real question 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.409
 that he supposed from what I am a 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.419
 I'm not a diplomat 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:58.080
 I basically think of nature who 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.469
 command and my question ie is 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.029
 what the diplomat is better than 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:04.949
 the extremism in question so she 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:08.399
 writing to request that then choose 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.409
 Benoît and count back with us on 

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:13.889
 the health issue we need to know 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.939
 nothing at the same time anyone who 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.179
 is never self - evident it is not 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.860
 better 

00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:18.929
 so basically actually me they do the guy 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.659
 who does that m choice and who is not 

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:23.759
 any extremism finally not better than 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:25.829
 the extremist between and roughly that of 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:28.110
 more cowardly than him a reflection by 

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:30.119
 week right now so there is no 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.309
 solution obviously it's just that you 

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:35.749
 have just middle as of the root 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:35.749
 square of abc looks 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.939
 gold 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.939
 but so many years 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.100
 one to do 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.100
 I dunno 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:59.280
 the author opens his fans of the loan 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:01.620
 above glass and modestly I hope 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.630
 enough modesty I had to pay homage 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.630
 I think I could not be more 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.860
 modest heart be alone woman hide 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.390
 completely mythomaniac who think that 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.790
 who thinks he has a love affair at 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.910
 day with the square root of all 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.910
 same 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:38.220
 in the same way it is the chain 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:41.010
 access a glamorous couple and is not two 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:45.090
 there is the cliché on both sides it's a 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:47.640
 guy is ridiculous actually very 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.250
 closed that ridiculous a 6-10 that actually 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:54.150
 it's love love and six to be 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.770
 love ridiculous defends m height 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.040
 ridicule 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:01.230
 ok the square root of stromae interview 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.300
 know the titles explained by stromae the 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.250
 square root of formidable just after 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.140
 formidable now integrates it first 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.380
 to the radio hit you stay with us this 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.380
 job
