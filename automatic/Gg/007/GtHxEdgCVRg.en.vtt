00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
hey guys what's up I got something that

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.349 
hey guys what's up I got something that
I<00:00:03.570> think's<00:00:03.780> I<00:00:03.899> think<00:00:04.080> is<00:00:04.170> really<00:00:04.650> cool<00:00:05.359> really

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
I think's I think is really cool really

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.330 
I think's I think is really cool really
excited<00:00:06.720> about<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:07.049> but<00:00:07.230> I'll<00:00:08.010> start<00:00:08.220> it

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
excited about this but I'll start it

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.120 
excited about this but I'll start it
going<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:09.440> so<00:00:10.440> if<00:00:10.500> you<00:00:10.590> remember<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> while<00:00:11.099> ago

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
going and so if you remember a while ago

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.720 
going and so if you remember a while ago
I<00:00:11.400> found<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:12.000> way<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.509> move<00:00:13.320> rails<00:00:13.590> on<00:00:13.950> slime

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
I found a way to move rails on slime

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.320 
I found a way to move rails on slime
blocks<00:00:16.160> turns<00:00:17.160> turns<00:00:17.850> out<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.090> don't<00:00:18.240> really

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
blocks turns turns out you don't really

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.630 
blocks turns turns out you don't really
needed<00:00:18.630> zero<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.199> pulse<00:00:19.859> generator<00:00:20.250> or<00:00:20.490> well

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
needed zero to pulse generator or well

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.109 
needed zero to pulse generator or well
this<00:00:20.970> works<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.449> fine<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.529> well<00:00:22.710> but

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
this works just fine on this well but

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.630 
this works just fine on this well but
using<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.390> can<00:00:24.539> push<00:00:25.019> TNT<00:00:25.710> minecarts

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
using that you can push TNT minecarts

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.179 
using that you can push TNT minecarts
pretty<00:00:27.210> stable<00:00:27.510> II<00:00:27.779> on<00:00:28.260> applying<00:00:28.859> piston

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
pretty stable II on applying piston

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.560 
pretty stable II on applying piston
machine<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.550> let<00:00:29.580> me<00:00:29.730> start<00:00:29.910> up<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.269> here

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
machine so let me start up this here

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.690 
machine so let me start up this here
this<00:00:31.109> second<00:00:31.710> Vista<00:00:31.980> machine<00:00:32.279> because<00:00:32.489> this

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
this second Vista machine because this

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.580 
this second Vista machine because this
is<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.360> detonator<00:00:33.620> so<00:00:35.690> after<00:00:36.690> watching<00:00:36.870> cube

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
is the detonator so after watching cube

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.510 
is the detonator so after watching cube
hipsters<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> precision<00:00:38.760> bombing<00:00:39.059> video<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.520> was

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
hipsters a precision bombing video I was

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.010 
hipsters a precision bombing video I was
kind<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> started<00:00:42.329> thinking<00:00:42.450> about<00:00:42.840> how<00:00:42.989> I

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
kind of started thinking about how I

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.810 
kind of started thinking about how I
could<00:00:43.200> use<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.040> kind<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.309> make<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.610> same

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
could use this to kind of make the same

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.110 
could use this to kind of make the same
sort<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.149> thing<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:47.100> that's<00:00:47.610> exactly<00:00:47.850> what

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
sort of thing and that's exactly what

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.279 
sort of thing and that's exactly what
I'm<00:00:48.239> showing<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.570> right<00:00:48.690> now<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.140> these

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
I'm showing you right now so these

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.810 
I'm showing you right now so these
craters<00:00:49.710> right<00:00:49.890> here<00:00:50.070> were<00:00:50.190> some<00:00:50.340> test<00:00:50.579> runs

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
craters right here were some test runs

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.500 
craters right here were some test runs
that<00:00:51.090> were<00:00:51.270> made<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:52.460> 256<00:00:53.460> TNT<00:00:53.910> minecarts<00:00:54.360> in

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
that were made with 256 TNT minecarts in

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.819 
that were made with 256 TNT minecarts in
there<00:00:54.860> right<00:00:55.860> now<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.360> 512<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.829> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
there right now I have 512 so the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.260 
there right now I have 512 so the
explosion<00:00:59.219> may<00:00:59.309> not<00:00:59.489> get<00:00:59.640> much<00:00:59.789> bigger<00:00:59.969> but

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
explosion may not get much bigger but

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.459 
explosion may not get much bigger but
I'm<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.510> kind<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.750> pushing<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.079> limits<00:01:01.410> here

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
I'm just kind of pushing the limits here

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.039 
I'm just kind of pushing the limits here
also<00:01:01.730> so<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> reason<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.270> really<00:01:03.600> just

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
also so the reason that I really just

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.260 
also so the reason that I really just
like<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.409> design<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.610> now<00:01:05.760> put<00:01:06.060> an

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
like this design is you can now put an

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.149 
like this design is you can now put an
infinite<00:01:07.049> amount<00:01:07.170> well<00:01:07.799> theoretically

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
infinite amount well theoretically

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
infinite amount well theoretically
infinite<00:01:08.760> obviously<00:01:09.299> there's<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.570> pretty

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
infinite obviously there's a pretty

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.380 
infinite obviously there's a pretty
there's<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.500> limit<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:10.860> amount<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.729> tnt<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.299> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
there's a limit but amount of tnt in a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.249 
there's a limit but amount of tnt in a
finite<00:01:12.750> space<00:01:13.020> there<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.100> goes<00:01:14.869> now<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.080> will

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
finite space there it goes now that will

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.899 
finite space there it goes now that will
stay<00:01:16.470> there<00:01:16.619> for<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> second<00:01:17.189> until<00:01:17.549> yeah<00:01:17.759> it

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
stay there for a second until yeah it

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.399 
stay there for a second until yeah it
gets<00:01:18.060> pushed<00:01:18.299> forward<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.200> then

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
gets pushed forward like that and then

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.940 
gets pushed forward like that and then
when<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.650> hits<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.920> ground<00:01:20.100> oh<00:01:21.770> please<00:01:22.770> don't

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
when it hits the ground oh please don't

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.350 
when it hits the ground oh please don't
crash<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:27.080> there<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.229> go<00:01:28.409> umm<00:01:29.060> decently<00:01:30.060> sized

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
crash and there we go umm decently sized

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.170 
crash and there we go umm decently sized
crater<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:31.520> still<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:32.820> kind<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
crater but still it's just kind of the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.210 
crater but still it's just kind of the
theory<00:01:33.390> behind<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.320> push

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
theory behind this that we can push

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.520 
theory behind this that we can push
minecarts<00:01:35.759> now<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.150> yeah<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.200> want<00:01:37.470> to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
minecarts now and yeah I just want to

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.870 
minecarts now and yeah I just want to
show<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.710> guys<00:01:37.770> they<00:01:37.979> actually<00:01:38.009> successfully

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
show you guys they actually successfully

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.429 
show you guys they actually successfully
made<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:40.579> just<00:01:41.579> kind<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.060> TNT<00:01:42.750> minecart

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
made a just kind of a TNT minecart

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.260 
made a just kind of a TNT minecart
Balmer<00:01:43.799> system<00:01:45.619> yeah<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:46.860> that's<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.310> pretty

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
Balmer system yeah but that's a pretty

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.480 
Balmer system yeah but that's a pretty
much<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.920> prototype<00:01:50.130> it's

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
much it this is just a prototype it's

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.679 
much it this is just a prototype it's
not<00:01:50.640> done<00:01:50.790> yet<00:01:50.820> because<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.240> does<00:01:51.390> sort<00:01:51.600> of

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
not done yet because it does sort of

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.039 
not done yet because it does sort of
leave<00:01:51.840> behind<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.350> little<00:01:53.250> shape<00:01:54.270> please

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
leave behind this little shape please

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.940 
leave behind this little shape please
don't<00:01:55.229> crash<00:01:57.229> alright<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.259> think<00:01:58.500> I'm<00:01:58.649> good

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
don't crash alright I think I'm good

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.770 
don't crash alright I think I'm good
sorry<00:01:59.189> about<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.490> low<00:01:59.579> frame<00:01:59.820> rate<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.240> yeah

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
sorry about the low frame rate but yeah

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.240 
sorry about the low frame rate but yeah
it<00:02:00.899> leaves<00:02:01.079> behind<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> want<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.070> fix

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
it leaves behind that so I want to fix

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.590 
it leaves behind that so I want to fix
it<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.729> takes<00:02:02.909> everything<00:02:03.240> along

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
it so that it takes everything along

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.359 
it so that it takes everything along
with<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.990> instead<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.950> leaving<00:02:05.219> something

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
with it instead of leaving something

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.990 
with it instead of leaving something
behind

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
behind

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.199 
behind
yeah<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.569> think<00:02:09.050> I<00:02:09.200> have<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.500> I'm<00:02:10.429> not<00:02:11.000> sure

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
yeah and I think I have a I'm not sure

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.369 
yeah and I think I have a I'm not sure
if<00:02:11.330> I'm<00:02:11.420> gonna<00:02:11.540> be<00:02:11.690> able<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.870> do<00:02:11.989> this<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.260> or

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
if I'm gonna be able to do this it or

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.080 
if I'm gonna be able to do this it or
not<00:02:12.500> but<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:12.650> think<00:02:12.920> I<00:02:13.010> have<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> system<00:02:13.730> in<00:02:13.940> my

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
not but I think I have a system in my

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.259 
not but I think I have a system in my
head<00:02:14.330> that<00:02:14.629> if<00:02:15.620> done<00:02:15.920> correctly<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:17.090> could

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
head that if done correctly you could

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.960 
head that if done correctly you could
have<00:02:17.480> multiple<00:02:17.840> TNT<00:02:20.620> TNT<00:02:21.620> minecart<00:02:22.280> kind<00:02:22.880> of

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
have multiple TNT TNT minecart kind of

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.059 
have multiple TNT TNT minecart kind of
nukes<00:02:23.209> on<00:02:23.390> one<00:02:23.810> piston<00:02:24.349> contraption<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:24.980> you

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
nukes on one piston contraption and you

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.890 
nukes on one piston contraption and you
can<00:02:25.220> send<00:02:25.400> multiple<00:02:25.580> detonators<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.450> set<00:02:26.810> off

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
can send multiple detonators and set off

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.050 
can send multiple detonators and set off
each<00:02:27.080> one<00:02:27.290> whenever<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.769> want<00:02:28.010> this<00:02:28.849> is<00:02:28.970> an
