it<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.680> possible<00:02:26.340> but<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.030> really<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:27.599> to

something also completely different is
the<00:02:55.650> blades<00:02:55.890> themselves<00:02:56.900> this<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:57.959> a<00:02:58.470> very

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
the blades themselves this is a very

the blades themselves this is a very

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
thin hollow grind and this is not this

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.620 
thin hollow grind and this is not this
blade<00:03:04.079> is<00:03:04.260> actually<00:03:04.440> pretty<00:03:04.860> chunky<00:03:05.450> far<00:03:06.450> as

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
blade is actually pretty chunky far as

how<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.470> grind<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.160> fairly<00:03:08.640> thick

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
how the grind is is fairly thick

you<00:03:13.200> see<00:03:13.530> on<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.709> market<00:03:14.069> but<00:03:15.680> this<00:03:16.680> knife

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
you see on the market but this knife

although<00:03:17.579> we<00:03:18.090> don't<00:03:18.269> know<00:03:18.389> the<00:03:18.660> still<00:03:18.959> for

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
sure they claim it's deep - it doesn't

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.800

gonna set these and I was down because

gonna set these and I was down because
my<00:03:35.850> bandanas<00:03:36.389> fixed<00:03:36.630> I'll<00:03:36.750> blow<00:03:36.930> off<00:03:36.980> but<00:03:37.980> this

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
my bandanas fixed I'll blow off but this

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.490 
my bandanas fixed I'll blow off but this
knife<00:03:38.400> is<00:03:38.700> just<00:03:38.970> so<00:03:39.150> much<00:03:39.329> thinner<00:03:39.750> than<00:03:40.079> this

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
knife is just so much thinner than this

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.190 
knife is just so much thinner than this
one<00:03:40.859> that<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:41.730> actually<00:03:41.970> slices<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.750> little<00:03:43.079> bit

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
snarf and so without this knife I would

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.200 
snarf and so without this knife I would
have<00:06:44.449> never<00:06:44.569> gotten<00:06:45.080> the<00:06:45.740> authentic<00:06:46.699> straddle

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
have never gotten the authentic straddle

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
so this to me is a jump off point from

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.600 
so this to me is a jump off point from
affordable<00:06:53.060> knives<00:06:53.240> into<00:06:53.719> luxury<00:06:53.900> knives<00:06:54.610> so

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610 
affordable knives into luxury knives so

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.290 
affordable knives into luxury knives so
that's<00:06:56.419> my<00:06:56.930> viewpoints<00:06:57.590> on<00:06:57.770> it<00:06:57.949> yes<00:06:58.849> or<00:06:59.120> some

that's my viewpoints on it yes or some

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.119 
that's my viewpoints on it yes or some
major<00:06:59.539> quality<00:07:00.169> differences<00:07:00.620> between<00:07:00.830> the

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:01.129 
major quality differences between the

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:06.689 
major quality differences between the
two<00:07:01.280> knives<00:07:01.490> and<00:07:03.490> you<00:07:04.490> might<00:07:04.669> have<00:07:04.819> some

what's it called you might have some
real<00:07:10.310> qualms<00:07:11.300> about<00:07:11.509> this<00:07:11.930> being<00:07:12.199> a

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 
real qualms about this being a

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:13.600 
real qualms about this being a
counterfeit<00:07:12.860> you<00:07:13.039> don't<00:07:13.250> want<00:07:13.430> to<00:07:13.490> support

counter<00:07:14.180> fiddles<00:07:14.509> I<00:07:14.750> completely<00:07:16.810> I<00:07:17.810> see<00:07:18.529> that

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.770 
point but I'm just saying this could be

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.740 
point but I'm just saying this could be
a<00:07:21.800> jumping-off<00:07:22.340> point<00:07:22.669> for<00:07:22.729> you<00:07:23.060> and<00:07:23.270> it's<00:07:23.659> a
