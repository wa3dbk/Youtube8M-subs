00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:04.490
 success of a small beam of central engine of the car without hurting the 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.430
 driver 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.940
 the concern is that the assembly is almost a hundred times more powerful than 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.940
 Electric Chair 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.529
 a non-lethal weapon of directed energy that the attempt 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.769
 approve it for the first time on television 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.539
 of these electrodes accumulate a fall of 175 thousand volts 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.790
 if everything goes well when the truck passed at full speed 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.030
 a small beam hit the vehicle 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.220
 logís overload of the electrical system as a circuit that is overloaded in 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.120
 a house 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.870
 flee to the circuit system of the car and that will have the truck completely 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.060
 activated 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.100
 disabled 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.960
 well the car stopped working but I'm fine I did not feel anything because I was 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.900
 fully protected 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.740
 in the future I imagine that this type of system will be more portable with a 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.430
 greater scope and more controllable imagine that there will be in a pocket or that 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.020
 will build inside a cell phone 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.400
 lasers and electricity are not the only sources of energy that 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.420
 can be used as weapons there is another the energy used in a common apparatus of 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.280
 the kitchen that allows you to pop popcorn by heating the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.820
 remains of food in just a matter of seconds 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.000
 the microwave Owen 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.480
 In the future it will not be impossible to use microwaves in handguns and even in 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.260
 bombs and their effects could be even more devastating than those of 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.170
 pleasures 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.350
 a microwave handgun could burn a person inside 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.670
 a super microwave cougar could cause a technological goal or rubber 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.520
 would defend all vehicles radios televisions and computers 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.520
 and submerged yet whole country in chaos 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.499
 the doctor rondín group to which is the director of the plasma laboratory 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:16.099
 pulsed energy and microwave from the university of michigan and has been 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.279
 working with microwaves for more than 30 years 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:23.189
 we are in the plasma laboratory the accused energy the micro 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.099
 those from the michigan university in this lab we investigated the 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.840
 relativist evildoers who generate 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.430
 high-powered microwave heroes high-power microwaves are 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.170
 used of course to cook food in their microwave ovens these 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.580
 microwaves can interfere with communications in their homes as well as 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.200
 with military equipment so there is a great interest in creating bridges 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.850
 Very high power microwave 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.900
 like this relativistic magnetron that equals half a million of its furnaces 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.549
 microwave oven 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.739
 that power is enough to generate short circuits in computers that 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.569
 they control all facets of modern warfare 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.739
 from radar communications to missile launches and for 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.469
 curl an entire military operation 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.599
 this is another reason why they are asked to turn off their phones 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.629
 Cell phones during flights 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.819
 there is a risk that the frequencies released by your phones may 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.479
 interfere with airplane controls 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:22.649
 the Chinese doctor will want or a small-scale experiment to 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:24.379
 demonstrate this 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.059
 will destroy a wristwatch with a lot of microwaves 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.650
 We prepared a small demonstration experiment in which a generator 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.260
 ultra wide band which equals approximately one thousand of its ovens 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.769
 microwave generates a pulse of a plan or seconds of ultra band radiation 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:42.250
 wide 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.560
 We will show that high frequency and high power electric fields 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.560
 can affect the operation of digital electronic products 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.029
 like the taste of the dictator pin 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:55.449
 Microwaves can also affect the circuitry of a vehicle 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.939
 a microwave burst would cause an impulse shock wave 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.769
 electric that would pass at full speed through the air 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.879
 and it would generate a voltage surge that would destroy the circuits this is 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.989
 great importance for the scientific research office of the 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.560
 air force and for other departments of defense agencies 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.739
 since the electronic systems of their weapons could be damaged 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.739
 enemies could save our soldiers 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.979
 the doctor piero alva who is ready 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.080
 if everything goes as planned the microwave boost should affect the system 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.669
 circuits of the clock and destroy the programmed information of its interior 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.689
 the tension of the machine 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:40.489
 even when it is imperceptible to the naked eye this clock is being pombar 

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:43.489
 microwaves equivalent to one thousand per two microwaves 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.669
 instantly the information of it is totally eliminated 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.030
 now imagine the damage that could be caused by a thousand microwave burst 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.230
 times more powerful 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.230
 that was detonated over the United States 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:07.829
 in an instant all the electronic systems of the country would be turned off 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.469
 It would be like taking the country back to the 19th century 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.270
 the results would be terrible 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.770
 as our electronic systems become more 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:22.870
 sophisticated 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.870
 they also become more vulnerable to this type of attack 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.099
 and the army is developing a weapon that can do it 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.199
 the electromagnetic bomb om combat 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.680
 ap some kind of weapon that is developing and that would be
