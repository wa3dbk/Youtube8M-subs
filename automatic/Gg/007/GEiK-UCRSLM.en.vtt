00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.400
 10.4 from minecraft and pocket edition as well 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.200
 is that I'm apologizing 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.520
 half stranger why if I just got 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.020
 raise that in this study point of 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.640
 to leave friendship my to see is no but 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.980
 but good to me because I ran into this 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.989
 landmark monitor that checking there are a few 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.340
 how many forms of minecraft then 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.960
 well, it's been a long time since he's a tribune 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.640
 and I did not want to miss the 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.620
 opportunity to bring a machito 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.969
 more not anymore for this new version of 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.280
 pocket edition if it has brought you many 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.629
 mods meats is because you already know that I 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.359
 I like to bring the ones that really 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.500
 worth it and more than anything those who 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:46.390
 be new because there are 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.760
 many many but that are of those of 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.410
 the version passed to 0.9 point 5 and that 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.059
 are compatible with this one 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.920
 You can check that you are one 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.719
 but good to welcome you to this 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.370
 is the review of the camera mode 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.530
 security or that is very very interesting 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.489
 the truth then is not the 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.830
 installation is based on a url without a 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.479
 url what I am a link that has 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.070
 you who copy and paste back me 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.310
 will show how they look check if here 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.649
 down 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.229
 you already know that they have to download what is 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.329
 the forum this would be the other one that says 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.220
 this one that says minecraft forum this 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.390
 footwear is sometimes they are originally or 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.729
 that what they have to do is look for the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.549
 link that says download that is an athlon 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.110
 of light that is this blue 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.729
 any shape orita with super magic 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.750
 of the cursor I deduced to indicate what is this 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.280
 then you do not have to touch it to 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.810
 she know they have to wait 5 seconds 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.729
 when the advertising happens, they accept 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.100
 advertising and this will look like this 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.840
 link that is stealing point websites is that 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.360
 that you have to copy ok they give you in 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.860
 copy then and they will paste it where 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.539
 we're going to hit it good because you already know or 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.610
 on the blog what for anything he 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.080
 and I do not know how luckily we taught him 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.179
 they go and obviously the keys are going to go 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.840
 to launcher blog options and they will go 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.009
 to the part where the mods are not 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.569
 they are going to give him in import and they are going to give him 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.250
 in web address ok does not do as 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.229
 We 're not doing anything in web address 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.909
 they will hit him and the only thing they have to 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.009
 to be you is to accept simple not 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.299
 remember that link of the fly o 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.220
 that you will do the the fla and 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.780
 church appears in the part of shane 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.459
 pure command letters is the one that 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.989
 they have to copy in any way that 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.430
 Anyway, I 'm going to leave you the 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.709
 forum link and see them 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.420
 rich chicken link that is the way that 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.519
 for you and decide if you want to go to 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.140
 support with a visit of how you guys 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.989
 then want then good once 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.150
 installed does not require textures only 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.590
 it's this to the sketch and textures 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.730
 but they are downloaded via the Internet or not 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.889
 it is very necessary as you can see 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.510
 I bring here the one that I always use pixie 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:37.090
 and those are the security cameras ok 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.620
 then you subscribe to others 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.329
 we show simply I'm going to show you 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.590
 where I have security cameras for 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.540
 that you since you are not in the house 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.730
 one that the crops in fact like that the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.129
 call you can name them typical that you 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.810
 speak with you are recording good ya aviv 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.849
 in the edition I put a marquita there 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.609
 or something so that it does not look and here I have 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.730
 another in the state of the sheep ok 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:03:02.109
 Well then, why do not you fuck me? 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.519
 stop talking our ok then they 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.900
 I said I do not have three different schemes 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.480
 of test I will teach what are nodes 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.060
 things do not stop to be able to capture 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.880
 we simply require stone 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.500
 we require this redstone thing and 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.510
 crystals ok us 10 simple we're going to 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.459
 create the cameras that we want 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.770
 or that already simple the cameras that 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.020
 we want to 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.819
 crafter us and we're also this one 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.030
 is the city monitor that as you can see 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.620
 they are 77 stone a network are and a 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.599
 a crystal or that the crystal is 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.300
 complete that is to shrink all the 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.489
 in the cameras 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.230
 then let's see let's make the day 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.489
 the camera because I'm going to put it there 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.980
 down this is the map with a little on 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.299
 green is the one on the way to the 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.090
 dragon ok that way they made me the 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.680
 please carry then do not go 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.150
 to go to the bottom of the trap 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.709
 so they can see that it's a lot of distance 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.840
 that you can go to has put 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.030
 where you crave today and what 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.640
 It is like the map of fight night sad 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.900
 freddy remember 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.370
 as everyone knows this game because you know 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.650
 is shrinking the security beds 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.720
 something like this works that what for 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.400
 that more or less give an idea of ​​how 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.810
 may be let's put here is the 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.250
 side channels and I tell them you can name 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.660
 the cameras made that web or that the 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.590
 you have to name with the code 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.940
 diagonal cctv this space name ok and 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.440
 after the name you are going to put the name 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.359
 We are going to check meat for a long time because 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.920
 some strange reason does not let me write 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.450
 when I'm recording in this way, 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.000
 then let me write right now that 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.680
 that there is the genesis form we come back 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.090
 ban and they will notice and good channels 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.010
 after trying to try I realized 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.720
 that would not let me write with my tablet 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.850
 but yes with the keyboard then good 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.130
 let's put diagonal cctv remember 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.460
 this as soon as you put a camera 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.870
 channel cctv space name space the one 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.950
 you want u in this case we are going to 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.050
 put a trap 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.730
 it goes simple then to see that is the 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.720
 code 3 can put a camera always 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.950
 is going to ask for a name is what 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.680
 they have to put in any way and they 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.300
 notes as non-diagonal cctv space 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.010
 name space the name you want 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.450
 so then the camera is good 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.590
 was named as a cheat because we're going to 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.040
 come up again to see how 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.740
 there is the game here 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.630
 he was cool I'm the truth not 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.130
 it works as much as a teleporter 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.289
 because then you're in a 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.300
 teleporter you can not move there 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.439
 simple, the only thing he does is 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.080
 it's just that you can see that 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:16.719
 section of your map then it is very very 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.979
 well the truth told them to fade 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:19.629
 how it works you have to have this in 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.300
 the hand that is the control you have to 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:23.830
 tap the floor with that tv monitor 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.719
 you are going to touch the floor and you 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.369
 this menu will appear that as you can see 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:29.110
 there are the cameras that you have 

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:31.119
 sheep farming almost trap right now 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.039
 let's give this some of these things 

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:35.259
 they are left there will transport you to the 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.149
 sheep as you can see it's not that you 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.919
 teleportation itself because you are the 

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:40.719
 cube as you can see you're done more 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.099
 small that the sheep do is be that 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.110
 boats what will end with google 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:46.330
 minecraft and in fact to be able to leave you 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.699
 of this part of this camera mode or 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.849
 of this camera neither two options can you 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:54.520
 put diagonal cst cctv you bird 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:56.169
 ok so how can this lead or can it be 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.839
 touch through with the monitor to the floor and 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.520
 Put gay sex simple and see ladies 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:01.719
 Camarasa brings you back to the point where you 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.979
 you were originally 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.119
 now let's check the crop as 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.939
 it can be the same gives you the option of 

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:08.319
 diagonal cctv the leit or gives you the option 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:11.080
 also that you give him the same 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.879
 with the monitor, you put whoever 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.409
 you say camera and the moment you give him 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:16.539
 there he will come back again then 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:17.860
 here we go to the house ok so that 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:21.219
 you see the different points of 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.139
 views the prospects then I was 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:24.669
 very interesting or is it cool me the 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.580
 I have the little boy beat me not that I've seen 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.929
 something so so provech then well 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.369
 I think it 's interesting, I never know 

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:31.749
 had brought here to the canal then 

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:33.459
 there is here is new here is the 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:35.619
 trap that we just put and remember 

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:37.269
 to follow slave disk amerite greens 

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:39.969
 now the original point where you were 

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:42.729
