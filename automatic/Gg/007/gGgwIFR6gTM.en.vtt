00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 after several days of investigations to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.820
 civil police officer arrested in the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.519

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.519
 accused of killing ala that would be one of 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.189
 suspected of murdering fÃ¡bio the sukkah 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.019
 his participation in the assassination of the allen 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.949
 refuses to say anything worried has 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.649
 something to do with this 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.880
 recognition with this issue quit 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.870
 I will not talk 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.329
 no one in the sense that the culprit does not 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.870
 He was arrested because he knows the case of 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.870
 homicide 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.969
 and you as you planned everything is 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.980
 civilian police believes that the 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.340
 crime may have been for reckoning 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.280
 drug but does not rule out the connection 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.500
 crimes to the name but we already knew the people 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.170
 so much that he had already been sentenced 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.780
 this warrant was fulfilled yesterday 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.820
 now this crime this prison has a 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:15.240
 relationship with the rational of the antonio 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.880
 in principle not the relationship is not 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.580
 by some possibilities of 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.830
 involvement with others beyond the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.830
 Yesterday's own prisoner 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.430
 This guy was arrested and he's the cousin of the case. 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.079
 it is cousin the same family can 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.430
 there is a connection of the fan through 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.200
 investigations, the civilian police 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.869
 to reach this conclusion, it is possible that 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.150
 so that they may have passages through 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.540
 good police officer he already has one 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.780
 I was already in contact with 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.350
 other people who were trafficking is 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.950
 has a great deal of knowledge in the month 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.049
 I criminal then we have to do 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.590
 a more appropriate analysis in relation to 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.030
 he 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.650
 the investigations do not stop here 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.979
 continued to be able to elucidate the cases 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.810
 investigations are continuing as always 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.990
 prison itself does not conclude 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.840
 imprisonment investigation in this case because 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.260
 a temporary prison it helps 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.660
 investigation, it may be extended if 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.940
 necessary or otherwise transformed 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.280
 in custody in the case the boy 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.959
 confesses the crime doctorate or naouri denies 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.010
 well he keeps silent and is 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.000
 probably should be waiting 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.000
 counseling counseling
