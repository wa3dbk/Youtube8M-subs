 just the type of his paraderolle 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.180
 and the reason why he first ranking 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.020
 but it is without if and 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.900
 but Captain Jack Sparrow has been around 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.280

 purely pulling there placed still lures 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.310
 square we lure rock square four on the 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.270
 fourth place is already guessed 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.060

 acting career with the 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.680

 situation we do not lean too far 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.530
 out of the window when we say that 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.930

 no matter how jittery and crappy his 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.150
