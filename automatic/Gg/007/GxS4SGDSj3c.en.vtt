00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.530 
okay the tricky part is you still have
to<00:03:46.019> hold<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.500> red<00:03:46.799> so<00:03:47.129> it<00:03:47.250> doesn't<00:03:47.609> come<00:03:47.819> come

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
to hold this red so it doesn't come come

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
to hold this red so it doesn't come come
loose<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:49.019> just<00:03:49.200> what<00:03:49.890> I<00:03:49.920> do<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.370> just<00:03:50.670> tuck<00:03:50.909> it

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
loose so just what I do I just tuck it

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.339 
loose so just what I do I just tuck it
underneath<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:52.859> finger<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.640> just<00:03:53.849> holds

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
underneath this finger and it just holds

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.720 
underneath this finger and it just holds
okay<00:03:55.349> and<00:03:55.590> then<00:03:55.680> take<00:03:55.859> your<00:03:56.010> black<00:03:57.319> run<00:03:58.319> it<00:03:58.470> in

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
until it meets with the red okay and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.420 
until it meets with the red okay and
you're<00:04:15.120> gonna<00:04:15.239> have<00:04:15.419> something<00:04:15.840> coming<00:04:16.049> out
