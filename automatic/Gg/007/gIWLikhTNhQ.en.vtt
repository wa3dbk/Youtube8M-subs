00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.750 

I'm<00:00:01.079> going<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.439> show<00:00:01.589> you<00:00:01.650> a<00:00:01.770> way<00:00:02.040> that<00:00:02.070> you<00:00:02.429> can

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
I'm going to show you a way that you can

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.670 
I'm going to show you a way that you can
convert<00:00:03.149> just<00:00:03.360> about<00:00:03.600> any<00:00:03.870> stool<00:00:04.380> or<00:00:04.650> chair

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
convert just about any stool or chair

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.440 
convert just about any stool or chair
into<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.640> rubberband<00:00:06.420> catapult<00:00:07.910> this<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.120> very

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
into a rubberband catapult this is very

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.419 
into a rubberband catapult this is very
easy<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.809> accomplish<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.590> don't<00:00:11.280> need

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
easy to accomplish and you don't need

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.280 
easy to accomplish and you don't need
any<00:00:11.580> tools<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.509> pack<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.750> rubber<00:00:13.019> bands

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
any tools just a pack of rubber bands

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.540 
any tools just a pack of rubber bands
and<00:00:14.130> maybe<00:00:14.969> some<00:00:15.210> marshmallows

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.970 

a<00:00:19.609> stretch<00:00:20.420> rubber<00:00:20.720> band<00:00:20.960> is<00:00:21.109> a<00:00:21.140> storehouse<00:00:21.800> of

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
a stretch rubber band is a storehouse of

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.390 
a stretch rubber band is a storehouse of
potential<00:00:22.460> energy<00:00:23.050> when<00:00:24.050> it's<00:00:24.199> released<00:00:24.529> this

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
potential energy when it's released this

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.350 
potential energy when it's released this
energy<00:00:25.759> becomes<00:00:26.060> kinetic<00:00:26.150> energy

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.930 

so<00:00:31.020> if<00:00:31.380> potential<00:00:31.890> energy<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.310> stored<00:00:32.340> energy

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
so if potential energy is stored energy

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.620 
so if potential energy is stored energy
that's<00:00:33.390> ready<00:00:33.720> to<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.080> work<00:00:34.970> then<00:00:35.970> a<00:00:36.000> whole<00:00:36.300> bag

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
that's ready to do work then a whole bag

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.630 
that's ready to do work then a whole bag
of<00:00:36.660> rubber<00:00:37.110> bands<00:00:37.320> contains<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.890> whole<00:00:38.160> lot<00:00:38.460> of

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
of rubber bands contains a whole lot of

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.229 
of rubber bands contains a whole lot of
potential<00:00:39.059> Fund<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:41.550> only<00:00:41.760> technique<00:00:42.059> that

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
potential Fund the only technique that

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.910 
potential Fund the only technique that
you<00:00:42.390> need<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.660> understand<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.320> how<00:00:43.650> to<00:00:43.710> link

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
you need to understand is how to link

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.180 
you need to understand is how to link
two<00:00:44.070> rubber<00:00:44.280> bands<00:00:44.550> together<00:00:45.980> this<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.160> how

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
two rubber bands together this is how

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.799 
two rubber bands together this is how
we're<00:00:47.520> going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.820> make<00:00:47.970> just<00:00:48.000> about<00:00:48.390> all<00:00:48.750> of

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
we're going to make just about all of

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.970 
we're going to make just about all of
our<00:00:49.050> connections<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.850> watch<00:00:51.210> carefully

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.160 

okay<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:55.730> get<00:00:55.970> started<00:00:56.030> we<00:00:56.540> first<00:00:56.900> make<00:00:57.140> a

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
okay to get started we first make a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.500 
okay to get started we first make a
bundle<00:00:57.410> of<00:00:57.620> about<00:00:57.920> ten<00:00:58.190> rubber<00:00:58.430> bands<00:01:00.100> and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
bundle of about ten rubber bands and

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.360 
bundle of about ten rubber bands and
then<00:01:02.510> we<00:01:02.720> apply<00:01:02.990> our<00:01:03.020> connection<00:01:03.980> technique

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
then we apply our connection technique

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:15.090 
then we apply our connection technique
to<00:01:04.550> it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.070 

now<00:01:15.730> we<00:01:15.790> repeat<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.330> same<00:01:16.360> thing<00:01:16.780> on<00:01:16.930> the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
now we repeat the same thing on the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:27.990 
now we repeat the same thing on the
opposite<00:01:17.440> side

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.240 

and<00:01:28.360> we<00:01:28.780> do<00:01:28.930> it<00:01:29.020> on<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.260> left<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:29.770> right<00:01:29.980> sides

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
and we do it on the left and right sides

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.510 
and we do it on the left and right sides
as<00:01:30.490> well

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.880 

okay<00:01:38.210> now<00:01:38.479> we're<00:01:38.689> going<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:38.990> triple<00:01:39.290> each<00:01:39.649> of

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
okay now we're going to triple each of

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.600 
okay now we're going to triple each of
the<00:01:40.070> bands<00:01:40.430> on<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:40.700> legs<00:01:41.890> you<00:01:42.890> could<00:01:43.130> add<00:01:43.369> even

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
the bands on the legs you could add even

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.050 
the bands on the legs you could add even
more<00:01:43.759> to<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.420> if<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:45.110> want<00:01:45.320> more<00:01:45.409> resistance

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
more to it if you want more resistance

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.789 
more to it if you want more resistance
but<00:01:47.060> three<00:01:47.450> bands<00:01:47.720> on<00:01:47.840> each<00:01:48.049> can<00:01:48.380> launch<00:01:48.649> a

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
but three bands on each can launch a

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.279 
but three bands on each can launch a
marshmallow<00:01:49.310> pretty<00:01:49.790> well<00:01:52.570> again<00:01:53.570> we<00:01:53.990> repeat

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
marshmallow pretty well again we repeat

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.480 
marshmallow pretty well again we repeat
on<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.680> other<00:01:54.830> side<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:57.070> then<00:01:58.070> on<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.340> left

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
on the other side and then on the left

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.240 
on the other side and then on the left
and<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.820> right

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.340 

next<00:02:04.970> we're<00:02:05.120> going<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.360> lengthen<00:02:05.780> each<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.260> the

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
next we're going to lengthen each of the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.380 
next we're going to lengthen each of the
main<00:02:06.560> bands<00:02:06.980> by<00:02:07.130> adding<00:02:07.520> three<00:02:07.910> more<00:02:07.940> rubber

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
main bands by adding three more rubber

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:20.670 
main bands by adding three more rubber
bands<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.840> each<00:02:08.990> side

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.130 

if<00:02:21.159> you're<00:02:21.430> using<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.790> larger<00:02:22.030> chair<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.900> could

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
if you're using a larger chair you could

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.580 
if you're using a larger chair you could
make<00:02:23.409> the<00:02:23.530> chain<00:02:23.739> even<00:02:23.860> longer

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.979 

so<00:02:30.220> once<00:02:30.489> again<00:02:30.610> we<00:02:31.090> do<00:02:31.270> this<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.599> all<00:02:31.750> four

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
so once again we do this to all four

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.660 
so once again we do this to all four
sides

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.490 

for<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.420> bucket<00:02:36.690> in<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.900> center<00:02:37.319> an

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
for the bucket in the center an

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.290 
for the bucket in the center an
applesauce<00:02:38.460> cup<00:02:38.880> works<00:02:39.150> great

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.230 

and<00:02:42.840> on<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.320> side<00:02:43.620> note<00:02:43.650> these<00:02:44.310> also<00:02:44.670> work<00:02:45.000> with

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
and on a side note these also work with

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.720 
and on a side note these also work with
a<00:02:45.270> soup<00:02:45.570> can<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.960> provide<00:02:46.320> a<00:02:46.530> useful<00:02:46.980> stowaway

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
a soup can to provide a useful stowaway

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.980 
a soup can to provide a useful stowaway
for<00:02:48.000> all<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.180> your<00:02:48.330> leftover<00:02:48.660> rubberbands

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.260 

it<00:02:54.470> takes<00:02:54.830> four<00:02:55.220> more<00:02:55.520> rubber<00:02:55.790> bands<00:02:56.030> to

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
it takes four more rubber bands to

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.530 
it takes four more rubber bands to
attach<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.780> bucket<00:02:57.970> we<00:02:58.970> want<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.270> keep<00:02:59.390> it

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
attach the bucket we want to keep it

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:08.050 
attach the bucket we want to keep it
from<00:02:59.660> flying<00:03:00.020> out<00:03:00.260> with<00:03:00.560> every<00:03:00.830> shot

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.380 

it<00:03:08.569> helps<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.989> pre<00:03:09.200> stretch<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.650> rubber<00:03:09.770> band

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
it helps to pre stretch the rubber band

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.370 
it helps to pre stretch the rubber band
started<00:03:11.390> in<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.510> center<00:03:11.690> underneath<00:03:12.140> and

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
started in the center underneath and

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.530 
started in the center underneath and
stretch<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.190> all<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.459> way<00:03:13.550> around<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:14.060> top<00:03:14.270> on

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
stretch it all the way around the top on

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.190 
stretch it all the way around the top on
each<00:03:14.720> side

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.740 

do<00:03:19.770> this<00:03:19.950> four<00:03:20.280> times<00:03:20.750> alternating

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
do this four times alternating

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.970 
do this four times alternating
directions<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.349> that<00:03:22.500> they're<00:03:22.650> perpendicular

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
directions so that they're perpendicular

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.030 
directions so that they're perpendicular
to<00:03:23.340> one<00:03:23.610> another

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.260 

and<00:03:28.400> all<00:03:29.090> that's<00:03:29.299> left<00:03:29.390> is<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.840> test<00:03:30.200> it

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:49.729 

it<00:03:34.840> definitely<00:03:35.200> takes<00:03:35.710> some<00:03:35.920> practice

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.289 

but<00:03:50.739> I<00:03:50.769> found<00:03:51.159> that<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.459> got<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.670> little<00:03:52.030> better

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
but I found that I got a little better

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.369 
but I found that I got a little better
at<00:03:52.480> aiming<00:03:54.480> well<00:03:55.480> I<00:03:55.510> hope<00:03:55.840> that<00:03:56.079> you<00:03:56.200> found

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
at aiming well I hope that you found

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.949 
at aiming well I hope that you found
this<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.650> little<00:03:56.859> bit<00:03:57.040> interesting<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:57.849> I<00:03:58.689> hope

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
this a little bit interesting and I hope

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:12.040 
this a little bit interesting and I hope
that<00:03:59.170> you<00:03:59.290> have<00:03:59.470> fun<00:03:59.680> with<00:03:59.890> this

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.110 

you
