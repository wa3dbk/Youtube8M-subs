know it's almost evident that he's going
to<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.759> know<00:01:35.790> Michael<00:01:36.299> Jordan<00:01:36.600> did

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
to do so but you know Michael Jordan did

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.850 
to do so but you know Michael Jordan did
the<00:01:36.810> same<00:01:36.990> thing<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.350> he<00:01:37.409> came<00:01:37.619> back<00:01:37.650> with

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the same thing and he came back with

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.819 
the same thing and he came back with
Washington<00:01:38.610> now<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.540> believe<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.259> Kobe<00:01:40.530> is

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
Washington now I do believe that Kobe is

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.649 
Washington now I do believe that Kobe is
going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> Laker<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.939> life<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.390> don't

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
going to be a Laker for life I don't

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.870 
going to be a Laker for life I don't
think<00:01:42.899> he's<00:01:43.079> going<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:44.250> know<00:01:44.369> go<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
think he's going to you know go to

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.480 
think he's going to you know go to
another<00:01:45.299> team<00:01:45.470> but<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.680> possible<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.280> he

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
another team but it is possible that he

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.550 
another team but it is possible that he
leaves<00:01:47.700> next<00:01:47.939> year<00:01:48.270> takes<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.020> couple<00:01:49.200> years

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
leaves next year takes a couple years

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.950 
leaves next year takes a couple years
off<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> forty-year-old<00:01:51.270> duty<00:01:51.750> comes
