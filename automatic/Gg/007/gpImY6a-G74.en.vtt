just wrapping this hair tight as tight
as<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.879> possibly<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:43.020> go<00:00:43.200> because<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.620> not

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
as it possibly can go because I do not

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.290 
as it possibly can go because I do not
want<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.760> slipping<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.660> would<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.809> awful

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
want it slipping out that would be awful
