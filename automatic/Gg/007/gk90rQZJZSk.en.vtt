00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
bait and the float will go owner and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.819 
bait and the float will go owner and
then<00:01:36.780> we'll<00:01:37.049> actually<00:01:37.170> reel<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.740> in

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
then we'll actually reel it in

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.770 
then we'll actually reel it in
automatically<00:01:38.579> now<00:01:39.240> we're<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.479> going<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.689> be

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
automatically now we're just going to be

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.510 
automatically now we're just going to be
watching<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.680> float<00:01:40.920> bobbing<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.430> down

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
watching the float bobbing up and down

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.520 
watching the float bobbing up and down
for<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> bit<00:01:42.119> there<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.329> are<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.570> see<00:01:42.720> auto<00:01:43.110> am

for a bit there we are you see auto am
took<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.399> then<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.610> recasts<00:01:45.149> out<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
took it in and then it recasts out and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.389 
took it in and then it recasts out and
I'm<00:01:45.540> not<00:01:45.659> actually<00:01:45.990> doing<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.380> thing<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:46.890> all

I'm not actually doing a thing it's all
did<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.479> see<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.780> did<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.320> see<00:01:49.590> all

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
did you just see that did you see all

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.080 
did you just see that did you see all
those<00:01:49.860> squids<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.549> spawn<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
those squids it's just spawn in the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.700 
those squids it's just spawn in the
water<00:01:51.270> there<00:01:51.540> what<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.990> hell<00:01:52.200> happened<00:01:52.649> there

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
water there what the hell happened there

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.100 
water there what the hell happened there
it's<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> squid<00:01:53.970> infestation<00:01:54.750> we've<00:01:54.930> just

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
it's like a squid infestation we've just

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.380 
it's like a squid infestation we've just
all<00:01:55.229> spawned<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.860> again<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:56.759> recasting

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
all spawned and again it's recasting

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.580 
all spawned and again it's recasting
because<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.780> didn't<00:01:57.990> catch<00:01:58.140> anything<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.530> a

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
because it didn't catch anything in a

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.310 
because it didn't catch anything in a
certain<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.950> time<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.460> it's<00:01:59.579> recasted<00:02:00.119> now

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
certain that time so it's recasted now

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.660 
certain that time so it's recasted now
and<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.740> basically<00:02:01.920> how<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.219> mod<00:02:02.460> works

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
and this is basically how the mod works

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.459 
and this is basically how the mod works
now<00:02:03.000> I'm<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.299> showing<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.259> game

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
now I'm just showing you the game

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.080 
now I'm just showing you the game
actually<00:02:04.710> playing<00:02:05.219> itself<00:02:05.640> it's<00:02:05.909> really

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
actually playing itself it's really

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.560 
actually playing itself it's really
peculiar

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
peculiar

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.270 
peculiar
I'm<00:02:06.840> still<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> bit<00:02:07.259> baffled<00:02:07.710> by<00:02:07.829> why<00:02:08.039> all<00:02:08.099> those

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
I'm still a bit baffled by why all those

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.070 
I'm still a bit baffled by why all those
squids<00:02:08.640> have<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:09.030> randomly<00:02:09.420> spawned<00:02:09.869> us

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
squids have just randomly spawned us

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.990 
squids have just randomly spawned us
that's<00:02:10.590> peculiar<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.520> shader<00:02:11.790> pack

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
that's peculiar and the shader pack

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.610 
that's peculiar and the shader pack
makes<00:02:12.239> them<00:02:12.390> stand<00:02:12.599> out<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.840> lot<00:02:13.080> doesn't<00:02:13.290> it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
makes them stand out a lot doesn't it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.190 
makes them stand out a lot doesn't it
just<00:02:13.830> see<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.159> squids<00:02:14.459> there<00:02:14.730> well<00:02:15.330> anyway<00:02:16.049> so

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
just see the squids there well anyway so

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.960 
just see the squids there well anyway so
that's<00:02:16.470> basically<00:02:16.920> all<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.370> mod<00:02:17.610> does<00:02:17.640> it

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
that's basically all this mod does it

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.550 
that's basically all this mod does it
just<00:02:18.180> automates<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.049> whole<00:02:19.200> process<00:02:19.440> of

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
just automates the whole process of

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.589 
just automates the whole process of
fishing<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.400> can<00:02:20.489> leave<00:02:20.640> yourself<00:02:20.819> afk

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
fishing so you can leave yourself afk

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.809 
fishing so you can leave yourself afk
for<00:02:21.629> ages<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.409> it'll<00:02:23.159> automatically<00:02:23.580> get

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
for ages and it'll automatically get

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.580 
for ages and it'll automatically get
loads<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.150> fish<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.900> does<00:02:25.110> work<00:02:25.349> in

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
loads of fish and it does work in

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.320 
loads of fish and it does work in
multiplayer<00:02:26.010> servers<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:26.879> don't<00:02:27.060> worry<00:02:27.239> about

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
multiplayer servers so don't worry about

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.149 
multiplayer servers so don't worry about
that<00:02:27.629> although<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.260> did<00:02:28.590> read<00:02:28.799> somewhere<00:02:29.010> that

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
that although I did read somewhere that

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.890 
that although I did read somewhere that
if<00:02:29.400> you've<00:02:29.519> got<00:02:29.549> a<00:02:29.760> server<00:02:30.060> with<00:02:30.239> no<00:02:30.420> cheat<00:02:30.720> on

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
if you've got a server with no cheat on

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.899 
if you've got a server with no cheat on
I<00:02:31.290> don't<00:02:31.620> think<00:02:32.069> this<00:02:32.190> will<00:02:32.370> work<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:32.790> if

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
I don't think this will work but if

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.190 
I don't think this will work but if
you've<00:02:33.000> got<00:02:33.030> vanilla<00:02:33.390> servers<00:02:33.900> then<00:02:34.049> with

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
you've got vanilla servers then with

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.600 
you've got vanilla servers then with
shouldn't<00:02:34.560> be<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.680> problem<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:35.280> look<00:02:35.430> at<00:02:35.519> that

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
shouldn't be a problem and look at that

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.369 
shouldn't be a problem and look at that
well<00:02:35.819> we<00:02:35.940> got<00:02:36.060> now<00:02:36.209> we've<00:02:36.360> got<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> raw<00:02:37.079> salmon

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379
