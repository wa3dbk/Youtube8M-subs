00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:37.230
 From here 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:42.360
 Let's learn 36 decisive battles which are indispensable to use tradition conveniently 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.210
 We use store and power source which we used last time this time 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.720
 First decide where you want to add a switch 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:56.560
 This time we assume this box as 1 f 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:59.770
 And suppose that the switch box on the other side is 2 f 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:05.830
 From this 1 f 2 f box 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:09.820
 Let's wire using joint strike of 1.6 mm to the joint box 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.270
 As in the last time, the length of the wire is cut off 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:18.380
 Let's write the name firmly 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.380
 So let's peel off and confirm the decisive battle of the 3 way switch 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:33.570
 Let's join the white and red of the strikeout first to make it easier to understand 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:37.650
 In this case, only 3 black lines remain for 3 singers 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.710
 I will leave the strikeout here once 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.520
 The next remaining power cent 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:50.240
 Connect the severe winter of line 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:54.550
 Please prepare yourself to a suitable length of 1.6 mm to be easy to understand this time 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:02:02.650
 We prepared a wire of about 20 cm here 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:06.050
 This electric wire is regarded as the wire coming from the switch box and the battle of the usual cut off switch is done 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.770
 The one that made the switch battle is here 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:13.750
 If a switch is attached here, it is normal 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.750
 It becomes the tradition of single-cut switch 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.110
 Then I have not yet joined this wire 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.970
 In this way we connect with one side to the black line of strikeouts 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:31.580
 This does not matter 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:35.050
 I used different size connection parts to make it easy to understand. 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.430
 It does not matter if it is a part matched to the multiplier 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:44.519
 This 36 decisive battle is put away your 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:49.330
 This time I took out the switch wire in the joint box for easy understanding . 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:55.390
 But you can join by omitting the procedure like this 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:59.050
 I think that you can understand if you follow the furnace well, but the basics are the same as a normal switch battle 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:03.040
 I think you can understand that 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:08.890
 If you master one piece switch decisive battle firmly 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.319
 If you can not understand it, it is not so difficult 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.859
 First of all 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.859
 It is wise to do a decisive battle of the switch of one side 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:24.630
 If it is's attachment of a device of the switch you'll look at the spigot on the back of the wiring 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.560
 Insertion port is left No. 0 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:33.360
 The right has become the third No. 1 from the top 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:41.440
 Be sure to insert the + on the power supply side to No. 0 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:46.810
 In other words, here the black line is inserted into the 0th 4 routes in 3rd 1 each 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:54.270
 Please insert a red line and do not matter which color is different 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:04:01.620
 So let the lighting confirmation by attaching also 3-way switch of 1 f Gar of face-to-face 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:05.440
 It does not matter whether the lighting confirmation is always from either, but it will never be turned on once and twice 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:11.230
 Let's do it by the procedure of putting it on again 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.660
 If the battle is wrong, it happens that you can not set it on one side, so confirmation is firmly 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:19.160
 Let's try 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.160
 This time I do not pass electricity except lighting confirmation
