mountains you can have machine start off

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.370 
mountains you can have machine start off
with<00:04:07.250> 30<00:04:07.459> tools<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:08.030> there<00:04:08.510> we<00:04:08.630> go<00:04:08.750> options<00:04:09.200> up

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
with 30 tools and there we go options up

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.000 
with 30 tools and there we go options up
to<00:04:09.560> that<00:04:09.709> up<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.370> 160<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:11.780> you<00:04:11.870> can<00:04:12.019> have<00:04:12.110> 160

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
to that up to 160 so you can have 160

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.640 
to that up to 160 so you can have 160
tools<00:04:13.250> on<00:04:13.430> this<00:04:13.519> which<00:04:13.700> is<00:04:13.849> 160<00:04:14.330> told<00:04:14.690> yes<00:04:14.870> I've

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
tools on this which is 160 told yes I've

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.240 
tools on this which is 160 told yes I've
seen<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:17.120> 700<00:04:17.750> before<00:04:18.139> before<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.859> new

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
seen the 700 before before the new

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.770 
seen the 700 before before the new
smooth<00:04:19.549> control<00:04:19.970> and<00:04:20.209> we<00:04:20.389> had<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:20.570> door<00:04:20.750> open

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
smooth control and we had the door open

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.430 
smooth control and we had the door open
it's<00:04:21.410> very<00:04:21.530> easy<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.340> get<00:04:22.610> in<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:22.940> unload<00:04:23.780> yes

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
it's very easy to get in and unload yes

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.230 
it's very easy to get in and unload yes
it<00:04:24.620> is<00:04:24.740> we<00:04:25.250> can<00:04:25.400> demonstrate<00:04:25.580> that<00:04:25.910> if<00:04:26.150> you

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
it is we can demonstrate that if you

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.560 
it is we can demonstrate that if you
like<00:04:26.389> yeah<00:04:26.900> listen

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.160 

so<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.170> load<00:04:34.800> or<00:04:35.160> to<00:04:35.340> go<00:04:35.520> in<00:04:35.700> into<00:04:36.540> the<00:04:36.810> machine

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
so to load or to go in into the machine

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.230 
so to load or to go in into the machine
it's<00:04:37.350> so<00:04:37.620> accessible<00:04:37.920> yeah<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.880> machine's

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
it's so accessible yeah the machine's

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.420 
it's so accessible yeah the machine's
been<00:04:39.390> designed<00:04:39.780> with<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.470> ergonomics<00:04:41.250> in

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
been designed with the ergonomics in

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.490 
been designed with the ergonomics in
mind<00:04:41.670> and<00:04:41.970> they're<00:04:42.690> thinking<00:04:42.930> of<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.140> comfort

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
mind and they're thinking of the comfort

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.050 
mind and they're thinking of the comfort
of<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.650> operators<00:04:44.160> as<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.580> can<00:04:44.700> see<00:04:44.790> you<00:04:44.880> can

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
of the operators as you can see you can

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.860 
of the operators as you can see you can
step<00:04:45.300> right<00:04:45.330> in<00:04:46.700> very<00:04:47.700> close<00:04:47.970> close<00:04:48.360> position

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
step right in very close close position

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.200 
step right in very close close position
is<00:04:49.140> very<00:04:49.380> easy<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.770> load<00:04:50.010> without<00:04:50.790> any<00:04:50.940> strain

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
is very easy to load without any strain

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.240 
is very easy to load without any strain
on<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.480> operator<00:04:51.840> I'll<00:04:52.410> notice<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:52.980> sports

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
on the operator I'll notice the sports

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.920 
on the operator I'll notice the sports
going<00:04:53.490> out<00:04:53.670> the<00:04:53.760> back<00:04:53.790> of<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.090> machine<00:04:54.390> yes

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
going out the back of the machine yes

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.780 
going out the back of the machine yes
the<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.320> swap<00:04:55.950> is<00:04:56.130> taken<00:04:56.430> out<00:04:56.520> at<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.610> back<00:04:56.670> of

the actual that would be the x axis is

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.000 
the actual that would be the x axis is
moving<00:05:03.120> rather<00:05:04.080> than<00:05:04.290> obviously<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.680> table

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
moving rather than obviously the table

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.560 
moving rather than obviously the table
itself<00:05:05.280> and<00:05:05.520> moving<00:05:05.970> on<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.150> column

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.010 
itself and moving on the column
yes<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:08.730> X<00:05:08.910> and<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.180> y<00:05:09.300> axis<00:05:09.660> all<00:05:09.810> come

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
yes the the X and the y axis all come

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.390 
yes the the X and the y axis all come
off<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.230> gantry<00:05:10.500> construction<00:05:11.040> at<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.160> top

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.520 
and also for loading as well this cover
automatically<00:05:15.090> retracts<00:05:15.270> so<00:05:15.960> if<00:05:16.170> we<00:05:16.290> have<00:05:16.440> it

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
automatically retracts so if we have it

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.070 
automatically retracts so if we have it
loading<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.920> heavy<00:05:17.100> cover<00:05:17.370> heavy<00:05:18.030> workpiece<00:05:18.480> we

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
loading a heavy cover heavy workpiece we

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.810 
loading a heavy cover heavy workpiece we
can<00:05:19.230> load<00:05:19.410> by<00:05:19.560> a<00:05:19.590> crane<00:05:19.980> directly<00:05:20.520> over<00:05:20.730> the
