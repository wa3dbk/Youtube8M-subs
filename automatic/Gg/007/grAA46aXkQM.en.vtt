00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello to all guys and welcome in 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.690
 this new video this will be a blog 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.580
 max of a little special because precisely 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.830
 I want to organize something 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.509
 particular thanks with in that 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.400
 Let me explain to you now that I am working with a tito 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.840
 all for the sight that is Christmas 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.330
 practically really I wanted anyway 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.949
 let's think about it anyway 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.480
 something for you since I don't 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.029
 wayne never live this happened 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.250
 opportunity let's say caught on the fly 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.610
 what then is the site tres 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.829
 link that you may know or otherwise 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.780
 I see already spoken because I collaborate 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.600
 I often show you many products 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.340
 that they send me to face between me 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.110
 proposed to do a Christmas giveaway 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.809
 then how are the rules? 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.949
 very simple you can leave a 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.370
 comment below 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.199
 to theme then I will choose the comments 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.430
 I don't want to fall because I want that 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.550
 you commit yourself a little 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.230
 and then you can choose between ten 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.080
 prizes found below in the info 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.540
 box that I have been in fact already given 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.100
 from the site in via klink then you in 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.350
 your comment 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.869
 I prefer you to leave a head 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.759
 the only one are emilio husky fills with 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.890
 comments therefore only a comment to 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.729
 so much head is it to choose a 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.070
 lighthouse random there is you have to leave 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.920
 the point I said below by saying 1 the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.689
 prize you want to receive according to one 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.159
 something a bit peculiar precisely because 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.610
 we are on Christmas would do me so much 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.340
 so much pleasure to know what it is 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.009
 the thing we say the strangest decoration that 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.659
 you have on your christmas tree maybe 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.840
 one thing you did that small 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.579
 or maybe a 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.130
 something you have also achieved 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.799
 the little one maybe the gang biscuits 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.520
 that in any case campaigns however things a 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.710
 a bit so a bit special and nothing 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.610
 so you have a week of time today 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.350
 19 starts and ends against 26 on 26 e 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.579
 half rats anyway i will close all the 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.799
 comments that will come after 26 not with them 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.659
 however all the links of 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.709
 all site link products and so on 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.010

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.019

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.450

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.459

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.860
 in contact with the boy anyway 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.930
 I feel like saying link in the week 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.720
 then at the end of you will find 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.049
 this clip bucks the names of the three bars 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.910
 five winners still do not know how many and 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.379
 how many I want to choose because 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.410
 precisely that they have given free choice 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.420
 at 35 but I still don't know why I have to 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.650
 see how many comments really 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.950
 they hit me because the girls 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.660
 committed dc not these tracks for which 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.400
 I don't know how cool they can be 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.200
 I have n't seen them yet, I don't even know if 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.010
 maybe we're screwed 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.569
 I hope not okay I send you a kiss 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.109
 and we see each other the idiot 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.109
 girls
