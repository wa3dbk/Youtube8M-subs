one<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.240> reasons<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.380> real

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619

one of the reasons is that it's a real

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
load carrier in terms of the ability to

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.380 
load carrier in terms of the ability to
pick<00:00:23.580> up<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:24.000> dense<00:00:24.810> amount<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.350> pigment<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.390> to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
lot of pressure by having to adhere to a

playing<00:01:21.180> around<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.020> great<00:01:22.259> thing<00:01:22.500> to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
with some of our tools and have some fun

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.729 
with some of our tools and have some fun
when<00:02:50.340> we<00:02:50.459> paint<00:02:50.730> landscapes<00:02:51.349> with<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.470> spray

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.039 
when we paint landscapes with the spray
bottle<00:02:53.159> and<00:02:55.099> allow<00:02:56.099> some<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.819> those<00:02:56.909> colors<00:02:57.359> to

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
bottle and allow some of those colors to

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.580 
bottle and allow some of those colors to
run<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.920> precipitate<00:02:59.989> even<00:03:00.989> more<00:03:01.200> than<00:03:01.470> they

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
run and precipitate even more than they

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.430 
run and precipitate even more than they
normally<00:03:01.769> would<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.549> that<00:03:03.120> gives<00:03:03.780> us<00:03:04.049> a<00:03:04.200> nice

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
normally would and that gives us a nice

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.210 
normally would and that gives us a nice
feeling<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:06.139> foreground<00:03:07.139> receding<00:03:08.099> into

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
feeling of foreground receding into

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.800 
feeling of foreground receding into
background<00:03:10.909> see<00:03:11.909> it<00:03:12.000> makes<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.299> nice<00:03:12.480> color

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
blend again when we do these kinds of

additions and paint wet into wet it's

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.170 
additions and paint wet into wet it's
wonderful<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.530> have<00:03:19.859> a<00:03:19.919> brush<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.699> packs<00:03:21.000> a

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
wonderful to have a brush that packs a

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.909 
wonderful to have a brush that packs a

real punch in terms of the amount of
pigment<00:03:23.129> that<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:23.940> will<00:03:24.060> carry<00:03:24.329> in<00:03:24.660> one<00:03:24.989> stroke

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
one of the things that that does is it

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.610 
one of the things that that does is it
keeps<00:03:28.949> us<00:03:29.220> from<00:03:29.579> having<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:30.209> do<00:03:30.419> too<00:03:31.049> much<00:03:31.230> back

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
keeps us from having to do too much back

and<00:03:40.980> start<00:03:41.549> doing<00:03:41.879> too<00:03:42.269> much<00:03:42.419> brushwork<00:03:43.019> is

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
and start doing too much brushwork is

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.699 
and start doing too much brushwork is
that<00:03:44.099> we<00:03:44.310> tend<00:03:44.819> to<00:03:45.180> naturally<00:03:45.810> muddy<00:03:46.500> the

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
that we tend to naturally muddy the

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.159 
that we tend to naturally muddy the
color<00:03:46.980> by<00:03:47.310> moving<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.790> pigments<00:03:48.209> around<00:03:48.540> much

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
color by moving the pigments around much

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.409 
color by moving the pigments around much
like<00:03:49.440> if<00:03:49.620> we<00:03:49.799> mix<00:03:50.069> these<00:03:50.430> colors<00:03:50.849> here<00:03:51.180> on<00:03:51.299> the

like if we mix these colors here on the

a<00:03:59.370> primary<00:03:59.879> red<00:04:00.949> we<00:04:01.949> see<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:02.669> doesn't

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
a primary red we see that it doesn't

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.800 
a primary red we see that it doesn't
take<00:04:03.209> much<00:04:03.449> brush<00:04:03.840> swirling<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:05.340> turn<00:04:05.810> this

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
take much brush swirling to turn this

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.699 
take much brush swirling to turn this
mixture<00:04:07.290> into<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:08.780> fairly<00:04:09.780> dull<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.349> lifeless

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
color which is not exactly what we want

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.210 
color which is not exactly what we want
I<00:04:14.340> would<00:04:14.819> much<00:04:14.970> rather<00:04:15.030> be<00:04:15.569> looking<00:04:15.959> at<00:04:16.220> this

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
I would much rather be looking at this

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.110 
I would much rather be looking at this
