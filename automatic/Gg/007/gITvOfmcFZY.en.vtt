it just basically goes I'm gonna target
oh<00:01:44.520> there<00:01:44.790> goes<00:01:44.939> my<00:01:44.970> field<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.840> adds<00:01:46.439> an

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
oh there goes my field so it adds an

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.440 
oh there goes my field so it adds an
element<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.220> kind<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.610> suppression<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.329> your

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
you're in control this monster if they

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.469 
you're in control this monster if they
you<00:01:52.680> know<00:01:52.829> don't<00:01:53.220> do<00:01:53.430> anything<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:53.880> say<00:01:54.299> D

prisoner or anything like that that
doesn't<00:01:56.610> target<00:01:56.820> Karim<00:01:57.360> I'm<00:01:57.479> 50%<00:01:57.780> targets<00:01:58.380> it

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
doesn't target Karim I'm 50% targets it

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.780 
doesn't target Karim I'm 50% targets it
means<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.979> they're<00:01:59.100> gonna<00:01:59.189> be<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.579> real

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
means that they're gonna be in a real

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.690 
means that they're gonna be in a real
bad<00:02:00.090> situation<00:02:00.390> because<00:02:01.350> regardless<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.399> they

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
bad situation because regardless if they

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.160 
bad situation because regardless if they
you<00:02:02.820> know<00:02:02.969> get<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.180> bigger<00:02:03.450> monster<00:02:03.719> that

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
you know get a bigger monster that

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.010 
you know get a bigger monster that
attacks<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.829> kinda<00:02:05.369> has<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.969> have<00:02:06.210> some

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
attacks it kinda has to have some

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.990 
attacks it kinda has to have some
built-in<00:02:07.469> protection<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.399> doesn't<00:02:08.729> die

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
built-in protection so it doesn't die

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.360 
built-in protection so it doesn't die
otherwise<00:02:09.599> it's<00:02:10.200> not<00:02:10.500> really<00:02:10.950> gonna<00:02:11.129> get

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
otherwise it's not really gonna get

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.740 
otherwise it's not really gonna get
through<00:02:11.790> me<00:02:12.239> first

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
through me first

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.240 
through me first
in<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.290> matter<00:02:13.560> would<00:02:13.860> be<00:02:13.920> quite

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
in this matter would be quite

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.280 
in this matter would be quite
interesting<00:02:15.030> but<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.510> problem<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:16.110> mirror

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
interesting but the problem that mirror

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.020 
interesting but the problem that mirror
force<00:02:16.500> dragon<00:02:16.530> does<00:02:17.070> have<00:02:17.340> with<00:02:17.520> its<00:02:17.670> blow-up

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
force dragon does have with its blow-up

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.630 
force dragon does have with its blow-up
effect<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:19.040> nuking<00:02:20.040> your<00:02:20.190> opponent's

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
effect is that nuking your opponent's

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.700 
effect is that nuking your opponent's
field<00:02:20.850> isn't<00:02:21.420> always<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:22.020> greatest<00:02:22.260> thing

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
field isn't always the greatest thing

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.490 
field isn't always the greatest thing
nowadays<00:02:23.220> with<00:02:23.820> satellites<00:02:24.570> burning<00:02:25.230> abyss

and<00:02:28.590> while<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.730> might<00:02:29.880> say<00:02:30.209> well<00:02:30.540> they<00:02:30.870> might

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
and while you might say well they might

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.210 
and while you might say well they might
all<00:02:31.140> get<00:02:31.260> their<00:02:31.410> effects<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:31.860> they<00:02:31.920> might<00:02:32.070> go

all get their effects and they might go

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.710 
all get their effects and they might go
into<00:02:32.340> smaller<00:02:32.640> monsters<00:02:33.090> or<00:02:33.240> do<00:02:33.450> stuff<00:02:33.690> like

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
into smaller monsters or do stuff like

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.960 
into smaller monsters or do stuff like
this<00:02:34.020> but<00:02:34.470> they<00:02:34.770> still<00:02:35.100> really<00:02:35.400> get<00:02:35.670> screwed

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
this but they still really get screwed

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.510 
this but they still really get screwed
over<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.810> true<00:02:37.170> but<00:02:37.620> they<00:02:38.040> still<00:02:38.370> are

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
over it's true but they still are

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.460 
over it's true but they still are
gaining<00:02:38.850> advantage<00:02:39.000> it's<00:02:39.630> not<00:02:39.810> like<00:02:39.959> back<00:02:40.230> in

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
gaining advantage it's not like back in

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.750 
gaining advantage it's not like back in
the<00:02:40.590> old<00:02:40.620> days<00:02:40.950> where<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.340> would<00:02:41.490> summon

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
the old days where you would summon

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.000 
the old days where you would summon
jadeed<00:02:42.120> pop<00:02:42.390> everything<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.620> would<00:02:43.860> be

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
jadeed pop everything and that would be

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.500 
jadeed pop everything and that would be
gain<00:02:44.220> because<00:02:44.640> they<00:02:44.790> can't<00:02:45.090> come<00:02:45.270> back<00:02:45.450> from

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
gain because they can't come back from

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.990 
gain because they can't come back from
it<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:46.260> can<00:02:46.410> come<00:02:46.709> back<00:02:46.920> from<00:02:47.220> these<00:02:47.489> types<00:02:47.850> of

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
it you can come back from these types of

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.140 
it you can come back from these types of
scenarios<00:02:48.560> which<00:02:49.560> makes<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.160> slightly<00:02:50.670> less

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
scenarios which makes it slightly less

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.270 
scenarios which makes it slightly less
better<00:02:51.630> but<00:02:52.320> nevertheless<00:02:52.830> it's<00:02:53.250> still

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
better but nevertheless it's still

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.180 
better but nevertheless it's still
incredible<00:02:54.060> 2800<00:02:54.870> attack<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.290> nothing<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.100> be

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
incredible 2800 attack is nothing to be

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.100 
incredible 2800 attack is nothing to be
laughter<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.940> while<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.660> defense<00:02:57.959> is

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
laughter and while the defense is

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.020 
laughter and while the defense is
obviously<00:02:58.410> quite<00:02:58.530> low<00:02:58.770> it's<00:02:59.100> it's<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.670> mirror

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
obviously quite low it's it's a mirror

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.390 
obviously quite low it's it's a mirror
force<00:03:00.239> dragon<00:03:00.300> what<00:03:01.140> can<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.410> say<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.830> really

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
force dragon what can you say I really

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.190 
force dragon what can you say I really
like<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.850> card<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.270> think<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:03.630> really<00:03:03.989> cool

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
like the card I think it's really cool

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.810 
like the card I think it's really cool
and<00:03:04.500> as<00:03:04.680> soon<00:03:04.920> as<00:03:05.100> this<00:03:05.280> comes<00:03:05.489> out<00:03:05.730> the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
and as soon as this comes out the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.760 
and as soon as this comes out the
dragons<00:03:06.150> legend<00:03:06.540> -<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.690> am<00:03:06.989> getting<00:03:07.140> everything

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
dragons legend - I am getting everything

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.040 
dragons legend - I am getting everything
a<00:03:08.010> bit<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.340> want<00:03:08.820> at<00:03:08.970> all<00:03:09.150> because<00:03:09.630> it's<00:03:09.900> my

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
a bit I want at all because it's my

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.680 
a bit I want at all because it's my
childhood<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:11.040> remember<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.850> card<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.360> the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
childhood I remember this card and the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.870 
childhood I remember this card and the
only<00:03:12.959> really<00:03:13.470> irritating<00:03:14.010> thing<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.430> as<00:03:14.730> I

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
only really irritating thing and as I

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.000 
only really irritating thing and as I
said<00:03:14.940> in<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.300> intro<00:03:15.630> it's<00:03:16.020> kind<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.799> quite

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
said in the intro it's kind of quite

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.210 
said in the intro it's kind of quite
ironic<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.150> can<00:03:18.299> mirror<00:03:18.510> force<00:03:18.780> it

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
ironic is that you can mirror force it

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.420 
ironic is that you can mirror force it
because<00:03:20.220> mirror<00:03:20.459> force<00:03:20.700> doesn't<00:03:21.030> target<00:03:21.239> and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
because mirror force doesn't target and
