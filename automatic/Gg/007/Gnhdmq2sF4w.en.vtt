00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.330 
much I paid for it but on the New York
caller<00:00:27.420> website<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.320> says<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.130> they<00:00:29.220> are

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
caller website it says that they are

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.790 
caller website it says that they are
currently<00:00:29.609> 99<00:00:30.510> cents<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.410> there's<00:00:31.650> an

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.479 
currently 99 cents but there's an
asterisk<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.120> don't<00:00:33.360> know<00:00:33.450> if<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.870> means

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
asterisk so I don't know if that means

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.100 
asterisk so I don't know if that means
you<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.790> buy<00:00:35.940> something<00:00:36.360> else<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.989> get

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
you have to buy something else to get

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.380 
you have to buy something else to get
that<00:00:37.170> price<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:38.129> there<00:00:38.309> doesn't<00:00:38.610> seem<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:39.210> be

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that price but there doesn't seem to be

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.440 
that price but there doesn't seem to be
any<00:00:40.460> indication<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.579> what<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.879> asterisk

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
any indication of what the asterisk

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.979 
any indication of what the asterisk
means<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> website<00:00:43.969> so<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.390> wouldn't

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
means on the website so I wouldn't

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.380 
means on the website so I wouldn't
really<00:00:46.200> trust<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.010> price<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:50.090> bought<00:00:51.090> this

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
really trust that price I bought this

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.020 
really trust that price I bought this
because<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.440> didn't<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> brown<00:00:53.579> eyeliner

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
because I didn't have a brown eyeliner

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.660 
because I didn't have a brown eyeliner
and<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:55.170> wanted<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> brown<00:00:56.280> one<00:00:56.460> because

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
and I wanted to have a brown one because

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.250 
and I wanted to have a brown one because
I<00:00:56.699> usually<00:00:56.850> use<00:00:57.210> black<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.020> wanted

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
I usually use black and I just wanted

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.529 
I usually use black and I just wanted
something<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.949> days<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.850> wanted<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.359> look<00:01:00.480> like

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
something for days I wanted to look like

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.720 
something for days I wanted to look like
I<00:01:00.809> wasn't<00:01:01.140> wearing<00:01:01.289> as<00:01:01.500> much<00:01:01.680> makeup<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.699> I

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
I wasn't wearing as much makeup so I

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.130 
I wasn't wearing as much makeup so I
bought<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:04.939> because<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> Kohl

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
bought this and because it is a Kohl

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.950 
bought this and because it is a Kohl
pencil<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.189> expecting<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.570> really

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
pencil I was expecting it to have really

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.690 
pencil I was expecting it to have really
easy<00:01:10.200> application<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.510> just<00:01:12.510> was<00:01:12.960> very

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
easy application and I just was very

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.020 
easy application and I just was very
disappointed<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.299> product<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:17.030> pulls

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
disappointed with this product it pulls

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.530 
disappointed with this product it pulls
on<00:01:18.479> when<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.350> put<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.799> my<00:01:19.979> lower<00:01:20.509> lash<00:01:21.509> line

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
on when I put it on my lower lash line

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.219 
on when I put it on my lower lash line
it<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.680> pulls<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.850> skin<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.570> really<00:01:24.689> rough

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
it just pulls the skin it's really rough

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.490 
it just pulls the skin it's really rough
and<00:01:25.619> there's<00:01:26.490> really<00:01:26.790> not<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> lot<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.049> color

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
and there's really not a lot of color

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.310 
and there's really not a lot of color
payoff<00:01:29.150> so<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.750> could<00:01:31.350> see<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:32.119> maybe<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:34.020> as

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
payoff so I could see this maybe just as

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.770 
payoff so I could see this maybe just as
a<00:01:34.380> brow<00:01:34.829> pencil<00:01:35.540> but<00:01:36.829> it<00:01:38.420> specifically<00:01:39.420> says

but<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.640> had<00:02:38.819> to<00:02:39.030> push<00:02:39.360> really<00:02:40.170> hard<00:02:40.430> on<00:02:41.430> my<00:02:42.360> eye

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
but I had to push really hard on my eye

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.420 
but I had to push really hard on my eye
and<00:02:44.180> when<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.209> go<00:02:45.569> I<00:02:45.840> was<00:02:46.170> gonna<00:02:46.350> blend<00:02:46.739> it<00:02:47.010> it's

anymore

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.770 
anymore
it's<00:02:53.670> just<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:55.430> really<00:02:56.430> don't<00:02:56.850> like<00:02:57.060> this

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
it's just I really don't like this

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.820 
it's just I really don't like this
eyeliner<00:02:58.459> it<00:02:59.459> just<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.330> pulls<00:03:00.750> really<00:03:01.170> harshly

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
eyeliner it just it pulls really harshly

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.580 
eyeliner it just it pulls really harshly
on<00:03:02.069> my<00:03:02.549> eyelid<00:03:03.060> when<00:03:03.269> I<00:03:03.299> try<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.690> put<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.110> on<00:03:04.230> I

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
on my eyelid when I try to put it on I

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.070 
on my eyelid when I try to put it on I
do<00:03:04.769> not<00:03:05.130> do<00:03:05.670> anything<00:03:06.030> with<00:03:06.390> my<00:03:06.540> eyebrows<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:08.220> I

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
do not do anything with my eyebrows so I

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.660 
do not do anything with my eyebrows so I
can't<00:03:10.080> really<00:03:10.440> review<00:03:10.799> this<00:03:10.980> as<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.250> brow

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
can't really review this as a brow

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.470 
can't really review this as a brow
pencil<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.540> know<00:03:12.569> to<00:03:12.720> be<00:03:12.959> honest<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.650> think<00:03:14.480> the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
pencil you know to be honest I think the

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.440 
pencil you know to be honest I think the
whole<00:03:15.720> like<00:03:16.410> coloring<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.459> your<00:03:17.489> eyebrows<00:03:18.000> is

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
whole like coloring in your eyebrows is

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.900 
whole like coloring in your eyebrows is
a<00:03:18.750> little<00:03:19.140> bit<00:03:19.260> pointless<00:03:19.650> unless<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.670> have

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
a little bit pointless unless you have

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.759 
a little bit pointless unless you have
really<00:03:21.480> sparse<00:03:22.130> eyebrow<00:03:23.130> hairs<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:24.209> don't<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:25.739> I

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
really sparse eyebrow hairs I don't so I

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.650 
really sparse eyebrow hairs I don't so I
don't<00:03:26.070> really<00:03:26.160> see<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.549> need<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:27.060> do<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.239> I

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
don't really see a need to do that I

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.539 
don't really see a need to do that I
think<00:03:27.750> it's<00:03:28.109> a<00:03:28.200> waste<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:28.590> money<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:29.370> buy<00:03:29.519> a

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
think it's a waste of money to buy a

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.940 
think it's a waste of money to buy a
product<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.600> color<00:03:30.989> in<00:03:31.319> something<00:03:31.739> that's

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
product to color in something that's

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.920 
product to color in something that's
already<00:03:32.130> there<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:33.569> just<00:03:33.750> my<00:03:33.870> personal

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
already there that is just my personal

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.580 
already there that is just my personal
opinion<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:36.680> I<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:38.250> really<00:03:38.790> did<00:03:39.540> not<00:03:39.720> like
