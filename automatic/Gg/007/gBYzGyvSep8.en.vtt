00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
unfold it so just like this not going

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.830 
unfold it so just like this not going
just<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.500> only<00:01:04.589> need<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.690> take<00:01:06.690> your

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
just you only need this and take your

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
scissors and cut down this crease okay

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.960 
scissors and cut down this crease okay
so<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.830> two<00:01:20.159> pieces<00:01:20.399> that<00:01:20.580> look<00:01:20.909> like

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
so you have two pieces that look like

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.090 
so you have two pieces that look like
this<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.500> then<00:01:22.679> you<00:01:23.520> set<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:23.880> piece<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.270> side

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
this so then you set one piece of side

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.779 
this so then you set one piece of side
open<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.190> this<00:01:26.399> piece<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:28.250> do<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> same<00:01:29.550> thing

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
open up this piece and do the same thing

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:39.639 
open up this piece and do the same thing
so<00:01:35.630> then<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:37.229> should<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.649> pieces<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.520> this

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
so then you should have pieces like this

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.279 
so then you should have pieces like this
so<00:01:40.649> what<00:01:41.580> you're<00:01:41.670> gonna<00:01:41.789> do<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.659> take<00:01:42.720> one<00:01:43.259> of

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.090 
so what you're gonna do is take one of
these<00:01:43.440> pieces<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:45.560> fold<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.860> half

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
these pieces like this fold it in half

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.240 
these pieces like this fold it in half
hot<00:01:47.880> dog<00:01:48.119> style<00:01:48.390> like<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:52.039> take<00:01:53.039> this

hot dog style like that and take this
corner<00:01:53.869> right<00:01:54.869> here<00:01:54.929> and<00:01:55.910> fold<00:01:56.910> it<00:01:57.060> down<00:01:57.119> to

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:57.239 
corner right here and fold it down to

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.930 
corner right here and fold it down to
the<00:01:57.479> crease<00:01:57.709> like<00:01:58.709> a<00:01:58.739> papers<00:01:59.190> when<00:01:59.459> you<00:01:59.729> do<00:01:59.849> the

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
the crease like a papers when you do the

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.030 
the crease like a papers when you do the
same<00:02:00.179> on<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> other<00:02:00.479> side

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.260 

so<00:02:04.040> sure<00:02:04.430> look<00:02:04.610> like<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:06.070> okay<00:02:07.070> then<00:02:07.400> you

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
so sure look like that okay then you

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.460 
so sure look like that okay then you
take<00:02:08.560> this<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:12.140> then<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:14.060> fold<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.420> down<00:02:14.570> like

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
take this and then you fold it down like

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.940 
take this and then you fold it down like
this<00:02:16.420> just<00:02:17.420> like<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.810> paper<00:02:17.990> but<00:02:18.380> again<00:02:18.680> I

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
this just like the paper but again I

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.640 
this just like the paper but again I
guess<00:02:19.400> same<00:02:19.580> thing<00:02:19.820> on<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.810> other<00:02:20.870> side<00:02:20.990> so<00:02:21.590> I

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
guess same thing on the other side so I

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.030 
guess same thing on the other side so I
should<00:02:21.920> look<00:02:22.040> like<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:23.560> unfold<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:25.930> then

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
should look like that unfold it and then

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.840 
should look like that unfold it and then
you<00:02:28.090> take<00:02:29.090> really<00:02:29.990> take<00:02:30.230> this<00:02:30.740> corner<00:02:31.070> you

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
you take really take this corner you

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.990 
you take really take this corner you
just<00:02:32.480> feel<00:02:33.290> like<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:34.550> flip<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.880> around

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
just feel like this you flip it around

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.550 
just feel like this you flip it around
so<00:02:35.709> it's<00:02:36.709> like<00:02:36.830> this<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:37.930> then<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.380> do<00:02:39.470> the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
so it's like this and then you do the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.220 
so it's like this and then you do the
same<00:02:39.739> thing<00:02:40.040> as<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.340> did<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.880> first<00:02:40.910> time<00:02:41.330> on

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
same thing as you did the first time on

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.340 
same thing as you did the first time on
the<00:02:42.350> other<00:02:42.470> side<00:02:42.739> like<00:02:43.010> this<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:45.110> when<00:02:45.230> you're

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
the other side like this so when you're

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.170 
the other side like this so when you're
done<00:02:45.670> should<00:02:46.670> like<00:02:46.820> that<00:02:46.850> look<00:02:47.510> like<00:02:47.660> this<00:02:47.900> and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
done should like that look like this and

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.880 
done should like that look like this and
you<00:02:50.350> take<00:02:51.350> this<00:02:53.020> piece<00:02:54.020> that<00:02:54.080> you<00:02:54.380> did<00:02:54.410> with

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
you take this piece that you did with

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.820 
you take this piece that you did with
the<00:02:55.220> like<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.090> paper<00:02:56.300> airplane<00:02:56.450> kind<00:02:56.959> you

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
the like the paper airplane kind you

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.320 
the like the paper airplane kind you
just<00:02:57.860> take<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:59.209> fold<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.690> over<00:02:59.930> like<00:03:00.739> this

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
just take it and fold it over like this

just take it and fold it over like this
do<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.390> same<00:03:02.630> on<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.870> other<00:03:02.900> side

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
do the same on the other side

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.820 
do the same on the other side
okay<00:03:04.640> so<00:03:04.700> right<00:03:05.300> now<00:03:05.480> she<00:03:06.050> like<00:03:06.230> look<00:03:06.680> like

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
okay so right now she like look like

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.250 
okay so right now she like look like
this<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:09.160> then<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:11.000> fold<00:03:11.239> this<00:03:11.420> in<00:03:11.630> half<00:03:11.660> like

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
this and then you fold this in half like

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.449 
this and then you fold this in half like
this

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.440 

so<00:03:17.459> it's<00:03:17.730> kind<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.269> like<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.599> Kuna<00:03:18.930> nice<00:03:20.450> part

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
so it's kind of like the Kuna nice part

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.770 
so it's kind of like the Kuna nice part
of<00:03:21.540> it

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
of it

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.130 
of it
and<00:03:22.400> you<00:03:23.400> are<00:03:23.549> going<00:03:23.879> to<00:03:24.090> make<00:03:24.269> three<00:03:24.840> more<00:03:25.019> of

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
and you are going to make three more of

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:38.530 
and you are going to make three more of
these<00:03:26.840> three<00:03:27.840> unit<00:03:28.280> basically<00:03:29.330> so<00:03:30.330> this<00:03:31.760> this

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.770 

so<00:03:40.190> like<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:43.549> but<00:03:44.549> you<00:03:44.670> can<00:03:44.700> do<00:03:44.879> anyway<00:03:45.420> just

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
so like that but you can do anyway just

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.050 
so like that but you can do anyway just
a<00:03:45.900> matter<00:03:46.110> steps<00:03:46.709> but<00:03:47.069> just<00:03:47.430> see<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:47.790> media

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
a matter steps but just see to it media

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:59.360 
a matter steps but just see to it media
first<00:03:48.390> time<00:03:48.599> that<00:03:49.170> stuff<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:59.010> have<00:03:59.129> two

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
first time that stuff and you have two

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.220 
first time that stuff and you have two
of<00:03:59.400> these<00:03:59.989> stick<00:04:00.989> one<00:04:01.230> inside<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.620> other<00:04:01.799> so<00:04:03.230> I

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
of these stick one inside the other so I

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.740 
of these stick one inside the other so I
should<00:04:04.440> like<00:04:04.590> might<00:04:04.859> look<00:04:05.190> like<00:04:05.250> this<00:04:05.750> then

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
should like might look like this then

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:28.640 
should like might look like this then
you<00:04:07.260> take<00:04:07.470> your<00:04:07.620> tape

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:38.909 

just<00:04:29.650> tape<00:04:29.889> it<00:04:30.069> like<00:04:30.449> down<00:04:36.509> okay<00:04:37.509> so<00:04:37.860> should<00:04:38.860> I

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
just tape it like down okay so should I
