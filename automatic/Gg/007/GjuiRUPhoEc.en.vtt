 Many songs, because they are very personal, touch many people. 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.316
 The words mean the same to them as I was told when I wrote the songs. 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.512
 I love meeting people, I love making them happy. 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.782
 It's my job. My best work in the world. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.064
 Many people do a job because they feel they need it, 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.812
 instead of doing it because their hearts dictate it. 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.469
 I think it is always worth trying to act according to your heart and passion. 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.500
 I feel very lucky to do what I love. 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:49.742
 This is a wonderful festival, really. People are great, the environment is special. 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.838
 I think this is a very special festival. 

00:01:53.032 --> 00:01:58.292
 I hope that it will continue for many years, and in a few years I will come back here.
