 video today we have tips 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.519
 to play league play on improving 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.530
 overcome each day be better to try 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.900
 do this in a way so that we can 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.900
 enjoy so let's start with this 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.360
 number one function to know when 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.910
 retreat if we win a match and 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.140
 we were very bad of life the logical thing would be 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.770
 call but let's see this video that 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.880
 I'm going to show the riva incarnated combat 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:39.000
 against his counter pantheon 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.240
 We have three options option to return 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.720
 a base option b will go fernando option 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.720
 will die and scream like a little girl 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.570
 you stay there 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.350

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.680
 tell you that you won, take your cookie 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.680
 champion 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.510
 Tip number 2 know how and when 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.370
 rankear is very good we have all played 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.400
 of jungle that says I can not 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.200
 accomplish this that level 1 good many 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.729
 Sometimes we play and we will help 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.520
 with a little come to our ally 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.560
 both a means when the means is the 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.390
 roaming when the English support their 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.360
 other lines even when the stop is 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.750
 affiliate that will help the environment but 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.930
 let's see is not believing a god so 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.790
 more devised that is without tower ideas but 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.860
 good what can be done we look at this 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.600
 video tell them that I know they want 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.520
 option to fail his cv and 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.369
 will return to the bus to continue sleeping 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.210
 option will be worth a cucumber the tower and 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.580
 will die or the third option the two 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.360
 they will die and make them look ridiculous 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.360
 both of them 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 love 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.750
 your tower is your friend during all the 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.000
 departure but it's more your friend in the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.430
 beginnings of the game since this tower 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.360
 can be protected in phase of lines is 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.250
 very good 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.140
 trying to support your lines a lot 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.030
 that do not leave wild jungles and thus 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.569
 be able to return to your tower safe and sound 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.560
 well this part has as sub council 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.810
 as well as a 3.1 board like this many 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.420
 Sometimes do a gang of 4 versus 2 on bot 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.129
 or 4 is one in vote in top as in 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.019
 any line is very good but 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.670
 you also have to know how to do it and 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.049
 they also have to know how to deal 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.510
 obviously there are tanks that have to 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.780
 deal and try to tank the tower 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.290
 but if this is not done well all 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.129
 they will die but better look at this this 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.129
 happened to me yesterday 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.850
 as well 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.420
 given multiple 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.470
 the other 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.470
 or download for free 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:24.599
 advice number 4 know what are the 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:27.239
 objectives are quite important 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.310
 dragon baron tower but the most 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.010
 important to my eyes are draw no ball 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.079
 because because the parrot of a dragon and a 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.480
 baron can not recover up inside 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.819
 of six or seven minutes depending on which 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.939
 that is to say, imagine that I do the 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.900
 two first dragons and this is a total 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:47.700
 of 700 good gold do not give like 500 in 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.129
 500 gold example while a 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.439
 tower of 250 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.870
 we have 500 gold while 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:57.269
 they have 250 is to say that we 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.669
 we have 250 more gold even though 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.549
 they have a tower destroyed and it is not 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:05.639
 something that appears every time as the 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.870
 dragons or the barons is to say that the 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.949
 gold that you accumulate with the 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.120
 dragons is going to be very useful a 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.879
 there will be a tower and when 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.280
 destroyed never again reappears 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.689
 but you also have to have a little bit of 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.400
 head at the time of making a dragon a 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:20.639
 male usually when one is done 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.520
 a male expects his enemy jungle 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.930
 is dead or is in a vote or is in 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.600
 any other party that does not 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.320
 near the male but you also have to 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.210
 know that now make a ball in front 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.180
 of all your enemies who have vision 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.470
 those can go very wrong for you because you're 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.630
 reliable that they are so affiliated that 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.210
 can the dragon the baron in 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.310
 front of their faces or you can simply 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.310
 get them a bad move like this 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.620
 council number 5 the sentinels place 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:29.840
 the little things that give vision as what 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.509
 you want to call even if many think that 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.870
 is what this is an expense that only the 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:37.879
 quotas or other things should do and 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.159
 that in another occasion you will buy us believe me 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:43.129
 these can be saved life is never 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:46.490
 get on a bus tim ward a and a lot 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:49.099
 less if you 're going for the same 30 or more 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.840
 of the game ok or much less if they go already 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.729
 by minute 30 one of the games 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.349
 remember children the vision is good the 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:56.349
 lifeguard vision companionship 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.240
 for the best initiation wins is clear 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.310
 that the best one that starts will have a 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.110
 advantage over the others but so 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.790
 usually almost always the best 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.520
 they start earning an ink and 3 is very 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:29.100
 clear but one thing is to start well and 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.430
 another thing is to make a goal or like in this 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.430
 video 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.650
 and these are the five tips that they 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.600
 I can give and the bonus that was soccer 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.520
 we obviously will not tell and already 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.830
 you know if they liked denle I like 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.720
 I give up as you want to tell me leave me 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.460
 a comment like that I 'll know if you liked this 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.740
 video do not know if maybe I have a 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.330
 Second part 5 tips more than what 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.220
 do and what not to do that could be very 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.370
 good good I'm gtx I say goodbye thumb 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.370
 above
