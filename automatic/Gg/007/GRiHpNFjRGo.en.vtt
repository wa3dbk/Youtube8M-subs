instead<00:00:37.579> of<00:00:37.640> scanning<00:00:37.970> with<00:00:38.270> a<00:00:38.450> grid<00:00:38.690> of<00:00:38.720> line

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
instead of scanning with a grid of line

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.460 
instead of scanning with a grid of line
it<00:00:40.190> scans<00:00:40.610> with<00:00:40.850> a<00:00:40.880> field<00:00:41.180> of<00:00:41.329> light<00:00:41.630> so<00:00:42.380> you

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
it scans with a field of light so you

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.590 
it scans with a field of light so you
can<00:00:42.680> then<00:00:42.800> take<00:00:43.010> a<00:00:43.070> picture<00:00:43.550> of<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:44.210> barcode

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
from any angle it also has a picklist

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.630 
from any angle it also has a picklist
mode<00:00:52.579> where<00:00:53.510> you<00:00:53.600> can<00:00:53.630> pick<00:00:53.930> it<00:00:54.050> up<00:00:54.489> hit<00:00:55.489> the
