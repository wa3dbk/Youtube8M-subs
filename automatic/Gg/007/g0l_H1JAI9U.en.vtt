him I I couldn't find a new stuff

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.359 
him I I couldn't find a new stuff
because<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.409> flat<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.979> I've<00:01:29.130> just

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
these two things actually work for

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.710 
these two things actually work for
myself<00:03:31.670> but<00:03:32.090> I'm<00:03:32.210> going<00:03:32.330> to<00:03:32.390> give<00:03:32.540> them<00:03:32.660> away

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720

the other one someone obviously I
haven't<00:03:46.100> used<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.520> because<00:03:46.610> that<00:03:46.790> would<00:03:46.910> just

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
haven't used it because that would just

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.050 
haven't used it because that would just
be<00:03:47.090> disgusting<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.560> this<00:03:48.740> is<00:03:49.010> a<00:03:49.340> pout

in the UK you'll know what sneakers and
you'll<00:03:57.380> probably<00:03:57.590> know<00:03:57.950> what<00:03:58.100> power<00:03:58.310> pain<00:03:58.520> is

basically<00:04:04.310> in<00:04:04.610> my<00:04:04.880> opinion<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.390> UK

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
basically in my opinion the UK

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.370 
basically in my opinion the UK
equivalent<00:04:06.320> of<00:04:06.440> an<00:04:06.620> occ<00:04:07.220> lip<00:04:07.400> tar<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.380> which

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
equivalent of an occ lip tar and which

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.080 
equivalent of an occ lip tar and which
to<00:04:09.709> be<00:04:09.800> honest<00:04:10.010> I<00:04:10.220> think<00:04:10.280> would<00:04:10.700> be<00:04:10.820> a<00:04:10.850> really

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
to be honest I think would be a really

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.670 
to be honest I think would be a really
nice<00:04:11.300> color<00:04:11.540> by<00:04:11.720> don't<00:04:12.020> know<00:04:12.140> if<00:04:12.200> it'd<00:04:12.290> be<00:04:12.470> too

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
nice color by don't know if it'd be too

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.290 
nice color by don't know if it'd be too
pale<00:04:12.920> for<00:04:13.010> my<00:04:13.250> skin<00:04:13.459> tone<00:04:13.670> so<00:04:13.880> when<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.030> looked

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
pale for my skin tone so when I looked

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.670 
pale for my skin tone so when I looked
at<00:04:14.420> a<00:04:14.570> bit<00:04:14.900> like<00:04:15.110> I<00:04:15.320> don't<00:04:15.500> know<00:04:15.620> but<00:04:16.160> actually

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
at a bit like I don't know but actually

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.140 
at a bit like I don't know but actually
maybe<00:04:18.680> in<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.160> future<00:04:19.310> I'll<00:04:19.669> purchase<00:04:19.880> one

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
maybe in the future I'll purchase one

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.460 
maybe in the future I'll purchase one
for<00:04:20.270> myself<00:04:20.419> but<00:04:20.780> I<00:04:20.840> just<00:04:21.080> thought<00:04:21.200> it<00:04:21.320> was<00:04:21.410> a

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
for myself but I just thought it was a

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.410 
for myself but I just thought it was a
really<00:04:21.530> pretty<00:04:22.100> light<00:04:22.669> pink<00:04:22.970> color

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
really pretty light pink color

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.630 
really pretty light pink color
and<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:24.170> those<00:04:24.320> are<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.650> five<00:04:24.950> things<00:04:25.010> I'm<00:04:25.520> in

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.250 
explain this before I ask you what way
to<00:05:01.490> do<00:05:01.700> but<00:05:01.880> when<00:05:02.450> I<00:05:02.480> think<00:05:02.570> about<00:05:02.900> making

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
to do but when I think about making

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.190 
to do but when I think about making
videos<00:05:03.770> and<00:05:04.270> the<00:05:05.270> things<00:05:05.510> that<00:05:05.690> go<00:05:05.720> through<00:05:05.900> my

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
videos and the things that go through my

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.680 
videos and the things that go through my
head<00:05:06.560> are<00:05:06.830> right<00:05:07.400> where<00:05:07.700> do<00:05:07.880> my<00:05:08.000> subscribers

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
head are right where do my subscribers

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.620 
head are right where do my subscribers
live<00:05:08.960> because<00:05:09.950> if<00:05:10.550> they<00:05:10.760> all<00:05:10.940> live<00:05:11.150> in<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.450> UK

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
live because if they all live in the UK

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.720 
live because if they all live in the UK
then<00:05:12.620> potentially<00:05:14.950> giveaways<00:05:15.950> and<00:05:15.980> things<00:05:16.430> I

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
then potentially giveaways and things I

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.520 
then potentially giveaways and things I
need<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.030> look<00:05:17.270> for<00:05:17.540> stuff<00:05:17.780> possibly<00:05:18.110> that<00:05:18.500> I

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
need to look for stuff possibly that I

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.740 
need to look for stuff possibly that I
can<00:05:18.740> get<00:05:18.860> from<00:05:18.980> abroad<00:05:19.370> and<00:05:19.640> if<00:05:20.120> you<00:05:20.270> all<00:05:20.420> in

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
can get from abroad and if you all in

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.170 
can get from abroad and if you all in
America<00:05:21.410> and<00:05:21.650> Canada<00:05:21.980> it<00:05:22.460> means<00:05:22.700> that<00:05:22.850> my

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
America and Canada it means that my

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.060 
America and Canada it means that my
giveaways<00:05:23.630> it<00:05:23.960> makes<00:05:24.260> sense<00:05:24.470> to<00:05:24.590> have<00:05:24.770> stuff

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
giveaways it makes sense to have stuff

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.620 
giveaways it makes sense to have stuff
that<00:05:25.100> you<00:05:25.370> can<00:05:25.520> only<00:05:25.640> get<00:05:25.910> in<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.060> UK<00:05:26.390> because

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
that you can only get in the UK because

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.750 
that you can only get in the UK because
it<00:05:26.900> just<00:05:27.020> kind<00:05:27.320> of<00:05:27.410> switches<00:05:27.800> it<00:05:27.920> up<00:05:27.950> a<00:05:28.100> bit<00:05:28.130> and

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
it just kind of switches it up a bit and

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.280 
it just kind of switches it up a bit and
also<00:05:29.150> when<00:05:29.330> I'm<00:05:29.420> thinking<00:05:29.720> about<00:05:29.900> you<00:05:30.110> to<00:05:30.230> all
