criminals in school and out of school

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.969 
criminals in school and out of school
people<00:07:08.080> are<00:07:08.169> being<00:07:08.320> treated<00:07:08.530> like<00:07:08.710> criminals

people are being treated like criminals

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:11.040 
people are being treated like criminals
and<00:07:09.430> it<00:07:09.669> doesn't<00:07:09.790> seem<00:07:10.000> to<00:07:10.120> matter<00:07:10.270> how<00:07:10.510> old<00:07:10.540> or

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
and it doesn't seem to matter how old or

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.159 
and it doesn't seem to matter how old or
how<00:07:11.110> young<00:07:11.560> they<00:07:11.740> are<00:07:12.030> it's<00:07:13.030> like<00:07:13.360> one<00:07:13.810> big

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:14.169 
how young they are it's like one big

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.280 
how young they are it's like one big
ongoing<00:07:14.889> sion<00:07:15.460> so<00:07:16.240> overall<00:07:16.540> I<00:07:16.660> would<00:07:16.840> have<00:07:17.110> to

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:17.290 
ongoing sion so overall I would have to

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.469 
ongoing sion so overall I would have to
conclude<00:07:17.680> that<00:07:18.010> it<00:07:18.190> really<00:07:18.400> is<00:07:18.639> a<00:07:18.910> conspiracy

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:19.479 
conclude that it really is a conspiracy

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:21.900 
conclude that it really is a conspiracy
to<00:07:20.040> make<00:07:21.040> our<00:07:21.220> children<00:07:21.520> feel<00:07:21.639> like<00:07:21.760> criminals

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:21.910 
to make our children feel like criminals

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.390 
to make our children feel like criminals
so<00:07:22.419> that<00:07:22.570> they<00:07:22.660> act<00:07:22.840> like<00:07:22.930> criminals<00:07:23.380> so<00:07:24.130> that

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 
so that they act like criminals so that

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.710 
so that they act like criminals so that
the<00:07:24.610> state<00:07:24.820> can<00:07:24.970> get<00:07:25.090> more<00:07:25.270> money<00:07:25.389> for<00:07:25.660> their

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 
the state can get more money for their

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.860 
the state can get more money for their
special<00:07:26.200> needs<00:07:26.410> and<00:07:26.740> criminal<00:07:27.100> budgets<00:07:27.490> and

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870 
special needs and criminal budgets and

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.540 
special needs and criminal budgets and
so<00:07:28.870> that<00:07:29.050> the<00:07:29.199> private<00:07:29.860> prisons<00:07:30.220> can<00:07:30.400> make

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.550 
so that the private prisons can make

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.460 
so that the private prisons can make
more<00:07:30.820> money<00:07:30.970> off<00:07:31.120> you<00:07:31.930> know<00:07:32.020> these<00:07:32.199> young
