question<00:00:23.340> okay<00:00:23.519> today<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:24.600> have<00:00:24.930> three<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
question okay today we have three so the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.130 
question okay today we have three so the
first<00:00:26.010> one<00:00:26.160> concerns<00:00:26.760> creating<00:00:27.359> callback

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
first one concerns creating callback

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.109 
first one concerns creating callback
functions<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:28.740> javascript<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.939> might

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
functions with javascript so you might

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.970 
functions with javascript so you might
be<00:00:30.150> familiar<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.689> something<00:00:31.380> like<00:00:31.500> jQuery

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
be familiar with something like jQuery

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.459 
be familiar with something like jQuery
where<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.520> attach<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:33.149> click<00:00:33.840> event<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
where you can attach a click event and

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.319 
where you can attach a click event and
then<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.739> run<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> callback<00:00:35.730> function<00:00:36.180> when

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
then you run a callback function when

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.709 
then you run a callback function when
that<00:00:36.510> event<00:00:37.070> has<00:00:38.070> occurred<00:00:38.420> so<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.629> do

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
that event has occurred so we can do

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
that event has occurred so we can do
that<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:39.960> javascript<00:00:40.379> very<00:00:40.649> easily<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.340> is

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
that with javascript very easily this is

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.100 
that with javascript very easily this is
a<00:00:41.520> simple<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.570> let's<00:00:42.719> go<00:00:42.840> ahead<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
a simple one so let's go ahead and

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.840 
a simple one so let's go ahead and
create<00:00:43.469> some<00:00:43.800> random<00:00:44.129> function<00:00:44.489> like<00:00:44.670> do

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
create some random function like do

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.229 
create some random function like do
something<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:46.170> going<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.410> accept<00:00:46.860> a

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
something and it's going to accept a

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.090 
something and it's going to accept a
parameter<00:00:48.239> let's<00:00:48.570> say<00:00:48.750> name<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.649> all<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:49.950> want

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
parameter let's say name and all we want

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.660 
parameter let's say name and all we want
to<00:00:50.160> do<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.460> alert<00:00:50.760> hello<00:00:51.559> +<00:00:52.559> name<00:00:52.860> okay<00:00:53.219> we've

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
to do is alert hello + name okay we've

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.549 
to do is alert hello + name okay we've
done<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:53.940> many<00:00:54.149> times<00:00:54.239> right<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.410> we're

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
done this many times right so we're

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.260 
done this many times right so we're
going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.739> call<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.309> something<00:00:56.789> we're<00:00:57.210> going

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
going to call do something we're going

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.569 
going to call do something we're going
to<00:00:57.360> pass<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.840> our<00:00:57.989> name<00:00:58.199> but<00:00:58.920> also<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.370> want<00:00:59.520> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
to pass in our name but also we want to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.880 
to pass in our name but also we want to
pass<00:00:59.789> in<00:01:00.090> an<00:01:00.329> anonymous<00:01:00.570> function<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.770> will

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
pass in an anonymous function that will

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.619 
pass in an anonymous function that will
serve<00:01:02.129> as<00:01:02.340> our<00:01:02.460> callback<00:01:02.820> which<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:03.420> only

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
serve as our callback which will only

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.929 
serve as our callback which will only
run<00:01:03.899> after<00:01:04.409> whatever<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.519> contained<00:01:05.880> within

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
run after whatever is contained within

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.810 
run after whatever is contained within
this<00:01:06.240> function<00:01:06.689> has<00:01:06.780> run<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.670> just<00:01:08.670> for

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
this function has run and just for

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.219 
this function has run and just for
brevity<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.330> say<00:01:09.600> alerts<00:01:11.810> call<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.990> called

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
brevity will say alerts call that called

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.010 
brevity will say alerts call that called
okay<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.430> now<00:01:14.610> when<00:01:15.030> we<00:01:15.150> pass<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.869> it

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
okay so now when we pass this in it

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.660 
okay so now when we pass this in it
needs<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.380> represented<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.100> here<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.580> we

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
needs to be represented up here so we

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.160 
needs to be represented up here so we
can<00:01:17.729> either<00:01:17.850> called<00:01:18.119> call<00:01:18.390> back<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:18.930> you've

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
can either called call back or you've

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.649 
can either called call back or you've
probably<00:01:19.380> seen<00:01:19.619> CB<00:01:20.130> before<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.150> now<00:01:21.330> this

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
probably seen CB before so now this

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.770 
probably seen CB before so now this
variable<00:01:22.140> CB<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.830> equal<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.360> function

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
variable CB is equal to this function

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.499 
variable CB is equal to this function
specifically<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.400> all<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.240> is

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
specifically so all we have to do is

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.880 
specifically so all we have to do is
once<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.869> run<00:01:28.049> our<00:01:28.200> code<00:01:28.320> at<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.530> very<00:01:28.710> bottom

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
once we run our code at the very bottom

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.550 
once we run our code at the very bottom
just<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.520> siebie<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.119> call<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.930> that's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
just do siebie and call it and that's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.039 
just do siebie and call it and that's
really<00:01:31.799> as<00:01:31.979> simple<00:01:32.130> as<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:33.390> was<00:01:33.659> come<00:01:33.869> back

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
really as simple as this was come back

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.319 
really as simple as this was come back
refreshed<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.040> page<00:01:35.070> hello<00:01:35.670> Jeffrey<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
refreshed the page hello Jeffrey and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.780 
refreshed the page hello Jeffrey and

call back this cult so that's an easy

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.160 
call back this cult so that's an easy
way<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.030> take<00:01:39.270> her<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.960> was<00:01:40.049> an

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.040 
I come back and if we set the quick fix
is<00:03:41.050> overflow<00:03:41.769> hidden<00:03:42.120> okay<00:03:43.120> that'll<00:03:43.600> force<00:03:43.930> it

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
is overflow hidden okay that'll force it

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.540 
is overflow hidden okay that'll force it
to<00:03:44.140> contain<00:03:44.410> it<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:44.920> what<00:03:45.130> you're<00:03:45.250> doing<00:03:45.280> is

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
to contain it so what you're doing is

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.130 
to contain it so what you're doing is
because<00:03:45.880> he's<00:03:46.060> floating<00:03:46.540> all<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.840> elements

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
because he's floating all the elements

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.530 
because he's floating all the elements
it<00:03:48.070> sort<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:48.850> takes<00:03:49.030> it<00:03:49.180> out<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.360> flow<00:03:49.510> of

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
it sort of takes it out of the flow of

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.970 
it sort of takes it out of the flow of
the<00:03:49.660> documents<00:03:50.110> even<00:03:50.350> though<00:03:50.440> these<00:03:50.620> elements

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
the documents even though these elements

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.009 
the documents even though these elements
will<00:03:51.220> still<00:03:51.459> affect<00:03:51.850> other<00:03:52.090> inline<00:03:52.510> elements

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
will still affect other inline elements

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.380 
will still affect other inline elements
it'll<00:03:53.920> cause<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.610> parent<00:03:54.940> element<00:03:55.030> to

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
it'll cause the parent element to

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.000 
it'll cause the parent element to
collapse<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:57.060> most<00:03:58.060> people<00:03:58.500> set<00:03:59.500> overflow<00:03:59.950> to

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
collapse so most people set overflow to

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.500 
collapse so most people set overflow to
hidden<00:04:00.310> but<00:04:00.880> if<00:04:01.060> you're<00:04:01.300> in<00:04:01.420> a<00:04:01.480> situation

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
hidden but if you're in a situation

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.509 
hidden but if you're in a situation
where<00:04:02.110> maybe<00:04:02.260> you<00:04:02.470> need<00:04:02.709> maybe<00:04:03.040> some<00:04:03.160> kind<00:04:03.430> of

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
where maybe you need maybe some kind of

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.300 
where maybe you need maybe some kind of
graphic<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.090> overflow<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.989> boundaries<00:04:05.590> the

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
graphic to overflow the boundaries the

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.830 
graphic to overflow the boundaries the
next<00:04:06.519> fix<00:04:06.760> is<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:06.940> do<00:04:07.180> something<00:04:07.480> called<00:04:07.660> the

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
next fix is to do something called the

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.600 
next fix is to do something called the
clear<00:04:08.110> fix<00:04:08.970> so<00:04:09.970> what<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:10.300> clear<00:04:10.510> fix<00:04:10.750> does<00:04:10.989> is

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
clear fix so what the clear fix does is

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.910 
clear fix so what the clear fix does is
it<00:04:12.610> pretty<00:04:12.910> much<00:04:13.120> adds<00:04:13.360> content<00:04:14.110> after<00:04:14.230> the

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
it pretty much adds content after the

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.360 
it pretty much adds content after the
element<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:17.140> can<00:04:17.260> see<00:04:17.410> content<00:04:17.830> here<00:04:18.250> you

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
element and you can see content here you

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.210 
element and you can see content here you
can<00:04:18.489> set<00:04:18.640> display<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:19.060> block<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.630> clear

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
can set display to block and clear

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.319 
can set display to block and clear
so<00:04:20.280> it's<00:04:20.400> pretty<00:04:20.519> much<00:04:20.670> the<00:04:20.730> same<00:04:21.000> thing<00:04:21.209> as

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
so it's pretty much the same thing as

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.180 
so it's pretty much the same thing as
setting<00:04:21.630> clear<00:04:22.019> both<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.860> then<00:04:22.980> all<00:04:23.100> you<00:04:23.160> have

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
setting clear both and then all you have

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.880 
setting clear both and then all you have
to<00:04:23.340> do<00:04:23.460> is<00:04:23.610> add<00:04:23.820> class<00:04:24.270> of<00:04:24.540> clear<00:04:24.930> fix<00:04:25.170> and<00:04:25.440> then

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
to do is add class of clear fix and then

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.290 
to do is add class of clear fix and then
I'll<00:04:25.980> take<00:04:26.130> care<00:04:26.280> of<00:04:26.340> it<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:27.000> only<00:04:27.150> thing

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
I'll take care of it the only thing

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.970 
I'll take care of it the only thing
worth<00:04:27.420> noting<00:04:27.570> here<00:04:27.750> is<00:04:28.140> we're<00:04:28.440> also<00:04:28.590> setting

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
worth noting here is we're also setting

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.230 
worth noting here is we're also setting
zoomed<00:04:29.460> one<00:04:30.080> ie<00:04:31.080> six<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:31.890> seven<00:04:32.730> sometimes

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
zoomed one ie six and seven sometimes

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.750 
zoomed one ie six and seven sometimes
have<00:04:33.540> some<00:04:33.780> issues<00:04:33.900> with<00:04:34.140> hesley<00:04:34.740> up<00:04:34.890> so<00:04:35.580> the

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
have some issues with hesley up so the

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.670 
have some issues with hesley up so the
star<00:04:36.000> hack<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.780> could<00:04:36.900> also<00:04:37.020> put<00:04:37.320> this<00:04:37.440> into

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
star hack you could also put this into

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.190 
star hack you could also put this into
an<00:04:37.890> IE<00:04:38.070> stylesheet<00:04:38.700> specifically<00:04:39.390> but<00:04:39.690> the

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
an IE stylesheet specifically but the

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.940 
an IE stylesheet specifically but the
star<00:04:40.440> hack<00:04:40.710> at<00:04:41.210> targets<00:04:42.210> ie7<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:43.050> below<00:04:43.380> so

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
star hack at targets ie7 and below so

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.410 
star hack at targets ie7 and below so
here<00:04:44.130> we're<00:04:44.280> just<00:04:44.310> setting<00:04:44.670> a<00:04:44.730> has<00:04:44.940> layouts

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
here we're just setting a has layouts

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.850 
here we're just setting a has layouts
though<00:04:45.660> you<00:04:45.720> could<00:04:45.930> also<00:04:46.050> do<00:04:46.350> something<00:04:46.590> like

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
though you could also do something like

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.460 
though you could also do something like
hi<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.880> one<00:04:48.300> percent<00:04:48.750> but<00:04:49.020> I've<00:04:49.080> also<00:04:49.260> heard

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
hi to one percent but I've also heard

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.050 
hi to one percent but I've also heard
that<00:04:49.560> can<00:04:50.040> have<00:04:50.250> some<00:04:50.430> issues<00:04:50.550> in<00:04:50.880> some

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
that can have some issues in some

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.540 
that can have some issues in some
browsers<00:04:51.210> so<00:04:51.660> soon<00:04:52.380> one<00:04:52.770> works<00:04:53.070> just<00:04:53.250> fine

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
browsers so soon one works just fine

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.850 
browsers so soon one works just fine
just<00:04:54.480> make<00:04:54.600> sure<00:04:54.630> you<00:04:54.870> clear<00:04:55.110> your<00:04:55.260> floats<00:04:55.560> and

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
just make sure you clear your floats and

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.790 
just make sure you clear your floats and
that<00:04:56.550> will<00:04:56.670> do<00:04:56.790> it<00:04:56.820> for<00:04:56.970> today's<00:04:57.780> Q&amp;A<00:04:58.380> be<00:04:58.650> sure

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
that will do it for today's Q&amp;A be sure

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.300 
that will do it for today's Q&amp;A be sure
to<00:04:58.890> check<00:04:59.070> back<00:04:59.100> next<00:04:59.520> week<00:04:59.970> or<00:05:00.270> so
