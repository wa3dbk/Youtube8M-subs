00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.789
 eo so for the first time that this 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.439
 are seventeen explosions m 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.330
 it's been seven years since we existed there 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.580
 it's a bit of a time to become 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.770
 present what we had done all our 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.140
 personal design 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.480
 so we came to get her 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.520
 mainly distributors on the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.470
 us and then other countries of the world 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.360
 so this is the last day we had 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.840
 a lot of good contacts 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.610
 and so we brought a dozen 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.620
 guitar several models that we have 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.559
 drawn that came out 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.770
 between 2008 and now is so 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.320
 especially four new models that we have 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.440
 show here 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.760
 so 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.859
 the london's burning park 2 which is 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.180
 it's a bit of an evolution of three 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.460
 visits of 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.750
 a london's burning we were doing 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.000
 already but with something more 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.000
 staff we spent a lot of time at 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.790
 nature boss did not have and then with 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.450
 one side submitted to the lobby the beats by 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.610
 Lotivy Jones with a put see shots 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.380
 is like that 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.370
 finally who gave him a side not 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.200
 bad not bad gretsch a bit and we 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.130
 took advantage to make a new head 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.130
 we did not have for the moment 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.880
 which for the moment is going to be on two 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.220
 models and then we'll see in the future if 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.220
 we expand it on others 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.290
 he then went out 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.930
 going stellite reindeer this is this 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.789
 version it's a bit we were not bad 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.689
 known at the beginning for guitars 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:56.030
 type e sleeve glued and humbucker and then 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.939
 we still wanted to go more in the 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.000
 vein a vein fender in fact so 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:05.180
 screwed sleeve 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.670
 maple fingerboard vibrato type strata by 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.979
 against 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.040
 in the stuff we wanted on the micro 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.920
 year 2 p 90 to do something 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:20.010
 from a little bit a little bit a little bit more 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.010
 known is here again in hall 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.610
 a second version that she has green this 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.530
 credit with the earliest 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.750
 rather a horse to label the casters 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.950
 this is a master model i bridge that 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.890
 is an American brand that we 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.510
 distributes in France so a little bit 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.640
 same spec the peculiarity is the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.680
 config micro we put peace 90 in 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.500
 handle and a simple pickup 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.569
 this evening to have interesting side of the 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.969
 p90 always with regard to dynamics 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:57.519
 etc but that goes well in the crunch and 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:03:00.400
 had launched this one it's really 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.900
 a guitar that was designed in 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.159
 starting from the spectators ie we 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.099
 said we want to make a guitar and clamor 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:08.379
 I live and an easel of this type there and 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.490
 then everything was built around 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.970
 these elements 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.970
 and the fourth 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.920
 it's the blackout 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.620
 this one 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.709
 so it's a little there seems more 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.150
 the craziest that have effect at the beginning we 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.459
 was gone on the idea of on a 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.069
 metal guitar with spikes etc 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.390
 and then I think we were not 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.280
 able we are with you 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.019
 and by force the spikes have become a 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.519
 little more rounded etc 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.370
 but we are we stayed on a guitar 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:42.000
 a bit strange that by a bit so in 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.220
 many senses and where we like it 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.959
 I really think it's 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.350
 really the most original we had 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.910
 made 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.819
 she does not really remember much 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.530
 other existing guitar I think 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.830
 so 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:01.310
 for now we're on a guitar 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:04.069
 mahogany handle humbucker 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.569
 maple neck and ebony fingerboard so with 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.120
 the same head as on london's burning 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.319
 mark 2 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.220
 this is the one she is probably going to 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:16.450
 evolve towards stage to versions 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.160
 maybe a little metal and pickups 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.730
 active and where we did tests like 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.320
 that she was pretty funny and then he 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.480
 happened something stupid we were hoping 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.370
 we had three magazines 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.960
 Japanese who passed each time 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.660
 they are arrested on this one think 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.460
 that it can talk to them that can 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.600
 to be very funny if I hang there 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.150
 above 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.190
 and for the rest of the ranges was based 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.770
 about the sirens of the udc what have 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.900
 proposed in France we have each time 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.280
 made improvements on it by 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.350
 compared to the luxury series now on 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.070
 decided up everywhere we went 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:54.460
 now from the pro lap by operating at 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:58.060
 place of the wilkinson of pot'arts cts and 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.410
 then so everything is in has a first 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.510
 range that is presented there and at every 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:06.870
 focus of the possible options be it 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.870
 m dt life jones for example a bixby 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.440
 masters and brigs for this one and 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.729
 it's actually these foes opposed a 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.190
 first version already a little higher 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.569
 range and then a version again 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.039
 possible to improve 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.039
 that's the big news of 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.750
 of this year now really 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.789
 tried to develop is probably not 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.410
 not go out of other forms because that 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.940
 already makes a pretty big catalog for 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.960
 a brand like us 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.090
 and now and it's really ugly 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.220
 work to see how the markets 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.780
 react if in the united states it takes 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.420
 what models are interested 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.830
 for the moment they are quite a lot 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.720
 interesting especially london's burning 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.710
 mark ii and lose for life seem to 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.290
 have tapped them in the eye 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.350
 and so here now we're going to be a little 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.180
 in the grave 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.190
 of the world and see how the world 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.190
 reacts to our little french 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.059
 mapa 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.200
 1 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:19.509
 but
