00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.170
 good good good I have here the 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.170
 appropriate ingredients to make a 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.869
 biscuit that good because it occurred to me 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.119
 so suddenly an inspiration I'm going to 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.590
 make a cake mixing the almond 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.570
 sugar oil corn vegetable so that 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.820
 This cake can also be taken 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.260
 People who have problems with the 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.649
 gluten some eggs and some raisins 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.360
 that I have them macerating in rum so 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.890
 they hydrate a little 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.829
 and if not, in any case, it will be 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.450
 to be and let death be good 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.730
 with these ingredients I will make one 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.329
 I'm going to make a couple of biscuits in the 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.399
 type brow cake and what do you want me to say 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.190
 I hope you leave me a phenomenon I 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.770
 to make the clear the way does the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.680
 game to point of snow and on the other 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.510
 then I'm going to mix the rest of 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.159
 ingredients and when they are all 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.820
 last minute credits I add the 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.470
 clear 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:12.300
 for me to tell everything and that I do not 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.730
 get off the meringue air a lot 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.810
 I also think as if only 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.880
 missing to see there a yeast envelope 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.400
 we get chemical yeast powder or what 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.320
 that America call baking powders like that 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.700
 is that with these ingredients I'm going to 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.329
 put on the task 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.670
 Well with the rods 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.590
 the mechanical rods are I going to 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.869
 lift the meringue 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.539
 I'm going to do it in a fast camera and you'll see 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.060
 that I add 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:45.670
 the sugar in a couple of times or three and it's 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.179
 what I'm going to clear up with 6 of 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.979
 sugar 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.069
 but you're going to see everything on camera 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.069
 fast 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.130
 Well, we've already seen how the 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.130
 fast camera 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:17.410
 the merengue now here I will do 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.940
 I put the yolks and 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.310
 now I will throw him the rest of things 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.730
 the cornstarch to the almond the oil 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.930
 the rum that I have left over here to hydrate 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.870
 the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.599
 the raisins and when everything is fine 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.030
 I will put the meringue for 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.099
 mix it with the palette no longer no longer 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.200
 use on the mechanical rods 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.700
 because I do not think it gets off and 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.219
 finally I will put the raisins 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.450
 the mold and the jacuzzi is worth everything 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.480
 we are going to see this also on camera 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.480
 fast 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:16.030
 well now 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.060
 to the molds that the cell had already 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.270
 make this dough 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.180
 and now we are going to distribute it between these 2 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.790
 cakes that are called well because their shape 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.460
 long and good because he has put this 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.620
 name and I know why 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.900
 now I call it mold of all life 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.640
 rectangular mold is not to call him 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.379
 cakes to do I do not know that I do not know how many 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.810
 well, extra case 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:50.680
 it is still well distributed until it is here 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.250
 what does it look like and what rumbita 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.500
 comes from the rum 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.370
 do not worry because the rum now in 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.250
 the oven when cooking alcohol is 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.720
 evaporate so have no fear 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.270
 that nothing will happen to him that this is not 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.610
 get drunk good because this I calculate 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.870
 that in 25 minutes or so you can 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.740
 be because they are not very big 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:17.209
 but then I tell you the result 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.209
 Well, we have the cake here 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.209
 cold 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.400
 and then leave it all night to 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.560
 to be able to give us conditions 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.050
 Look at this little piece of paper that I put on you like this 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.990
 it is simply for now to be able to do 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:38.080
 Obviously, I'm going to remove that 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.300
 paper 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.720
 and I'm going to put a little bit of sugar 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:48.260
 glas to decorate without more 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:52.120
 this the truth is that it is very full 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.400
 we have two options or put it like that 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.320
 with the coast upwards that good 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.310
 I just was not of course avoiding 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.550
 this 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.850
 or we can turn it around and like more 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.370
 like it but I prefer that because the 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.000
 rib is on top has a something 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:14.650
 special that is more toasted more 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.650
 compensated and have only 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.420
 and now let's talk about it without further 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.650
 let's make snow on top of 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.900
 Biscuit 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.860
 a baking strainer after 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.280
 little ones 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.210
 and ground sugar that this is not sugar 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.210
 gas, ground sugar 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.240
 in the coffee grinder because it's something 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.080
 very cheap 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.810
 well then well you just have to eat it 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.449
 cut and eat 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:51.509
 my mother what a richer thing 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:53.159
 still does not decide a name but something 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:55.060
 it has to do with the Rioja since it 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:57.130
 they employ 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.670
 and typical ingredients here as is 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.720
 the almond 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:05.270
 the raisins and I have put rum 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.640
 but I'm almost going to recommend the best 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.520
 white muscat that is being made in 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.950
 the rioja a very rich muscatel that stops 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.840
 this kind of thing is going great 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.720
 I hope you do that you enjoy and 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.990
 as I always say, well, that always 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.990
 friends
