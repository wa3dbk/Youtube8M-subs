00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.429
 road signage protrudes 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.009
 When the load protrudes from the projection on the vehicle's floor, 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.060
 must take all appropriate precautions to avoid damage 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.120
 committed 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.120
 and it must be protected in the outgoing extremity to reduce the 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.120
 effects of a friction 8 that possible 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.909
 the load that protrudes from behind the vehicles must be marked 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:33.930
 by means of a panel of 50 by 50 centimeters in dimension 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.179
 painted with alternating diagonal stripes of red and white 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.800
 the panel should be placed the rear end of the load so that 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.800
 is constantly perpendicular to the axis of the vehicle 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.500
 when the load protrudes longitudinally across the insula of 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.610
 the rear of the vehicle will be placed transversely two panels 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.340
 of signaling each at one end of the load or the insula of the material 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.470
 that excels 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.960
 when the vehicle circulates between sunset and sunrise 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.439
 weather or environmental conditions 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.820
 that noticeably decrease visibility 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.870
 the load must be and also marked with a red light 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.070
 When the load protrudes from the front, it will be signaled with a light 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.870
 white 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.910
 loads protruding laterally from the vehicle gauge in such a way 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.810
 that your lateral limb is more than 40 centimeters from the edge 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.610
 outside of the front light another will be of vehicle position between the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.290
 bet and sunrise 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.719
 as well as when there are environmental conditions that are not very environmental 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.370
 that noticeably decrease visibility 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.539
 should be marked 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.850
 by means of a white light and a white reflective device 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:49.800
 from the front 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.219
 and in the back 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.509
 a red light and a red reflective device 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.280
 during the day and under normal visibility conditions it will not be 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.640
 need to signal
