standing by the barracks who just

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.800 
standing by the barracks who just
finished<00:00:19.800> building<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.400> isn't<00:00:21.180> going<00:00:21.359> back<00:00:21.600> to

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
finished building it isn't going back to

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.050 
finished building it isn't going back to
work<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:23.010> know<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.340> because<00:00:23.519> when<00:00:23.939> they

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
work you know that because when they

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.910 
work you know that because when they
finish<00:00:24.390> making<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.050> building<00:00:25.439> they<00:00:25.560> get<00:00:25.740> tired

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
finish making a building they get tired

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.679 
finish making a building they get tired
and<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.220> can't<00:00:26.250> work<00:00:26.670> anymore<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.269> they<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.539> to

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
and I can't work anymore so they have to

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.870 
and I can't work anymore so they have to
stand<00:00:27.930> still<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.010> they<00:00:29.160> pretty<00:00:29.429> much<00:00:29.519> get

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
stand still and they pretty much get

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.490 
stand still and they pretty much get
wasted<00:00:30.359> i<00:00:30.420> really<00:00:30.689> think<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:30.990> they<00:00:31.199> need<00:00:31.380> to

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500

wasted i really think that they need to
fix<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.859> before<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.399> game<00:00:32.550> goes<00:00:32.759> live<00:00:32.969> but

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
fix that before the game goes live but

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.260 
fix that before the game goes live but
so<00:00:34.890> as<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.160> see<00:00:35.340> our<00:00:35.520> opponent<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.059> built

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
so as you can see our opponent is built

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.950 
so as you can see our opponent is built
an<00:00:36.360> engineering<00:00:36.840> Bay<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.500> refinery<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:39.149> barracks

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
an engineering Bay a refinery a barracks

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.229 
an engineering Bay a refinery a barracks
and<00:00:40.469> if<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:40.739> zoom<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.160> real<00:00:41.370> close<00:00:41.399> we<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.000> see

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and if we zoom in real close we can see

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.450 
and if we zoom in real close we can see
that<00:00:42.420> they're<00:00:42.629> orange<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:44.040> they<00:00:44.190> don't

that they're orange and that they don't
believe<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.210> God<00:00:45.980> so<00:00:47.210> it's<00:00:48.210> clear<00:00:48.840> who<00:00:49.620> Jesus

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
believe in God so it's clear who Jesus

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.709 
believe in God so it's clear who Jesus
wants<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.700> win<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.680> arena<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.430> back<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.449> at

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
wants to win this arena so back up at

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.600 
wants to win this arena so back up at
our<00:00:54.840> base<00:00:55.110> um<00:00:55.440> we're<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.340> do

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
our base um we're not going to do

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.069 
our base um we're not going to do
anything<00:00:56.820> with<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> barracks<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:57.870> just

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
anything with the barracks that we just

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.420 
anything with the barracks that we just
built<00:00:58.320> because<00:00:58.710> that's<00:00:59.750> you<00:01:00.750> know<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.109> why<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
built because that's you know it why and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.539 
built because that's you know it why and
so<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.870> look<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.379> guy<00:01:04.530> who<00:01:04.589> had<00:01:05.100> built<00:01:05.309> it

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
so if you look the guy who had built it

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.340 
so if you look the guy who had built it
and<00:01:05.700> then<00:01:05.970> got<00:01:06.150> tired<00:01:06.390> has<00:01:06.689> actually<00:01:07.080> been

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
and then got tired has actually been

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.039 
and then got tired has actually been
sucked<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.189> inside<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.180> command<00:01:09.570> center<00:01:09.750> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
sucked up inside the command center and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.870 
sucked up inside the command center and
became<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> satellite<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.369> that's<00:01:11.520> kind<00:01:11.820> of

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
became a satellite so that's kind of

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.910 
became a satellite so that's kind of
neat<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.210> neat<00:01:12.479> feature<00:01:12.689> where<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.590> going

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920

well<00:05:15.740> of<00:05:15.889> course<00:05:15.919> our<00:05:16.460> evidence<00:05:16.819> was

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
well of course our evidence was

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.600

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
and sound that's essentially all there

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.809 
and sound that's essentially all there
is<00:05:23.030> to<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.389> strategy<00:05:24.220> basically<00:05:25.220> you're

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
is to the strategy basically you're

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:33.069 
is to the strategy basically you're
involved<00:05:28.030> in<00:05:29.030> weight<00:05:29.539> as<00:05:29.780> it<00:05:29.990> were<00:05:30.139> for<00:05:30.919> them
