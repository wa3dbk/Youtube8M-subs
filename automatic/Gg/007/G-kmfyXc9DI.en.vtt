00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
because

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.500 
because
probably<00:02:13.900> buy<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.170> playstation<00:02:14.860> 4<00:02:15.069> and<00:02:15.760> i

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
probably buy a playstation 4 and i

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.619 
probably buy a playstation 4 and i
probably<00:02:16.840> will<00:02:17.319> not<00:02:17.439> buy<00:02:17.680> an<00:02:17.890> xbox<00:02:18.099> 720<00:02:18.760> unless

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
probably will not buy an xbox 720 unless

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.420 
probably will not buy an xbox 720 unless
they<00:02:19.840> come<00:02:20.079> out<00:02:20.200> with<00:02:20.260> some<00:02:20.590> exclusives<00:02:21.189> that

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
they come out with some exclusives that

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.729 
they come out with some exclusives that
i<00:02:21.459> really<00:02:21.790> want<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.030> play<00:02:22.590> now<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.709> course

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
i really want to play now of course

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.860 
i really want to play now of course
there's<00:02:24.189> always<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.000> possibility<00:02:25.209> of<00:02:25.689> the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
there's always the possibility of the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.860 
there's always the possibility of the
wii<00:02:26.019> u<00:02:26.290> too<00:02:26.560> but<00:02:26.890> yeah<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:27.970> mean<00:02:28.360> we<00:02:28.569> all<00:02:28.689> know

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
wii u too but yeah I mean we all know

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.809 
wii u too but yeah I mean we all know
it's<00:02:29.049> a<00:02:29.290> generation<00:02:29.860> behind<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.340> hardware

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
it's a generation behind the hardware

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.180 
it's a generation behind the hardware
and<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.420> really<00:02:32.230> don't<00:02:32.409> think<00:02:32.470> Nintendo<00:02:33.040> would

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
and I really don't think Nintendo would

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.100 
and I really don't think Nintendo would
be<00:02:33.310> interested<00:02:34.030> anyway<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.599> mean<00:02:34.840> I'm<00:02:34.959> not

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
be interested anyway I mean I'm not

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.020 
be interested anyway I mean I'm not
going<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.700> finance<00:02:36.700> Shenmue<00:02:37.569> 3<00:02:38.879> because<00:02:39.879> they

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
going to finance Shenmue 3 because they

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.670 
going to finance Shenmue 3 because they
already<00:02:40.209> have<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.629> exclusives<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.530> they

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
already have the exclusives that they

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.949 
already have the exclusives that they
need<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.190> mean<00:02:42.640> they<00:02:42.760> have<00:02:42.970> Mario<00:02:43.390> they<00:02:43.750> have

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
need I mean they have Mario they have

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
mario kart they have donkey kong country

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.759 
mario kart they have donkey kong country
they<00:02:47.560> have<00:02:47.799> zelda<00:02:48.609> so<00:02:49.359> I<00:02:49.810> mean<00:02:50.409> they<00:02:50.530> already

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
they have zelda so I mean they already

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.589

have the exclusives they need and I

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.869 
have the exclusives they need and I
don't<00:02:52.780> think<00:02:52.930> they'd<00:02:53.079> all<00:02:53.709> be<00:02:53.950> interested<00:02:54.609> in

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
don't think they'd all be interested in

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.509 
don't think they'd all be interested in
Shenmue<00:02:55.299> 3<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:57.870> yeah<00:02:58.870> I<00:02:58.900> mean<00:02:59.290> playstation<00:03:00.220> 4

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
Shenmue 3 so yeah I mean playstation 4

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.030 
Shenmue 3 so yeah I mean playstation 4
and<00:03:00.849> Shenmue<00:03:01.629> 3<00:03:01.659> is<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:02.019> great<00:03:02.230> pairing<00:03:02.590> for<00:03:02.829> me

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
and Shenmue 3 is a great pairing for me

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.940 
and Shenmue 3 is a great pairing for me
um<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.970> course<00:03:04.000> Dreamcast<00:03:04.750> would<00:03:04.989> be<00:03:05.109> my<00:03:05.319> first

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
um of course Dreamcast would be my first

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.979 
um of course Dreamcast would be my first
choice<00:03:06.099> for<00:03:06.280> Shenmue<00:03:07.000> 3<00:03:07.030> but<00:03:07.480> we<00:03:07.720> all<00:03:07.840> know

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
choice for Shenmue 3 but we all know

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.869 
choice for Shenmue 3 but we all know
that<00:03:08.019> isn't<00:03:08.950> going<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.159> happen<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:12.310> in<00:03:12.639> terms

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
that isn't going to happen so in terms

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.020 
that isn't going to happen so in terms
of<00:03:13.209> strategy<00:03:14.049> for<00:03:14.799> how<00:03:15.220> they<00:03:15.519> should<00:03:15.579> come<00:03:15.940> out

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
of strategy for how they should come out

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.809 
of strategy for how they should come out
with<00:03:16.090> Shenmue<00:03:16.659> 3<00:03:16.889> I<00:03:17.889> think<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.370> would<00:03:18.489> be<00:03:18.519> a

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
with Shenmue 3 I think it would be a

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.170 
with Shenmue 3 I think it would be a
terrible<00:03:19.299> terrible<00:03:20.019> idea<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:21.370> just<00:03:21.609> bring<00:03:22.000> out

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
terrible terrible idea to just bring out

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.920 
terrible terrible idea to just bring out
Shenmue<00:03:22.720> 3<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.319> masses<00:03:24.269> just<00:03:25.269> like<00:03:25.449> that<00:03:25.660> I

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
Shenmue 3 to the masses just like that I

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.110 
Shenmue 3 to the masses just like that I
think<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:26.829> would<00:03:26.919> be<00:03:26.949> a<00:03:27.010> bad<00:03:27.160> idea<00:03:27.220> because<00:03:27.760> a

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
think it would be a bad idea because a

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.390 
think it would be a bad idea because a
lot<00:03:28.299> of<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:28.449> new<00:03:28.989> gamers<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:29.889> this

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
lot of the new gamers and this

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.300 
lot of the new gamers and this
generation<00:03:31.209> of<00:03:31.329> gamers<00:03:31.569> a<00:03:32.019> lot<00:03:33.010> of<00:03:33.160> them

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
generation of gamers a lot of them

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.849 
generation of gamers a lot of them
probably<00:03:33.760> have<00:03:34.269> no<00:03:34.449> clue<00:03:34.930> even<00:03:35.290> what<00:03:35.440> Shenmue

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
probably have no clue even what Shenmue

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.059 
probably have no clue even what Shenmue
is<00:03:36.160> so<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.629> bring<00:03:37.840> out<00:03:37.959> a<00:03:37.989> third<00:03:38.349> installment

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
is so to bring out a third installment

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.830 
is so to bring out a third installment
in<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.310> series<00:03:39.699> that<00:03:39.970> no<00:03:40.090> one's<00:03:40.269> ever<00:03:40.389> heard<00:03:40.629> of

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
in a series that no one's ever heard of

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.119 
in a series that no one's ever heard of
it's<00:03:41.680> probably<00:03:41.799> not<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.340> good<00:03:42.549> idea<00:03:42.629> so<00:03:43.949> what<00:03:44.949> I

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
it's probably not a good idea so what I

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.849 
it's probably not a good idea so what I
would<00:03:45.519> probably<00:03:45.669> do<00:03:46.239> is<00:03:46.510> bring<00:03:47.199> out<00:03:47.379> the

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
would probably do is bring out the

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:53.159 
would probably do is bring out the
original<00:03:48.190> two<00:03:48.669> games<00:03:49.030> in<00:03:49.480> HD<00:03:50.019> format<00:03:51.120> on<00:03:52.169> PSN
