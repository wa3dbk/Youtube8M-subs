strip canoe that my dad and I built when
I<00:00:13.080> first<00:00:13.380> started<00:00:13.650> up<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.070> was<00:00:14.370> using<00:00:14.580> an<00:00:14.849> 18<00:00:15.480> to

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
I first started up I was using an 18 to

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.710 
I first started up I was using an 18 to

lakes<00:00:22.380> while<00:00:22.590> fishing<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.359> these<00:00:24.359> were<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
lakes while fishing and these were the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.200 
lakes while fishing and these were the
connectors<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.380> were<00:00:25.949> on<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.760> was<00:00:26.939> kind

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
connectors that were on it it was kind

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.779 
connectors that were on it it was kind
of<00:00:27.300> cumbersome<00:00:27.830> to<00:00:28.830> take<00:00:29.160> these<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.730> off

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
of cumbersome to take these on and off

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.840 
of cumbersome to take these on and off
so<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.390> went<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.439> was<00:00:31.740> able<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.009> find<00:00:32.309> this

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
so I went and was able to find this

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.180 
so I went and was able to find this
quick-release<00:00:33.600> option<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.649> liked<00:00:34.950> from

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
quick-release option that I liked from

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.170 
quick-release option that I liked from
MinnKota<00:00:35.940> they<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.690> other<00:00:36.960> options<00:00:37.530> but

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
MinnKota they have other options but

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.130 
MinnKota they have other options but
this<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.480> matched<00:00:39.750> up<00:00:40.020> with<00:00:40.290> my<00:00:41.629> charger<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.110> I

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
this one matched up with my charger so I

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.410 
this one matched up with my charger so I
like<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> snipped<00:00:44.340> off<00:00:44.520> those<00:00:47.420> seed

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
like that so I snipped off those seed

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.279 
like that so I snipped off those seed
type<00:00:48.690> connectors<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:49.770> open<00:00:50.460> end<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.289> I

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
type connectors here open end and I

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.779 
type connectors here open end and I
crimped<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.340> put<00:00:54.059> shrink<00:00:54.390> wrap<00:00:54.600> over<00:00:55.789> this

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
crimped on and put shrink wrap over this

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.779 
crimped on and put shrink wrap over this
other<00:00:57.059> connector<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.379> said<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.550> is

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
other connector here like I said this is

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.880 
other connector here like I said this is
what<00:00:59.969> comes<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:02.180> my<00:01:03.180> charger<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.110> makes<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.589> nice

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
what comes on my charger so makes a nice

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.760 
what comes on my charger so makes a nice
and<00:01:05.129> easy<00:01:05.250> connect<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> battery<00:01:06.470> this<00:01:07.470> kit

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and easy connect to the battery this kit

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.760 
and easy connect to the battery this kit
also<00:01:07.920> came<00:01:08.340> with<00:01:08.930> permanent<00:01:09.930> eyelets<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.560> I

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
also came with permanent eyelets so I

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.539 
also came with permanent eyelets so I
could<00:01:11.100> connect<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.820> battery<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
could connect it up to the battery and

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.399 
could connect it up to the battery and
with<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.700> end<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.509> that's<00:01:15.659> what<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:16.380> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
with this end to so that's what I do I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.260 
with this end to so that's what I do I
just<00:01:16.740> plug<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.130> right<00:01:17.189> into<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.640> charger<00:01:18.090> I

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
just plug that right into the charger I

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.660 
just plug that right into the charger I
also<00:01:18.920> put<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:21.619> circuit<00:01:22.619> breaker<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:23.189> line

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
also put this circuit breaker in line

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.460 
also put this circuit breaker in line
too<00:01:23.939> just<00:01:24.240> for<00:01:24.420> extra<00:01:24.780> protection<00:01:25.020> as

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
too just for extra protection as

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.580 
too just for extra protection as
MinnKota<00:01:25.970> recommends<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.470> can

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
MinnKota recommends this and as you can

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.440 
MinnKota recommends this and as you can
see<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:28.979> got<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> little<00:01:29.220> reset<00:01:29.820> switch<00:01:30.119> here

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
see it's got a little reset switch here

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.539 
see it's got a little reset switch here
I<00:01:31.130> passing<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.549> battery<00:01:32.909> using<00:01:33.500> a

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
I passing it to the battery using a

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:42.050 
I passing it to the battery using a
sticky<00:01:35.869> mount<00:01:37.159> which<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:41.790> find

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
sticky mount which I like you can find

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.300 
sticky mount which I like you can find
those<00:01:42.240> at<00:01:42.299> any<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:43.470> know<00:01:43.590> local<00:01:43.829> hardware

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
those at any you know local hardware

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.780 
those at any you know local hardware
store<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.619> find<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.189> provides<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
store and I find that this provides a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.810 
store and I find that this provides a
very<00:01:47.820> simple<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.320> very<00:01:49.680> lightweight

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
very simple but very lightweight

Troy motor electrical setup and this

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.300 
Troy motor electrical setup and this

a couple hours of fishing more than

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.409 
a couple hours of fishing more than
