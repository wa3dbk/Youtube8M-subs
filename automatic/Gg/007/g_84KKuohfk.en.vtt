hopefully<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.779> can<00:00:06.990> recognize<00:00:07.529> what<00:00:07.710> this<00:00:07.859> is

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
hopefully you can recognize what this is

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.600 
hopefully you can recognize what this is
and<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.330> strand<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.690> RNA<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.469> copy<00:00:11.190> of

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
and this is the strand of RNA a copy of

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
and this is the strand of RNA a copy of
a<00:00:12.440> segment<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.860> DNA<00:00:14.130> code<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:15.389> want<00:00:15.570> to

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
a segment of the DNA code and I want to

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.109 
a segment of the DNA code and I want to
talk<00:00:15.809> about<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.500> what<00:00:17.100> we<00:00:17.640> should<00:00:17.880> find

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
talk about this and what we should find

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.080 
talk about this and what we should find
interesting<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:19.350> on<00:00:19.619> you'll<00:00:20.550> see<00:00:20.640> that

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
interesting in this on you'll see that

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.170 
interesting in this on you'll see that
you<00:00:21.720> have<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.230> strands<00:00:22.740> here<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.880> various

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
you have the strands here of the various

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.880 
you have the strands here of the various
chemicals<00:00:25.490> aug<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.599> CT<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.900> particular

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
chemicals aug a CT in particular

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.040 
chemicals aug a CT in particular
sequence<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.810> hopefully<00:00:30.810> better<00:00:30.929> i

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
sequence and hopefully better i

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.540 
sequence and hopefully better i
understand<00:00:31.380> what<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.529> means<00:00:31.769> if<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.130> please

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
understand what that means if not please

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.110 
understand what that means if not please
i<00:00:32.989> take<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> time<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.500> understand<00:00:34.910> DNA<00:00:35.910> and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
i take the time to understand DNA and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.610 
i take the time to understand DNA and
how<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.329> works<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.870> very<00:00:37.110> important<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
how it works it's very important for the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.720 
how it works it's very important for the
ideas<00:00:37.950> are<00:00:38.070> working<00:00:38.309> discuss<00:00:38.670> yet<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.410> these

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
ideas are working discuss yet and these

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.600 
ideas are working discuss yet and these
these<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.690> sequence<00:00:43.350> breaks<00:00:44.280> up<00:00:44.520> into

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
these the sequence breaks up into

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.910 
these the sequence breaks up into
three-letter<00:00:45.300> codes<00:00:46.140> which<00:00:46.559> are<00:00:46.680> called

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
three-letter codes which are called

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.779 
three-letter codes which are called
codons<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.450> eight<00:00:48.719> ug<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.190> particular<00:00:50.430> code

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
codons so eight ug is a particular code

and so on and so forth we use Lucy and

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.630 
and so on and so forth we use Lucy and
this<00:02:41.940> will<00:02:42.150> use<00:02:42.360> isoleucine<00:02:43.489> apologize<00:02:44.489> for

now<00:04:00.420> I<00:04:00.450> believe<00:04:00.720> then<00:04:01.470> some<00:04:01.950> organisms

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
now I believe then some organisms

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.539 
now I believe then some organisms
minority<00:04:03.590> there<00:04:04.590> actually<00:04:04.980> be<00:04:05.160> different

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
minority there actually be different

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.759 
minority there actually be different
that<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.390> mite<00:04:06.989> not<00:04:07.110> equal<00:04:07.500> stop

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
that you a a mite not equal stop

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.400 
that you a a mite not equal stop
instance<00:04:08.400> some<00:04:08.940> very<00:04:09.209> few<00:04:09.450> organisms<00:04:09.750> give

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
instance some very few organisms give

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.949 
instance some very few organisms give
you<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.620> example<00:04:10.890> not<00:04:11.160> saying<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:11.430> for<00:04:11.579> sure

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
you the example not saying it for sure

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.159 
you the example not saying it for sure
and<00:04:12.959> then<00:04:13.500> actually<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:14.370> might<00:04:14.910> record<00:04:15.810> for<00:04:16.140> a

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
and then actually it might record for a

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.760 
and then actually it might record for a
new<00:04:16.859> asset<00:04:17.600> so<00:04:18.600> I'm<00:04:19.019> going<00:04:19.349> to<00:04:19.380> stop<00:04:19.590> this

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
new asset so I'm going to stop this

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.860 
new asset so I'm going to stop this
video<00:04:20.099> for<00:04:20.609> now<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:21.359> I'm<00:04:21.479> going<00:04:21.599> to<00:04:21.660> leave<00:04:21.840> you

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
video for now and I'm going to leave you

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.690 
video for now and I'm going to leave you
with<00:04:22.049> this<00:04:22.289> question<00:04:22.560> think<00:04:23.190> about<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:23.520> for<00:04:23.640> a

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
with this question think about it for a

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.240 
with this question think about it for a
second

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
second

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.940 
second
what<00:04:25.250> why<00:04:25.970> is<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.420> code<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:27.260> way<00:04:27.380> it<00:04:27.440> is<00:04:27.560> why

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
what why is the code the way it is why

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.970 
what why is the code the way it is why
does<00:04:28.250> these<00:04:28.520> letters<00:04:29.300> equal<00:04:30.170> these<00:04:30.470> amino

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
does these letters equal these amino

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.820 
does these letters equal these amino
acids<00:04:31.430> now<00:04:32.210> I'll<00:04:32.450> stop<00:04:32.750> for<00:04:32.990> now<00:04:33.110> think<00:04:33.740> about

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
acids now I'll stop for now think about

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.620 
acids now I'll stop for now think about
it<00:04:34.100> and<00:04:34.310> I'll<00:04:34.700> make<00:04:34.760> another<00:04:35.000> video<00:04:35.210> or

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
it and I'll make another video or

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.900 
it and I'll make another video or
discuss
