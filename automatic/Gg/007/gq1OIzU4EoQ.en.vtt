for<00:00:49.710> at<00:00:50.399> least<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.850> couple<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.149> years<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.480> think

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
for at least a couple of years I think

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.150 
for at least a couple of years I think
and<00:00:51.870> he<00:00:51.930> sold<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.440> me<00:00:52.530> for<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.770> fantastic

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and he sold it to me for a fantastic

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.549 
and he sold it to me for a fantastic
price<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.480> return<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.899> wanted<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.350> give<00:00:55.469> him

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
price so in return I wanted to give him

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.279 
price so in return I wanted to give him
basically<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> video<00:00:56.699> he<00:00:57.600> didn't<00:00:57.809> ask<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
basically a video he didn't ask for this

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.420 
basically a video he didn't ask for this
he<00:00:58.500> probably<00:00:58.620> doesn't<00:00:58.980> even<00:00:59.039> know<00:00:59.160> I'm<00:00:59.280> making

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
he probably doesn't even know I'm making

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.700 
he probably doesn't even know I'm making
it<00:00:59.699> but<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.940> wanted<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:01.350> because<00:01:01.530> I

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
it but I wanted to do it just because I

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.650 
it but I wanted to do it just because I
thought<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.010> when<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> actually<00:01:03.059> went<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.539> him

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
thought that when I actually went to him

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.210 
thought that when I actually went to him
with<00:01:03.690> an<00:01:03.930> offer<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.229> didn't<00:01:04.559> kind<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.860> expect

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
with an offer I didn't kind of expect

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.469 
with an offer I didn't kind of expect
him<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.369> come<00:01:05.610> back<00:01:05.790> with<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> price<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.210> he

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
him to come back with a price that he

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.240 
him to come back with a price that he
did<00:01:06.720> because<00:01:07.320> when<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.530> tell<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.890> guys<00:01:08.010> the
