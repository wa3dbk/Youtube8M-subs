00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
days I think as a lot of upside if he is

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.370 
days I think as a lot of upside if he is
powerful<00:02:11.240> enough<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:11.750> i<00:02:11.870> actually<00:02:12.110> have

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
powerful enough and i actually have

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.530 
powerful enough and i actually have

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
never played with the Jays myself so I

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.850 
never played with the Jays myself so I

himself<00:03:45.590> in<00:03:45.890> modern<00:03:48.549> I've<00:03:49.549> got<00:03:49.910> a<00:03:49.940> lot<00:03:50.480> of

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
himself in modern I've got a lot of

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.840 
himself in modern I've got a lot of
upside<00:03:51.250> true<00:03:52.250> even<00:03:52.670> at<00:03:52.880> this<00:03:53.209> extreme<00:03:53.750> price

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
upside true even at this extreme price

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.650 
upside true even at this extreme price
the<00:03:55.850> reason<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.269> has<00:03:56.390> so<00:03:56.570> much<00:03:56.690> upside<00:03:57.110> is<00:03:57.459> then

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
the reason it has so much upside is then

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
the reason it has so much upside is then
during<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.959> next<00:04:00.140> year<00:04:01.480> if<00:04:02.480> he's<00:04:03.290> heavy<00:04:03.530> we

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
high risk medium reward speculation but

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.020

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
that's interesting that is interesting

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.570 
that's interesting that is interesting
to<00:05:30.590> me<00:05:30.620> because<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:33.770> best<00:05:33.979> case<00:05:34.190> scenario

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
to me because the best case scenario

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.850 
to me because the best case scenario
you've<00:05:34.930> take<00:05:35.930> your<00:05:36.050> for<00:05:36.229> Jace's<00:05:36.590> from<00:05:36.740> your

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
you've take your for Jace's from your

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.960 
you've take your for Jace's from your
standing<00:05:37.160> back<00:05:37.280> and<00:05:37.310> you<00:05:37.550> want<00:05:37.760> to<00:05:37.850> play

standing back and you want to play
madden<00:05:38.330> modern<00:05:39.140> because<00:05:39.350> it's<00:05:39.530> Madison

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
madden modern because it's Madison

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.800 
madden modern because it's Madison
because<00:05:43.010> you<00:05:43.220> want<00:05:43.400> to<00:05:43.460> do<00:05:43.550> that<00:05:43.700> just<00:05:44.600> take

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
because you want to do that just take

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:45.880 
because you want to do that just take
your<00:05:44.900> for<00:05:45.050> Jace's<00:05:45.410> and<00:05:45.560> you're<00:05:45.650> good<00:05:45.770> to<00:05:45.800> go

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
your for Jace's and you're good to go

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.719 
your for Jace's and you're good to go
and<00:05:46.190> then<00:05:46.280> you<00:05:46.400> get<00:05:46.490> so<00:05:46.669> much<00:05:46.789> value<00:05:47.180> from<00:05:47.780> that

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
and then you get so much value from that

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.890 
and then you get so much value from that
in<00:05:49.729> the<00:05:49.910> fact<00:05:50.120> that<00:05:50.240> like<00:05:50.419> you<00:05:50.570> don't<00:05:50.720> have

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
in the fact that like you don't have

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.690 
in the fact that like you don't have
like<00:05:51.140> if<00:05:51.260> you<00:05:51.350> purchase<00:05:51.770> snaps<00:05:52.100> you<00:05:52.340> can't<00:05:52.550> use

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
like if you purchase snaps you can't use

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.260 
like if you purchase snaps you can't use
him<00:05:52.850> a<00:05:52.940> standard<00:05:54.160> your<00:05:55.160> purchase<00:05:55.520> jasus<00:05:56.000> then

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
him a standard your purchase jasus then

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.379 
him a standard your purchase jasus then
maybe<00:05:56.600> you<00:05:56.750> use<00:05:56.870> him<00:05:57.020> a<00:05:57.050> standard<00:05:57.470> and<00:05:57.620> modern

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
maybe you use him a standard and modern

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.140 
maybe you use him a standard and modern
interesting<00:05:59.389> speculation<00:06:00.080> I<00:06:01.090> the<00:06:02.090> only

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
interesting speculation I the only

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.390 
interesting speculation I the only
reason<00:06:02.570> I<00:06:02.660> wouldn't<00:06:02.990> say<00:06:03.260> go<00:06:03.470> all-in<00:06:03.680> is<00:06:04.130> he's

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
reason I wouldn't say go all-in is he's

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.670 
reason I wouldn't say go all-in is he's
so<00:06:04.669> high<00:06:05.000> right<00:06:05.210> now<00:06:05.270> the<00:06:06.020> price<00:06:06.289> is<00:06:06.440> so<00:06:06.650> high

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
so high right now the price is so high

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.469 
so high right now the price is so high
