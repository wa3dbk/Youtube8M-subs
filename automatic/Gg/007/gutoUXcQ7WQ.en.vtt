00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.740
 roaring ejection also be verbal PS faster than others 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.479
 this is part of the adventure motorcycle 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:13.129
 an environmentally friendly bike 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.129
 obedient and slow 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.160
 which was also the way until Stefan Gulas Karben lives in Berlin 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.949
 Austrian is actually a mining engineer 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.829
 meanwhile he develops and builds vehicles 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.680
 Now he has missed the motorcycle a completely new drive concept 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.700
 Motorcycle what exactly what you know 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.060
 On the one hand, crib inventor Gula him loose the pedals prefer a bicycle 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.290
 On the other hand, he overtook playing cars is too fast on the way as with 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.680
 a motorcycle 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.040
 on the open track reached 80 km / h 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.040
 but there is hardly anything to hear from an engine 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.520
 you want to be a highlight 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.899
 finally cheer between motorcycle and bike 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.140
 Motor Corp's speed 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.240
 from the bike 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.110
 the operations us that the world record in it 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.360
 to be able to ride 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.560
 the countries should think about it 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.620
 a vehicle 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.620
 its muscle power can engine power 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.080
 the power of a powerful electric motor to be precise 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.439
 The combination of pedals and electric drive is known so far from 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.500
 lighter 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.850
 much weaker electric bikes 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.780
 Stefan Gulas has made the concept more effective and on a larger machine 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.080
 transfer 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.900
 this is not a bike with auxiliary engine for the team of Kent you need the 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.660
 motorcycle license 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.100
 wants to drive for the eco-friendly bike 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
 must first turn on and then pedal 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.880
 the times the bike but not directly to them do what other bikes of the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.880
 Throttle done "They govern the engine 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.589
 An electronics in the bottom bracket measures how fast you kick and 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.589
 then doses the power of the electric motor 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:20.619
 this brings the rear wheel via a toothed belt 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.459
 if you pedal slowly, you will not get much engine power 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.389
 faster the engine turns on properly 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:33.510
 That's how you reach the speed of a real bike and still feel that way 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.509
 would you ride a bike 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:43.420
 the fun stream comes from a park of 336 Special Arcos 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.540
 which can be charged at any outlet the charge is sufficient for 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.179
 60 to 80 kilometers 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:54.289
 In addition, the batteries are also filled while driving the pedal drives 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:58.809
 namely on the side of a generator on this muscle power makes electrical energy 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.999
 Twelve employees are currently making the new bike ready for series production 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:09.949
 At the end of the year, the first ten wheels will be delivered 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.949
 handmade 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:19.459
 Alu frame Carbon parts High tech Arcos To have that is not to 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.649
 bargain Price 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:23.869
 especially the immensely expensive batteries drive up the costs 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.810
 So every office will initially be as expensive as a midrange car 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.419
 "For ordinary consumers, the bike is out of the question so far 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:39.139
 but the eco-friendly concept has a future and could be mass-produced 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.099
 sometimes cheaper too 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.399
 Stefan Gulas expects the Rocket team to send out an important signal 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:48.939
 An electric vehicle does not have to be boring and sporty 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:55.880
 that's the but it's often the way Ursic Ursula can imagine in the city 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.149
 and now it is that bike 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:00.150
 at up to 80 km / h fast 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.150
 and can therefore even cars shares from DAX and Co 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:06.139
 Cars 18 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.979
 this is Stefan Gula's favorite game 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:12.080
 at the traffic lights next to a wait there want the car 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.080
 and prepare for a duel 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.080
 In green, the electric drive Schukat like the gasoline engine one 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.499
 production motorcycle 

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:23.509
 and that's one of them
