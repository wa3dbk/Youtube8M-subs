00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.579 
60s and 70s and these trees you see here
are<00:00:31.020> probably<00:00:31.320> 40<00:00:32.129> to<00:00:32.160> 50<00:00:32.609> years<00:00:32.879> old<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.589> they

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.450 
close-up so in California one of the
benefits<00:00:47.699> of<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:47.969> tree<00:00:48.359> they're<00:00:48.629> very

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
benefits of this tree they're very

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.009 
benefits of this tree they're very
drought<00:00:50.460> tolerant<00:00:50.489> most<00:00:51.359> of<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> ones<00:00:51.809> you

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
drought tolerant most of the ones you

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.189 
drought tolerant most of the ones you
see<00:00:52.289> are<00:00:53.010> older<00:00:53.850> they<00:00:54.209> were<00:00:54.269> popular<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.929> long

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
see are older they were popular a long

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.879 
see are older they were popular a long
time<00:00:55.499> ago<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.129> now<00:00:56.159> they're<00:00:56.969> not<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.420> popular

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:57.889 
time ago and now they're not so popular

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:00.079 
time ago and now they're not so popular
here<00:00:58.889> I'm<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.280> showing<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.729> a<00:00:59.760> close-up

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
here I'm just showing you a close-up

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.289 
here I'm just showing you a close-up
where<00:01:00.719> they<00:01:01.289> get<00:01:01.440> two<00:01:01.679> spiders<00:01:02.549> here<00:01:02.909> we<00:01:03.089> don't

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
where they get two spiders here we don't

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.870 
where they get two spiders here we don't
get<00:01:03.510> rain<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.199> probably<00:01:04.710> seven<00:01:05.159> eight<00:01:05.460> months

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
get rain for probably seven eight months

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.860 
get rain for probably seven eight months
out<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.360> year

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
out of the year

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.610 
out of the year
from<00:01:07.440> Spring<00:01:08.070> until<00:01:08.100> fall<00:01:08.900> here<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
from Spring until fall here and the

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.920 
from Spring until fall here and the
spiders<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.340> these<00:01:11.610> because<00:01:11.940> they're<00:01:12.540> above

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
spiders like these because they're above

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.710 
spiders like these because they're above
the<00:01:13.110> irrigation<00:01:13.620> and<00:01:14.070> they<00:01:15.030> don't<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.480> any

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
the irrigation and they don't have any

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.230 
the irrigation and they don't have any
water<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.380> them<00:01:16.620> so<00:01:16.920> they<00:01:17.130> form<00:01:17.670> their<00:01:17.850> spider

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
water on them so they form their spider

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.020 
water on them so they form their spider
webs<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.870> them<00:01:19.110> also<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.190> can<00:01:20.490> see<00:01:20.730> how<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
webs in them also you can see how the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.680 
webs in them also you can see how the
limbs<00:01:21.930> start<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.500> hang<00:01:22.740> out<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:24.000> stick<00:01:24.510> out

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
limbs start to hang out and stick out

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.860 
limbs start to hang out and stick out
kind<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.200> bad<00:01:25.530> hair<00:01:26.010> day<00:01:26.090> on<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.600> side

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
kind of like a bad hair day on the side

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.080 
kind of like a bad hair day on the side
so<00:01:28.290> as<00:01:28.530> they<00:01:28.740> get<00:01:28.920> older<00:01:29.370> that's<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
so as they get older that's one of the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.570 
so as they get older that's one of the
things<00:01:30.330> to<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.570> aware<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:31.050> there<00:01:31.890> because

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
things to be aware of there because

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.310 
things to be aware of there because
they're<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.060> high<00:01:33.300> they're<00:01:33.570> also<00:01:33.720> hard<00:01:34.230> to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
they're so high they're also hard to

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.470 
they're so high they're also hard to
prune<00:01:34.770> or<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.310> manage<00:01:35.550> as<00:01:36.030> they<00:01:36.240> get<00:01:36.420> more

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
prune or to manage as they get more

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.690 
prune or to manage as they get more
mature<00:01:36.870> so<00:01:37.800> that's<00:01:38.130> something<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.580> think

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
mature so that's something to think

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.020 
mature so that's something to think
about<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:40.370> really<00:01:41.370> if<00:01:41.490> you're<00:01:41.640> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.820> use

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
about is really if you're going to use

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.110 
about is really if you're going to use
this<00:01:42.210> for<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.480> long<00:01:42.690> term<00:01:42.960> solution<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.880> need<00:01:45.060> a

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
this for a long term solution you need a

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.840 
this for a long term solution you need a
larger<00:01:45.920> application<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.370> them<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.730> be

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
larger application for them to be

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.910 
larger application for them to be
appropriate<00:01:48.480> in<00:01:48.600> my<00:01:48.750> opinion<00:01:49.260> as<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.440> design

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
appropriate in my opinion as a design

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.910 
appropriate in my opinion as a design
element<00:01:50.150> forty<00:01:51.150> to<00:01:51.360> sixty<00:01:51.750> feet<00:01:52.260> is<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> very

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
element forty to sixty feet is a very

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.530 
element forty to sixty feet is a very
large<00:01:53.220> plant<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.850> that's<00:01:53.940> kind<00:01:54.300> of<00:01:54.360> where

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
large plant and that's kind of where

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.350 
large plant and that's kind of where
they<00:01:54.659> max<00:01:54.930> out<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.370> get<00:01:56.550> as<00:01:56.700> wide<00:01:57.000> as

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
they max out and they can get as wide as

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.190 
they max out and they can get as wide as
you<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.350> six<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.890> seven<00:01:59.370> feet<00:01:59.690> wide<00:02:00.690> with

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
you know six to seven feet wide with

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.860 
you know six to seven feet wide with
maturity<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.070> even<00:02:02.610> wider<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.300> generally<00:02:03.840> I

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
maturity and even wider but generally I

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.149 
maturity and even wider but generally I
haven't<00:02:04.260> seen<00:02:04.500> too<00:02:04.680> many<00:02:04.710> wider<00:02:05.190> than<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:07.159> so

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159 
haven't seen too many wider than that so

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.479

where<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.209> use<00:02:09.420> them<00:02:09.659> in<00:02:09.810> design<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.560> design<00:02:11.099> I

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
where to use them in design in design I

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.509 
where to use them in design in design I
think<00:02:11.969> they're<00:02:12.569> great<00:02:12.870> as<00:02:13.260> very<00:02:14.069> strong

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
think they're great as very strong

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:15.330 
think they're great as very strong

to a more prominent residence I think

these used to be used as you see here is

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.949 
these used to be used as you see here is
an<00:02:35.260> effort<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:35.890> screen<00:02:36.340> people<00:02:36.959> between

an effort to screen people between

an effort to screen people between

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.960 
properties I've never really cared for
that<00:02:40.480> because<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.440> feels<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:41.890> soldiers<00:02:42.310> kind

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
that because it feels like soldiers kind

that because it feels like soldiers kind
of<00:02:43.090> lining<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:43.780> property<00:02:44.319> and<00:02:44.500> and

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
of lining the property and and

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.180 
of lining the property and and
protecting<00:02:45.849> it<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.239> for<00:02:46.540> me<00:02:46.769> this<00:02:47.769> isn't<00:02:47.980> a

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
protecting it so for me this isn't a

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.270 
protecting it so for me this isn't a
tree<00:02:48.459> that<00:02:48.640> we<00:02:48.790> use<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.060> lot<00:02:49.390> because<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:50.440> to

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
tree that we use a lot because it to

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.030 
tree that we use a lot because it to
feel<00:02:51.760> right<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.299> in<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.870> right<00:02:53.049> context<00:02:53.860> I

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
feel right and in the right context I

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.370 
feel right and in the right context I
think<00:02:54.640> there's<00:02:55.360> very<00:02:55.599> few<00:02:56.849> design<00:02:58.380> situations

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
think there's very few design situations

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.170 
think there's very few design situations
where<00:02:59.680> that's<00:02:59.890> an<00:03:00.069> appropriate<00:03:00.400> feel<00:03:00.970> at

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
where that's an appropriate feel at

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.699 
where that's an appropriate feel at
least<00:03:01.360> for<00:03:01.599> what<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.780> do<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:02.170> do<00:03:02.349> a<00:03:02.470> lot<00:03:02.680> of

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
least for what I do I do a lot of

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.770 
least for what I do I do a lot of
residential<00:03:03.489> design<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:04.060> for<00:03:04.269> me<00:03:04.420> this<00:03:04.599> is<00:03:04.750> a

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
residential design and for me this is a

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.020 
residential design and for me this is a
larger<00:03:05.260> plant<00:03:05.560> for<00:03:05.920> larger<00:03:06.280> applications

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
larger plant for larger applications

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.990 
larger plant for larger applications
this<00:03:07.900> is<00:03:08.110> a<00:03:08.140> very<00:03:08.470> drought<00:03:08.799> tolerant<00:03:08.829> plant<00:03:09.760> in

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
this is a very drought tolerant plant in

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.910 
this is a very drought tolerant plant in
Northern<00:03:10.360> California<00:03:10.540> we<00:03:11.290> have<00:03:11.440> low<00:03:11.709> humidity

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
Northern California we have low humidity

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.600 
Northern California we have low humidity
below<00:03:12.549> 20%<00:03:13.120> most<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:14.079> the<00:03:14.230> year<00:03:14.560> we<00:03:15.129> don't<00:03:15.370> have

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
below 20% most of the year we don't have

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.280 
below 20% most of the year we don't have
any<00:03:15.940> rain<00:03:16.299> for<00:03:16.780> seven<00:03:17.290> months<00:03:17.500> or<00:03:17.799> so<00:03:18.069> so<00:03:19.290> and

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
any rain for seven months or so so and

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.840 
any rain for seven months or so so and
that's<00:03:20.590> during<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.100> heat<00:03:21.280> of<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.519> year<00:03:21.730> as

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
that's during the heat of the year as

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.569 
that's during the heat of the year as
well<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:22.150> it's<00:03:23.139> very<00:03:23.410> drought<00:03:23.799> tolerant<00:03:23.829> I

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
well so it's very drought tolerant I

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.759 
well so it's very drought tolerant I
think<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.269> does<00:03:25.510> look<00:03:25.750> much<00:03:25.959> better<00:03:26.290> when<00:03:26.650> it

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
think it does look much better when it

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.270 
think it does look much better when it
gets<00:03:26.980> some<00:03:27.190> summer<00:03:27.549> rain<00:03:28.500> but<00:03:29.500> again<00:03:30.069> it's

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
gets some summer rain but again it's

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.210 
gets some summer rain but again it's
native<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:31.470> Mediterranean<00:03:32.470> areas<00:03:32.859> where<00:03:33.069> they

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
native to Mediterranean areas where they

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.949 
native to Mediterranean areas where they
don't<00:03:33.250> get<00:03:33.609> much<00:03:33.819> summer<00:03:34.120> rain<00:03:34.389> and<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:34.780> does

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
don't get much summer rain and it does

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.259 
don't get much summer rain and it does
just<00:03:35.230> find<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:35.739> just<00:03:36.160> think<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.519> foliage<00:03:36.910> looks

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
just find I just think the foliage looks

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.319 
just find I just think the foliage looks
less<00:03:37.930> dried<00:03:38.319> out<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.799> a<00:03:38.859> little<00:03:39.519> happier<00:03:39.910> than

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
less dried out and a little happier than

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.830 
less dried out and a little happier than
what<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.660> see<00:03:40.870> here<00:03:41.230> when<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:41.500> gets<00:03:41.709> that<00:03:41.920> rain

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
what you see here when it gets that rain

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.740 
what you see here when it gets that rain
so<00:03:43.840> there's<00:03:44.319> a<00:03:44.410> variety<00:03:44.650> called<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.669> tiny<00:03:46.299> Tower

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
so there's a variety called a tiny Tower

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.900 
so there's a variety called a tiny Tower
and<00:03:47.169> it<00:03:47.319> only<00:03:47.410> gets<00:03:47.680> about<00:03:47.919> eight<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.669> ten<00:03:48.880> feet

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
and it only gets about eight to ten feet

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.960 
and it only gets about eight to ten feet
high<00:03:49.209> and<00:03:49.780> two<00:03:50.019> feet<00:03:50.290> wide<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.950> think<00:03:51.459> for<00:03:51.669> a<00:03:51.700> lot

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
high and two feet wide I think for a lot

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.030 
high and two feet wide I think for a lot
of<00:03:52.000> applications<00:03:52.959> that<00:03:53.079> would<00:03:53.410> be<00:03:53.590> one<00:03:53.829> that

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
of applications that would be one that

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.890 
of applications that would be one that
one<00:03:54.280> could<00:03:54.519> use<00:03:54.849> when<00:03:55.389> you<00:03:55.540> want<00:03:55.690> this

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
one could use when you want this

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.000 
one could use when you want this
columnar<00:03:56.590> feel<00:03:56.980> in<00:03:57.250> your<00:03:57.760> design<00:03:58.739> again<00:03:59.739> as<00:03:59.919> I

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
columnar feel in your design again as I

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.699 
columnar feel in your design again as I
said<00:04:00.069> earlier<00:04:00.549> this<00:04:00.760> is<00:04:00.819> a<00:04:00.970> very<00:04:01.060> high<00:04:01.870> sorry

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
said earlier this is a very high sorry

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.979 
said earlier this is a very high sorry
tall<00:04:03.010> grower<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:03.700> for<00:04:04.480> very<00:04:04.720> few

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
tall grower and for very few

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.339 
tall grower and for very few
applications<00:04:05.739> is<00:04:05.980> that<00:04:06.010> appropriate<00:04:06.549> so

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
applications is that appropriate so

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.920 
applications is that appropriate so
that's<00:04:08.349> what<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:08.560> can<00:04:08.650> tell<00:04:08.859> you<00:04:09.280> about<00:04:09.930> Italian

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
that's what I can tell you about Italian
