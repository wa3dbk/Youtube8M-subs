00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.060
 on Russian railways started 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.300
 delivery of the newest electric locomotives ip20 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.150
 it is planned that until the end of 2013 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.070
 will get 36 locomotives part of them 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.049
 will transport passengers on the route 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.250
 Moscow Sochi including during 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.800
 Winter Olympics 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.010
 6 locomotives are already being run on 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.330
 Moscow Railway Depot Moscow 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.519
 Ryazan sorting first 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.519
 The results of the work learned Dina Vlaskina 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.100
 alexander keg machinist works 12 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.050
 years experience decent on his not enough 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.240
 for work on the new locomotive 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.820
 Generations Alexander one of the first 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.690
 passed training at the factory 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.820
 in Novocherkassk 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.239
 now he is helping other locomotives 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.200
 teams to master ip20 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:55.379
 but Cherkassy studies we studied schemes there 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.129
 electric locomotive 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.940
 accordingly how to manage it well in 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.570
 while running it shows itself while 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.400
 very good this is the first lecturers with 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.530
 there is also a separate toilet 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.690
 video camera microwave 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.350
 automatic blinds and even heating 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.270
 the seats 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.550
 all this is better for me only at first 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.510
 look but they create a comfortable 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.890
 working environment for locomotive crews in 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.650
 plans means and direction thrust and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.229
 leadership rzh gradual transition 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.670
 does train driving by machinists 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.190
 wave to face well, just like you are now 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.170
 see metro and this locomotive 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.479
 you wear all the conditions created especially in 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.520
 Perspective means to organize work 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.189
 or driving trains will be correct 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.350
 say one face like this new 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.909
 electric locomotive solves the question rational 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.159
 work locomotive crews 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.380
 this is only part of the economic benefits 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.979
 its main feature is work as 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.500
 alternating 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.630
 so on dc it will allow not 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.880
 change locomotive on one route 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.789
 which will reduce the time of parking us such 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.100
 stations almost five times the speed 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.250
 Delivery increases besides if 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.289
 we used to carry train data in two 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.960
 let's say a plot of some drove through 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.950
 two locomotives used labor 2 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.020
 locomotive brigades 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.850
 it is natural now it will all be 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.130
 make 1 locomotive 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.810
 say novices lucky here and for ip20 in 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.540
 the depot created all the conditions 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.680
 special power supply 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.740
 infrastructure for refueling locomotives 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.690
 sand and plot ac in 27 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.630
 kilovolts for its technical condition 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.820
 are being watched by depot staff and 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.010
 manufacturing companies monitor everything 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.800
 remarks remarks in operative 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.360
 order are sent to but cherkassky 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.330
 plant to next 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.990
 locomotive came already eliminated by them 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.660
 remarks at the factory when its already 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.030
 build from voltage drops to hang 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.530
 software systems for now 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.720
 this is the main snag 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.580
 but experts say the costs are 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.950
 maintenance of this 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.510
 electric locomotive will be less than others on 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.490
 maintenance he will 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.490
 go every 15,000 kilometers 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.960
 long and 20 are technical 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.250
 run-in gave it send to member 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.740
 Moscow, Saint Petersburg 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.210
 there will be speed tests because 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.730
 he is primarily a high-speed electric train 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.310
 and is capable of speeds up to two hundred 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.560
 kilometers per hour it is waiting for routes from 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.010
 moscow to adler minsk helsinki and in 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.010
 other cities
