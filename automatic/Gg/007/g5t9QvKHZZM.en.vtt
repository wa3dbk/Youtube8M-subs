00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.140 

so<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.890> beginning<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.190> program<00:00:05.580> we<00:00:05.759> start

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
so the beginning the program we start

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.390 
so the beginning the program we start
off<00:00:06.210> with<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.390> slew<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.109> ideation<00:00:07.500> sketches<00:00:08.220> and

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
off with a slew of ideation sketches and

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.270 
off with a slew of ideation sketches and
what<00:00:08.970> we<00:00:09.090> do<00:00:09.269> in<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:09.929> exploration<00:00:10.469> phase<00:00:10.950> is

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
what we do in this exploration phase is

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.580 
what we do in this exploration phase is
really<00:00:12.000> trying<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.420> flush<00:00:12.630> out<00:00:12.840> one<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
really trying to flush out one of the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.189 
really trying to flush out one of the
most<00:00:14.340> appropriate<00:00:14.730> design<00:00:15.330> elements<00:00:15.809> for<00:00:16.049> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
most appropriate design elements for the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.340 
most appropriate design elements for the
car<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:17.520> developed<00:00:17.760> three<00:00:18.270> final<00:00:18.690> design

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
car so we developed three final design

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.380 
car so we developed three final design
themes<00:00:19.680> represented<00:00:20.520> here<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.820> these<00:00:20.910> images

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
themes represented here in these images

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.200 
themes represented here in these images
ultimately<00:00:22.289> we<00:00:22.500> want<00:00:22.619> here<00:00:23.010> with<00:00:23.189> with<00:00:23.640> da<00:00:23.850> is

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
ultimately we want here with with da is

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.540 
ultimately we want here with with da is
this<00:00:24.359> really<00:00:24.720> represented<00:00:25.590> perhaps<00:00:26.070> more<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
this really represented perhaps more the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.480 
this really represented perhaps more the
brutal<00:00:27.330> side<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> three<00:00:28.830> design<00:00:29.130> themes

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
brutal side of the three design themes

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.400 
brutal side of the three design themes
but<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.210> there<00:00:30.359> were<00:00:30.630> elements<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.170> some<00:00:31.349> of

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
but but there were elements of some of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.049 
but but there were elements of some of
the<00:00:31.500> other<00:00:31.619> themes<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.070> really<00:00:32.430> influenced

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
the other themes that really influenced

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.459 
the other themes that really influenced
the<00:00:33.270> final<00:00:33.719> design<00:00:35.960> every<00:00:36.960> more<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.230> guy<00:00:37.410> is

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the final design every more this guy is

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.130 
the final design every more this guy is
brand<00:00:37.860> new<00:00:37.980> every<00:00:38.850> single<00:00:39.149> part<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:39.600> design<00:00:39.930> we

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
brand new every single part we design we

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.350 
brand new every single part we design we
reinvented<00:00:40.649> there's<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.309> lot<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.520> key<00:00:41.790> elements

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
reinvented there's a lot of key elements

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.810 
reinvented there's a lot of key elements
which<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.200> took<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.710> build<00:00:44.160> inspired<00:00:44.579> from

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
which we took and build inspired from

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.569 
which we took and build inspired from
our<00:00:45.030> heritage<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.899> there's<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> certainly

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
our heritage and there's a certainly

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.020 
our heritage and there's a certainly
bloodline<00:00:48.420> running<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.960> entire<00:00:49.649> car<00:00:50.030> we

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
bloodline running to entire car we

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.760 
bloodline running to entire car we
talked<00:00:51.239> about<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.840> punching<00:00:52.320> out<00:00:52.469> quality

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
talked about this punching out quality

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.860 
talked about this punching out quality
this<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.190> fist<00:00:53.640> breaking<00:00:54.090> through<00:00:54.300> glass<00:00:54.570> or

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
this is fist breaking through glass or

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.590 
this is fist breaking through glass or
punching<00:00:55.289> through<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> wind<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:57.390> whole

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
punching through the wind and the whole

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.000 
punching through the wind and the whole
front<00:00:57.899> end<00:00:57.960> was<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.379> developed<00:00:58.530> around

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
front end was really developed around

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.490 
front end was really developed around
this<00:00:59.219> theme<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.760> that's<00:01:00.600> been<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> historic

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
this theme and that's been a historic

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.369 
this theme and that's been a historic
you<00:01:02.129> from<00:01:02.370> Mustang<00:01:02.820> since<00:01:03.329> day<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.229> can

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
you from Mustang since day one you can

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.070 
you from Mustang since day one you can
see<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.220> dominant<00:01:05.640> shark<00:01:05.820> nose<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.390> which<00:01:06.900> we

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
see the dominant shark nose but which we

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.219 
see the dominant shark nose but which we
actually<00:01:07.619> took<00:01:07.799> from<00:01:08.040> our<00:01:08.479> 64<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.750> half<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
actually took from our 64 and a half and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.440 
actually took from our 64 and a half and
two<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.560> 69<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.790> see<00:01:11.939> our<00:01:12.090> headlights

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
two and 69 you can see our headlights

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.560 
two and 69 you can see our headlights
came<00:01:12.750> much<00:01:12.990> more<00:01:13.229> forward<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.890> i<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.100> this

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
came much more forward so i have this

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.330 
came much more forward so i have this
forward-facing<00:01:15.570> look<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.590> our<00:01:16.770> nose<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.280> very

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
forward-facing look and our nose is very

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.149 
forward-facing look and our nose is very
proud<00:01:18.259> you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.979> whole

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
proud you can see the the whole

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.010 
proud you can see the the whole
silhouette<00:01:20.520> were<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.030> did<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.570> new<00:01:21.750> car

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
silhouette were we did for the new car

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.539 
silhouette were we did for the new car
basically<00:01:22.200> removed<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.830> entire<00:01:23.070> cabin

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
basically removed the entire cabin

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.899 
basically removed the entire cabin
reward<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.810> gives<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.229> actually<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
reward so that gives you actually a

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.910 
reward so that gives you actually a
longer<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.030> hood<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:28.020> creates<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.500> more

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
longer a hood and it creates a more

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.249 
longer a hood and it creates a more
selfish<00:01:29.430> greenhouse<00:01:30.180> cabin<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.869> for<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
selfish greenhouse cabin for the for the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.319 
selfish greenhouse cabin for the for the
driver<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.240> gives<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:35.329> 6465

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
driver and and it gives you that 6465

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.899 
driver and and it gives you that 6465
look<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.229> car<00:01:37.439> we're<00:01:38.310> really<00:01:38.579> looking<00:01:38.670> at

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
look of the car we're really looking at

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.910 
look of the car we're really looking at
all<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> design<00:01:39.689> elements<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.380> how<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.530> could

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
all the design elements and how we could

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.030 
all the design elements and how we could
evolve<00:01:41.610> them<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.270> send<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.930> new<00:01:43.259> modern<00:01:43.530> message

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
evolve them to send a new modern message

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.789 
evolve them to send a new modern message
and<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:44.880> ultimately<00:01:45.030> ended<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.840> along<00:01:46.619> this

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and we ultimately ended up along this

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.289 
and we ultimately ended up along this
theme<00:01:47.070> here<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.700> what<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.090> call<00:01:48.270> a

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
theme here with this what we call a

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.080 
theme here with this what we call a
unified<00:01:48.890> diello<00:01:49.890> graphic<00:01:50.399> which<00:01:50.729> stands<00:01:51.000> for

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
unified diello graphic which stands for

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.859 
unified diello graphic which stands for
daylight<00:01:51.689> opening<00:01:52.110> ie<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.950> side<00:01:53.130> glass<00:01:53.369> and

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
daylight opening ie the side glass and

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.539 
daylight opening ie the side glass and
once<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:54.960> came<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.470> conclusion<00:01:55.649> it

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
once we came to this conclusion it

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.670 
once we came to this conclusion it
really<00:01:56.850> helped<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.780> modernize<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.439> car

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
really helped to to modernize the car

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.980 
really helped to to modernize the car
and<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.310> bring<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.700> into<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.030> new<00:02:00.810> dimension

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
and just bring it into a new dimension

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.469 
and just bring it into a new dimension
it<00:02:01.560> also<00:02:01.890> helped<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:03.000> set<00:02:03.270> up<00:02:03.360> a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
it also helped to really set up a

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.030 
it also helped to really set up a
fastback<00:02:03.899> profile<00:02:04.439> for<00:02:04.740> us

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
fastback profile for us

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.330 
fastback profile for us
we<00:02:07.040> made<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.370> rear<00:02:07.720> track<00:02:08.720> wider<00:02:09.250> pull<00:02:10.250> the

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
we made the rear track wider pull the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.790 
we made the rear track wider pull the
haunch<00:02:10.550> rear<00:02:10.880> outboard<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.870> then<00:02:12.440> they<00:02:12.590> made

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
haunch rear outboard and then they made

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.070 
haunch rear outboard and then they made
a<00:02:12.830> backlight<00:02:13.250> nearer<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:13.970> in<00:02:14.780> order<00:02:14.930> to

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
a backlight nearer so in order to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.930 
a backlight nearer so in order to
achieve<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.590> really<00:02:16.160> wide<00:02:16.340> fender<00:02:16.730> which

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
achieve that really wide fender which

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.170 
achieve that really wide fender which
gives<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:17.420> massacre<00:02:17.930> okay<00:02:18.700> we<00:02:19.700> pulled

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
gives you that massacre okay we pulled

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.970 
gives you that massacre okay we pulled
the<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.600> wheels<00:02:20.780> out<00:02:21.020> 20<00:02:21.410> millimeters<00:02:21.890> per

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
the the wheels out 20 millimeters per

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.400 
the the wheels out 20 millimeters per
side<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:23.210> really<00:02:23.570> allowed<00:02:23.840> us<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.110> get<00:02:24.380> a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
side and that really allowed us to get a

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.130 
side and that really allowed us to get a
very<00:02:24.920> very<00:02:25.190> strong<00:02:25.340> muscular<00:02:26.300> hunched<00:02:26.750> over

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
very very strong muscular hunched over

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.890 
very very strong muscular hunched over
the<00:02:27.770> rear<00:02:27.950> wheels<00:02:28.220> what<00:02:29.120> we<00:02:29.240> also<00:02:29.360> said<00:02:29.750> we

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
the rear wheels what we also said we

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.270 
the rear wheels what we also said we
want<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.170> have<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.320> three<00:02:30.560> dimensional<00:02:30.740> quality

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
want to have a three dimensional quality

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.500 
want to have a three dimensional quality
on<00:02:31.550> this<00:02:31.640> car<00:02:31.850> if<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.060> look<00:02:32.209> at<00:02:32.300> all<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
on this car if you look at all the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.780 
on this car if you look at all the
surfacing<00:02:33.050> through<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.890> decklid<00:02:34.310> it's<00:02:34.580> it's

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
surfacing through the decklid it's it's

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.820 
surfacing through the decklid it's it's
a<00:02:34.940> very<00:02:34.970> three-dimensional<00:02:35.500> it's<00:02:36.500> very

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
a very three-dimensional it's very

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.580 
a very three-dimensional it's very
unique<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.580> think<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.420> taillights<00:02:38.840> we<00:02:39.080> took

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
unique I think the taillights we took

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.370 
unique I think the taillights we took
the<00:02:39.740> next<00:02:39.920> step<00:02:40.040> we<00:02:40.790> got<00:02:40.970> inspired<00:02:41.300> by<00:02:41.540> 69<00:02:42.080> cars

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
the next step we got inspired by 69 cars

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.380 
the next step we got inspired by 69 cars
but<00:02:42.680> we<00:02:42.980> did<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.160> in<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.489> very<00:02:43.520> modern<00:02:44.000> way

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
but we did it in a very modern way

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.720 
but we did it in a very modern way
you'll<00:02:45.050> be<00:02:45.080> able<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.380> identify<00:02:45.620> this<00:02:46.040> car<00:02:46.430> from

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
you'll be able to identify this car from

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.150 
you'll be able to identify this car from
miles<00:02:47.450> down<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.900> road<00:02:48.080> just<00:02:48.770> with<00:02:48.980> those

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
miles down the road just with those

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.790 
miles down the road just with those
tri-bar<00:02:49.670> taillamps<00:02:50.330> illuminated<00:02:51.140> at<00:02:51.770> night

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
tri-bar taillamps illuminated at night

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.870 
tri-bar taillamps illuminated at night
it's<00:02:52.580> unmistakable<00:02:53.450> Mustang
