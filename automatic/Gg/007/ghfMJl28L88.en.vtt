00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.680
 to do that it is certain 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.860
 hi to all the people this is to vox 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.809
 management you put in making bets 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.369
 to death the health me it's going nickel despite 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.260
 I am a little sick I think 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.830
 I heated the watsa glue it's not 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.240
 very serious 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.099
 we might have a little bit 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.010
 before 20 I find you today 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:30.560
 for a little trick in the risers 2 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.270
 in zombie mode good if you get technical 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.650
 so it's not really a glitch I 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.750
 do not think we can call it 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.760
 that because he does not know it's a 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.430
 tip that was found sending by me 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.479
 but by ngt zombies surely had the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.890
 takes elsewhere on another channel 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:47.540
 I just hope this little trick 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.670
 you do it so it's very simple it's 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.870
 really really very very simple he 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.489
 you simply need to 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.350
 take the lay that made catr there you 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.850
 see again that you 're not even 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.680
 obliged but above all what it takes is 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.930
 four thrusters as you can 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.100
 to see that he manufactures it's easily he 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.070
 there is tutorial on the internet you can 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.650
 it's very simple and look it's 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.770
 just a fun part but total 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.729
 crazy hobbies on you and the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.799
 boosters are then they did not even 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.689
 no cooldown is it in flight 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.520
 simply all the zombies everywhere 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.899
 it's just huge by cons fagaf 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.250
 look at my teammate at the end and got 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.649
 makes return the zeal so you have to have 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.090
 a certain technique but after that it's 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.789
 just huge and you can do it from 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.049
 points easily and after a while 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.079
 I think we see elsewhere in 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.229
 this video the thrusters explodes 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.060
 because the orbival and hurt them to 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.200
 destroy them little by little or when you 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.929
 you shoot you may not want 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.579
 account but you put balls so 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.100
 these poor in russia just a trick 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.810
 nice I do not think it can 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.130
 really skewed the world rankings 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.439
 because you are very fast 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.149
 start one is propelled ourselves and 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.369
 we're really in ub zone now 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.210
 dangerous and in addition it lasts only 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.090
 some handle portion 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.020
 I think it's more 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.040
 to delirious it is also for that 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.390
 that in this trick because 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.860
 maybe he'll be patched not 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.330
 really if it was expo it would surprise me 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.070
 but good for me I tell you about 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.650
 this trick that is really huge 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.680
 we get tired when we do this look 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.570
 I fly to the remains of dozens of 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.130
 meters he just tries and then so there 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.400
 you can see that it's broken and 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.980
 it does not matter you just have to 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.450
 put here and the orbi before will run 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.100
 to you and is simply taking the 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.450
 thruster just watch out for the little 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.370
 door that is behind us for when 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.040
 we cover you because it's 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.150
 down it's a bit of a mess you see 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.870
 it's just epic and it makes us 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.550
 raving so 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.040
 so that's so it's not really a 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.570
 glitch I do not want the budget nor whatever 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.250
 it's just a little trick 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.080
 good morocco for you to take 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.790
 pleasure because finally this is it 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.310
 zombie is having fun before 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.950
 all suspense and so here I hope that 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.440
 the video you liked what I missed a 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.950
 little delirium like that do not hesitate to 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.489
 subscribe to these videos you like 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.020
 all still discover the dlc life of this 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.550
 black ops do not hesitate to let go 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.170
 little lay people etc etc 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.459
 and as for me I tell you to very 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.459
 soon it was eyebox
