00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
on the JT Pro flex there's a reason it's

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.420

been<00:00:24.779> around<00:00:24.960> since<00:00:25.260> 2005<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.310> that's

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
been around since 2005 and that's

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.009 
been around since 2005 and that's
because<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:26.910> one<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.210> best<00:00:27.449> masks<00:00:27.900> on
