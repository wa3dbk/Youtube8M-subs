me<00:03:13.240> does<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:18.850> does<00:03:19.090> allow<00:03:19.420> for<00:03:19.690> great

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
me does it it does allow for great

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.060 
me does it it does allow for great
possibility<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:21.150> with<00:03:22.150> most<00:03:22.750> figures<00:03:23.260> for

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
possibility and with most figures for

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.280 
possibility and with most figures for
this<00:03:24.250> line<00:03:24.810> something<00:03:25.810> with<00:03:27.600> extra<00:03:28.600> pairs<00:03:28.930> of

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
this line something with extra pairs of

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.260 
this line something with extra pairs of
hands<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:31.720> really<00:03:31.990> does<00:03:32.230> come<00:03:32.650> up<00:03:32.860> with<00:03:33.180> or<00:03:34.180> it

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
hands it really does come up with or it

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.810 
hands it really does come up with or it
does<00:03:34.450> come<00:03:34.690> up<00:03:34.720> with<00:03:35.050> a<00:03:35.200> lot<00:03:35.410> of<00:03:35.820> great

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
does come up with a lot of great

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:43.070 
does come up with a lot of great
possibility<00:03:37.540> ideas

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.350 

now<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.920> only<00:03:45.130> thing<00:03:45.220> that<00:03:45.520> really<00:03:45.790> keeps<00:03:46.120> us

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
now the only thing that really keeps us

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.830 
now the only thing that really keeps us
from<00:03:46.540> being<00:03:46.600> like<00:03:47.020> what<00:03:47.230> my<00:03:47.440> favorite<00:03:48.840> Goku

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
from being like what my favorite Goku

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.140 
from being like what my favorite Goku
figures<00:03:50.290> which<00:03:50.740> it's<00:03:51.040> pretty<00:03:51.430> close<00:03:51.700> up<00:03:51.940> there

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
figures which it's pretty close up there

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.850 
figures which it's pretty close up there
it's<00:03:52.390> just<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.890> hair<00:03:54.160> sculpt<00:03:55.140> is<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.200> little

loss as a whisper same three hairs on
this<00:04:05.980> is<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.580> rag<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:07.240> looks<00:04:07.450> like<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:08.430> don't

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
this is a to rag it looks like I don't

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.450 
this is a to rag it looks like I don't
know<00:04:09.730> at<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.510> top<00:04:10.750> of<00:04:10.990> a<00:04:11.140> pineapple<00:04:11.530> from<00:04:12.280> this

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
know at the top of a pineapple from this

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.610 
know at the top of a pineapple from this
angle<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:15.250> can<00:04:15.460> really<00:04:15.670> tell<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:15.940> difference

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
angle you can really tell the difference

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:25.560 
angle you can really tell the difference
I<00:04:17.700> get<00:04:18.700> this<00:04:18.970> one<00:04:19.209> here<00:04:23.910> this<00:04:24.910> one<00:04:24.970> just<00:04:25.420> has

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
I get this one here this one just has

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.440 
I get this one here this one just has
more<00:04:25.870> of<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.110> natural<00:04:26.320> foot<00:04:26.770> in<00:04:26.890> this<00:04:27.010> one

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
more of a natural foot in this one

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.750 
more of a natural foot in this one
because<00:04:28.450> it's<00:04:29.290> really<00:04:29.500> made<00:04:29.770> of<00:04:29.950> like<00:04:30.280> three

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
because it's really made of like three

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.200 
because it's really made of like three
pieces<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.890> forward<00:04:32.890> section<00:04:33.130> mid<00:04:33.910> section

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
pieces the forward section mid section

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.750 
pieces the forward section mid section
here<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.380> back<00:04:35.620> section<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:36.400> they<00:04:36.580> all

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
here and the back section and they all

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.260 
here and the back section and they all
really<00:04:37.120> just<00:04:37.330> don't<00:04:37.710> go<00:04:38.710> together<00:04:38.890> that<00:04:39.160> well

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.290 

I'm<00:04:43.270> not<00:04:43.480> sure<00:04:43.870> how<00:04:44.220> hard<00:04:45.220> this<00:04:45.640> particular

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
I'm not sure how hard this particular

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.560 
I'm not sure how hard this particular
figure<00:04:46.810> is<00:04:46.840> to<00:04:47.320> come<00:04:47.710> across<00:04:47.980> these<00:04:48.940> days<00:04:49.270> but

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
figure is to come across these days but

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.780 
figure is to come across these days but
I<00:04:49.630> got<00:04:49.930> him<00:04:51.660> probably<00:04:52.660> about<00:04:53.370> three<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.640> a

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
I got him probably about three and a

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.060 
I got him probably about three and a
half<00:04:54.820> years<00:04:55.390> ago<00:04:55.890> but<00:04:58.320> if<00:04:59.320> you're<00:04:59.530> looking<00:04:59.860> for

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
half years ago but if you're looking for

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.580 
half years ago but if you're looking for
really<00:05:00.820> small<00:05:00.940> or<00:05:01.690> not<00:05:01.930> really<00:05:02.169> small<00:05:02.350> but<00:05:02.560> a

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
really small or not really small but a

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.010 
really small or not really small but a
fairly<00:05:02.890> small<00:05:03.300> really<00:05:04.300> well<00:05:04.510> particularly

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
fairly small really well particularly

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.440 
fairly small really well particularly
fear<00:05:05.440> I<00:05:05.800> would<00:05:06.340> definitely<00:05:06.880> recommend<00:05:06.940> them

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
fear I would definitely recommend them

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.100 
fear I would definitely recommend them
just<00:05:07.870> don't<00:05:08.140> really<00:05:08.560> expect<00:05:09.010> for<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.370> most

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
just don't really expect for the most

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.890 
just don't really expect for the most
show<00:05:11.110> accurate<00:05:12.150> sculpts<00:05:13.150> with<00:05:13.330> these<00:05:13.480> figures

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
show accurate sculpts with these figures

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.110 
show accurate sculpts with these figures
so<00:05:14.770> overall<00:05:15.220> I'm<00:05:15.490> going<00:05:15.700> to<00:05:15.760> give<00:05:15.940> this<00:05:16.060> the

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
so overall I'm going to give this the

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.970 
so overall I'm going to give this the
year<00:05:16.480> a<00:05:17.550> 7<00:05:18.550> out<00:05:18.790> of<00:05:18.820> 10
