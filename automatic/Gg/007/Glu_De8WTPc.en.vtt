00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:03.020
 hi everyone today we will talk about one 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.240
 of the main features on 58 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.379
 Narain was taken for a centerback opportunity 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:10.059
 I consider that 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.429
 device positioning touch 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:13.549
 screen like 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.459
 arrange to listen to music 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.240
 or for 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.910
 photographic functions not exactly 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.859
 justified 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.409
 but the Internet is what 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:24.569
 especially well suited to these 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:26.209
 devices as they are equipped with large 

00:00:26.209 --> 00:00:28.939
 good resolution screens and 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.579
 touch as they say 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.579
 opportunities so internet 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.980
 you can go two ways here I have 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.210
 Dads special folder online or through 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.370
 Express panel button go 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.940
 through her 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.240
 I have already uploaded 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.500
 the site seems to be the title page 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.780
 yandex 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.780
 bottom in addition to the function keys 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.620
 were present and excellent 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.440
 there are three more contextual keys 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.800
 one of them causes scale 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.870
 the second 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.870
 address introduction 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.920
 the third is like 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.750
 all kinds of settings 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.000
 victory is the same full screen setting to 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.570
 show what page view looks like 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.400
 how the phone is equipped with just one meter 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.410
 change screen orientation 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.050
 it will look like this 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.950
 if she just doesnâ€™t believe 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.640
 diagonal 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.190
 that's greatness 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.920
 another double click returns back 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.860
 and launches 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.260
 full page overview 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.270
 but I think 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.470
 with main browser may 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.500
 sorted out 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.500
 and therefore go to the sphere 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.490
 if you are not a millionaire 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.450
 it does not follow 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.250
 some oligarch 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.300
 then from the traffic that consume major 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.100
 browsers 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.390
 may seem too heavy for you 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.620
 and put on comes to the rescue of the year plain 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.280
 So consider this to be a funny copy. 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.580
 the screen here we can lead 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.670
 your address search fields amazon or 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.190
 Wikipedia 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.459
 bookmarks which counted 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.439
 d i rub but here's potter as boris like 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.469
 the publisher considered my most important 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.129
 own use of the tent sketch and here I am 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.700
 now with a load of gims 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.700
 club 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.359
 the essence of opera mini is that 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.949
 the guy for you did not immediately send here 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:35.119
 it passes through a special server 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:36.819
 which is may 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.559
 traffic and already in a lost form 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.559
 sends it to you as you see here 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.729
 Well, the withdrawn pictures and all that is possible 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.729
 browse the site the promise is convenient if 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:53.079
 we worked with text 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.079
 with like filling because 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.669
 very convenient to read all the automatism of the West 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.169
 Screen size 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.459
 and practically 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.509
 but bothers them like a criminal 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.049
 procedural code 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.419
 besides scored leaders 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:11.549
 also 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.669
 we are interested in and master 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.669
 the best of them is definitely a mobile 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:16.949
 agent 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:18.829
 hour loaded 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.229
 the essence of this abbas jiro is 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.809
 that he allows to work not only with 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:25.770
 channel with Olesya Kiev 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:26.970
 well and own 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.550
 ounovskimi massagers I am in 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.409
 year or opera 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.010
 but also not very interesting 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.010
 feature is the ability 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.609
 opportunity to send free sms 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.870
 if the phone number is recorded 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.909
 of any contact so now I have it for now 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.909
 example year, you can send a minimum Witek 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.349
 additionally 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.839
 so no 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:54.839
 no, it's not entirely clear just push court 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.909
 and send a text message is true 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.909
 the disadvantage that less characters than expected 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.899
 a gift horse in the mouth as they say no 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:06.259
 is looking 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:07.679
 besides 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.259
 I still use the pit program 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:12.819
 press as an email client as you can see 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.610
 here is a list of songs 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.850
 You can also send to write a new 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.090
 delete letter 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.170
 and a list of contacts from Yandex to them also 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.509
 you can send a letter and that is especially interesting 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.129
 this 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:29.460
 can send 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.050
 your coordinates 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.499
 generally 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:37.270
 It is a fraud to help if you are a jealous husband and 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.030
 and caring parents just don't know how 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.030
 drive in one place or another you 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.360
 is waiting for you 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.770
 still quite interesting 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.490
 handicap language application 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.520
 but 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.870
 so now I will show how it works 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.099
 shows 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.800
 weather 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.999
 forecasts 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:00.819
 that today she is trying to counsel 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:01.699
 here 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.029
 passed went forecast 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:06.960
 What is the weather 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.349
 but also 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.860
 may I help 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.099
 as you probably know the blocks opened 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.189
 your own app store 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.169
 aviv 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.219
 Now I will show how he is 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:19.849
 works 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.089
 here it connects to the internet by the way 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:23.960
 forgot to mention that 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.460
 The phone is equipped with the left and if there is it 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.400
 there you can use it 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.070
 internet connection what 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.309
 natural is much cheaper 

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:34.180
 So 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.259
 we wait 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.919
 So here is a list of applications that 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.290
 recommended us for download 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.279
 as you can see here mm 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.689
 many free programs 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:45.610
 so that 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.879
 there is always plenty to choose from 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.919
 choose and shop assortment constantly 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:50.919
 replenish 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.370
 also we have 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.040
 special applications which 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.740
 work with treated house 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.740
 one helps to watch videos 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.629
 some definite but again taking advantage 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.400
 current even pierre compound this 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.810
 too expensive and therefore we leave to 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.289
 better times before joining a third party 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.509
 or mcdonalds house your free wai 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:16.619
 fay 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:19.619
 completed his story on the Internet 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.119
 bye that's showing 

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:26.689
 Mobile we steal form 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:27.710
 as you can see here 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.080
 weather information is present 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.860
 and currency quotes 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.569
 although desktop access is not 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:39.210
 open 11 8 00 in contrast to the general secret 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.939
 this 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:43.069
 units slightly replaces the situation 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.550
 I hope that such 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.169
 develop further will 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:47.009
 more 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:48.870
 all bye tons 82
