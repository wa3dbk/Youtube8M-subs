00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello everyone in this video would like to 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.980
 tell and show in detail how you can 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.870
 check motorcycle ignition system 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.030
 Minsk Sunrise mopeds Carpathians 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.490
 well and other motorcycles and scooters 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.049
 who work with electronic 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.840
 ignition on the switch 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.650
 electromagnet sensors are common to us 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.730
 for this you need a power source 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.859
 up to 150 volts 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.630
 no longer makes sense since the zener in 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.910
 switch still won't miss 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.270
 voltage is further on but better 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.940
 less than 100 volts is enough further 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.379
 that the switch is an ordinary minsk 262 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.040
 ignition coil in this case from 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.399
 yamaha 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.879
 Well, no sense there is no coil fit 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:52.010
 almost anybody as it coil and in 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.110
 africa coil well now the whole thing 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.760
 we connect according to the scheme as in a motorcycle 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.250
 Well, that is, the ignition coil to the output 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.200
 switches of course coil with hiv y 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.299
 electromagnetic pickup coil entry well 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.780
 and the transformer power supply 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:17.220
 connect ground to the switch and for 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.140
 Ignition main 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:26.700
 o2 do not connect the light circuit in general 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.520
 what else do you need also need some 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.840
 magnetic 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.799
 modulator or don't know how to say in 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.780
 general in this case took the engine 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:41.280
 crocodile hitched girls off and 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.140
 at the end here if you see a magnet from 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.200
 headphone 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.270
 just any headphones parsing but take 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.390
 that magnets here he is calm 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.759
 I will try to crocodile 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.780
 to you this thing to demonstrate everything in 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:02.219
 the work that we do power up 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.100
 motor so can see how he 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.640
 Glonass is spinning and I was an ebnik 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.640
 didn't fly away 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:42.100
 this thing works fine turn off 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:44.170
 and now what is most interesting if 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.560
 just finger touch the entrance 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.660
 sensor 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.620
 and passionately want constantly and how 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.700
 see you have nothing to do with the engine 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.320
 magnets removed 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.920
 i'm just touching my finger 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.920
 sensors 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.630
 what else would you like to point out 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:14.080
 sparks seems to me much better than 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.940
 when this whole thing is on a motorcycle 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.630
 there is possible for those who have already redone 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.610
 color scheme as it were powered by 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.750
 battery 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.610
 maybe it makes sense to collect some 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.350
 simple converter there up to 100 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.760
 volt and 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.950
 at least for start up do more 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.010
 powerful and stable spark possible 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.690
 the bike will be better to wind up in common 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.750
 you need to experiment 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:45.070
 this video was show how to check 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:49.420
 and talk about the ignition system without leaving 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:51.280
 from home and without a motorcycle, I think that everything 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.050
 showed if someone does not understand something 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.050
 ask questions I will answer
