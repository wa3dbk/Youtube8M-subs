00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
my opinion the worst character on the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.069 
my opinion the worst character on the
show<00:00:53.280> only<00:00:53.879> even<00:00:54.300> that's<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:54.570> trend<00:00:54.840> her<00:00:54.960> off

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
show only even that's my trend her off

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.200 
show only even that's my trend her off
in<00:00:55.199> season<00:00:55.469> 4<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:55.829> we'll<00:00:56.309> get<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
in season 4 but we'll get to that the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.340 
in season 4 but we'll get to that the
reason<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.510> didn't<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.930> wasn't<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.230> she

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
reason I didn't like it wasn't that she

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.779 
reason I didn't like it wasn't that she
was<00:00:58.620> uninteresting<00:00:59.190> or<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.520> she<00:00:59.640> was<00:00:59.760> a

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
was uninteresting or that she was a

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.700 
was uninteresting or that she was a
change<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.149> pace<00:01:00.300> no<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:01.079> didn't<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.620> her

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
change of pace no I didn't like her

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.080 
change of pace no I didn't like her
because<00:01:01.859> her<00:01:02.070> potential<00:01:02.489> was<00:01:02.579> wasted<00:01:03.000> from

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
because her potential was wasted from

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.420 
because her potential was wasted from
being<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.390> cool<00:01:03.600> foil<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.229> our<00:01:04.439> D<00:01:04.650> and/or<00:01:05.100> pinky

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
being a cool foil to our D and/or pinky

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.679 
being a cool foil to our D and/or pinky
and<00:01:05.640> being<00:01:05.970> an<00:01:06.060> interesting<00:01:06.240> look<00:01:06.540> at<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
and being an interesting look at the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.179 
and being an interesting look at the
mythology<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.380> world<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.860> being<00:01:08.040> an

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
mythology of the world to being an

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.770 
mythology of the world to being an
annoying<00:01:08.369> stereotype<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.210> teenagers<00:01:09.689> and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
annoying stereotype of teenagers and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.950 
annoying stereotype of teenagers and
bullies<00:01:10.340> hmm<00:01:11.340> sometimes<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.479> need<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.689> make<00:01:12.810> my

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
bullies hmm sometimes I need to make my

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.289 
bullies hmm sometimes I need to make my
points<00:01:13.290> clear<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:14.369> anyway<00:01:14.760> she<00:01:15.090> could<00:01:15.210> have

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
points clear but anyway she could have

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.700 
points clear but anyway she could have
been<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.780> great<00:01:15.960> character<00:01:16.170> if<00:01:16.470> giving

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
been a really great character if giving

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.649 
been a really great character if giving
more<00:01:16.860> time<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.100> develop<00:01:17.280> how<00:01:18.000> about<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.299> Cece

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
more time to develop how about you Cece

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.140 
more time to develop how about you Cece
time<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.560> develop<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.400> problem<00:01:20.939> when<00:01:21.060> it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
time to develop is the problem when it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.390 
time to develop is the problem when it
comes<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.509> these<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.259> far<00:01:22.619> one-time

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
comes to these so far one-time

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.789 
comes to these so far one-time
characters<00:01:24.000> even<00:01:24.659> assuming<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.290> character<00:01:25.710> is

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
characters even assuming a character is

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.130 
characters even assuming a character is
given<00:01:25.979> every<00:01:26.280> single<00:01:27.060> minute<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.540> 22<00:01:28.020> minute

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
given every single minute of a 22 minute

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.590 
given every single minute of a 22 minute
episode<00:01:28.680> that's<00:01:29.040> still<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> very<00:01:29.549> short<00:01:30.329> amount

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
episode that's still a very short amount

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.569 
episode that's still a very short amount
of<00:01:30.659> time<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.110> develop<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.650> kind<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.009> complexity

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
of time to develop a kind of complexity

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.819 
of time to develop a kind of complexity
that<00:01:33.000> most<00:01:33.390> would<00:01:33.630> likely<00:01:33.930> be<00:01:34.259> comfortable

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
that most would likely be comfortable

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.649 
that most would likely be comfortable
with<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.490> canned<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> problem<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.540> that

with but canned if the problem is that

with but canned if the problem is that
we<00:01:36.720> don't<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:36.960> enough<00:01:37.110> time<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.320> make<00:01:37.530> a

we don't have enough time to make a

we don't have enough time to make a
character<00:01:38.009> why<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.579> most<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.030> key

character why are most of the key

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.090 
character why are most of the key
bringer<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.780> well<00:01:39.990> liked<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.710> shouldn't

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
bringer so well liked this shouldn't

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.649 
bringer so well liked this shouldn't
