00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.850 
right and so that fear that pops up is
automatic<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:04.380> need<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.590> consciously

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
automatic but we need to consciously

automatic but we need to consciously
focus<00:02:05.369> on<00:02:05.670> why<00:02:05.969> we're<00:02:06.210> doing<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.689> first

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
focus on why we're doing it in the first

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.109 
focus on why we're doing it in the first
place<00:02:06.960> if<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.530> not<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.700> not<00:02:08.970> be

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
place if we can not just like not be

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.029

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
thinking about why did I even start

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.270 
thinking about why did I even start
doing<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.020> it's<00:02:16.350> like<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.710> got<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.860> go<00:02:17.040> back

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
to that like a big enough purpose behind

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.300 
to that like a big enough purpose behind
the<00:02:21.540> reason<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.440> started<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.070> the
