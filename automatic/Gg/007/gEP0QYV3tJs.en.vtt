the<00:02:29.930> energy<00:02:30.290> of<00:02:30.410> 60<00:02:31.660> 2647<00:02:32.660> at<00:02:33.020> max<00:02:33.410> damage<00:02:33.680> and

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
the energy of 60 2647 at max damage and

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.790 
the energy of 60 2647 at max damage and
I<00:02:34.370> suppose<00:02:34.610> you'd<00:02:34.730> better<00:02:34.940> hang<00:02:35.120> at<00:02:35.300> 9,000<00:02:36.140> 397

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
I suppose you'd better hang at 9,000 397

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.760 
I suppose you'd better hang at 9,000 397
so<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:38.120> guess<00:02:38.570> that<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.110> part<00:02:39.260> of<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.500> video

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
so I guess that the part of it is video

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.990 
so I guess that the part of it is video
