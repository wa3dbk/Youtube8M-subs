recommend just slowly descending down

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.070 
recommend just slowly descending down
towards<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.180> platform<00:02:48.480> because<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.930> don't

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
towards this platform because you don't

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.720 
towards this platform because you don't
want<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.260> accidentally<00:02:49.650> hit<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.100> switch<00:02:50.459> and

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
want to accidentally hit that switch and

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.390 
want to accidentally hit that switch and
just<00:02:50.910> fall<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.239> fail<00:02:51.860> automatically<00:02:52.860> it's<00:02:53.310> a

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
just fall and fail automatically it's a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.460 
just fall and fail automatically it's a
game<00:02:53.580> over<00:02:53.760> once<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.150> hit<00:02:54.269> that<00:02:54.420> platform<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
game over once you hit that platform the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.860 
game over once you hit that platform the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
other side of the platform anyways so

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.729 
other side of the platform anyways so
