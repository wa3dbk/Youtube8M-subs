00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
thing we've talked about is starting to

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.520 
thing we've talked about is starting to
develop<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.599> habits<00:02:27.019> that<00:02:27.079> will<00:02:27.200> make<00:02:27.380> us

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
develop the habits that will make us

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.670 
develop the habits that will make us
successful<00:02:27.709> during<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.489> year<00:02:28.730> that's

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
successful during the year that's

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.930 
successful during the year that's
offensively<00:02:30.680> that's<00:02:30.980> defensively<00:02:31.670> that's

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
offensively that's defensively that's

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.120 
offensively that's defensively that's
approach<00:02:32.269> to<00:02:33.049> the<00:02:33.319> game<00:02:33.349> approach<00:02:33.920> to

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
approach to the game approach to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.530 
approach to the game approach to
practice<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:34.760> think<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.030> players<00:02:35.209> have<00:02:35.420> done<00:02:35.510> a

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
practice I think the players have done a

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.039 
practice I think the players have done a
great<00:02:35.780> job<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.019> far<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.769> that<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:38.540> i<00:02:38.870> would

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
great job so far of that and i would

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:45.790 
great job so far of that and i would
like<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.380> win<00:02:39.590> as<00:02:40.430> well

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.050 

no<00:02:46.800> question<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.310> quicker<00:02:47.519> you<00:02:47.700> can<00:02:47.730> learn<00:02:48.000> it

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
no question the quicker you can learn it

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.449 
no question the quicker you can learn it
the<00:02:48.390> quicker<00:02:48.659> it's<00:02:49.080> it's<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.620> big<00:02:49.890> jump<00:02:50.099> going

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
the quicker it's it's a big jump going

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.289 
the quicker it's it's a big jump going
from<00:02:50.700> college<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.360> NBA<00:02:51.629> and<00:02:53.299> defensive

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
from college to the NBA and defensive

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.460 
from college to the NBA and defensive
end<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.540> floor<00:02:54.599> is<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.080> probably<00:02:55.379> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
end of the floor is it probably the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.020 
end of the floor is it probably the
biggest<00:02:55.680> challenge<00:02:56.250> for<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.730> lot<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.879> these

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
biggest challenge for a lot of these

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.210 
biggest challenge for a lot of these
guys<00:02:57.239> so<00:02:57.690> we've<00:02:58.290> given<00:02:58.500> great<00:02:58.739> defensive

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.830 
guys so we've given great defensive
effort<00:02:59.459> in<00:02:59.580> these<00:02:59.700> practices<00:03:00.269> it'll<00:03:00.540> be<00:03:00.599> fun

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
effort in these practices it'll be fun

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.160 
effort in these practices it'll be fun
to<00:03:00.959> watch<00:03:01.110> against<00:03:01.739> other<00:03:02.250> opponents<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:03.170> stick

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
on some things that you learned last

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.770 
on some things that you learned last
year<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:10.480> closet<00:03:11.459> yeah<00:03:12.459> it's<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.180> process<00:03:13.480> for

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
year in closet yeah it's a process for

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.869 
year in closet yeah it's a process for
every<00:03:14.500> player<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.950> continue<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.430> try<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:15.760> get

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
every player to continue to try and get

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.089 
every player to continue to try and get
better<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.269> guys<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:16.659> don't<00:03:16.950> think<00:03:17.950> they

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
better the guys that don't think they

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.179 
better the guys that don't think they
need<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.400> get<00:03:18.549> better<00:03:18.730> will<00:03:19.269> struggle<00:03:20.260> when<00:03:21.040> at

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:21.189 
need to get better will struggle when at

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.069 
need to get better will struggle when at
every<00:03:21.340> point<00:03:21.549> that<00:03:21.790> is<00:03:21.939> in<00:03:22.060> their<00:03:22.209> career<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:22.840> I

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
every point that is in their career so I

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.690 
every point that is in their career so I
don't<00:03:23.590> think<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.860> approach<00:03:24.129> Kelly<00:03:24.459> has

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
don't think the approach Kelly has

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.770 
don't think the approach Kelly has
should<00:03:25.000> be<00:03:25.090> any<00:03:25.209> different<00:03:25.450> than<00:03:25.659> the

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
should be any different than the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.140 
should be any different than the
approach<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.739> rookies<00:03:27.099> have<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.640> are<00:03:27.909> guys

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
approach the rookies have that are guys

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.339 
approach the rookies have that are guys
that<00:03:28.180> have<00:03:28.540> played<00:03:28.750> professionally<00:03:29.319> in

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
that have played professionally in

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.380 
that have played professionally in
Europe<00:03:29.620> together<00:03:29.819> trying<00:03:30.819> to<00:03:31.030> get<00:03:31.180> better

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
Europe together trying to get better

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.720 
Europe together trying to get better
today<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:32.170> try<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.709> prepare<00:03:32.860> to<00:03:33.310> be<00:03:33.549> better

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
today and try and prepare to be better

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.490 
today and try and prepare to be better
tomorrow<00:03:33.940> so<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.750> think<00:03:34.900> they've<00:03:35.170> all<00:03:35.290> done<00:03:35.440> a

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
tomorrow so I think they've all done a

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:43.500 
tomorrow so I think they've all done a
good<00:03:35.650> job<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:43.030> would<00:03:43.239> say<00:03:43.359> all

three of those guys Chris Phil and Chris
both<00:03:46.329> Chris's<00:03:46.810> are<00:03:47.079> very<00:03:47.739> good<00:03:47.980> defensive

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
both Chris's are very good defensive

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.580 
both Chris's are very good defensive
players<00:03:48.670> they<00:03:49.000> give<00:03:49.239> defenses<00:03:50.109> a<00:03:50.290> lot<00:03:50.470> about

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
players they give defenses a lot about

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.860 
players they give defenses a lot about
effort<00:03:51.069> it's<00:03:51.489> a<00:03:51.670> lot<00:03:51.790> about<00:03:51.940> unselfishness

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
effort it's a lot about unselfishness

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.979
