 Hello everyone, I'm a sunbather 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.900
 salty and in this video I'm going to show you 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.849
 how a home is made and a home is a 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.010
 tomato and onion used 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.619
 much in Colombia and we serve it with the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.660
 meals at the end of the video I'm going to 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.150
 leave the link where they can find 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.600
 the recipe with the ingredients and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.600
 measurements 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.710
 to do 1 degree first we're going to 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:40.990
 Heat oil in a large pan 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.990
 then we add chopped long onion 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.530
 and chopped garlic 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.840
 do not 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.489
 We stir well and let cook 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.489
 medium heat for about 3 minutes 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.850
 then we add chopped tomato 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.909
 or 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.790
 and this we 're going to cook over low heat 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.520
 for about 8 minutes or until the tomato 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.120
 be soft 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.120
 or not 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.679
 then we add a little cumin 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.110
 with black pepper 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:50.090
 a chicken broth to give it a little 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.090
 of flavor and salt to taste 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.650
 again we are going to stir all this and 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.960
 we are going to cook it for another 3 to 5 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.380
 minutes more until the sauce is 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.380
 thick 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.130
 once the sauce has this 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.230
 consistency and our cat is ready 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.990
 and the home we usually serve 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.270
 with arepas or accompanied with beans 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.270
 or even with sweets or soups 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.590
 and that 's the recipe to make or gao
