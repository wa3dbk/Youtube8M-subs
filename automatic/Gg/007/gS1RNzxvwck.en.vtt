bracket is very sturdy it's not going to
go<00:01:29.549> anywhere<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.810> next<00:01:30.990> step<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.770> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
go anywhere so the next step is to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.910 
go anywhere so the next step is to
reattach<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.240> panel<00:01:33.600> back<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.619> put<00:01:34.799> it

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
reattach this panel back and just put it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.300 
reattach this panel back and just put it

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
back and push it in so the clips go in

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.169 
back and push it in so the clips go in
now<00:01:41.310> we're<00:01:41.490> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.850> attach<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.329> holder<00:01:44.179> and

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
now we're going to attach the holder and

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.959 
now we're going to attach the holder and
once<00:01:45.359> you<00:01:45.539> attach<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.249> if<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.759> turn

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
once you attach it this you if you turn

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.899 
once you attach it this you if you turn
this<00:01:48.210> knob<00:01:48.799> you<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:49.829> actually<00:01:50.159> loosen<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.880> so

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
this knob you can actually loosen it so

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.279 
this knob you can actually loosen it so
you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.270> move<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.569> into<00:01:51.749> the<00:01:51.990> landscape

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
you can move it into the landscape

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.340 
you can move it into the landscape
position<00:01:53.039> or<00:01:53.219> this<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.420> regular<00:01:54.780> position

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
position or this is the regular position

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.459 
position or this is the regular position
so<00:01:56.340> we're<00:01:56.549> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.789> tighten<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.469> becomes

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
so we're going to tighten it becomes

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.289 
so we're going to tighten it becomes
very<00:01:58.679> sturdy<00:01:59.009> there's<00:01:59.369> also<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.789> button<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
very sturdy there's also a button on the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.989 
very sturdy there's also a button on the
