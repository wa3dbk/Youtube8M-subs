 Hello you weird viewers 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.040
 I was just checking if my videos were uploaded to photos Holy 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.219
 already vet visit bottrop everything super trouper good last panel is always 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.939
 still very colorful and not per level 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:17.789
 Nevertheless, apparently it works Gigs colleagues and princess the no 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.239
 more fitting here is the same shot with last panel and the traffic I 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:26.440
 to these text suggestions Pupp Tele Munich 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.000
 Yes fits 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.180
 the fans since al Shaba have no idea how YouTube gets through 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.620
 the Intermezzi also the fans but with the SZ 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.620
 it has nothing to do with this video 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.690
 at least understand nothing with the text to have the ciphers and me 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.730
 hope also nothing in the nothing you OK in the title and nothing here in the title 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.600
 other description 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.860
 it does not stop him from getting involved in jazz 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.930
 more critical only good ones come and so on 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.780
 gardening 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.699
 no idea what this video Met gardening has to do 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.590
 but in any case it is today, as I said the fans and it 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.110
 comes he is the reason why I actually this video week morning 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.780
 meet where sooner 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.430
 I puke shoulders 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.680
 All that's going on here Smith Last Place has to do if I have her 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.710
 Upload 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.570
 Apparently the cube is associated with montage warfare that is this 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.250
 School peace shooter warship not good games and that despite me 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.760
 exact is including death game 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.480
 but then even this student does not Schell mistake he me 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.150
 I can not say English is good I can say Kika 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.230
 Add the pumpkin and it will be so it's tears 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.790
 stay anyway 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.600
 So real monsters Warfare 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.940
 happy 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.940
 no idea how that went Eurocom Polar came 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.260
 Dell would interest me so what will be coaching over the last few years 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.980
 what's suggested to you when you are watching videos from and playing high 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.010
 if it's me neither modern nor mother Mofair is 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.579
 if a step in the text Glatz Play him 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.819
 what happens? 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.530
 Modern Warfare Modern Warfare 2 why will everything suit me this time 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.340
 Everything warmed up Modern Warfare or Mutombo Vera is suggested to be warm 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.340
 she is not 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:39.179
 it is rather uncool to express our very simple words 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:43.019
 live 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.529
 this chance has already been 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.529
 but the title already goes the few extensively 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.109
 Weissenburg is surprised 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.329
 this bad spelling mistake
