it this polishing lay behind me here
circa<00:04:10.280> 1940<00:04:11.240> is<00:04:11.780> in<00:04:12.110> daily<00:04:12.470> use<00:04:12.500> because<00:04:13.070> it

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
circa 1940 is in daily use because it

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.770 
circa 1940 is in daily use because it

does something the automated equipment

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.710 
does something the automated equipment
can<00:04:15.350> but<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.130> real<00:04:16.310> story<00:04:16.580> is<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:16.910> investment
