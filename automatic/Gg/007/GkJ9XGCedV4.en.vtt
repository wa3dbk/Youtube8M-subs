00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello friends welcome to a new video 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.389
 courtesy of his friend 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.250
 rockstar what January this time 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.200
 I will talk about a game of double 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.869
 double uy but not raw versus 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.689
 smartphone or double double and 12 and 13 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.610
 nor double double and 2 k 14 and the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.890
 that are to come since all those 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.960
 games seem the same bullshit and 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.369
 the only fucking novelty they have is that 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.189
 every year they are added to new 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.899
 superstars to the roster that's all 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.090
 the game that I come to talk about today 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.250
 for me it is one of the best in its 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.050
 gender and if some day someone 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.240
 I dared to make a top of the best 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.120
 Wrestling games should not stop for 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.220
 out to this great double-double with no 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.040
 mercy for the nintendo 64 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.410
 this game came out at the end of the year 2000 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.660
 It was developed by the extinct tea 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.329
 Excuse accompanied by the developer 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.340
 Japanese here this game went well 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.550
 received by both players and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.710
 critics alike to start the game 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.720
 contains a variety of wrestlers 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.090
 where we will meet at 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.630
 superstars at those times like the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.180
 rock 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.640
 steve austin greene of cock the under 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.940
 on the hard disk edge and cristian between 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.260
 others can also be unlocked 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.040
 superstars but for those who give them 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.650
 weakness 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.780
 they can use the fucking tricks the game 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.060
 has new fighting modalities what 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.070
 which was very innovative in the games of 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.920
 this guy like the steel cage match 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.320
 ladder match special referee and iron man 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.990
 match there is a total of 7 sands 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.390
 different each is constituted by 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.850
 main sand the top of the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.860
 stage backstage room where 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.229
 they can perform hardcore style fights 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.840
 where you can also fight in other 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.240
 sites like the dressing rooms the bar and up 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.430
 the parking the game counts 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.320
 also with the story mode which one 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.990
 You can choose between seven titles 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.270
 to unlock it but for the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.759
 that the lazy can use the fucking 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.490
 tricks other novel aspects that 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.560
 owns the game are the paper ring mode 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.979
 where you can create your own event to your 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.440
 taste 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.110
 the royal rumble mode where you can 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.239
 perform your own real battles and 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.730
 other types of fighting via elimination 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.350
 the king of the ring mode where you can 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.810
 create your own tournament 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.580
 and the survivor mode where you'll put 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.470
 Test your skills when facing 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.350
 first of all the roster in a real battle 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.630
 the smackdown mode where you can 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.790
 create your own superstar too 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.830
 you can buy accessories with the money 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.770
 that you win in the story or survival mode 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.560
 but you can avoid that by using the 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.860
 fucking tricks good now I'll start 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.170
 highlight the categories first I'll start 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.510
 for the gameplay for those who have 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.760
 played other fighting games like purees 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.700
 lehman since 2000 his style of play is 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.100
 exactly the same however for the 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.170
 who want to play it for the first time 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.540
 worry because your style of play is 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.640
 very simple and if you play it on a pc 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.950
 configuring the controls to your liking 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.310
 You will see that you have become accustomed to 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.730
 hours 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.980
 Of course there is an exception when you play in 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.980
 fights type one against one all well 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.080
 but when you decide to play in pairs or 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.720
 where it involves more fighters the 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.210
 game sometimes it becomes slow this 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.770
 is because the cartridge of the 64 is 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.870
 reaching its maximum level of 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.490
 processing since this game was what 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.400
 maximum that could reach 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.260
 alone in processing anyway you go 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.330
 to have a good time since the 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.700
 playability in various stipulations 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.980
 it's really fun to put 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.480
 examples can make them a power boom 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.670
 to your opponent from the table 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.490
 transmission and can also perform 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.320
 air plates from the stairs the 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.060
 way of access to places outside 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.340
 You can do it in a ring way 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.230
 very easy and best of all is that no 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.450
 you have to wait for a fucking load like 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.060
 if you were playing on a playstation 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.010
 there is a great variety of weapons that has 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.530
 the game when making fights 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.140
 extreme as chairs kendo sticks 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.200
 wire stick signs among others 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.270
 when you play the steel cage mode I should 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.280
 say it's disappointing not only 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.350
 because the design of the cage is lousy 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.720
 but because it is very difficult to win 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.730
 departure in this modality and if of 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.890
 miracle you manage to win you stay with the 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.560
 red fingers from both pressing the buttons 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.110
 to exit if you play the special mode 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.910
 I really referred that it's really fun and 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.070
 that you can betray the 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.710
 wrestler you want and you can also 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.150
 do a quick count the mode 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.400
 of stairs is also 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.710
 and as I said earlier you can 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.990
 carry out air strikes from the top of 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.840
 the ladder and you can also use it 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.970
 as a weapon in the end the gameplay of this 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.920
 game is decent since the controls 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.710
 They are simple to use and at the time of 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.220
 execute them is very satisfactory I will give 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.100
 a 4 star rating of 5 good 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.410
 I will follow the graphics the first thing 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.870
 that you will notice of no mercy are its graphics 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.550
 pretty good both the design of the 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.590
 fighters who no longer look like 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.810
 dolls as in the past deliveries 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.090
 but because the fighting environment is very 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.340
 nice the scenes very well made 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.740
 although the public still has the 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.750
 same poor animation every detail of 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.760
 the fighters is more detailed since 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.130
 the factions of the faces the attire 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.680
 up muscular details like the ass 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.380
 of ricky and the deployment of movement 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.770
 it is much more realistic from the blows 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.290
 frontal attacks and aerial plates each 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.300
 special that your opponent runs looks 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.790
 very well done from a nudge the 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.950
 the people a stoner to the gusanito of 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.289
 scott and your hot and want to highlight the 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.990
 much more realistic blood effect 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.180
 and it does not look like ketchup not all 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.069
 is good in this aspect I have a complaint 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.869
 with this game and are the funds and 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:51.149
 images that show up when a 

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:53.430
 fighter makes his entrance really 

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:55.499
 they could do something better not only do you see 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.509
 very pixelated also because it only 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:59.330
 they show photographs and the fund does not 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.469
 appears on the stage screen 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.139
 they only put it in all the 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:06.449
 monitor screen I also have another 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.819
 complaint and it's much more important since 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:11.189
 are the tickets an aspect that the game 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:13.020
 he did not make a lot of effort since the fighter just 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:15.029
 appears walking on the ramp of 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.759
 stage and then the screen will 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:20.520
 fade they could do something better for 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:22.949
 cannes good despite the negative that 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.740
 highlight the graphics are still about 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:28.949
 of the most attractive points I will give you a 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.499
 score of 4 stars out of 5 well 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:33.089
 end with the music starting with 

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:35.099
 the respective entries of the 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:37.589
 wrestlers that are of very good quality 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:39.300
 he also highlighted the melodies that there are in 

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:42.089
 the menu among other options which 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.249
 Do not get tired of hearing them so much 

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:46.080
 effects of combats are also very 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:46.830
 good as when you throw your opponent 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.960
 toward 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.630
 of the ring or when he bursts them with 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.850
 any weapon music is nothing 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.590
 another world because we are talking about a 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.050
 fighting game what is understandable 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.660
 that have not put legendary tunes 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.120
 like those of super Mario games you 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:06.210
 I will give a score of 3 stars out of 5 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.950
 in order double-double web no mercy is a 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.840
 excellent game that still follows 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.270
 surprising even when it's already 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.490
 more than 10 years since its premiere 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.800
 recommended for those who are tired of 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.620
 play the same repetitive games and 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.840
 look for something retro but interesting I 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.450
 I recommend downloading it for the 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.160
 that do not have a console without a doubt 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:29.130
 I play that should not go unnoticed 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:33.120
 by no fan I will give you one 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:35.370
 score of 4.5 stars of 5 good 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.200
 that's it if you liked the video 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.840
 dale manito up you can also 

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.030
 recommend it with your friends and if you do not 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.200
 you have subscribed to my channel you can do it 

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.200
 good, goodbye
