00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.940
 traveling on the market or even 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.940
 by no means needed that 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.440
 she is supposed to be one at least 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.399
 the feeling completely lost 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.949
 and then there is our village 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.170
 it is somehow on the radl 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.320
 probably the sixteenth to find and the 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.090
 template and then to model so far 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.260
 how are you up behind 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.700
 but really 360 with distance that 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.710
 hardest thing I've ever done 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.090
 because of the different 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.950
 thematic conditions and 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.890
 topographical conditions better 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.040
 to get ahead but yes makes is one 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.939
 the hardest race in the world and yes goes 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.920
 now also to the end and although one 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.500
 Let's say I'm done adjusting games 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.110
 so you against a rhythm 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.110
 then one that one car on it 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:35.750
 but now in the house or in 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:38.870
 small sizes on the horizon and that 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.980
 is in the station costs a 4 2 by 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.980
 fastest cate forward
