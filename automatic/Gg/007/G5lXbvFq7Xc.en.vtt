rain<00:01:37.280> again<00:01:37.430> but<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:39.410> summers<00:01:39.860> very<00:01:40.070> dry<00:01:40.400> and

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
rain again but the summers very dry and

rain again but the summers very dry and
depending<00:01:41.660> on<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.900> year<00:01:42.140> went<00:01:42.410> it<00:01:42.560> can<00:01:42.710> be

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
depending on the year went it can be

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.050 
depending on the year went it can be
very<00:01:42.860> wet

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
very wet

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.609 
very wet
and<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.079> environmental

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
and it's not just environmental

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.710 
and it's not just environmental
challenges<00:01:47.430> facing<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.000> young<00:01:48.240> farmer<00:01:48.600> and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
challenges facing this young farmer and

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.300 
challenges facing this young farmer and
to<00:01:48.810> poorer<00:01:49.049> there<00:01:49.470> are<00:01:49.590> social<00:01:49.770> challenges

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
to poorer there are social challenges

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.830 
to poorer there are social challenges
too<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:52.130> think<00:01:53.130> location<00:01:53.700> has<00:01:54.420> its<00:01:54.630> challenges

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
too I think location has its challenges

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.789 
too I think location has its challenges
in<00:01:55.500> isolation<00:01:56.310> being<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.539> a<00:01:57.570> mainland<00:01:58.439> island

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
in isolation being on a mainland island

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.230 
in isolation being on a mainland island
the<00:01:59.579> social<00:01:59.970> factors<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:01.259> more<00:02:01.590> difficult

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
the social factors but more difficult

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.969 
the social factors but more difficult
it's<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.299> bit<00:02:03.450> more<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.630> an<00:02:03.780> effort<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.080> go<00:02:04.920> to

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
it's a bit more of an effort to go to

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.080 
it's a bit more of an effort to go to
town<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.580> speak

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090

strength the contest is designed that

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.660 
strength the contest is designed that
anyone<00:03:43.960> should<00:03:43.990> be<00:03:44.470> able<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.830> do<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.130> if<00:03:45.280> you've

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
anyone should be able to do it if you've

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.380 
anyone should be able to do it if you've
got<00:03:46.090> relative<00:03:46.510> fitness<00:03:46.690> so<00:03:47.550> yeah<00:03:48.550> I<00:03:48.760> try<00:03:49.360> to

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
got relative fitness so yeah I try to

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.420 
got relative fitness so yeah I try to
learn<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.930> technique<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.830> make<00:03:50.980> life<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.310> bit

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
learn the technique to make life a bit

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.760 
learn the technique to make life a bit
easier<00:03:51.580> for<00:03:52.060> me<00:03:52.180> because<00:03:52.330> it's<00:03:53.200> not<00:03:53.350> so<00:03:53.590> much

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
easier for me because it's not so much

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.130 
easier for me because it's not so much
being<00:03:54.340> a<00:03:54.430> woman<00:03:54.760> it's<00:03:54.940> vertically<00:03:55.720> challenged

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
being a woman it's vertically challenged

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.130 
being a woman it's vertically challenged
for<00:03:56.260> me<00:03:56.410> I<00:03:57.390> find<00:03:58.390> that<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.600> bit<00:03:58.720> more<00:03:58.990> of<00:03:59.050> a

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
for me I find that a bit more of a

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.970 
for me I find that a bit more of a
disadvantage<00:03:59.500> but<00:04:00.600> yeah<00:04:01.600> I've<00:04:01.690> never<00:04:01.980> I've

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
disadvantage but yeah I've never I've

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.370 
disadvantage but yeah I've never I've
never<00:04:03.040> worried<00:04:03.760> about<00:04:03.820> being<00:04:04.240> a<00:04:04.570> girl<00:04:05.110> or

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
never worried about being a girl or

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.810 
never worried about being a girl or
anything<00:04:05.740> it's<00:04:05.920> just<00:04:06.720> nothing<00:04:07.720> too<00:04:07.990> new<00:04:08.110> to<00:04:08.260> me

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
anything it's just nothing too new to me

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.580 
anything it's just nothing too new to me
did<00:04:09.820> you<00:04:09.970> do<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.120> lot<00:04:10.330> of<00:04:10.390> training<00:04:10.840> for<00:04:11.380> the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
well technically I've been training for

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.080 
well technically I've been training for
since<00:04:20.140> I<00:04:20.320> first<00:04:20.650> of<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.160> first<00:04:21.610> one<00:04:21.910> and

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
since I first of the the first one and

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.330 
since I first of the the first one and
five<00:04:23.050> years<00:04:23.320> if<00:04:23.470> you<00:04:23.590> want<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:23.830> look<00:04:23.950> at<00:04:24.130> that

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
five years if you want to look at that

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.950 
five years if you want to look at that
way<00:04:25.110> with<00:04:26.110> this<00:04:26.230> particular<00:04:26.590> one<00:04:27.010> I<00:04:27.960> decided

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
way with this particular one I decided

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.660
