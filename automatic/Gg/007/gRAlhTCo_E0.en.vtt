00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 that was the playstation meeting 2013 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.430
 a little different than me 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.270
 Overall, I am 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.980
 very satisfied 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.570
 they have shown games they do not have 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.670
 she talked around the bush 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.290
 have not told a business nonsense 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.809
 but be said that the new one 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.640
 playstation and that will be you i can 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.189
 am the girl blown away by some 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.350
 ideas so this network will be too 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.689
 still nice car play works that means 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.189
 I am not that way yet 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.779
 I'm sure that's really good 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.320
 it will look like you trailer it then 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.360
 demonstrate 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.660
 That's the first thing for me 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.870
 the candidate for boni schott and days 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.219
 in there on took but overall you can still 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.160
 really do not complain a new internal 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.480
 new kill should be shown in ingame 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.730
 was on fire and the engine 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.820
 presentation an exciting to it of 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.800
 capcom and the harp 3d should be happy and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.370
 above all, many interesting and interesting things 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.680
 exciting features so the packaging 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.539
 I already knew it was clear 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.420
 We then on the internet before 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.979
 but that's the way it is 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.540
 And that's not how complex it is 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.860
 only at the push of a button the time 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.750
 can travel back and it already 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.580
 played online make something cool 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.500
 But that's just how people are with you 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.360
 can be gamble 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.310
 that is the whole idea of 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.320
 virtual sofa on the online friends 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.180
 sit and watch and comment 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.530
 and maybe even give tips and for 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.560
 the control assume that's 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.870
 incredibly cool but here i have the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.940
 fear there is still a bit 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.040
 Promises on the way I want 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.320
 I want to see the first time function 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.900
 that error free and members router 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.060
 Configuration that bravely experience at home 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.840
 because right mood so many 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.400
 sources of error 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.170
 I'm really excited and all that 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.220
 So this story sounded like this 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.450
 training thing with you 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.200
 probably your whole game catalog 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.240
 make certain stone time available 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.410
 want 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.520
 instead of just real backwards pro 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.190
 to provide mobility 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.470
 that everything will work that way and what 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.540
 is with used games but that's yes 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.550
 everything is still pretty long to end 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.750
 of the year and on the e3 it is also 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.179
 a little something show so well 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.890
 Overall, a really great solid 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.890
 screw some nice games 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.630
 Plenty of information and garden now 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.760
 it's time to wait for the three and one 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.430
 maybe there is one or the other 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.530
 developers until then finally that time 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.640
 it had many petra that would me 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.320
 happy and so good 8 gbytes gddr5 for 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.090
 not freaks marktes now maybe too 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.040
 we'll get gigabytes after one 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.020
 digital camera I have nothing else 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.900
 set 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.120
 It was important the last few years 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.860
 the console is slowly maxed out though 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.080
 pc graphics have long progressed 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.120
 memory has important what is important 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.580
 a ps3 was taken out with only 512 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.560
 megabyte memory is incredible though 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.959
 one considers that the psp 16 times as much 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.370
 have memory is not dissatisfied 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.230
 that's all much better here because of me 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.750
 think it is a great advantage if it is 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.849
 really, that's 668 same amount 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.989
 fun is much slower there is in the 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.650
 clear 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.980
 I am so glad that she had and 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.209
 that maybe i'm surprised that 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.609
 loose on the move controller 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.260
 mentioned or even this stereo camera 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.670
 Although first shown but not so important 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.680
 was declared 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.730
 controller is behind it's easy it falls 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.319
 works the same way as it did 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.510
 controller of players there as in the 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.310
 pension and thanks to the two cameras then 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.379
 even in the three-dimensional space is then 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.659
 the console very clear where to find the 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:36.239
 top-four will have us it will be used 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:40.849
 also the touchpad that work 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.849
 but probably see
