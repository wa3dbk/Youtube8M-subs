 [SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA] 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.476
 Hello, my name is Kim Sang Jin and we are at Jongno Octopus in Seoul. 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.413
 I am the kitchen manager. 

00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:29.198
 I work with my mother. 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.393
 I will show you how to prepare a live octopus. 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.868
 First, you take the octopus by the head 

00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:45.953
 and you squeeze the tentacles to remove the mucus, which is not very good to eat. 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.240
 Since it's a living octopus, 

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:48.333
 it moves a lot. 

00:00:48.498 --> 00:00:52.226
 Eating Octopus is very good for blood sugar levels, 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.521
 because it contains pure taurine. 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.971
 Since it lives in an environment surrounded by many good microorganisms, 

00:01:03.135 --> 00:01:05.426
 it has a lot of strength. 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.598
 Especially those here. 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.798
 It's alive, so you have to prepare it quickly to serve customers. 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.646
 The tentacles stick to the mouth and it's a bit weird. 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.123
 Its good ! 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:36.138
 Since it moves and it sticks to the mouth, it must be cut into small pieces. 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.785
 So when it sticks, it's easy to remove. 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.758
 If you try to eat big pieces, it can get stuck in your throat. 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.168
 You can have an accident and die. 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.038
 Yes, I like it. 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.631
 Especially when I'm tired. Instead of taking vitamins, I cut one and eat it. 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.490
 It's garlic and chili. 

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:04.375
 It helps with digestion and adds flavor. 

00:02:07.206 --> 00:02:09.208
 I will eat live octopus. 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.665
 It's scary. 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.168
 They move all. 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.098
 They dance. 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.805
 It moves. 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.610
 And if it sinks into my throat and that stifles me? 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.903
 It's very strong. 

00:02:50.308 --> 00:02:51.088
 Its good. 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.191
 Its good. 

00:03:31.308 --> 00:03:34.990
