 we can do the first lit this 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.830
 phone to check also that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.840
 applications comes by default or from 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.599
 factory here on the right we have the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.789
 power button we leave it on 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.450
 after having entered the battery and 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.920
 put the sim and the micro sd if they have it 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.590
 I release the button immediately turn on the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.210
 screen an android phone we are going to 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.399
 Quickly check which version of the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.469
 Android has with the simple fact that 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.020
 has left this operator logo is 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.090
 an an operating system manipulated by 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.399
 the operator that means that the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.250
 updates are delayed in arriving and 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.750
 maximum we have an update of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.690
 operating system we select 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.470
 let's have here not show again 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.470
 we select the Spanish language 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.220
 we are here the network configuration 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.280
 omit anyway we give 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.880
 select next next date 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.740
 then we set it up we're going to close 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.230
 here I am receiving call I do not know by 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.510
 what in this without it is completely 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:28.020
 new next next welcome 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.580
 accept and I will increase a little 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.170
 the brightness of the screen so that 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.170
 you can see a little better 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.380
 what's the phone ready we're going to 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.080
 see who brings this phone by default 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.820
 As you can see it 's a multi phone 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.820
 touch very 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.420
 and easy to manipulate this time is the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.360
 application option let's look at what 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.370
 applications brings by default 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.420
 from top to bottom let's look here 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.440
 quickly applications like chrome 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.670
 remarkable 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.930
 facebook is already installed 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:13.470
 we have to google plus gmail and some 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.470
 some jueguitos google maps another game 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.250
 I like torque, obviously you should have it 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.620
 It has many applications of the operator 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.070
 spider-man youtube twitter are little 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.210
 the applications that comes by default 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.030
 so let's look at the configuration here 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.210
 of buttons on that phone is that is 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.670
 here on the left we enter here if you 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.070
 I give the one on the right does not do anything if 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.190
 I give the one on the left is the button 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.100
 backward we do here the button of the 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.770
 center has to be the home button 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.170
 aha and the button on the right is the button 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.470
 that allows me to enter here some 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.940
 settings this is the menu button 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.700
 to be able to suddenly configure what 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.140
 are widgets wallpaper settings and 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.060
 now let's quickly see what 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.830
 it has to do with the size 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.750
 storage that phone let's look at 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.160
 see how much it is when we have 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.380
 really available to the user 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.170
 storage space remember that 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.640
 supposedly it's the 8 gig phone 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.860
 and quite possibly that I have 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.430
 wrong since I have only 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.560
 available 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.909
 two gigabytes available for the 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.920
 user is to say the majority is at 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.260
 operating system let's return it 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.689
 here the woman that we have more here I have 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.569
 the space of the microsd card which 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:35.849
 it is little 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.489
 and we are going to return them here to look to see 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.180
 information from the ram and we leave here by 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.159
 applications and we quickly look at what 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.159
 ram has that phone available that's what 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.450
 we do entering by applications 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.540
 let's go here we can see that I have 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.099
 available two gigas internet to go to 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.680
 see in the execution option I can see 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.139
 how much round I have available is a 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.459
 untxilla ram phone is interesting 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.739
 that already almost all phones also 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.409
 in the ram colony this makes the 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.669
 phone be very fast and let's look 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.530
 quickly that the operating system 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:10.480
 bring from the factory 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.750
 about the device comes with system 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.750
 operative 4.4 points this explains 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.060
 it's basically good this was 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.159
 basically everything by is had many 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.780
