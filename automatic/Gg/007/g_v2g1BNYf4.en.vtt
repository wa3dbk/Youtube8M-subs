00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
see here on the front we do put six

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.710 
see here on the front we do put six
stamped<00:01:27.710> in<00:01:27.850> strakes<00:01:28.850> on<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.120> bottom<00:01:29.450> adds

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
stamped in strakes on the bottom adds

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.810 
stamped in strakes on the bottom adds
rigidity<00:01:30.170> to<00:01:30.620> the<00:01:30.650> bottom<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.280> then<00:01:31.550> also

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
rigidity to the bottom and then also

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.190 
rigidity to the bottom and then also
helps<00:01:32.090> with<00:01:32.180> performance<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:32.840> handling

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
helps with performance and handling

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.649 
helps with performance and handling

routing and trying to you know put cable
covers<00:01:38.420> in<00:01:38.540> place<00:01:38.750> where<00:01:38.990> cable<00:01:39.290> covers

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
covers in place where cable covers

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:52.010 
covers in place where cable covers
really<00:01:40.130> need<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.400> be<00:01:40.520> in<00:01:40.640> place

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020
