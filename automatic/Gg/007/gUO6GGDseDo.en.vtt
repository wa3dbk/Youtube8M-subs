there and it works it works and it's in
split-screen<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:51.350> let's<00:03:51.590> imagine<00:03:51.710> that<00:03:52.130> I

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
split-screen so let's imagine that I

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.190 
split-screen so let's imagine that I
have<00:03:52.280> a<00:03:52.460> kid<00:03:52.700> brother<00:03:52.880> who<00:03:53.210> desperately<00:03:53.570> wants

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
have a kid brother who desperately wants

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.440 
have a kid brother who desperately wants
a<00:03:54.260> game<00:03:54.440> based<00:03:54.680> on<00:03:54.830> this<00:03:55.040> this<00:03:55.460> new<00:03:55.760> cool<00:03:56.060> movie

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
a game based on this this new cool movie

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.920 
a game based on this this new cool movie
is<00:03:56.660> this<00:03:56.960> worth<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.070> game<00:03:58.250> if<00:03:58.640> he's<00:03:59.390> about

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
is this worth the game if he's about

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.090 
is this worth the game if he's about
eight<00:04:00.500> years<00:04:00.710> old

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
eight years old

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.530 
eight years old
yes<00:04:02.110> f<00:04:03.110> is<00:04:03.740> 12<00:04:04.190> old<00:04:04.370> he<00:04:04.910> would<00:04:05.060> probably<00:04:05.240> look

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
yes f is 12 old he would probably look

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.340 
yes f is 12 old he would probably look
at<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.810> technical<00:04:06.110> limitations<00:04:06.440> and<00:04:08.350> he

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
at the technical limitations and he

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.050 
at the technical limitations and he
would<00:04:09.470> ask<00:04:09.590> for<00:04:09.740> GTA<00:04:10.250> it's<00:04:10.460> something<00:04:10.820> else

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
would ask for GTA it's something else

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.290 
would ask for GTA it's something else
but<00:04:11.300> of<00:04:12.140> course<00:04:12.440> if<00:04:12.800> you<00:04:13.280> don't<00:04:13.460> want<00:04:13.670> guns<00:04:14.090> and

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
but of course if you don't want guns and

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.140 
but of course if you don't want guns and
blocking<00:04:14.690> violence

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
blocking violence

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.530 
blocking violence
I'll<00:04:17.150> say<00:04:17.390> fine<00:04:18.049> it's<00:04:18.950> fine<00:04:19.150> for<00:04:20.150> that<00:04:20.180> but

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
I'll say fine it's fine for that but

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.090 
I'll say fine it's fine for that but
it's<00:04:20.690> definitely<00:04:20.930> for<00:04:21.290> younger<00:04:21.530> audience

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
it's definitely for younger audience

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.730 
it's definitely for younger audience
so<00:04:22.460> while<00:04:22.850> this<00:04:23.030> doesn't<00:04:23.330> sound<00:04:23.570> like<00:04:23.750> a<00:04:23.900> GTA

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
so while this doesn't sound like a GTA

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.640 
so while this doesn't sound like a GTA
competitor<00:04:25.490> anything<00:04:26.000> it<00:04:26.300> does<00:04:27.290> sound<00:04:27.530> like

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
competitor anything it does sound like

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.250 
competitor anything it does sound like
an<00:04:27.920> okay<00:04:28.310> game<00:04:28.490> for<00:04:28.730> the<00:04:28.790> young<00:04:28.970> audience<00:04:29.260> yeah

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
an okay game for the young audience yeah

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.130 
an okay game for the young audience yeah
it<00:04:30.320> is<00:04:30.760> it's<00:04:31.760> got<00:04:32.000> technical<00:04:32.420> limitations

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
it is it's got technical limitations

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.950 
it is it's got technical limitations
it's<00:04:34.040> quite<00:04:34.340> short<00:04:34.700> but<00:04:35.240> it's<00:04:35.420> a<00:04:35.480> decent<00:04:35.660> game

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
it's quite short but it's a decent game

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.680 
it's quite short but it's a decent game
for<00:04:36.500> kids
