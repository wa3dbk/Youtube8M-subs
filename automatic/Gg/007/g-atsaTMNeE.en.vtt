00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.119
 that of the world is the ad site 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.310
 so today we would meet again 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.070
 for a pretty special video where I will 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.470
 represent two two car codes 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.199
 different so two when we waited 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.199
 for quite some time already the first 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.500
 code that will be following the lamborghini 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:40.460
 tencer which is offered by the page as 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.050
 the official page of the operation 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.410
 for this back to school we were waiting 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.690
 for a long time when the law and the code 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.220
 of the concept hjra that was expected a 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.580
 million young people since a small 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.909
 week young so I entered 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.860
 how to activate them right now since 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:02.250
 currently it's going to be quite complicated 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.159
 to disable if the rating activation 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.670
 since if you go on its own 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.530
 forces of twenty then there is 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.260
 available but just now I'm 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.250
 location he was in Spain I am and 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.869
 why since the site is 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.990
 currently overloaded him that all 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.460
 which was in a hurry to receive the collar 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:27.030
 of blackberry so quoted so I'm going 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.430
 explain how to install them 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.520
 how are they activated by year then I 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.960
 will comment on how assets fall 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.920
 although she has already shown so 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.140
 attractive and considering that in case there 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.920
 would have an overload at the time you 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.300
 activate the code 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.340
 I will give you a tip that 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.950
 works that will inject the codes the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.840
 miss everything will start again with a computer 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.700
 and henson for this a rental of 7 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.810
 days unfortunately it's not online 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.560
 offered that's what has a little bit 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.030
 disgusting but we will do with 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.350
 so it can be practical for everyone 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.500
 we recognize in a world and that they 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.659
 progress fast but good so so for 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.460
 this is very simple so you copy 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.420
 the code that by the inscription of the 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.659
 mango and ignorant as you want 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.080
 finally thierry delcol at that moment they 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:18.380
 ask me to a true religion 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.790
 and the idea is normal for once 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.180
 it's over so you come to this 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.770
 page 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.910
 we had more about a code of 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.080
 congratulations you have rather 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.830
 directly on a French dish volcano 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.050
 like me I take it into account 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.290
 city â€‹â€‹not to take it I feel them 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.850
 so when he wants 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.990
 so that was it to activate the 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.030
 project rating now i show you 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.150
 that we will motivate the code in case of 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.830
 overload 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.540
 so it's very simple you need 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.020
 origin origin happened the program 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.820
 of electronic art what was done for 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.200
 a download young salt cure 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.580
 in violent attack of my friend I 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.520
 you said young people will be able to download 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:06.890
 to play and so in the lead are looking to 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.510
 counter so already they will already have seen 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.830
 so if you want I can very well 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.740
 Sure that I have official origin have already 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.690
 the original notions and to activate the 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.890
 crunch face one time we're going to 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.090
 robinho you are connected with 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:29.239
 thurgau forgotten people on origin out of 10 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:36.790
 a product code but that says code 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:36.790
 product hard to enter the following code 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.519
 but landry nor murat concept is the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.980
 following 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:50.200
 normally you add sictom so 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.200
 we'll check that right now 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.700
 morally I arrived here 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.189
 you will see support 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:28.530
 that's just what it was for 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:31.230
 embarrassing so here we will see 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.800
 yes that here only car all to 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.260
 is normal 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.410
 so here to recover your 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.760
 gifts in his past by the site where that 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:44.990
 you do how are you from 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.990
 concession who swears gift you have 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.450
 you see that he can recover his walls 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.740
 a concept or other gifts like the 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:09.680
 ask I do not like my daughter he 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:12.000
 had yesterday before is called wilson here
