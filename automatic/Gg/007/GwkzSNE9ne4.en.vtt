00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.020
 hello guys with you tech today 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.770
 us visiting on a trick from Russian 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.230
 celebrities andrey boikie delirium total 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.540
 of acknowledges then this is the channel author review 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.880
 Designer Famous Channel Sri 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.500
 a specific audience 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.600
 I thank God found and decided to take 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.489
 interview with us joy I decided on 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.910
 some questions in general how came 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.270
 action on reviews on constructors 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.970
 Well, to be honest, I'll come this way from afar 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.519
 the question is generally since childhood when I loved 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.080
 to collect designers everyones there run 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.180
 not a league but then they of course 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.260
 surrendered colony drank thrown into 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.229
 trash and now being an adult I 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.110
 went to the shop drunk typesetter legate 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.729
 then you need to collect it autonomous why not 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.610
 take a review of my equipment 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:17.790
 everything was got shot so incomprehensible 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.229
 Obzorchik posted it like liked 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.939
 people and so that's what I actually 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.210
 activity of my channel quietly 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.979
 began to buy to shoot under the shoot 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.409
 here I am watching you shoot or video 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.030
 quite a long time just review of the set but I 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.560
 never looked how much 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.340
 when the first video was important how much 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.649
 already do something about being told 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.780
 so the first video was uploaded 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.670
 just recently by the way watched a couple 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.399
 days ago 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.100
 April 18 that is, the year will be soon 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.060
 my channel but roughly speaking review 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.289
 constructor so that is basically it 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.479
 ok considering that so much 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.850
 videos for the year so interesting 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.630
 sets from different committee series 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.159
 quite interesting i watch you 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.460
 collaborate with fellow saffron then 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.890
 do you have that as it met well 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.270
 in fact, he helped her at first 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.480
 promote my reviews 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.970
 longin success who noticed here and then i 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.170
 he was still remembered by fellow safron bus 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:25.650
 popular let's say so extinguisher here it is 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.650
 I helped a little bit has given me such a push in 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.739
 300 subscribers have come together and I am so 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.810
 all joy 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.659
 it is of course great and how much is leaving 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.549
 time to prepare for the survey to shoot 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.860
 but there about seven or eight minutes 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.610
 on how long it lasts 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.680
 installation lasts here 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.420
 honestly to charts so we dropped our 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.280
 preparation in principle is not a lot of time 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.210
 it leaves that everything is ready for her here 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.670
 lamps stand 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.590
 again I say rented at home no 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.140
 no studio equipment nothing wrong 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.350
 just simple homemade type lamp 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.980
 there slightly included set 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.920
 literally that's all the camera and I went 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.690
 mounting at me somewhere will fall 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.970
 what set again if about him 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.690
 tell here is the millennium falcon at me 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.330
 there was a review 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.170
 a huge set about him is what 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.870
 tell well it took three days probably 4 I 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.090
 buying too much and took off in pieces 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.830
 everything 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.410
 For example, just a review of briks is possible and 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:31.630
 an hour to cope in principle for 2 that is 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:33.640
 shooting shooting pancake shooting probably 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.959
 get somewhere you dream everything else 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.730
 it is like mounting already and so on which 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.330
 settle you like best and 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.230
 brik and run but in brik probably the 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.400
 good series 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:58.290
 military series many will agree with me 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:04:01.090
 for 1 or 2 2 who lego combat zones 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.160
 moving honestly some kind of 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.950
 There is no series of course a star fan 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.970
 wars and 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.769
 like very cool room service 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.560
 superhero probably funny series 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.260
 points of him from many series which i 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.380
 I adore I don't miss such harry anymore 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.540
 potter like pirates any up 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.280
 deliver a set on them were pretty 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.890
 interesting by many did not like 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.330
 and which sets in the near future there 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:30.010
 It can be as soon as it is 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.400
 most likely there will be some brik 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.110
 because as I say the channel 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.690
 devoted and only if at all 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.990
 by the designer so people brik harnesses on 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.930
 This 1 brik will do a series and if 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.410
 I have two sets 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:51.610
 these are familiar people with this with drain 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:54.700
 there are no wars there bordzha you also ganship 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.700
 Republican Well, I keep them very well 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.860
 I can't 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.340
 opening to the general meeting as you know 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.170
 no mood for such a fence 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.450
 then I think many will be interesting 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.010
 see so here this review at 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.170
 least on the barge jabba on the pennies not exactly 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.650
 really bring what you know to tell 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:15.170
 or cut the story so yes by the way 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.030
 here and this channel has accumulated 30 thousand 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.850
 egg subscribers congratulate this figure 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.800
 really so standing on the brain thanks 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.710
 for me it's a really huge number 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.840
 in fact if you take youtube this world is 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.660
 generally down there somewhere and if you take 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.250
 me another small city of shadows in 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:37.670
 principle, in which all or youtube 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:39.110
 Once this does not agree okay thanks it was 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.740
 very nice to talk and more 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:48.530
 learned many others too well passive 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:51.130
 time was tell the first time thanks 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.130
 OK Bye
