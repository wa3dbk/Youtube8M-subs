most<00:00:17.940> gamers<00:00:18.210> when<00:00:18.539> they<00:00:18.660> had<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.900> decide

most gamers when they had to decide

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.950 
most gamers when they had to decide
between<00:00:19.260> slate<00:00:20.039> or<00:00:20.600> castlevania<00:00:21.600> lords<00:00:21.660> of

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
between slate or castlevania lords of

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.750 
between slate or castlevania lords of
Shadow<00:00:22.260> they<00:00:22.830> went<00:00:23.039> with<00:00:23.100> Castlevania

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
because well it's Castlevania but I

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.060 
because well it's Castlevania but I
