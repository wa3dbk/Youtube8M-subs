rowdy there's some magical chemistry

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.279 
rowdy there's some magical chemistry
that<00:00:36.030> occurs<00:00:36.359> when<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.659> put<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.899> top<00:00:37.079> pool

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289

swimmers<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.920> ocean<00:00:38.280> swimmers<00:00:38.639> in<00:00:38.819> the<00:00:38.850> same

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
swimmers and ocean swimmers in the same

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.729 
swimmers and ocean swimmers in the same
race<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.539> think<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.050> great<00:00:40.079> marriage<00:00:40.499> if

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
race I think it's a great marriage if

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.469 
race I think it's a great marriage if
you<00:00:40.829> think<00:00:41.069> about<00:00:41.159> it<00:00:41.339> because<00:00:41.789> this<00:00:41.969> open

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:42.479 
you think about it because this open

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.090 
you think about it because this open
water<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.079> quick<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.589> only<00:00:43.829> about<00:00:43.949> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
water but it's quick it's only about a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.000 
water but it's quick it's only about a
mile<00:00:44.399> long<00:00:44.699> so<00:00:45.030> pool<00:00:45.479> swimmers<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:46.319> definitely

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
mile long so pool swimmers do definitely

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.410 
mile long so pool swimmers do definitely
have<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.190> chance<00:00:47.549> it<00:00:47.789> should<00:00:48.269> be<00:00:48.299> very

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
have a chance it should be very

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.899 
have a chance it should be very
interesting<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:49.679> the<00:00:50.159> strategy<00:00:50.460> out

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
interesting to see the strategy out

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.399 
interesting to see the strategy out
there<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.569> course<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.959> event<00:00:52.289> has

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
there and of course this event has

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.349 
there and of course this event has
traditionally<00:00:53.010> been<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.190> top<00:00:53.670> spot<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.299> the

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
traditionally been a top spot for the

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:55.729 
traditionally been a top spot for the
International<00:00:54.870> Swimming<00:00:55.019> calendar<00:00:55.530> why<00:00:55.679> is

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
that well I think a lot of swimmers love

that well I think a lot of swimmers love
