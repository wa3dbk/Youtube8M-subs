crazy<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:45.850> a<00:01:45.880> little<00:01:46.030> white<00:01:46.360> at<00:01:46.570> first<00:01:46.600> but<00:01:47.110> it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
crazy and a little white at first but it

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.990 
crazy and a little white at first but it
definitely<00:01:47.770> does<00:01:48.130> London<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.700> looks<00:01:48.820> more
