00:00:05.243 --> 00:00:07.487
I remember my first day in kindergarten

00:00:07.512 --> 00:00:09.985
I sat down next to a kid named Ricky

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:13.066
And I said:
"Hey Ricky, my name's Tyler, how are you?"

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.122
And he looks at me and he's like:
"I'm fine, thanksstfhhhh"

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.282
"Howtffhhh is you?"

00:00:17.318 --> 00:00:19.373
So I wipe the spittle from my face

00:00:19.421 --> 00:00:21.028
And I'm like:
'Oh my God, what am I doing?'

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:24.543
'My first day at school and I make friends
with a kid with a speech impediment'

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.738
'I'm.. I'm really fuckin' setting
myself up for failure, ain't I?'

00:00:27.764 --> 00:00:29.996
'I'm gonna go play with these Lincoln Logs, Ricky'

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:33.009
'You stay here and you try
not to swallow your tongue, alright?'

00:00:33.076 --> 00:00:37.021
Now, that's a little mean, I know but the kid
would spit all over your fuckin' face when you talk

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:39.124
Okay, I mean, we did become friends later on

00:00:39.178 --> 00:00:42.940
And believe me, I was no fuckin' Casanova either, okay?

00:00:42.993 --> 00:00:45.980
I remember one day we were told
to bring in the collection of something

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:47.392
For Show and Tell the next day

00:00:47.487 --> 00:00:51.376
It could be anything, as long
as it was at least 100 of something

00:00:51.424 --> 00:00:52.574
It had to be a hundred

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.195
I'm like:
'What the hell do I have of a hundred?'

00:00:55.232 --> 00:00:57.121
'I'm five years old,
what the hell am I gonna bring in?"

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.459
So my dad tells me:
"Hey, I got a 100 screws in the garage"

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:05.070
"You can have those, you can show
those to all your friends in school"

00:01:05.115 --> 00:01:07.877
'Oh sweet, thanks Dad, this will totally work!'

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:11.363
You got kids bringing in
a 100 comic books or a 100 action figures

00:01:11.396 --> 00:01:15.285
Here I am:
"Hey you guys wanna see my screw collection?"

00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:17.081
"I got a 100 of 'em!"

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.220
"No? Alright, I guess I'll just
play by myself for the rest of the year"

00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:25.866
But even though I was the weird kid
that brought in a fuckin' bag of screws to show and tell

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.410
I still had a girlfriend,
my first girlfriend in kindergarten

00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:30.836
Her name was Chelsea

00:01:30.876 --> 00:01:34.749
And I knew she was my girlfriend
because she coloured me a picture

00:01:34.883 --> 00:01:38.891
Okay, that's a big deal,
that's like second base in kindergarten

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.682
So I coloured her a picture of the Ninja Turtles

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:47.194
And after that every day she'd colour me a picture,
put it on my desk, before I get there in the morning

00:01:47.268 --> 00:01:50.661
I don't wanna say
I was big pimping in kindergarten, but..

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:52.778
I totally was big pimping in kindergarten!

00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:54.245
And that all happened for a while

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.388
Every morning I'd go in there,
and there would be a new picture on my desk

00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:00.412
Until one day there wasn't a picture on my desk

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.977
But there sure as hell was a picture
on the kid who sat next to me's desk

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.731
So I was like:
'What the hell, Chelsea?!'

00:02:05.756 --> 00:02:08.731
'Who's this.. Who's this picture
of Daffy Duck for, huh?!'

00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:12.004
'Fucking Daniel?! You coloured a picture for Daniel?!'

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:13.540
Let me tell you a little story about Daniel

00:02:13.565 --> 00:02:17.674
One day we're all sitting there
and Daniel was picking his nose in front of everybody

00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:22.044
And he wiped whatever he found in his nose
on the fuckin' crayons that we used to have

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.451
You know, the ones that were, like,
the size of a fuckin' roll of quarters

00:02:25.537 --> 00:02:27.489
He put a bugger on one of those crayons

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:30.972
And everybody stayed away from him
for the good four to five months

00:02:31.138 --> 00:02:33.731
So needless to say,
I was a little upset about Chelsea's decision

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.857
I was like:
'What the fuck?!'

00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:37.135
'I trusted you! I showed you my fucking..'

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.017
'..screw collection, for Christ's sake!'

00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:41.419
So after that it was just me and Ricky

00:02:41.502 --> 00:02:44.756
Me and mush mouth at the table, hanging out

00:02:44.807 --> 00:02:48.093
'Bros before hoes! Am I right, Ricky?
Bros before hoes!'

00:02:48.143 --> 00:02:51.294
'It's a rhetorical question, Ricky, okay?
Don't open your mouth for God's sakes!'

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:56.639
