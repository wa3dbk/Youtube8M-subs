00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 the vickers viscount medium-haul plane 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.790
 entered service 20 years ago 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.070
 can carry 65 passengers 500 km 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.080
 hour on stages of 1000 km 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.980
 the device is powered by four 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.439
 2600 turboprop his horses 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.470
 British builder vickers has 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.600
 manufactured 800 such devices including 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.750
 many moreover volts still air 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.939
 inter had thirteen viscount in use 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.850
 the plane that crashed last night 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.559
 stolen for 15 years we can certainly 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.300
 wonder that the useful life of an airplane 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.160
 longer than that of a 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.620
 automobile but it's that the plane is 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.420
 designed to live very long 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.059
 it is designed to be constantly 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.129
 rejuvenated on this disc for example there is 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.680
 today very few original parts 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.520
 turboprops have been 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.739
 regularly check check and the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.539
 parts have been changed 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.420
 the landing gear itself was 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.780
 changed last week and did not 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.200
 still served for a take-off 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.600
 in fact the tires are changed after 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.240
 about a hundred landing and 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.760
 all turboprops and 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.860
 completely regenerate after five thousand 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.200
 flight hours so that as say 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.920
 the technicians the plane loses its wrinkles 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.060
 during his career 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.960
 the plane can even improve in 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.180
 career course 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.600
 this is the case especially on this we can not 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.930
 thanks to this device it is the radar 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.369
 weather forecast that can detect by 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.869
 example of cumulo nimbus formations 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.340
 that can be unpleasant or 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.920
 dangerous for navigation this 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.229
 device did not originally exist 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.619
 it was added only five years ago 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.500
 so that this aging viscount 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.829
 may be more sophisticated than vscan 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.670
 young people coming out of factories 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.670
 fifteen years ago 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.830
 every flight is constantly followed by the 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.710
 famous black box that it is orange 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.200
 actually the flight recorder that the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.560
 technicians install in the tail of 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.550
 the device and that they can recover 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.750
 after each flight 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.540
 we will find in this recorder a 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.350
 metal film that will have been 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.280
 impressed by different 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.100
 news 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.190
 this movie what information is 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.280
 worn on this film we find 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.800
 not the flight itself we find 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.180
 elements that allow to reconstitute 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.510
 the trajectory of the plane 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.250
 ie the speed the cap of 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.950
 the plane its altitude 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.660
 naturally the time as well as the 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.280
 accelerations, that is to say the 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.740
 trajectory abnormalities will be a 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.660
 trajectory well then we found this 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.400
 movie about the accident of 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.690
 clermont ferrand 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.780
 what are we going to do now to 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.110
 from this movie from these movies 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.780
 we will reconstruct the flight of the plane and 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.550
 alone will examine the 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.170
 likelihood of different hypotheses 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.530
 that we could have done during the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.120
 investigation 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.280
 in other words, this film does not give a 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.900
 answer to the questions we ask ourselves but 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.440
 will serve as a starting point for a 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.000
 investigation 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.410
 it will be a starting point and a 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.410
 verification of different hypotheses
