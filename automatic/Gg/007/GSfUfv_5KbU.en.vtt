audio pretty incredible when you're

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.070 
audio pretty incredible when you're
working<00:00:35.920> down<00:00:36.040> the<00:00:36.280> 500<00:00:36.790> 600<00:00:37.300> megahertz<00:00:37.570> audio

those small frequency sections you have

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.740 
those small frequency sections you have
to<00:00:42.250> compress<00:00:42.699> the<00:00:42.940> sound<00:00:43.180> and<00:00:43.390> that's<00:00:43.449> the<00:00:43.600> way

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
to compress the sound and that's the way

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
channel and it's locked in if I shut the

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.500 
channel and it's locked in if I shut the
transmitter<00:01:20.860> off<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.580> receiver<00:01:21.910> remembers

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
transmitter off the receiver remembers

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.910 
transmitter off the receiver remembers
that<00:01:22.660> so<00:01:22.930> that<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.140> next<00:01:23.350> time<00:01:23.470> I<00:01:23.530> turn<00:01:23.800> the

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
that so that the next time I turn the

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.890 
that so that the next time I turn the
transmitter<00:01:24.250> on<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:25.030> same<00:01:25.300> transmitting

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
transmitter on that same transmitting

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.530 
transmitter on that same transmitting
channel<00:01:26.320> is<00:01:26.530> used<00:01:26.920> we<00:01:27.760> can<00:01:27.910> run<00:01:28.090> up<00:01:28.210> to<00:01:28.360> eight

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
channel is used we can run up to eight

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.990 
channel is used we can run up to eight
systems<00:01:29.200> that<00:01:29.650> would<00:01:29.770> be<00:01:29.890> for<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.280> duals<00:01:30.760> or

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
systems that would be for the duals or

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.899 
systems that would be for the duals or
eight<00:01:31.540> of<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.810> quattro<00:01:32.230> systems<00:01:32.760> they<00:01:33.760> also

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
eight of the quattro systems they also

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.550 
eight of the quattro systems they also
have<00:01:34.300> a<00:01:34.600> belt<00:01:35.260> pack<00:01:36.600> belt<00:01:37.600> pack<00:01:37.840> again<00:01:38.170> fairly

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
have a belt pack belt pack again fairly

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.680 
have a belt pack belt pack again fairly
standard<00:01:39.100> will<00:01:39.400> remember<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.940> channels<00:01:40.390> so

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
standard will remember the channels so

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.390 
standard will remember the channels so
they'll<00:01:40.810> communicate<00:01:41.080> together<00:01:41.680> just<00:01:42.159> press

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
they'll communicate together just press

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.610 
they'll communicate together just press
the<00:01:42.550> button<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:43.000> lock<00:01:43.480> them<00:01:43.659> in<00:01:43.810> one<00:01:44.440> of<00:01:44.560> the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
the button and lock them in one of the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.160 
the button and lock them in one of the
really<00:01:44.979> cool<00:01:45.190> features<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:46.240> d70<00:01:46.810> system

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
really cool features of the d70 system

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.350 
really cool features of the d70 system
is<00:01:47.560> that<00:01:47.770> if<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:47.950> shut<00:01:48.220> off<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.550> receiver<00:01:48.940> the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
is that if you shut off the receiver the

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.910 
is that if you shut off the receiver the
transmitter<00:01:49.960> will<00:01:50.170> automatically<00:01:50.680> shut<00:01:50.890> off

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
transmitter will automatically shut off

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.890 
transmitter will automatically shut off
so<00:01:51.370> there's<00:01:51.520> bi-directional<00:01:52.210> communication

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
so there's bi-directional communication

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.690 
so there's bi-directional communication
going<00:01:53.080> on<00:01:53.350> here<00:01:53.680> so<00:01:54.040> that's<00:01:54.190> really<00:01:54.310> cool<00:01:54.550> you

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
going on here so that's really cool you

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.580 
going on here so that's really cool you
just<00:01:54.729> shut<00:01:55.060> off<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.330> receivers<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:56.020> boom<00:01:56.470> the

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
just shut off the receivers and boom the

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.140 
just shut off the receivers and boom the
transmitters<00:01:57.130> also<00:01:57.430> get<00:01:57.580> shut<00:01:57.760> off<00:01:57.880> so<00:01:58.090> you

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
transmitters also get shut off so you

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.810 
transmitters also get shut off so you
don't<00:01:58.210> have<00:01:58.479> a<00:01:58.630> battery<00:01:58.960> problem<00:01:59.530> on<00:01:59.680> that<00:01:59.820> so

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
don't have a battery problem on that so

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.250 
don't have a battery problem on that so
you've<00:02:00.970> got<00:02:01.090> high<00:02:01.330> quality<00:02:01.390> audio<00:02:01.900> with<00:02:02.170> the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
you've got high quality audio with the

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.010 
you've got high quality audio with the
