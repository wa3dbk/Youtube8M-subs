I<00:02:26.500> mean<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.770> think<00:02:26.800> back<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.580> year<00:02:29.100> this<00:02:30.100> way

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
I mean I think back to the year this way

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.010 
I mean I think back to the year this way
as<00:02:30.700> far<00:02:30.880> as<00:02:31.000> from<00:02:31.180> when<00:02:31.570> I've<00:02:31.660> been<00:02:31.840> playing

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
as far as from when I've been playing

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.740 
as far as from when I've been playing
it's<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.380> or<00:02:32.620> when<00:02:32.800> I<00:02:33.180> think<00:02:34.180> when<00:02:34.270> roger<00:02:34.480> was

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
it's this or when I think when roger was

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.370 
it's this or when I think when roger was
at<00:02:34.900> 06<00:02:35.320> when<00:02:35.680> he<00:02:35.800> lost<00:02:36.520> three<00:02:36.760> matches

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
at 06 when he lost three matches

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.720 
at 06 when he lost three matches
something<00:02:38.380> like<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.650> five<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.070> mean<00:02:39.459> whatever

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
something like that five I mean whatever

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.890 
something like that five I mean whatever
