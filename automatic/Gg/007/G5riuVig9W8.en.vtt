you know it series being up and down I
think<00:04:06.620> these<00:04:07.040> games<00:04:07.340> one<00:04:07.939> lost<00:04:08.209> one<00:04:08.329> ball<00:04:08.629> so

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:09.219 
think these games one lost one ball so

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:10.780 
think these games one lost one ball so
hopefully<00:04:10.219> you<00:04:10.280> can<00:04:10.340> change<00:04:10.549> it<00:04:10.609> up<00:04:10.670> a<00:04:10.760> little

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
hopefully you can change it up a little

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.089 
hopefully you can change it up a little
bit<00:04:10.969> and<00:04:11.239> get<00:04:11.359> two<00:04:11.510> wins<00:04:11.629> in<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.870> row<00:04:12.040> put<00:04:13.040> the

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
bit and get two wins in a row put the

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.130 
bit and get two wins in a row put the
pressure<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.579> pressure<00:04:13.670> is<00:04:13.909> on<00:04:13.969> them<00:04:14.180> now<00:04:14.329> and

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
pressure the pressure is on them now and

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.900 
pressure the pressure is on them now and
also<00:04:15.379> on<00:04:15.709> that<00:04:15.739> so<00:04:16.039> it's<00:04:16.190> not<00:04:16.310> with<00:04:16.459> no<00:04:16.549> one<00:04:16.759> way

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
also on that so it's not with no one way

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.270 
also on that so it's not with no one way
street<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.630> pressure<00:04:17.870> is<00:04:18.190> I'm<00:04:19.190> very

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
street the pressure is I'm very

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.110 
street the pressure is I'm very
confident

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
confident

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.770 
confident
we<00:04:22.120> had<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.410> definitely<00:04:23.410> focus
