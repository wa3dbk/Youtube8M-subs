00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.830
 rare 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.560
 for us it's a chance a tiny chance I think little by little 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.809
 the team after the disappointment of the last match is being made 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.050
 surrender and tell himself he had a possibility 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.740
 but high level athletes that's it knows how to play a chance until the end 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.319
 we have one must play it to the mans account 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.019
 we set up little by little 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.380
 we leave for 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.960
 for this match against the country and to the others of this big of the world will not be 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.580
 an easy match but 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.630
 which can give you so much fear that you want to 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.280
 it's going well right now 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.280
 yes I was sad sad sad 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.640
 like the players like the spectators like the ones like the French who is 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.890
 who were expecting something from this team had a 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.640
 inexplicably by 1 1% compared to the match of Uruguay on Thursday ramatuelle 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.680
 he was not able to match a match that was a non match so we did not 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.290
 want to stay on it we want to 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.310
 but something me and keep this hope as long as possible in 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.090
 simply typing 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.680
 fighting on the ground with elano armand playing by creating something 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.970
 because if the high schools of pride and I believe that at a time 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.150
 of villiers who was passionate about not telling themselves a team with players of two 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.140
 audi vaud 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.380
 but who are capable of 2 5 years at home when I see the games on time 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.710
 current I saw playing the team of Algeria 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.030
 I'm so happy he even has time and so it's a touch two keys 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.630
 engaged play defend attack 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.829
 and then we dreamed for as long as possible a world cup 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.549
 it was his dream star it is necessary to go to the end of the dream but really after 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.200
 six years 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.010
 there was a moment there was a cloud 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.180
 now we have to bring something else 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.240
 I'm at the limit they do not even need to know if there have been any 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.380
 previous ones she tell herself that one thing is that it's playable that has a 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.400
 opportunity and that we must play it thoroughly I recall that 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.649
 no but mostly a little to a situation where we thought the others and make 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.670
 draw it was not the case the Netherlands played the match and return 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.250
 in destitution that 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.640
 allard us not to think of others and first take care of ourselves 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.889
 even 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.759
 this is something to do we have something to show his team 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:14.479
 of France 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.689
 and that's all that matters the rest 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.079
 we'll see if a boost of fate among them but at least we did 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:21.859
 we 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.199
 what it takes for that 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.199
 destiny since the smile 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.169
 she 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:30.429
 she
