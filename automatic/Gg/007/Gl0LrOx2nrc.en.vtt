00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:15.570
 the little led here is just for 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.670
 a point 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.680
 if you want to change fans 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.310
 to put a more powerful pointless of 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.760
 paint it using 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.260
 you will still have elected on Tuesday for 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.689
 finish with the fan I made a 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.260
 little test and plugging it into a 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.200
 other pc and actually it has a bitrate 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.309
 of air that is a little bit light and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.460
 also provides with pc hardware 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.710
 with the case forgive the screws so 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.430
 there is however absolutely nothing 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.770
 no dock but a priori it should not 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.680
 there is too much complexity so 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.930
 here it is said is worth that of the face 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.539
 before and connectors we have 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.850
 pretty basic connectors of the connected 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.840
 in usb 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.949
 finally what we can find 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.320
 usually so everything tried the state 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.540
 it's simple on the bottom so that 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.020
 should not pose any real concerns a 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:19.890
 filter is to avoid dust 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.009
 are the time card so that's the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.680
 filter so and like these elements t we 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.070
 will be able to come and place it correctly 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.530
 on the sale we put so I'm going 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.750
 already dined so it's not provided 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.320
 it is we who have bought for m 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.330
 knowing that the front part 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.680
 where is the fan there this 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.630
 place there actually 20 pm will shoot the air 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.460
 is not there breath and so that's what 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.229
 moment there actually the filter allows 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.040
 to avoid having to ship the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:58.040
 dust is so finally to put some of the 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.700
 dust in the casing is like the 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.840
 republic status 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:09.250
 so as you explained before this 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.880
 we will also be exchanged 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:17.989
 lifting their fan 120 mm and 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.360
 120 cm an original parent shot that 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.550
 suffer a little more so we took it 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.920
 with led to push a little more 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.190
 the appearance of a voluminous face 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.260
 before 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.130
 what is illuminating and blue 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.310
 actually appears so we're going 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.350
 start fixing the the fan that 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.739
 we bought because the other was 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.080
 not powerful enough I repeat so 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:49.760
 of computer is operating this power 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:52.150
 computer is serious sir vis my 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.150
 friend vi 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.340
 little we small holes 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.140
 always small troops of small 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.750
 holes of the little holes always 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.160
 small or so there you see that 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.300
 we should have put but we have 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.300
 family but we still go 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.780
 so explain there we put aside before 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.560
 the palettes and behind where there are the 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.230
 son you will tell me why 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.590
 simply because the air finally 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:25.060
 the air is going to go in by the so the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.880
 before and it will come out so by 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.350
 behind and that's why ben must 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.930
 not that it happens in the files what 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.720
 otherwise I remember they see that it's 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.250
 the back it's the front air make it 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.870
 from the front and back out 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.810
 so at the front of the case 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.450
 the air must be sucked into 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.480
 the case for moult reasons the 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.250
 first is that it's always down 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.500
 upwards that is to say that it comes back 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.780
 from the bottom it comes out from the top 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.790
 heat goes up one is well known is the 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.080
 second reason is that if you have 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.350
 a ball your casing placed on the 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.690
 office 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.340
 you would look in the head any 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.570
 anatolia during all the time you 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.830
 are in front of your pc it's not at all 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.540
 nice so better at home behind 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.080
 and so for the little explanation 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.030
 also 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.100
 it is better to first mount the 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.440
 fan that is currently there and 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.690
 then the famous filter is not like 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.180
 we explained it to you at the beginning in 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.400
 the other meaning one so first the fan 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:24.049
 then 2 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.049
 the filter sazy moult was right of course
