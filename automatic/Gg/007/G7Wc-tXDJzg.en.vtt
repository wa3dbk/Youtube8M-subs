00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello tankers with you eustace and today 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:15.210
 by wagging about how it might look 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:17.520
 I think a lot of Chinese Fri-Sau 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.890
 like you like me Chinese 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.039
 Sneakers like first of all because 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.170
 they are borrowed from the Soviet and 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.080
 they borrowed mostly the most 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.660
 interesting the most correct and the most 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.380
 powerful technical combat solutions and 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.020
 Therefore, the branch of Chinese birds should 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.210
 well be at least good at least 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.149
 interesting and a little bit as a minimum 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.719
 familiar to standard ordinary 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.910
 gave him a player touch on this topic 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.340
 I want to say that in fact in 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.980
 on the Internet we fry all kinds of forms 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.140
 all possible subject sites are very 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.199
 hard to find any information or 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.600
 drawings for Chinese destroyers 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.059
 tanks but nonetheless thanks to one 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.189
 Chinese player who leaked a few 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.100
 drawings in not the best of course 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.340
 quality we can see as possible 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.610
 the Chinese branch will look like 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.490
 so let's start the second and third 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.979
 levels are likely to take some attempt 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.790
 install Soviet cannon ZIS-3 and ZIS-6 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.619
 in stewart and british armored personnel carrier 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.170
 universal carrier looks like it will 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.729
 something like this 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.150
 fourth level supposedly 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.920
 amphibian buffalo which will carry on 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.270
 to myself 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.320
 plain Soviet caliber cannon 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.680
 57 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.670
 or 76 millimeters looks enough 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.210
 aggressively complete lack of armor 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.430
 level five is 63 85 installation 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.790
 eighty five millimeter again 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.310
 Soviet cannon armored personnel carrier type 63 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.320
 formed exactly such a car in 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.070
 suggest that she will be extremely 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.619
 fast sixth level btr 50 in which 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.200
 set either 85 millimeter or 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.360
 100 millimeters again soviet 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.090
 sample already 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.210
 again no armor 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.860
 armored cabin and lack of armor in 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.260
 body itself, but again 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.680
 car is extremely fast as I 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.500
 guess the seventh level and this is something 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.730
 like su-100 just as they say on 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.030
 Chinese forum 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.030
 this car based on you for 120 and again 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.650
 100 or 120 millimeter cannon 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.780
 for sure will be here but I guess 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.120
 that here you can even expect 130 and 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.980
 millimeter gun 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.000
 eighth level and this pawn is based on you 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.740
 for 111 or 113 which the Chinese have collected 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.610
 on the base of one hundred twenty two millimeter 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.920
 guns although it is no wonder that is-152 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.980
 which we all know very well 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.750
 whose guns 152 millimeters but 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.910
 maybe there to shove some 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.850
 unusual clever chinese shells 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.430
 Again, for now we are walking in this issue. 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.850
 waiting for official information official 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:13.459
 exit ninth level this pawn is in the spirit 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:16.430
 Su-122 54 it is called 130 59 and it is logical 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.100
 what is it on highway 59 and 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.200
 gun she has a caliber of 130 millimeters 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.959
 again as i see chinese cars 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.970
 will be very mobile little armored with 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.870
 good speed punches 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.269
 tools 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.480
 About the top here, too, the question is extremely 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.970
 blurred there are two options in z5a 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.980
 either from a tower heavily armored and with 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.380
 good armored hull with good 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.780
 dynamics and 130 mm millimeter 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.090
 either the same gun with is good too 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.610
 armored but already chopping which 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.250
 nowhere is rotated here such here 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.920
 Chinese cars all that expects us 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.750
 maybe that's all we will see 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.390
 thank you for your attention do not forget to bet 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.160
 thumbs up with you was justas 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.700
 my channel in the description of new meetings 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.700
 bye Bye
