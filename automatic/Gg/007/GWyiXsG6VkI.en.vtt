where our graphics card goes you're

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.290 
where our graphics card goes you're
taking<00:02:27.200> out<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.500> slot<00:02:28.340> space<00:02:28.670> there<00:02:28.910> for<00:02:29.209> it

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
taking out the slot space there for it

that anyway to set up dual graphics so
what<00:04:48.260> you<00:04:48.380> need<00:04:48.500> to<00:04:48.560> do<00:04:48.800> is<00:04:48.890> actually<00:04:49.100> you

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
what you need to do is actually you

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.370 
what you need to do is actually you

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
graphics in d2o graphics so that's where

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.990 
graphics in d2o graphics so that's where
your<00:05:11.479> total<00:05:12.440> graphic<00:05:12.740> configuration<00:05:13.370> it's

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
disabled a dual graphic see it shows you

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.730 
disabled a dual graphic see it shows you
APU<00:05:16.790> and<00:05:16.910> GPU<00:05:17.570> which<00:05:18.229> already<00:05:18.440> have<00:05:18.710> a

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.580 

take<00:05:27.020> a<00:05:27.050> second

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.470 

or<00:05:33.130> two<00:05:33.400> and<00:05:34.110> there<00:05:35.110> we<00:05:35.350> have<00:05:35.560> it<00:05:35.800> it's<00:05:36.480> flied

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
or two and there we have it it's flied

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.270 
or two and there we have it it's flied
in<00:05:37.750> and<00:05:38.130> we<00:05:39.130> have<00:05:40.650> dual<00:05:41.650> graphics<00:05:41.950> performance

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
in and we have dual graphics performance

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.830 
in and we have dual graphics performance
here<00:05:42.790> so<00:05:42.970> what<00:05:43.210> we're<00:05:43.330> going<00:05:43.419> to<00:05:43.510> do<00:05:43.630> is<00:05:43.750> we're

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
here so what we're going to do is we're

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.550 
here so what we're going to do is we're
going<00:05:43.930> to<00:05:43.990> do<00:05:44.139> some<00:05:44.410> some<00:05:44.950> quick<00:05:45.130> gameplay

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
going to do some some quick gameplay

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.930 
going to do some some quick gameplay
trying<00:05:47.560> throwing<00:05:47.830> Crysis<00:05:48.250> 2<00:05:48.280> there<00:05:48.610> and<00:05:48.639> see

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
trying throwing Crysis 2 there and see

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.820 
trying throwing Crysis 2 there and see
show<00:05:49.720> you<00:05:49.780> guys<00:05:50.050> how<00:05:50.950> it<00:05:51.310> functions<00:05:51.940> and<00:05:52.830> doing

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
show you guys how it functions and doing

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.850 
show you guys how it functions and doing
graphics<00:05:54.190> works<00:05:54.460> but<00:05:54.870> see<00:05:55.870> it<00:05:55.960> here<00:05:56.260> and<00:05:56.440> if

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
graphics works but see it here and if

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.620 
graphics works but see it here and if
you<00:05:56.980> go<00:05:57.010> back<00:05:57.340> into<00:05:57.490> performance<00:05:58.090> you<00:05:58.450> can

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
you go back into performance you can

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:06.890 
you go back into performance you can
actually<00:05:58.840> do<00:06:00.930> graphics<00:06:01.930> overdrive<00:06:02.410> in<00:06:03.389> here

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.719 

change<00:06:07.900> your<00:06:08.110> clock<00:06:08.800> speed<00:06:09.130> and<00:06:09.340> all<00:06:09.400> that<00:06:09.550> fun

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
change your clock speed and all that fun

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.670 
change your clock speed and all that fun
stuff<00:06:09.760> now<00:06:10.120> this<00:06:10.389> is<00:06:10.540> this<00:06:10.750> has<00:06:11.139> nothing<00:06:11.560> to<00:06:11.590> do

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
stuff now this is this has nothing to do

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.830 
stuff now this is this has nothing to do
with<00:06:11.830> the<00:06:12.040> dual<00:06:12.940> graphic<00:06:13.300> itself<00:06:13.600> but

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
with the dual graphic itself but

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.240 
with the dual graphic itself but
actually<00:06:14.139> this<00:06:14.260> is<00:06:14.440> for<00:06:14.620> your<00:06:14.770> dedicated

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
actually this is for your dedicated

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.920 
actually this is for your dedicated
graphics<00:06:15.940> card<00:06:16.150> so<00:06:16.389> you<00:06:16.479> can<00:06:16.540> actually

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
graphics card so you can actually

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.350 
graphics card so you can actually
increase<00:06:17.740> your<00:06:17.889> clock<00:06:18.190> speed<00:06:18.520> and<00:06:18.760> as<00:06:19.090> well<00:06:19.270> as

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
increase your clock speed and as well as

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.940 
increase your clock speed and as well as
memory<00:06:19.660> performance<00:06:20.229> and<00:06:20.380> all<00:06:20.440> that<00:06:20.620> fun

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
memory performance and all that fun

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.530 
memory performance and all that fun
stuff<00:06:20.979> so<00:06:21.910> just<00:06:22.570> showing<00:06:23.050> you<00:06:23.169> guys<00:06:23.290> that
