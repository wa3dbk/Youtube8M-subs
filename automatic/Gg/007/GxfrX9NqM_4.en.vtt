00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.540
 Good day to all of us now 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.199
 unpacking the tablet and phone from 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:24.359
 store sandpiper in this package have 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.689
 us ciao mi mi pad and rear 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.880
 5000 phone and tablet Well 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:37.219
 proceed to unpacking remove 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:46.739
 packing bag and take out first 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:49.550
 phone and then a box of chocolates here we are 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.690
 came more than two devices are sending 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.850
 there is nothing well ordinary packaging with 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.480
 pimples package wrapped 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.140
 so it's over aspired now let's 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.920
 Let's start with the tablet 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:18.060
 the tablet is more interesting and cooler and so it 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:22.320
 xiaomi mi pad 4 tablet on tegra k1 so 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.619
 the box should open us up just 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.130
 by scotch and without it 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:35.030
 only very tightly made 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.030
 the box goes so easy not to open 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:46.790
 but quietly cope to cope with 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:52.869
 the box is very tight because the cardboard on 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.869
 cardboard or spruce opens the whole thing 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:06.260
 and so here we are xiaomi mi pad 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:10.399
 4 more precisely just mipad in such a tone 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.640
 Pictures bags on the case more 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.570

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:27.970
 such a glossy plastic behind us 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:31.540
 let's turn it on while it seems to be pressed 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.300
 so okay she and sky all discharged a 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.130
 no, I just pressed a button 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.380
 loudness is a bit of a bad decision to me 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.780
 it seems somehow changed the volume button 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.250
 power button but okay bye tablet 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.240

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:57.800
 this charger and so 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.410
 it we still have to say all the wiring here 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.920

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.910

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.680

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:20.019
 well, lan, all of the tablet us turned on as we 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:24.459
 see everything works cool 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:29.560
 the display is good that's the brightness 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:32.180
 everything is pretty interesting necessarily 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.950
 do a reviewer and see how you are 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.890
 this tablet is well worth probably 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.590
 see the presence of the Russian language in 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.200
 This tablet to immediately see 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.600
 how can we out of the box 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.600
 use or not means we find 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:57.110
 language settings 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.890
 it is with us here and see what we 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.530
 there are languages 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.980
 there are quite a few of them but Russians 10 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.280
 necessarily present here he is and how we 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.430
 We see a little tablet localized camping 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.970
 but of course not all menu items are translated 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.620
 but as we know standard applications 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.480
 any translated some not yes then 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.000
 there will be something in english 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.320
 something in Russian but all new 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.180
 applications that you will 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.140
 of course they will have 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:30.230
 Russian language because setting 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.240
 the system already lets us informed 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.780
 the application that all of us are Russian 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.750
 language so here it turned out 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:43.520
 the tablet can now be seen 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:47.540
 he telefonchik those than 5000 course 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.460
 he was named for capacious 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.919
 battery which you like 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.520
 guessed it has five thousand mA well 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.490
 and 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.180
 good enough characteristics for 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.320
 chinese phone 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.770
 it means in the set we immediately see 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.180
 Flip case 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.370
 than he is with the little window like gg2 here what 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.130
 then it will either reflect the information 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:15.970
 whether there is weather or something else in general 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:19.630
 useful case further we have a phone with 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:22.439
 and he is already in progress in this bumper 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.240
 plastic 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:26.520
 Well, at night with such a bumper interesting 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.969
 just to protect 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.889
 like the case and the actual phone to 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.379
 now turn on and see how he 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.629
 It works and I do not want to say that it is strong 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:42.159
 weighty or has a huge thickness 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:44.560
 because its thickness is only 8 and 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:48.219
 9 millimeters as indicated on box a 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.830
 weight is about 162 grams already from the battery 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:53.169
 And the battery as far as I know myself 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.419
 all about eighty two grams so 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.780
 that I don't think the Chinese have gathered here 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:02.289
 or installed less capacity all here 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.810
 I am sure to read well 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:09.340
 brought probably already a lot of everything here 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:12.419
 it is interesting as standard already and the tips here 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.620
 we changed tell about this phone 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:18.029
 when I do the test and 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.750
 especially with capacity and that by yourself 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:22.169
 Presents you know in the set with us 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:28.270
 there is still a protective film 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:30.219
 instruction as well as earbuds charger 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:35.919
 device and the phone supports 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:39.310
 fast charging and everywhere microusb cable 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:41.620
 and most interestingly in the kit yet 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.409
 There is such a keychain android 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:48.029
 it allows you to charge other devices 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:53.710
 from a given phone and so mol e.g. 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:57.730
 we put in here 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:07:02.290
 and from here we will have another go yusb 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:03.520
 a cable that can with it 

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.460
 can be charged 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.380
 another phone since we have 5000 here 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.180
 and in principle for example with you 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.300
 battery has three thousand milliamps 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.850
 capacity then using this device 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:19.980
 you can fully charge yourself 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:25.080
 mobile phone is all on this our 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:31.350
