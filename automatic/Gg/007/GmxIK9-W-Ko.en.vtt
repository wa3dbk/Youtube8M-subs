where<00:01:17.330> we<00:01:17.420> want<00:01:17.510> to<00:01:17.600> fish<00:01:17.810> we<00:01:17.930> need<00:01:18.080> to<00:01:18.140> get<00:01:18.200> up

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
where we want to fish we need to get up

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.770 
where we want to fish we need to get up
current<00:01:18.860> upwind<00:01:19.400> put<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:20.000> boat<00:01:20.210> coming<00:01:20.630> back

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
current upwind put that boat coming back

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.050 
current upwind put that boat coming back
on<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:20.990> anchor<00:01:21.320> Oh<00:01:21.350> get<00:01:22.070> back<00:01:22.100> onto<00:01:22.400> our<00:01:22.580> GPS

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
on the anchor Oh get back onto our GPS

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.330 
on the anchor Oh get back onto our GPS
mark<00:01:23.330> back<00:01:23.930> on<00:01:24.080> we've<00:01:24.350> sanded<00:01:24.740> out<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.100> found

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
mark back on we've sanded out and found

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.070 
mark back on we've sanded out and found
a<00:01:25.490> bit<00:01:25.610> of<00:01:25.700> good<00:01:25.790> ground<00:01:26.090> get<00:01:26.360> that<00:01:26.479> cube<00:01:26.810> trial

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
a bit of good ground get that cube trial

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.180 
a bit of good ground get that cube trial
happening<00:01:27.410> and<00:01:27.500> hopefully<00:01:27.770> we'll<00:01:27.890> get<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.040> few

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
happening and hopefully we'll get a few

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.930 
happening and hopefully we'll get a few
snapper<00:01:28.490> up<00:01:28.750> or<00:01:29.750> burling<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:30.890> using<00:01:31.550> burley

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
snapper up or burling and using burley

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.880 
snapper up or burling and using burley
or<00:01:32.060> cubes<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.570> catch<00:01:33.020> me<00:01:33.229> spin<00:01:33.470> around<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.770> long

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
or cubes to catch me spin around a long

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.770 
or cubes to catch me spin around a long
time<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.430> nothing<00:01:35.120> too<00:01:35.300> hard<00:01:35.450> about<00:01:35.630> that

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
time so nothing too hard about that

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.719 
time so nothing too hard about that
quite<00:01:36.229> a<00:01:36.290> bit<00:01:36.350> of<00:01:36.530> fresh<00:01:36.950> bait<00:01:37.190> I've<00:01:37.369> got<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.550> mac

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
quite a bit of fresh bait I've got a mac

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.400 
quite a bit of fresh bait I've got a mac
tune<00:01:37.940> here<00:01:38.210> I've<00:01:38.330> got<00:01:38.390> a<00:01:38.509> few<00:01:38.660> pikliz<00:01:39.050> as<00:01:39.200> well

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
tune here I've got a few pikliz as well

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.430 
tune here I've got a few pikliz as well
side<00:01:39.950> areas<00:01:40.310> will<00:01:40.460> pop<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.030> side<00:01:41.240> off<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.479> off

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
side areas will pop the side off the off

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.910 
side areas will pop the side off the off
the<00:01:42.500> older<00:01:43.190> Mac<00:01:43.970> tuner<00:01:44.240> here<00:01:44.770> which<00:01:45.770> is

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
the older Mac tuner here which is

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.070 
the older Mac tuner here which is
fantastic<00:01:46.100> bait<00:01:46.640> also<00:01:47.090> makes<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.600> great

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
fantastic bait also makes the great

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.810 
fantastic bait also makes the great
cubes<00:01:48.470> as<00:01:48.680> well<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.130> I'll<00:01:49.190> cut<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.369> few<00:01:49.580> bites

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
cubes as well so I'll cut a few bites

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.469 
cubes as well so I'll cut a few bites
out<00:01:50.030> of<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:51.220> and<00:01:52.220> what<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:52.610> can<00:01:52.729> do<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:53.090> also

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
out of that and what you can do is also

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.080 
out of that and what you can do is also
is<00:01:53.540> it<00:01:53.720> cut<00:01:53.930> a<00:01:53.960> few<00:01:54.170> cubes<00:01:54.530> as<00:01:54.740> well<00:01:54.950> start<00:01:55.910> that

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
is it cut a few cubes as well start that

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.880 
is it cut a few cubes as well start that
cube<00:01:56.360> trial<00:01:56.690> going<00:01:56.900> so<00:01:57.229> much<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.470> same<00:01:57.650> as<00:01:57.800> if

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
cube trial going so much the same as if

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.800 
cube trial going so much the same as if
you're<00:01:58.009> cubing<00:01:58.340> futuna<00:01:58.850> or<00:01:58.940> something<00:01:59.240> let's

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
you're cubing futuna or something let's

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.730 
you're cubing futuna or something let's
throw<00:01:59.990> one<00:02:00.170> in<00:02:00.580> let<00:02:01.580> that<00:02:01.729> slowly<00:02:02.060> sink<00:02:02.479> away

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
throw one in let that slowly sink away

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.870 
throw one in let that slowly sink away
have<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.800> look<00:02:03.920> at<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.070> direction<00:02:04.399> your<00:02:04.670> cube

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
have a look at the direction your cube

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.030 
have a look at the direction your cube
trials<00:02:05.300> going<00:02:05.509> and<00:02:06.410> maybe<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:06.770> can<00:02:06.860> throw

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
trials going and maybe you can throw

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.130 
trials going and maybe you can throw
another<00:02:07.220> one<00:02:07.369> back<00:02:07.580> up<00:02:07.820> current<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:08.869> then<00:02:09.019> as

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
another one back up current and then as

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.080 
another one back up current and then as
that<00:02:09.410> one<00:02:09.560> disappears<00:02:10.100> just<00:02:10.580> pop<00:02:10.760> the<00:02:10.880> next

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
that one disappears just pop the next

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.150 
that one disappears just pop the next
one<00:02:11.239> in<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.840> ideas<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.350> get<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:12.560> snap<00:02:12.920> out<00:02:13.070> to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
one in the ideas to get that snap out to

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.220 
one in the ideas to get that snap out to
come<00:02:13.370> along<00:02:13.640> get<00:02:14.150> into<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.450> burly<00:02:14.810> trial<00:02:15.080> and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
come along get into that burly trial and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.220 
come along get into that burly trial and
eventually<00:02:15.590> find<00:02:15.800> you<00:02:15.920> will<00:02:16.010> be<00:02:17.230> using

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
eventually find you will be using

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.500 
eventually find you will be using
overhead<00:02:18.800> tackle<00:02:19.160> here<00:02:19.310> this<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.580> 6600

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
overhead tackle here this is a 6600

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.680 
overhead tackle here this is a 6600
