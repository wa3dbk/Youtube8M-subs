00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.139 
the whole point of this is to show you
that<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:46.350> eliminates<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.369> autocorrect<00:01:48.000> in

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
that it eliminates the autocorrect in

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.210 
that it eliminates the autocorrect in
safari<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.020> instead<00:01:49.560> will<00:01:49.770> allow<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
safari and instead will allow you to

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.149 
safari and instead will allow you to
rely<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.759> google's<00:01:51.540> search<00:01:52.259> suggestions

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
rely on google's search suggestions

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.850 
rely on google's search suggestions
which<00:01:53.549> are<00:01:53.759> often<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.270> lot<00:01:54.479> better<00:01:54.780> then<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
which are often a lot better then of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.399 
which are often a lot better then of
course<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.280> far<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.640> auto<00:01:56.850> correct<00:01:57.299> again<00:01:58.200> if

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
course so far is auto correct again if

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.410 
course so far is auto correct again if
you're<00:01:58.560> interested<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.340> no<00:01:59.700> search<00:02:00.030> correct

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
you're interested in no search correct

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.940 
you're interested in no search correct
and<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.780> head<00:02:00.930> over<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.170> flip<00:02:01.829> over
