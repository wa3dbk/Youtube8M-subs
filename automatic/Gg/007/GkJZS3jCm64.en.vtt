structured it so that we've got Amoco to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.350 
structured it so that we've got Amoco to
give<00:00:47.850> us<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.480> sixty<00:00:48.840> percent<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.360> initial

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
give us the sixty percent of the initial

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.209 
give us the sixty percent of the initial
of<00:00:53.570> financing<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.780> put<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.129> I

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
of financing to put this in and then I

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.510 
of financing to put this in and then I
went<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.460> found<00:00:56.730> private<00:00:57.660> equity<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:58.530> only<00:00:59.219> in

they hadn't done and some marketing
inside<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:12.420> think<00:01:12.600> within<00:01:12.869> about<00:01:13.020> 90

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
inside of this we think within about 90

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.320 
inside of this we think within about 90
days<00:01:13.740> we're<00:01:14.460> gonna<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.700> trying<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.000> able<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
days we're gonna be trying to able to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.039 
days we're gonna be trying to able to
triple<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.530> net<00:01:16.740> profit<00:01:17.509> and<00:01:18.509> generate

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
triple the the net profit and generate

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.920 
triple the the net profit and generate
and<00:01:19.320> pay<00:01:19.500> off<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.860> loan<00:01:20.460> fairly<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.750> what

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and pay off the loan fairly so what

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.350 
and pay off the loan fairly so what
would<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.200> say<00:01:22.409> are<00:01:22.880> two<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.030> biggest

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
would you say are two of the biggest

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.719 
would you say are two of the biggest
issues<00:01:24.600> with<00:01:25.229> what<00:01:26.040> was<00:01:26.189> causing<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.700> problem

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
issues with what was causing the problem

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.730 
issues with what was causing the problem
for<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> stories<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.110> profitable<00:01:28.650> to

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
for the stories to not be profitable to

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.770 
for the stories to not be profitable to
begin<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.130> yeah<00:01:29.700> there's<00:01:30.360> there's<00:01:30.659> two

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
begin with yeah there's there's two

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.140 
begin with yeah there's there's two
things<00:01:31.200> number<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:31.740> was<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.430> corporation

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
things number one was the corporation

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.300 
things number one was the corporation
type<00:01:33.329> take<00:01:33.540> them<00:01:33.659> all<00:01:33.810> over<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.439> manage<00:01:35.100> them

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
type take them all over and manage them

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.590 
type take them all over and manage them
and<00:01:35.430> they<00:01:35.520> didn't<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> structure<00:01:36.420> in

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and they didn't have a structure in

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.219 
and they didn't have a structure in
place<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.290> they<00:01:37.409> had<00:01:37.790> rotating<00:01:39.229> managers

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
place and so they had rotating managers

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.649 
place and so they had rotating managers
in<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> stores<00:01:40.860> about<00:01:41.280> every<00:01:41.610> two<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.850> three

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
in the stores about every two to three

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.130 
in the stores about every two to three
weeks

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
weeks

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.200 
weeks
they<00:01:43.530> put<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> different<00:01:43.979> manager<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.060> so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
they put a different manager in and so

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.920 
they put a different manager in and so
there's<00:01:45.390> no<00:01:45.570> continuity<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.740> lots<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.310> issues

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
there's no continuity and lots of issues

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.950 
there's no continuity and lots of issues
with<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.530> my<00:01:48.800> taking<00:01:49.160> money<00:01:49.940> out<00:01:50.060> put<00:01:50.540> it<00:01:50.690> in<00:01:50.840> the
