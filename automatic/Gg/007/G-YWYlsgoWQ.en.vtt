base<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:31.630> I'll<00:02:31.930> be<00:02:32.050> with<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.230> shortly<00:02:32.290> so

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
base and I'll be with you shortly so

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.650 
base and I'll be with you shortly so
I've<00:02:33.280> come<00:02:33.430> across<00:02:33.550> this<00:02:33.910> base<00:02:34.210> this<00:02:34.450> is

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
I've come across this base this is

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.930 
I've come across this base this is
literally<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.320> perfect<00:02:35.470> base<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:36.670> like

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
literally the perfect base that I like

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.930 
literally the perfect base that I like
to<00:02:37.210> raid<00:02:37.480> we've<00:02:37.990> got<00:02:38.170> about<00:02:38.490> 170,000<00:02:39.490> gold<00:02:39.700> I

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
to raid we've got about 170,000 gold I

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.250 
to raid we've got about 170,000 gold I
don't<00:02:40.300> really<00:02:40.390> care<00:02:40.570> much<00:02:40.630> for<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.020> elixir

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
don't really care much for the elixir

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.560 
don't really care much for the elixir
but<00:02:41.500> we<00:02:41.590> also<00:02:41.740> have<00:02:42.010> over<00:02:42.280> 1000<00:02:43.060> dark<00:02:43.330> elixir

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
but we also have over 1000 dark elixir

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.390 
but we also have over 1000 dark elixir
which<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.050> big<00:02:44.320> big<00:02:44.710> thumbs<00:02:44.980> up<00:02:45.130> in<00:02:45.280> my

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
which is a big big thumbs up in my

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.250 
which is a big big thumbs up in my
opinion<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.940> we<00:02:46.240> also<00:02:46.390> have<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.840> town<00:02:47.020> hall

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
opinion and we also have the town hall

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.840 
opinion and we also have the town hall
on<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.470> outside<00:02:47.890> so<00:02:48.100> pretty<00:02:48.400> much<00:02:48.580> it's<00:02:48.790> a

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
on the outside so pretty much it's a

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.090 
on the outside so pretty much it's a
win-win<00:02:49.180> either<00:02:49.420> way<00:02:49.660> let's<00:02:50.320> begin<00:02:50.500> by

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
win-win either way let's begin by

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.460 
win-win either way let's begin by
dropping<00:02:51.490> a<00:02:51.640> couple<00:02:52.210> arches<00:02:52.720> down<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.230> bottom

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
dropping a couple arches down the bottom

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.530 
dropping a couple arches down the bottom
here<00:02:53.500> just<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.340> make<00:02:54.940> sure<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.180> Town<00:02:55.360> Hall

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
here just to make sure that Town Hall

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.090 
here just to make sure that Town Hall
gets<00:02:55.720> taken<00:02:55.900> out<00:02:56.140> so<00:02:56.380> there's<00:02:56.560> one<00:02:56.770> start

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
gets taken out so there's one start

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.250 
gets taken out so there's one start
automatically<00:02:57.880> now<00:02:58.450> we<00:02:58.510> got<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.870> work<00:02:58.960> out<00:02:59.080> how

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
automatically now we got to work out how

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.450 
automatically now we got to work out how
we're<00:02:59.380> going<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.530> approach<00:02:59.650> in<00:02:59.980> here<00:03:00.160> usually

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
we're going to approach in here usually

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.180 
we're going to approach in here usually
I<00:03:00.940> use<00:03:01.630> this<00:03:01.990> sort<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.380> method<00:03:02.560> I'll<00:03:02.830> sort<00:03:03.040> of

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
I use this sort of method I'll sort of

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.460 
I use this sort of method I'll sort of
just<00:03:03.430> dump<00:03:03.850> a<00:03:03.940> giant<00:03:04.330> so<00:03:04.900> he'll<00:03:05.080> kind<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.350> take

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
just dump a giant so he'll kind of take

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.290 
just dump a giant so he'll kind of take
a<00:03:05.500> couple<00:03:05.770> of<00:03:05.890> hits<00:03:06.100> tucked<00:03:06.490> up<00:03:06.670> wake<00:03:06.910> up<00:03:07.090> for

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
a couple of hits tucked up wake up for

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.000 
a couple of hits tucked up wake up for
wall<00:03:07.450> breakers<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.050> then<00:03:08.440> kind<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:08.740> just<00:03:08.890> go

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
wall breakers and then kind of just go

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.830 
wall breakers and then kind of just go
