00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
is really when you get to start to

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.400 
is really when you get to start to
decide<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.100> curve<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.090> because<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.110> can

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
decide the curve of it because you can

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.699 
decide the curve of it because you can
choose<00:02:27.010> how<00:02:27.550> far<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.480> red<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:29.110> paint<00:02:29.410> or

choose how far on the red to paint or

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.430 
choose how far on the red to paint or
how<00:02:29.950> far<00:02:30.280> on<00:02:30.459> they're<00:02:30.670> white<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:32.050> really<00:02:32.410> just

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
how far on they're white so really just

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.990 
how far on they're white so really just
start<00:02:32.950> on<00:02:33.280> one<00:02:33.940> side<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.989> curve<00:02:35.290> your<00:02:35.530> way<00:02:35.739> in

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
start on one side and curve your way in

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.309 
start on one side and curve your way in
down<00:02:37.000> towards<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.450> center<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:37.840> then<00:02:38.050> stop

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
down towards the center and then stop

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.300 
down towards the center and then stop
and<00:02:39.160> then<00:02:39.220> start<00:02:39.819> from<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.180> other<00:02:40.390> side<00:02:41.310> lay

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
and then start from the other side lay

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:50.509 
and then start from the other side lay
it<00:02:42.700> down<00:02:47.489> yeah<00:02:48.489> see<00:02:48.970> I<00:02:49.000> like<00:02:49.300> having<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.840> red

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
it down yeah see I like having the red

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.310 
it down yeah see I like having the red
taking<00:02:51.519> up<00:02:51.670> most<00:02:51.910> of<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.269> finger<00:02:52.630> because<00:02:53.019> one

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
taking up most of the finger because one

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.809 
taking up most of the finger because one
red<00:02:54.220> pops<00:02:55.000> more<00:02:55.300> as<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:56.019> color<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.890> it's<00:02:57.190> just<00:02:57.519> a

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
red pops more as a color and it's just a

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.699 
red pops more as a color and it's just a
nicer<00:02:58.360> color<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.810> have<00:02:58.989> on<00:02:59.140> your<00:02:59.290> nails<00:02:59.440> and

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709
