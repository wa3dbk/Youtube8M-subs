00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
and everything but I'm over i think the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.990 
and everything but I'm over i think the
solar<00:04:34.979> sheets<00:04:35.250> are<00:04:35.370> way<00:04:35.490> better<00:04:35.669> than<00:04:35.759> this

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
solar sheets are way better than this

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.270 
solar sheets are way better than this
one<00:04:36.210> but<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:37.259> know<00:04:37.349> for<00:04:37.530> half<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.830> price<00:04:37.860> i

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
one but you know for half the price i

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.770 
one but you know for half the price i
think<00:04:38.310> young<00:04:38.729> you<00:04:38.939> will<00:04:39.090> actually<00:04:39.300> just<00:04:39.659> go
