00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hair knows everything and we hardly have to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.080
 a new video from me today is one 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.970
 very special video because I have one 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.190
 video now in cooperation with vidal 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.460
 Session bare pointed and that me 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.400
 asked for two hairstyling tutorials 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.070
 make for the summer and yes this 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.800
 by the way is the second lok and today 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.330
 there is the first year as I said 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.189
 intro I have a bit of that yes 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.680
 Packed, I say 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.689
 so do not be surprised if I am 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.870
 Now so said then go ahead with 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.730
 that with the right hair tutorial because 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.380
 he now you see the result 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.180
 from the first I have now with the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.430
 worked and this is here 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.600
 my first summer still a very 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.940
 voluminous sides braid with a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.250
 herringbone pin and when it comes wanted 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.379
 I did that then it just stays 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.489
 then I wish you much fun me 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.829
 now the soft shampoo under the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.030
 slight rinsing used by the volume 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.850
 line 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.930
 and then continue with the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.100
 foam stabilizer also from the series and there 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:16.189
 I take that much and now 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.189
 only apply it to the approach 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.720
 The next step would be upside down now 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.130
 to fill that does not want me now because 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.170
 ye know how that works 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.060
 simply feel upside down and that we so 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.799
 get a bit more volume and 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.899
 must now draw even 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.729
 be dry so rather the approach that 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.950
 he just a nice module have the rest 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.659
 can still be a bit wet 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.909
 and then will catch but this time 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.030
 Let's start with the side pigtail and 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.280
 Although I make a herringbone braid 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.600
 I'll show it to you for a very short time 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.850
 of course you can if you want 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.560
 youtube videos look it's 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.479
 that's why millions of tutorials will be 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.490
 I show you only briefly because many 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.310
 of you can certainly already 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.530
 We take our hair so said 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.259
 on the side now have the 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.270
 whole harem with two games so one 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.019
 half so said and two halves 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.060
 then we actually start from that of 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.130
 right from my right hand book 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.069
 half seen next to me a little 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.350
 bit and put this over here and 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.209
 go next to that in the other half 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.579
 then we take a little from here 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.709
 bit put that back over it 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.780
 take that back to the other half 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.870
 with pure and we do that 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.870
 actually 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.760
 that was it already 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.860
 that is the fusion could be such a 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.440
 a bit of humming a bit that 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.379
 recover volume 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.940
 yes and finished is actually the doll 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.250
 is super super fast looks right 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.930
 beautiful and you will please me 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.180
 I often think about it 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.080
 if you have the burr because he just like that 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.849
 looks nice and as I said if you 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.829
 have thicker hair or have longer 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.090
 looks more beautiful but you can 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.659
 Of course, even with a hair length 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.879
 if you make has often tutorial 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:17.390
 So you like the hairstyling with 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:20.890
 the profis products and yes we see 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.890
 hopefully in the next blog
