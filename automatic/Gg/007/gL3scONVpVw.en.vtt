 Ricardo and where is all here 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.509
 Wednesday of November December with a 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.550
 new episode of this special of 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.989
 Christmas if you already know me thank you for 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.180
 to be here again it gives me great pleasure 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.190
 see you here again and the news 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.170
 important of the day is that 36 are already missing 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.180
 days for Christmas it's time to prepare 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.129
 the gifts but good the video of the day 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.629
 Today I like it a lot and I'm going to tell you 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.250
 why I always wanted to be a 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.899
 gingerbread house but does not have a 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.850
 opportunity because here as I do not know 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.949
 they use a lot and that is that they look like super fathers 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.170
 with the colors the sweets and all this 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.940
 so I said good it can be a little house 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.769
 that does not have to be ginger but 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.329
 that also serves me to decorate well 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.069
 I came up with this little house that you will see 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.109
 then and it was very nice 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:04.210
 also in super easy but if they want 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.950
 know how it is done do not move and hands 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.780
 to the work 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.750
 and the materials that we are going to use 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.750
 for this little house of ginger are 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.299
 and cardboard and paper shell 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.299
 foamy with diamond 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.740
 white diamond 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.329
 wadding 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.189
 and the tool of always 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.189
 today 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.150
 and to begin with, what I'm going to use is 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.790
 cardboard or some subtype of this material 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.340
 I recommend cardboard because of this 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.470
 way they are recycling just like in 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.780
 this example where this piece that I am 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.120
 using is in fact a cover of a 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.170
 pizza box and what I'm going to do is what 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.049
 following 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.210
 I'm going to draw a rectangle of 20 x 15 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.280
 centimeters and at the base I will score 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.950
 the points 3 centimeters away 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.899
 from each corner to then mark a 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.780
 point in the middle of the top line 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.729
 of the rectangle then I'm going to join the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.500
 two upper corners of the rectangle 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.500
 with the points we made at the base 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.420
 now I'm going to make a triangle of 10 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.579
 centimeters high on the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.750
 rectangle so that these figures we 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.750
 form a little house 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.740
 we cut and we stay like this and 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.560
 of this piece we are going to need 2 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.230
 and also make two 20 x rectangles 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.270
 18 centimeters like these and once 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.340
 let's have these four pieces, let's 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.410
 use the mold to mark the shape 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.240
 in shape and with diamond of the color that 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.080
 you want 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.390
 we cut it to have this 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.160
 now let's set up the house to the 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.440
 rectangles take off the lashes of 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.690
 paper by the side of 20 centimeters 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.360
 to be able to paste them with the other pieces 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.310
 and what follows is very simple just 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.440
 we paste the other part of the tab with 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.830
 the piece of cardboard to put together something like 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.830
 this 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.730
 and the fun comes, we're going to cover the 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.159
 house with Formica pieces 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.140
 we cut here there is no lose and now 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.140
 The house is lined up 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.050
 they will realize that cyclin is 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.360
 see the board but do not worry the 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.670
 let's cover it with a piece of foami is 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.730
 a strip 4 centimeters wide by 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.740
 20 tall I just made some cuts on him 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.750
 mold in this way I leave them my 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.090
 facebook so that the checks that 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.890
 you can play with that even 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.450
 use of those scissors that cut out with 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.879
 some pattern 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.620
 and it's time to make the roof is just as 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.140
 easy let's make another two 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.660
 rectangles by in this occasion of 23 x 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.310
 16 centimeters and we're going to paste them 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.750
 this way trying to stay 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.750
 perfectly centered 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.849
 once stuck we are left with this 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.489
 way it's already grabbing way now we're going 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.010
 to cut out a piece of guardad of 23 x 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.500
 32 centimeters to stick it on the ceiling 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.090
 and give the effect as snow and 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.090
 let's stick this way 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.000
 and ready once stuck now we're going to 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.039
 give a touch of brightness to the snow 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.139
 let's put some Diamantina but 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.150
 so that it sticks on this occasion 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.889
 I'm going to put on hair spray that 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.520
 you can also use resist 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.830
 the white but very carefully 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.440
 we do a little bit and we put the 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.330
 diamond put something down so that 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.330
 can circulate the Levantine that falls 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.740
 and it's all finally I made these doors 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.350
 and windows to also put the 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.520
 these molds to make these figures are 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.520
 I also leave them on Facebook 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.360
 and already this is very optional I also did 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.610
 a fireplace to give that last touch 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.830
 it's just a rectangle with a cut in 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.129
 diagonal with the angle of the roof to 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.050
 that makes perfect and you're palettes 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.300
 way like the ones I did in the video 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.219
 the birthday basket with candy if 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.229
 they want to know how they are made or want 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.210
 remember how I leave the link in the 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:34.759
 description box to check it 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.759
 and then nothing the result is this 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.960
 yes 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:01.619
 and what did you think they liked, I'm very 

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:03.389
 sure that if it looks amazing from 

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:05.399
 can do several different 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.319
 sizes and build as a village it 

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:09.330
 I would see super father at the foot of his little tree 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:11.699
 to me this week toja to put it as 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.379
 centerpiece but I do not know how 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.300
 it stays and he wants to comment that seen in 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:17.069
 common internet was quoted from plastic that 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.719
 they look very real and they would look super 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.249
 father in this house I can not 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:22.679
 get them but if you can 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:24.330
 cheer up and put on and if you like and 

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:26.339

 photo on social networks here below them 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:29.819
