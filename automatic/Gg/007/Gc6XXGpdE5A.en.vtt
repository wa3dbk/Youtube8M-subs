out<00:01:15.840> there<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.140> person<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:16.860> taking<00:01:17.250> their

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
out there I person like taking their

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.230 
out there I person like taking their
double<00:01:17.759> chocolate<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:19.189> mean<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.369> does<00:01:20.549> its<00:01:20.820> its

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
double chocolate I mean it does its its

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.420 
double chocolate I mean it does its its
job<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.810> got<00:01:21.990> whey<00:01:22.200> protein<00:01:22.710> isolate<00:01:23.220> which

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
job it's got whey protein isolate which

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.570 
job it's got whey protein isolate which
is<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.670> quick-acting<00:01:24.170> protein<00:01:25.170> whey<00:01:26.130> protein

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
is a quick-acting protein whey protein

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.520 
is a quick-acting protein whey protein
concentrates<00:01:27.240> which<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> bit<00:01:27.990> slower<00:01:28.320> in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
concentrates which is a bit slower in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.609 
concentrates which is a bit slower in
absorption<00:01:29.000> due<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.240> lactose<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.869> fat<00:01:31.290> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
absorption due to the lactose in fat and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.880 
absorption due to the lactose in fat and
there<00:01:32.460> are<00:01:32.549> also<00:01:32.700> whey<00:01:33.290> protein<00:01:34.290> peptides

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
there are also whey protein peptides

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.359 
there are also whey protein peptides
which<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:36.060> are<00:01:36.270> more<00:01:36.479> readily<00:01:37.020> available

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
which just are more readily available

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.410 
which just are more readily available
for<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> body<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:39.810> give<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.860> protein<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.729> 5<00:01:42.210> out

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
for the body I give this protein a 5 out

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.240 
for the body I give this protein a 5 out
of<00:01:42.450> 5<00:01:42.570> there's<00:01:43.049> nothing<00:01:43.350> wrong<00:01:43.500> with<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.799> only

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
of 5 there's nothing wrong with it only

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.850 
of 5 there's nothing wrong with it only
thing<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.759> could<00:01:44.939> think<00:01:44.970> about<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:46.320> quite

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
thing I could think about is it's quite

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.249 
thing I could think about is it's quite
pricey<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.939> Australia<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.659> what<00:01:48.810> there's<00:01:49.140> not

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
pricey in Australia and what there's not

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.859 
pricey in Australia and what there's not
much<00:01:49.530> really<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.310> about<00:01:50.549> that

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.240 

okay<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.079> next<00:01:55.229> supplement<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.979> I'll<00:01:56.130> be

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
okay the next supplement that I'll be

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.580 
okay the next supplement that I'll be
talking<00:01:56.490> about<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:57.149> creating<00:01:57.659> now<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
talking about is creating now the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.429 
talking about is creating now the
creating<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.520> use<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.509> by<00:02:00.899> optimum

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
creating that I use is by optimum

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.410 
creating that I use is by optimum
nutrition<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.490> micronized<00:02:03.060> creatine

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
nutrition it is micronized creatine

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.760 
nutrition it is micronized creatine
powder<00:02:04.229> which<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.579> creatine<00:02:06.299> monohydrate

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
powder which is a creatine monohydrate

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.330 
powder which is a creatine monohydrate
now<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.799> only<00:02:07.979> take<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.459> on<00:02:08.670> my<00:02:08.970> tray

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
now I only take this on my tray

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.339 
now I only take this on my tray
days<00:02:10.080> it's<00:02:11.080> about<00:02:11.349> 5<00:02:11.830> grams<00:02:12.220> per<00:02:12.640> serving<00:02:13.349> I

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
days it's about 5 grams per serving I

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.690 
days it's about 5 grams per serving I
bought<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.130> for<00:02:15.550> roughly<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.450> think<00:02:16.830> $30<00:02:17.830> it's

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
bought this for roughly I think $30 it's

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.800 
bought this for roughly I think $30 it's
been<00:02:18.880> a<00:02:18.910> while<00:02:19.180> now<00:02:19.349> it<00:02:20.349> goes<00:02:20.410> yeah<00:02:20.709> $30<00:02:21.520> for<00:02:21.810> 5

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
been a while now it goes yeah $30 for 5

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.720 
been a while now it goes yeah $30 for 5
