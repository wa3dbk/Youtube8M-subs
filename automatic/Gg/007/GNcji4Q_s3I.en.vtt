 first planes actually thought it's 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.740
 super with the exclusion of are 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.630
 practically in horizontal flight it's a 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.860
 aircraft that remained operational 28 years 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.800
 in the air force he went into 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.510
 service in 1956 and he was still in

 service at the school of hunting of cazouls 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:05.160
 in 1983 and I think it's a 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.160
 absolutely unmatched performance 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.930

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.360
 ago 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.700
 the great satisfaction of being 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.070
