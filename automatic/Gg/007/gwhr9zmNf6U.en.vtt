00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
similar to the iskin solo FX which is

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.640 
similar to the iskin solo FX which is
like<00:01:15.000> 30-some<00:01:15.840> dollars<00:01:16.260> so<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.530> is

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
like 30-some dollars so this is

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.060 
like 30-some dollars so this is
literally<00:01:17.010> half<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.430> price<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:19.020> solo<00:01:19.380> FX<00:01:19.770> I

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
literally half the price of a solo FX I

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.820
