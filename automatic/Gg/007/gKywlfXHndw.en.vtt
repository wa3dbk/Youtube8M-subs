that packing the jackpot episode on my

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.710 
that packing the jackpot episode on my

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.880 
and I think we only got through three
episodes<00:06:11.600> before<00:06:11.780> we<00:06:12.110> go<00:06:12.230> on<00:06:12.290> in<00:06:12.440> four<00:06:12.650> maybe

we can actually lost a bit longer in

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.590 
we can actually lost a bit longer in
this<00:06:15.110> one<00:06:15.350> but<00:06:15.740> we<00:06:15.830> will<00:06:15.980> see<00:06:16.190> but<00:06:16.700> I'm<00:06:17.060> just
