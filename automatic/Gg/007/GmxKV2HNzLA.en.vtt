00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.590
 we'll just see here how we build public Paul 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.490
 gomes 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.269
 tallec arthurzinho q2 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.269
 by 2 to 1 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:16.649
 There are some ways to put together that kubot capes like that is not culture is 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.930
 to 1 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.329
 parallelepiped 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.329
 it's over if you already messed up 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.710
 write head 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.199
 it changes formatting right 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.369
 one option is for you to make it return to that format 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.900
 detroit that two by two by 4 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.640
 and then you only do what you're going to do in that part of the way here 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.070
 fischer all right 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.840
 all the way you can ride used on these things that you've learned to 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.520
 ride or three by three by four 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.740
 the text says that the fact is that the media here 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.910
 né fortão sentence that between the socks and you can ride those same two 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.870
 by two by four the same way I turn three pots save all means 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.210
 to buriti 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.299
 but if it is going to mount the socks then it is vaia that return the ends the same way 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.790
 three by three for 14 2 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.800
 the duo three by three for two also the tables thing that their plans to 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.390
 crying and going to ride 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.410
 and in the end you'll have to tidy up the nooks and crannies 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.200
 on the same day and can also be an option 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.870
 but I'd rather do it another way 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.650
 these these 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.480
 these four people than these other 480 that of the medium 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.560
 negus threatened that of tales the 4 of 4 low of cement 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.620
 and the one that emails the socks are eight common pieces two by two 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.179
 And you can ride this moment. 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.579
 all this kernel as if it were a two products 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.510
 that it's the messy skeleton 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.640
 did it as well as two feet as if finishing riding is common two by 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.760
 two 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.020
 it goes into that two-by-two format by 400 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.580
 do not have an error 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.410
 It's just that he looks at me, he's just missing the songs. 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.769
 as above 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.569
 so come on first 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.809
 a lot of my side
