00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
directions which are pretty basic just

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.910 
directions which are pretty basic just
like<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.930> showed<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.560> all<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
pieces click together and because this

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.230 
pieces click together and because this
is<00:01:58.979> gonna<00:01:59.100> make<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.369> pretty<00:01:59.579> good<00:01:59.759> size<00:02:00.000> hoop

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
this is pretty cool it does work as they

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.839 
this is pretty cool it does work as they
say<00:02:49.080> it's<00:02:49.530> supposed<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.159> which<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.519> counts

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849

your clicks and as we showed in the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
video Alex got up to 21 I think it was

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.880 
video Alex got up to 21 I think it was
clearly<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.489> 22<00:02:57.269> she<00:02:57.660> says<00:02:57.870> but<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.680> thing<00:02:58.860> is

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
clearly to 22 she says but the thing is

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.400 
clearly to 22 she says but the thing is
is<00:02:59.580> we<00:02:59.849> saw<00:03:00.150> had<00:03:00.390> her<00:03:00.569> stopped<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.290> we

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
is we saw had her stopped so that we

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.530 
is we saw had her stopped so that we
could<00:03:01.650> show<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.819> if<00:03:02.910> we<00:03:03.030> would<00:03:03.180> have<00:03:03.269> let<00:03:03.450> her

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
could show so if we would have let her

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.270 
could show so if we would have let her
go<00:03:03.569> she<00:03:03.840> probably<00:03:04.560> would<00:03:04.799> have<00:03:04.830> gotten<00:03:05.099> more

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280
