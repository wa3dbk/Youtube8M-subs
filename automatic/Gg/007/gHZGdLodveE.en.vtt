when<00:00:53.730> we're<00:00:53.879> playing<00:00:54.000> slow<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.680> begin

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
when we're playing slow and as we begin

that<00:00:58.109> rhythm<00:00:58.559> straightens<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.809> so<00:01:00.809> let<00:01:01.020> me

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
that rhythm straightens out so let me

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.319 
that rhythm straightens out so let me
play<00:01:01.320> some<00:01:01.559> different<00:01:01.920> tempos<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.579> time<00:01:02.969> feel

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:30.140 

go<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:21.980> little<00:01:22.040> quicker

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.110 

as<00:01:30.560> we<00:01:31.560> speed<00:01:31.800> up<00:01:31.830> those<00:01:32.190> notes<00:01:32.460> start<00:01:32.820> getting

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
as we speed up those notes start getting

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:41.660 
as we speed up those notes start getting
a<00:01:33.240> little<00:01:33.480> closer<00:01:33.750> together

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.490 

same<00:01:42.670> thing<00:01:42.939> if<00:01:43.450> we<00:01:43.600> start<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:43.960> push<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.320> tempo

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
same thing if we start to push the tempo

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.069 
same thing if we start to push the tempo
all<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.729> way<00:01:45.850> up<00:01:46.030> to<00:01:46.060> kind<00:01:46.390> of<00:01:46.450> like<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.689> bebop

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
all the way up to kind of like the bebop

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.919 
all the way up to kind of like the bebop
land<00:01:47.380> we<00:01:47.979> start<00:01:48.250> to<00:01:48.399> get<00:01:48.549> quarter<00:01:49.119> note<00:01:49.299> and<00:01:49.509> 28

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
land we start to get quarter note and 28

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:51.929 
land we start to get quarter note and 28
swear<00:01:50.439> it's<00:01:50.560> not<00:01:50.799> really<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.340> triplet

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
swear it's not really a triplet

swear it's not really a triplet
subdivision

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.140 

so<00:02:02.930> it<00:02:03.020> almost<00:02:03.140> becomes<00:02:03.560> one<00:02:04.160> two<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:04.790> three

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
so it almost becomes one two and three

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.510 
so it almost becomes one two and three
four<00:02:05.180> n<00:02:05.720> at<00:02:06.050> a<00:02:06.170> quick<00:02:06.380> tempo<00:02:06.710> one<00:02:06.920> two<00:02:07.160> three
