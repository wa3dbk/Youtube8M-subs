you is it really we asked a couple of

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.610 
you is it really we asked a couple of
top<00:00:08.910> drivers<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.360> tell<00:00:09.540> us<00:00:09.599> all<00:00:09.840> about<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
top drivers to tell us all about the

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.590 
top drivers to tell us all about the
circuit

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.820 

well<00:00:19.600> to<00:00:19.840> talk<00:00:19.990> about<00:00:20.109> the<00:00:20.289> track<00:00:20.500> we<00:00:20.650> need

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
well to talk about the track we need

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.650 
well to talk about the track we need
someone<00:00:21.130> who<00:00:21.250> knows<00:00:21.310> more<00:00:21.880> than<00:00:22.359> the<00:00:22.449> fact

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660

someone who knows more than the fact
that<00:00:22.720> just<00:00:23.020> goes<00:00:23.820> anti-clockwise<00:00:24.820> so<00:00:25.449> turns

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
that just goes anti-clockwise so turns

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.909

extra<00:00:44.260> power<00:00:44.440> we've<00:00:44.650> had<00:00:44.769> recently<00:00:44.980> because

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
extra power we've had recently because

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.770 
extra power we've had recently because
one<00:00:45.610> thing<00:00:45.640> we're<00:00:45.940> seeing<00:00:46.150> a<00:00:46.210> lot<00:00:46.239> with<00:00:46.629> the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
one thing we're seeing a lot with the

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.360 
one thing we're seeing a lot with the
cars<00:00:46.989> is<00:00:47.260> you're<00:00:47.530> using<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:47.860> brakes<00:00:48.070> a<00:00:48.220> lot

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
cars is you're using the brakes a lot

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.700 
cars is you're using the brakes a lot
and<00:00:48.489> you're<00:00:48.579> coming<00:00:48.760> in<00:00:49.030> I<00:00:49.210> mean<00:00:49.629> how<00:00:49.870> is<00:00:50.170> it<00:00:50.500> an

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
and you're coming in I mean how is it an

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.079 
and you're coming in I mean how is it an
easy<00:00:50.920> thing<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.220> get<00:00:51.309> the<00:00:51.400> brakes<00:00:51.610> right<00:00:51.850> every

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
easy thing to get the brakes right every

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.609 
easy thing to get the brakes right every
single<00:00:52.330> time<00:00:52.449> coming<00:00:52.659> out<00:00:52.720> first<00:00:52.989> caller<00:00:53.440> come

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:53.619 
single time coming out first caller come

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.020 
single time coming out first caller come
in<00:00:53.710> there<00:00:53.860> I<00:00:54.010> think<00:00:54.400> especially<00:00:54.460> in<00:00:54.879> this

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
in there I think especially in this

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.270 
in there I think especially in this
corner<00:00:55.360> it's<00:00:55.570> not<00:00:55.869> too<00:00:56.080> easy<00:00:56.110> to<00:00:56.920> find<00:00:57.129> the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
corner it's not too easy to find the

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.180 
corner it's not too easy to find the
perfect<00:00:57.699> breaking<00:00:58.089> point<00:00:58.390> but<00:00:59.049> I<00:00:59.470> think<00:01:00.070> you

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
perfect breaking point but I think you

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.119 
perfect breaking point but I think you
you<00:01:00.400> get<00:01:00.580> used<00:01:00.820> to<00:01:00.909> it<00:01:01.000> so<00:01:01.330> but<00:01:02.229> it's<00:01:02.500> it's<00:01:02.920> not

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
you get used to it so but it's it's not

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.640 
you get used to it so but it's it's not
perfect<00:01:03.519> every<00:01:03.699> lap<00:01:03.879> so<00:01:04.119> does<00:01:05.019> that<00:01:05.049> breaking

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
perfect every lap so does that breaking

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.649 
perfect every lap so does that breaking
point<00:01:05.860> move<00:01:06.010> around<00:01:06.250> from<00:01:06.460> lap<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:06.790> lap<00:01:06.880> or<00:01:07.060> are

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
point move around from lap to lap or are

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.750 
point move around from lap to lap or are
you<00:01:07.750> like<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.170> full-on<00:01:09.130> drallah<00:01:09.400> you<00:01:09.549> drove<00:01:09.729> a

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
you like a full-on drallah you drove a

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.880 
you like a full-on drallah you drove a
visual<00:01:10.450> mark<00:01:10.720> who<00:01:10.900> use<00:01:11.080> every<00:01:11.380> time<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:11.710> break

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
visual mark who use every time to break

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.840 
visual mark who use every time to break
no<00:01:12.549> no<00:01:12.700> it's<00:01:12.909> just<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:14.860> driver<00:01:15.130> used<00:01:15.400> to<00:01:15.520> you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
no no it's just just driver used to you

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.580 
no no it's just just driver used to you
know<00:01:15.970> where<00:01:16.210> were<00:01:16.360> to<00:01:16.540> break<00:01:16.720> it's<00:01:17.200> not<00:01:17.290> easy<00:01:17.439> I

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
know where were to break it's not easy I

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.499 
know where were to break it's not easy I
mean<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:18.280> make<00:01:18.430> every<00:01:18.670> a<00:01:18.700> real<00:01:18.970> app<00:01:19.119> same<00:01:19.330> time

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
mean to make every a real app same time

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:20.789 
mean to make every a real app same time
breaking<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.049> everything<00:01:20.409> to<00:01:20.560> make<00:01:20.680> the

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
breaking and everything to make the

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.830 
breaking and everything to make the
corner<00:01:21.100> exactly<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.610> same<00:01:21.820> every<00:01:22.030> time<00:01:22.060> it's

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
corner exactly the same every time it's

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.360 
corner exactly the same every time it's
very<00:01:22.960> difficult<00:01:23.230> but<00:01:23.590> it<00:01:23.680> is<00:01:23.770> very<00:01:23.980> important

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
very difficult but it is very important

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.060 
very difficult but it is very important
to<00:01:24.400> be<00:01:24.580> consistent<00:01:25.000> so<00:01:25.660> it's<00:01:25.930> not<00:01:26.050> easy<00:01:26.200> okay

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
to be consistent so it's not easy okay

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.320 
to be consistent so it's not easy okay
we<00:01:27.400> can<00:01:27.520> follow<00:01:27.670> our<00:01:27.790> selves<00:01:28.030> around<00:01:28.180> I'm

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
we can follow our selves around I'm

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.180 
we can follow our selves around I'm
gonna<00:01:28.750> cheat<00:01:29.020> like<00:01:29.230> a<00:01:29.260> shortcut<00:01:29.680> here<00:01:29.860> look<00:01:30.100> I

open switch back here what'swhat's
methodology<00:01:38.200> of<00:01:38.260> approaching<00:01:38.650> that<00:01:38.830> yeah<00:01:39.550> the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
methodology of approaching that yeah the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.149 
methodology of approaching that yeah the
important<00:01:40.510> is<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.659> go<00:01:41.470> a<00:01:41.500> little<00:01:41.800> for<00:01:42.130> me

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
important is to go a little for me

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.770 
important is to go a little for me
without<00:01:42.400> at<00:01:42.670> rattle<00:01:42.970> into<00:01:43.120> the<00:01:43.270> corner<00:01:43.600> but

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
without at rattle into the corner but

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.899 
without at rattle into the corner but
when<00:01:44.170> i'm<00:01:44.260> turning<00:01:44.650> i<00:01:44.770> already<00:01:45.100> accelerate<00:01:45.700> to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
when i'm turning i already accelerate to

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.170 
when i'm turning i already accelerate to
get<00:01:46.060> a<00:01:46.090> good<00:01:46.600> on<00:01:46.780> power<00:01:46.990> steering<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:49.060> not

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
get a good on power steering and to not

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.570 
get a good on power steering and to not
be<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.390> wide<00:01:50.020> from<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.440> corner<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:50.890> driving<00:01:51.460> to

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
be a wide from the corner and driving to

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.550 
be a wide from the corner and driving to
drive<00:01:51.820> as<00:01:52.030> much<00:01:52.060> close<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.630> those<00:01:52.750> as<00:01:53.110> possible

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
drive as much close to those as possible

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.990 
drive as much close to those as possible
I<00:01:53.710> think<00:01:53.979> it's<00:01:54.100> in<00:01:54.340> this<00:01:54.640> corner<00:01:54.880> it's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
I think it's in this corner it's

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.050 
I think it's in this corner it's
important<00:01:55.650> not<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.710> hit<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.010> dots<00:01:57.220> over<00:01:57.460> there

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
important not to hit the dots over there

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.840 
important not to hit the dots over there
then<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:58.420> have<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:58.659> bad<00:01:59.170> corner<00:01:59.440> but<00:01:59.740> and<00:01:59.950> I

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
then you have a bad corner but and I

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.160 
then you have a bad corner but and I
think<00:02:01.060> for<00:02:01.360> me<00:02:01.390> it's<00:02:01.659> important<00:02:01.990> not<00:02:02.110> to

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
think for me it's important not to

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.480 
think for me it's important not to
accelerate<00:02:02.680> too<00:02:02.830> much<00:02:03.010> in<00:02:03.190> this<00:02:03.310> section

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
accelerate too much in this section

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.880 
accelerate too much in this section
because<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.240> overshoot<00:02:04.780> sometimes<00:02:05.290> then<00:02:05.560> but

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
because I overshoot sometimes then but

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.639 
because I overshoot sometimes then but
it's<00:02:06.880> not<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.360> hard<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.930> drive<00:02:08.200> i<00:02:08.440> think

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
it's not that hard to drive i think

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.940 
it's not that hard to drive i think
never<00:02:09.610> Horace<00:02:09.909> good<00:02:10.119> if<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.929> girls<00:02:11.200> good<00:02:11.409> now

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
never Horace good if the girls good now

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.199 
never Horace good if the girls good now
behind<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:12.489> we'll<00:02:12.610> be<00:02:12.670> able<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.940> have<00:02:13.180> a

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
behind it so we'll be able to have a

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.250 
behind it so we'll be able to have a
section<00:02:13.510> here<00:02:13.569> which<00:02:14.019> is<00:02:15.989> when<00:02:16.989> we<00:02:17.080> come<00:02:17.230> into

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
section here which is when we come into

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.960 
section here which is when we come into
the<00:02:17.860> only<00:02:18.069> one<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.400> other<00:02:18.549> track<00:02:18.760> is

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
the only one of the other track is

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.649 
the only one of the other track is
called<00:02:19.060> very<00:02:19.299> long<00:02:19.659> hair<00:02:20.290> painted<00:02:20.709> yeah

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
called very long hair painted yeah

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.759 
called very long hair painted yeah
actually<00:02:22.659> this<00:02:22.959> corner<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.290> very<00:02:23.560> difficult

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
actually this corner is very difficult

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.680 
actually this corner is very difficult
because<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.790> need<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:24.970> give<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.420> need<00:02:25.569> to

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
because you need to give you need to

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.379 
because you need to give you need to
have<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.870> good<00:02:26.049> on<00:02:26.200> power<00:02:26.439> steering<00:02:26.859> to<00:02:27.700> be<00:02:27.849> as

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:28.389 
have a good on power steering to be as

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:29.970 
have a good on power steering to be as
quick<00:02:28.599> as<00:02:28.749> possible<00:02:28.959> on<00:02:29.349> the<00:02:29.499> exit<00:02:29.799> of<00:02:29.829> the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
quick as possible on the exit of the

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.120 
quick as possible on the exit of the
corner<00:02:30.159> so<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:30.849> have

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
corner so you have

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.100 
corner so you have
go<00:02:31.280> in<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.730> but<00:02:31.910> an<00:02:32.120> acceleration<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.960> have

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
go in and but an acceleration you have

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.660 
go in and but an acceleration you have
to<00:02:33.200> go<00:02:33.320> we<00:02:33.590> have<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:33.800> have<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.950> good<00:02:34.340> on<00:02:34.460> power

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
to go we have to have a good on power

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.450 
to go we have to have a good on power
steering<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.360> not<00:02:36.020> lose<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.350> time<00:02:36.560> with<00:02:36.830> 180

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
steering to not lose the time with 180

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.240 
steering to not lose the time with 180
corners<00:02:37.880> because<00:02:38.060> those<00:02:38.360> are<00:02:38.510> very<00:02:38.630> tricky

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
corners because those are very tricky

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.770 
corners because those are very tricky
respectively<00:02:40.250> or<00:02:40.340> indoors<00:02:41.300> you<00:02:41.450> tend<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.690> get

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
respectively or indoors you tend to get

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.090 
respectively or indoors you tend to get
a<00:02:41.840> lot<00:02:41.990> this<00:02:42.200> switch<00:02:42.440> backing<00:02:42.800> don't<00:02:42.980> you

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
a lot this switch backing don't you

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.740 
a lot this switch backing don't you
which<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.250> don't<00:02:43.580> get<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:44.030> know<00:02:44.060> on<00:02:44.360> time

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
which you don't get you know on time

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.540 
which you don't get you know on time
axis<00:02:45.050> X<00:02:45.140> we've<00:02:45.290> got<00:02:45.440> more<00:02:45.590> space<00:02:45.890> mean<00:02:46.160> does

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
axis X we've got more space mean does

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.000 
axis X we've got more space mean does
that<00:02:46.580> mean<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:46.910> have<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.090> very<00:02:47.330> different

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
that mean you have a very different

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.260 
that mean you have a very different
concept<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.220> car<00:02:49.400> not<00:02:49.520> obvi<00:02:49.820> set<00:02:49.970> up<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.150> lose

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
concept the car not obvi set up to lose

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.430 
concept the car not obvi set up to lose
carpet<00:02:50.690> but<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:50.900> have<00:02:51.020> it<00:02:51.110> look<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.290> have<00:02:51.380> a

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
carpet but you have it look I have a

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.900 
carpet but you have it look I have a
different<00:02:51.650> concept<00:02:52.100> where<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.370> car<00:02:52.550> wants<00:02:52.820> me

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
different concept where the car wants me

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.730 
different concept where the car wants me
to<00:02:52.970> make<00:02:53.270> it<00:02:53.420> more<00:02:53.510> front<00:02:53.840> ND<00:02:54.140> for<00:02:54.290> example

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
to make it more front ND for example

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.280 
to make it more front ND for example
yeah<00:02:55.640> that's<00:02:56.300> that's<00:02:56.630> very<00:02:56.840> important<00:02:57.170> that

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
yeah that's that's very important that

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.060 
yeah that's that's very important that
you<00:02:57.320> have<00:02:57.500> a<00:02:57.530> lot<00:02:57.770> of<00:02:57.910> in<00:02:58.910> corner<00:02:59.510> steering<00:03:00.070> for

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
you have a lot of in corner steering for

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.330 
you have a lot of in corner steering for
this<00:03:01.190> pie<00:03:01.460> for<00:03:01.700> this<00:03:01.790> hairpins<00:03:02.210> and<00:03:02.600> I<00:03:03.340> don't

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
this pie for this hairpins and I don't

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.100 
this pie for this hairpins and I don't
like<00:03:04.460> the<00:03:04.610> corner<00:03:04.880> much<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:05.330> I<00:03:05.600> always<00:03:05.930> always

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
like the corner much so I always always

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.670 
like the corner much so I always always
shoot<00:03:06.380> there<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.520> don't<00:03:08.450> like<00:03:08.660> that<00:03:08.930> this

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
shoot there and I don't like that this

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.880 
shoot there and I don't like that this
kind<00:03:09.980> of<00:03:10.160> corner<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:10.940> we<00:03:11.320> have<00:03:12.320> we<00:03:12.440> encounter

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
kind of corner so we have we encounter

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.770 
kind of corner so we have we encounter
section<00:03:13.160> over<00:03:13.340> there<00:03:13.460> which<00:03:13.700> is<00:03:13.940> again<00:03:14.600> quite

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
section over there which is again quite

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.330 
section over there which is again quite
a<00:03:14.840> traditional<00:03:15.350> cut<00:03:15.800> back<00:03:16.040> through<00:03:16.280> that

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
a traditional cut back through that

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.390 
a traditional cut back through that
again<00:03:16.550> sort<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.060> medium<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.540> open<00:03:17.720> wide<00:03:17.900> i<00:03:17.930> mean

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
again sort of medium I open wide i mean

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.070 
again sort of medium I open wide i mean
when<00:03:19.400> you're<00:03:19.520> saying<00:03:19.700> that<00:03:19.790> we<00:03:20.450> set<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.870> car

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
when you're saying that we set the car

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.900 
when you're saying that we set the car
up<00:03:21.290> which<00:03:21.860> part<00:03:22.190> of<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.310> track<00:03:22.550> do<00:03:22.670> you<00:03:22.760> think

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
up which part of the track do you think

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.340 
up which part of the track do you think
i<00:03:23.000> can<00:03:23.180> make<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:23.360> most<00:03:23.450> amount<00:03:23.660> of<00:03:23.750> time<00:03:23.960> on<00:03:23.990> I

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
i can make the most amount of time on I

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.790 
i can make the most amount of time on I
think<00:03:25.310> on<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.390> corner<00:03:26.810> exit<00:03:27.140> because<00:03:27.320> I<00:03:27.470> made

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
think on the corner exit because I made

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.770 
think on the corner exit because I made
a<00:03:27.830> my<00:03:28.070> car<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.430> get<00:03:28.580> as<00:03:29.150> much<00:03:29.390> on<00:03:29.600> power

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
a my car to get as much on power

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.140 
a my car to get as much on power
steering<00:03:30.140> as<00:03:30.260> possible<00:03:30.650> so<00:03:31.220> in<00:03:31.490> the<00:03:31.580> 180s<00:03:31.910> my

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
steering as possible so in the 180s my

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.620 
steering as possible so in the 180s my
car<00:03:32.330> is<00:03:32.420> pretty<00:03:32.570> good<00:03:32.780> but<00:03:33.380> what<00:03:34.220> is<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.630> very

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
car is pretty good but what is a very

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.570 
car is pretty good but what is a very
tricky<00:03:35.870> then<00:03:36.290> in<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.560> long<00:03:36.740> sweepers<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.400> car

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
tricky then in the long sweepers the car

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.550 
tricky then in the long sweepers the car
is<00:03:37.730> over<00:03:37.940> steering<00:03:38.330> as<00:03:38.420> much<00:03:38.600> a<00:03:38.930> lot<00:03:39.110> so<00:03:39.380> then

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
is over steering as much a lot so then

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.960 
is over steering as much a lot so then
you<00:03:39.680> I'm<00:03:39.800> hitting<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.250> dots<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:40.670> this<00:03:40.820> is<00:03:40.940> a

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
you I'm hitting the dots so this is a

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.150 
you I'm hitting the dots so this is a
very<00:03:41.690> difficult<00:03:41.960> to<00:03:42.230> find<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:42.560> compromise<00:03:42.800> in

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
very difficult to find a compromise in

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.770 
very difficult to find a compromise in
the<00:03:43.250> set<00:03:43.430> up<00:03:43.580> to<00:03:43.700> make<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.850> car<00:03:44.150> as<00:03:44.420> far<00:03:44.660> as

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
the set up to make the car as far as

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.450 
the set up to make the car as far as
possible<00:03:44.960> in<00:03:45.290> 180s<00:03:45.740> and<00:03:45.920> make<00:03:46.070> it<00:03:46.220> also

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
possible in 180s and make it also

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.700 
possible in 180s and make it also
drivable<00:03:46.940> in<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.240> long<00:03:47.390> sweepers<00:03:47.810> now<00:03:48.680> I

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
drivable in the long sweepers now I

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.320 
drivable in the long sweepers now I
think<00:03:48.830> of<00:03:49.010> it<00:03:49.100> be<00:03:49.610> obvious<00:03:49.730> you<00:03:49.940> guys<00:03:50.090> will<00:03:50.240> get

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
think of it be obvious you guys will get

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.430 
think of it be obvious you guys will get
a<00:03:50.390> practice<00:03:50.690> together<00:03:50.780> you<00:03:50.960> know<00:03:51.080> each<00:03:51.230> other

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
a practice together you know each other

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.020 
a practice together you know each other
when<00:03:51.860> you're<00:03:51.980> out<00:03:52.100> practicing<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:52.880> perhaps

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
when you're out practicing and perhaps

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.310 
when you're out practicing and perhaps
in<00:03:53.210> the<00:03:53.270> first<00:03:53.450> couple<00:03:53.630> of<00:03:53.780> rounds<00:03:53.900> are<00:03:54.170> you

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
in the first couple of rounds are you

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.780 
in the first couple of rounds are you
just<00:03:54.500> constantly<00:03:54.740> hearing<00:03:55.070> your<00:03:55.250> car<00:03:55.460> or<00:03:55.730> your

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
just constantly hearing your car or your

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.850 
just constantly hearing your car or your
thinking<00:03:56.270> or<00:03:56.330> hang<00:03:56.540> on<00:03:56.690> yeah<00:03:56.840> Martha<00:03:57.620> hey<00:03:57.740> with

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
thinking or hang on yeah Martha hey with

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.020 
thinking or hang on yeah Martha hey with
my<00:03:57.920> heat<00:03:58.070> is<00:03:58.160> catching<00:03:58.520> me<00:03:58.580> up<00:03:58.610> I<00:03:58.790> should<00:03:58.970> be

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
my heat is catching me up I should be

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.820 
my heat is catching me up I should be
faster<00:03:59.420> here<00:03:59.540> what<00:03:59.959> do<00:04:00.020> you<00:04:00.080> pacing<00:04:00.590> yourself

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
faster here what do you pacing yourself

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.850 
faster here what do you pacing yourself
against<00:04:01.540> basically<00:04:02.540> you<00:04:02.780> have<00:04:03.020> to<00:04:03.050> you<00:04:03.830> have

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
against basically you have to you have

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.410 
against basically you have to you have
to<00:04:04.040> concentrate<00:04:04.400> your<00:04:04.760> own<00:04:05.060> but<00:04:05.270> of

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
to concentrate your own but of

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.300 
to concentrate your own but of
course<00:04:05.870> you're<00:04:05.990> looking<00:04:06.260> at<00:04:06.380> other<00:04:06.500> cars<00:04:06.740> it's

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
course you're looking at other cars it's

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.949 
course you're looking at other cars it's
like<00:04:07.490> Formula<00:04:07.850> One<00:04:08.000> testing<00:04:08.420> they<00:04:08.750> always

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
like Formula One testing they always

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.810 
like Formula One testing they always
concentrate<00:04:09.470> on<00:04:09.590> their<00:04:09.650> own<00:04:09.770> car<00:04:09.980> so<00:04:10.010> that's

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
concentrate on their own car so that's

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.400 
concentrate on their own car so that's
what<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.060> have<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.209> do<00:04:11.390> you<00:04:12.140> need<00:04:12.320> to

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
what you have to do you need to

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.600 
what you have to do you need to
concentrate<00:04:12.560> on<00:04:12.920> the<00:04:12.980> parts<00:04:13.220> where<00:04:13.370> you're

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
concentrate on the parts where you're

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.270 
concentrate on the parts where you're
slower<00:04:13.850> so<00:04:14.440> if<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.560> lap<00:04:15.709> times<00:04:15.890> are<00:04:15.980> good<00:04:16.100> then

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
slower so if the lap times are good then

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.090 
slower so if the lap times are good then
it's<00:04:16.640> ok<00:04:16.880> but<00:04:17.090> I<00:04:17.420> think<00:04:17.810> for<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.560> oval<00:04:18.920> run

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
it's ok but I think for the oval run

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.600 
it's ok but I think for the oval run
it's<00:04:19.280> better<00:04:19.489> when<00:04:19.820> you're<00:04:20.350> quicker<00:04:21.350> as<00:04:22.130> quick

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
it's better when you're quicker as quick

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.150 
it's better when you're quicker as quick
as<00:04:22.790> in<00:04:23.090> every<00:04:23.330> corner<00:04:23.540> so<00:04:23.840> you<00:04:24.680> see<00:04:24.860> me<00:04:24.950> having

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
as in every corner so you see me having

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.460 
as in every corner so you see me having
a<00:04:25.220> bit<00:04:25.910> of<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:26.060> purple<00:04:26.570> patch<00:04:26.720> residing<00:04:27.290> there<00:04:27.440> a

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
a bit of a purple patch residing there a

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.260 
a bit of a purple patch residing there a
good<00:04:27.770> period<00:04:28.010> it<00:04:28.370> endures<00:04:28.880> and<00:04:29.180> you're

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
good period it endures and you're

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.640 
good period it endures and you're
getting<00:04:29.480> it<00:04:29.660> getting<00:04:29.750> harder<00:04:30.200> than<00:04:30.440> we<00:04:30.500> used

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
getting it getting harder than we used

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.340 
getting it getting harder than we used
to<00:04:30.710> signaling<00:04:31.100> finals<00:04:31.460> yeah<00:04:32.240> actually<00:04:32.720> it's

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
to signaling finals yeah actually it's

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.840 
to signaling finals yeah actually it's
all<00:04:33.740> about<00:04:33.980> the<00:04:34.160> testing<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:34.610> how<00:04:34.790> you

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
all about the testing and how you

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.700 
all about the testing and how you
prepare<00:04:35.270> for<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.510> race<00:04:35.750> of<00:04:35.780> course<00:04:36.260> there<00:04:36.620> are

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
prepare for the race of course there are

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.580 
prepare for the race of course there are
so<00:04:36.860> many<00:04:36.950> good<00:04:37.160> drivers<00:04:37.520> from<00:04:37.880> so<00:04:38.660> it's<00:04:39.080> not

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
so many good drivers from so it's not

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.130 
so many good drivers from so it's not
easy<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:39.919> make<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.190> a<00:04:40.310> final<00:04:40.700> because<00:04:40.990> in<00:04:41.990> this

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
easy to make the a final because in this

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.490 
easy to make the a final because in this
class<00:04:42.350> especially<00:04:42.590> its

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
class especially its
