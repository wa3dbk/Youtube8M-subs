can do something they can boycott for

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.000 
can do something they can boycott for
example<00:05:02.870> they<00:05:03.870> can<00:05:03.930> refuse<00:05:04.380> to<00:05:04.470> go<00:05:04.710> along<00:05:04.830> with

example they can refuse to go along with
it<00:05:05.660> they<00:05:06.660> can<00:05:06.810> try<00:05:06.990> to<00:05:07.020> interrupt<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.590> process

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070
