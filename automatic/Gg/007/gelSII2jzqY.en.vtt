I'm demonstrating here is this really
cool<00:00:19.500> tweak<00:00:19.949> called<00:00:20.220> sleek<00:00:20.850> sleep<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.480> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
cool tweak called sleek sleep and the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.810 
cool tweak called sleek sleep and the
reason<00:00:22.500> why<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.650> got<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.220> because<00:00:23.550> ever

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
reason why I got it is because ever

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.599 
reason why I got it is because ever

take it out of your pocket it uses the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.190 
take it out of your pocket it uses the
proximity<00:00:32.070> sensor<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:33.120> automatically<00:00:33.840> turn

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
proximity sensor to automatically turn

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.799 
proximity sensor to automatically turn
the<00:00:34.380> display<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> phone<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.180> ever

the display of the phone on and ever

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.260 
the display of the phone on and ever
since<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.320> saw<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.860> thought<00:00:38.190> wow<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.239> is

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
since I saw that I thought wow that is

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.600 
since I saw that I thought wow that is
really<00:00:39.420> cool<00:00:39.899> would<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.890> possible<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.340> do

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
really cool would it be possible to do

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.280 
really cool would it be possible to do
something<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.600> iPhone<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
something like that on the iPhone and

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.170 
something like that on the iPhone and
there<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.100> twit<00:00:44.370> called<00:00:44.610> always-on

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
there was this twit called always-on

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.790 
there was this twit called always-on
proximity<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.960> tried<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.680> bit

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
proximity that I tried for a little bit

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.260 
proximity that I tried for a little bit
but<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:46.980> ended<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.370> deleting<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.940> because

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
but I ended up deleting it because

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.479 
but I ended up deleting it because
whenever<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.140> swiped<00:00:49.739> over<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> proximity

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
whenever I swiped over the proximity

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.430 
whenever I swiped over the proximity
sensor<00:00:50.850> or<00:00:51.210> whenever<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.539> detected<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.289> it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
sensor or whenever it detected that it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.799 
sensor or whenever it detected that it
was<00:00:52.559> close<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> something<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.910> would<00:00:54.180> yes<00:00:54.420> turn

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
was close to something it would yes turn

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.150 
was close to something it would yes turn
the<00:00:54.960> screen<00:00:55.199> off<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.680> never<00:00:55.890> really

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the screen off but it never really

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.279 
the screen off but it never really
locked<00:00:56.640> my<00:00:56.879> device<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.690> did<00:00:57.930> lock<00:00:58.109> my

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
locked my device and if I did lock my

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.990 
locked my device and if I did lock my
device<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.859> couldn't<00:00:59.399> use<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.520> proximity

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
device I couldn't use the proximity

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.590 
device I couldn't use the proximity
sensor<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.660> properly<00:01:01.050> unlock<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.770> again<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.820> it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
sensor to properly unlock it again so it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.990 
sensor to properly unlock it again so it
was<00:01:03.840> quite<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.140> long<00:01:04.470> time<00:01:04.799> when<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> lost<00:01:05.610> tried

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
was quite a long time when I lost tried

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.200 
was quite a long time when I lost tried
that<00:01:06.180> tweak<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.229> one<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.740> fairly<00:01:07.979> new<00:01:08.400> so

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
that tweak and this one is fairly new so

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.149 
that tweak and this one is fairly new so
what<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.630> does<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.710> addresses<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
what it does is it addresses the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.640 
what it does is it addresses the
problems<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.939> old<00:01:12.150> one<00:01:12.360> had<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.290> what<00:01:13.619> I

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
problems that that old one had so what I

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.230 
problems that that old one had so what I
can<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.930> swipe<00:01:15.930> over<00:01:16.590> or<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.070> guess<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.759> front

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
can do is swipe over or I guess in front

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.120 
can do is swipe over or I guess in front
of<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.659> proximity<00:01:19.200> sensor<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.590> it'll<00:01:19.950> lock

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
of the proximity sensor and it'll lock

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.310 
of the proximity sensor and it'll lock
the<00:01:20.310> device<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.850> don't<00:01:21.180> know<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.570> probably

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the device I don't know if you probably

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.420 
the device I don't know if you probably
wouldn't<00:01:22.560> be<00:01:22.650> able<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.860> hear<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.250> because

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
wouldn't be able to hear that because

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.490 
wouldn't be able to hear that because
I'm<00:01:23.640> using<00:01:23.850> an<00:01:24.030> external<00:01:24.479> mic<00:01:24.689> here<00:01:24.960> but<00:01:25.409> it

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
I'm using an external mic here but it

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.050 
I'm using an external mic here but it
did<00:01:25.650> play<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.009> lock<00:01:26.189> sound<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.820> did

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
did play the lock sound and it did

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.200 
did play the lock sound and it did
properly<00:01:27.450> lock<00:01:27.869> my<00:01:28.080> device<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.740> if<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.490> go<00:01:29.820> over

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
properly lock my device and if I go over

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.719 
properly lock my device and if I go over
it<00:01:30.299> again<00:01:30.390> oh<00:01:30.960> didn't<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.040> right<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.520> go

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it again oh didn't do it right if I go

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.700 
it again oh didn't do it right if I go
over<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.150> again<00:01:33.210> there<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.290> go

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
over it again there you go

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.670 
over it again there you go
it<00:01:34.799> has<00:01:35.070> unlocked<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.759> device<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.530> is

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
it has unlocked the device so this is

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.929 
it has unlocked the device so this is
some<00:01:37.829> kind<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.130> functionality<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.759> I've

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
some kind of functionality that I've

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.120 
some kind of functionality that I've
really<00:01:39.329> wanted<00:01:39.619> because<00:01:40.619> I've<00:01:40.829> got<00:01:41.100> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.380 
these kind of
around<00:02:13.560> solutions<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.370> they're<00:02:15.000> actually

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
around solutions and they're actually

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.720 
around solutions and they're actually
really<00:02:15.629> nice<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:16.200> really<00:02:16.500> prefer<00:02:16.890> being<00:02:17.580> able

locked now you think that would use a

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.580 
locked now you think that would use a
little<00:02:42.420> bit<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.629> power<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.200> I'll<00:02:43.349> address

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
little bit of power and I'll address

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.070 
little bit of power and I'll address
that<00:02:43.709> in<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.280> moment<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.480> you've<00:02:45.599> got<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.870> third
