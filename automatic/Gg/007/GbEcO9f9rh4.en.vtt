the figure I'll give you a look at total

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.130 
the figure I'll give you a look at total
360<00:02:52.480> first<00:02:53.910> it's<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:55.000> very<00:02:55.180> very<00:02:55.390> small<00:02:55.690> figure

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
360 first it's a very very small figure

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.970 
360 first it's a very very small figure
and<00:02:56.760> he's<00:02:57.760> pretty<00:02:58.720> much<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:59.200> small<00:02:59.680> plastic

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
and he's pretty much a small plastic

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.979 
and he's pretty much a small plastic
statue<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:01.150> there's<00:03:01.510> not<00:03:01.630> really<00:03:01.690> much

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
statue and there's not really much

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.590 
statue and there's not really much
articulation<00:03:02.830> in<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:04.180> only<00:03:04.420> movement

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
articulation in it and the only movement

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.229 
articulation in it and the only movement
that<00:03:04.900> he<00:03:05.019> has<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:05.620> in<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.040> head<00:03:06.250> which<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.060> ball

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
that he has is in the head which is ball

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.210 
that he has is in the head which is ball
jointed<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.380> can<00:03:08.530> be<00:03:08.650> quite<00:03:08.739> tricky<00:03:09.069> to

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
jointed and it can be quite tricky to

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.460 
jointed and it can be quite tricky to
stand<00:03:09.610> up<00:03:09.819> and<00:03:10.480> just<00:03:10.900> because<00:03:11.200> he's<00:03:11.350> a<00:03:11.440> little

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
stand up and just because he's a little

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.020 
stand up and just because he's a little
bit<00:03:11.680> top-heavy<00:03:11.980> obviously<00:03:12.610> due<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.820> the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
bit top-heavy obviously due to the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.810 
bit top-heavy obviously due to the
elongated<00:03:13.840> head<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.920> but<00:03:15.549> it's<00:03:15.640> still<00:03:15.760> a

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
elongated head and but it's still a

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.580 
elongated head and but it's still a
pretty<00:03:16.030> nice<00:03:16.360> little<00:03:16.630> addition<00:03:16.930> on<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.410> list

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
pretty nice little addition on the list

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.960 
pretty nice little addition on the list
definitely<00:03:17.860> one<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.310> best<00:03:18.459> accessory

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
definitely one of the best accessory

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.610 
definitely one of the best accessory
we've<00:03:19.209> seen<00:03:19.480> with<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.690> figure<00:03:19.930> in<00:03:20.290> quite<00:03:20.590> a

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
we've seen with a figure in quite a

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
previous versions of CAD bane then

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.370 
previous versions of CAD bane then
there's<00:06:00.120> no<00:06:00.240> reason<00:06:00.450> why<00:06:00.690> I<00:06:00.720> can't<00:06:00.990> give<00:06:01.229> this

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
there's no reason why I can't give this

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.490 
there's no reason why I can't give this
figure<00:06:01.740> one<00:06:02.130> of<00:06:02.250> their<00:06:02.430> rifles<00:06:03.169> and<00:06:04.169> the<00:06:04.320> thing

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
figure one of their rifles and the thing

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.290 
figure one of their rifles and the thing
that<00:06:04.650> I<00:06:04.860> really<00:06:05.280> like<00:06:05.430> about<00:06:05.460> this<00:06:05.850> figure<00:06:06.150> is

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
that I really like about this figure is

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.830 
that I really like about this figure is
the<00:06:06.450> fact<00:06:06.720> that<00:06:06.810> he's<00:06:07.050> got<00:06:07.320> the<00:06:08.450> lower<00:06:09.450> part<00:06:09.750> of

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
the fact that he's got the lower part of

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.420 
the fact that he's got the lower part of
his<00:06:09.960> trench<00:06:10.260> coat<00:06:10.350> is<00:06:10.620> made<00:06:10.650> out<00:06:10.950> of<00:06:11.070> this<00:06:11.160> soft

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
his trench coat is made out of this soft

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.240 
his trench coat is made out of this soft
fake<00:06:11.700> leather<00:06:11.970> material<00:06:12.710> which<00:06:13.710> allows<00:06:13.740> a

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
fake leather material which allows a

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.310 
fake leather material which allows a
disposability<00:06:14.790> and<00:06:15.330> I'm<00:06:15.450> assuming<00:06:15.750> this<00:06:16.140> guy

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
disposability and I'm assuming this guy

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.800 
disposability and I'm assuming this guy
will<00:06:16.560> fit<00:06:16.740> inside<00:06:16.890> his<00:06:17.490> spaceship<00:06:18.150> and

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
will fit inside his spaceship and

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.860 
will fit inside his spaceship and
there's<00:06:19.320> an<00:06:19.440> Adu<00:06:19.650> blood

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
there's an Adu blood

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.310 
there's an Adu blood
so<00:06:22.870> very<00:06:23.080> very<00:06:23.170> cool<00:06:23.530> looking<00:06:23.860> figure<00:06:25.320> getting

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
so very very cool looking figure getting

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.190 
so very very cool looking figure getting
a<00:06:26.350> decent<00:06:26.500> look<00:06:26.770> at<00:06:26.860> that<00:06:26.950> head<00:06:27.100> sculpt

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
a decent look at that head sculpt

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.380 
a decent look at that head sculpt
definitely<00:06:29.200> one<00:06:29.320> of<00:06:29.350> the<00:06:29.470> best<00:06:29.650> in<00:06:29.830> my<00:06:29.860> opinion

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390
