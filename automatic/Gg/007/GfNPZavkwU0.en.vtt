course the damage now with this weapon

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.540 
course the damage now with this weapon
that<00:00:46.129> damage<00:00:46.609> really<00:00:47.359> is<00:00:47.660> only<00:00:48.550> hugely

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
that damage really is only hugely

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.959 
that damage really is only hugely
significant<00:00:50.390> if<00:00:50.600> you<00:00:51.140> build<00:00:51.589> for<00:00:52.489> it<00:00:52.730> if<00:00:52.850> you

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
significant if you build for it if you

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.779 
significant if you build for it if you
make<00:00:53.179> the<00:00:53.420> ideal<00:00:54.170> build<00:00:54.559> for<00:00:54.980> it<00:00:55.100> otherwise

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
make the ideal build for it otherwise

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.360 
make the ideal build for it otherwise
your<00:00:56.329> damage<00:00:56.659> will<00:00:56.839> be<00:00:56.870> pretty<00:00:57.620> much<00:00:57.800> average

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
your damage will be pretty much average

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.450 
your damage will be pretty much average
so<00:00:59.210> for<00:00:59.749> the<00:01:00.079> build<00:01:00.260> I<00:01:00.440> have<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:01.039> damage<00:01:01.339> is

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
so for the build I have the damage is

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.250 
so for the build I have the damage is
roughly<00:01:01.940> average<00:01:02.390> now<00:01:03.170> if<00:01:03.530> I<00:01:03.649> had<00:01:03.980> made<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.489> pure

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
roughly average now if I had made a pure

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.450 
roughly average now if I had made a pure
perfect<00:01:06.260> build<00:01:06.650> fort<00:01:06.950> you<00:01:07.100> know<00:01:07.190> going

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
perfect build fort you know going

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.180 
perfect build fort you know going
straight<00:01:07.880> up<00:01:08.000> skill<00:01:08.390> blood-tinged<00:01:09.110> build<00:01:09.440> but

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
straight up skill blood-tinged build but

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.350 
straight up skill blood-tinged build but
then<00:01:10.280> we'd<00:01:10.460> have<00:01:10.580> a<00:01:10.610> different<00:01:10.729> story<00:01:11.030> if<00:01:11.270> I

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
then we'd have a different story if I

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.840 
then we'd have a different story if I
was<00:01:11.479> using<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:12.110> fast<00:01:12.830> blow<00:01:13.070> gems<00:01:13.340> ever<00:01:13.550> we'd

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
was using the fast blow gems ever we'd

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.730 
was using the fast blow gems ever we'd
have<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.030> different<00:01:14.360> story<00:01:14.510> but<00:01:15.350> with<00:01:15.590> what

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
have a different story but with what

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.270 
have a different story but with what
I've<00:01:15.830> got

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
I've got

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.580 
I've got
I<00:01:16.310> have<00:01:17.000> average<00:01:17.420> stats<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.230> weapon<00:01:18.440> who

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
I have average stats so the weapon who

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.340 
I have average stats so the weapon who
deals<00:01:18.770> average<00:01:19.160> damage<00:01:19.420> it<00:01:20.420> is<00:01:20.510> what<00:01:20.660> it<00:01:20.750> is<00:01:20.870> so

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
deals average damage it is what it is so

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.050 
deals average damage it is what it is so
keep<00:01:21.560> that<00:01:21.680> in<00:01:21.740> mind<00:01:21.860> through<00:01:22.310> this<00:01:22.430> video<00:01:22.610> and

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
decently if you go unlocked with it but

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.619 
decently if you go unlocked with it but
it's<00:02:10.009> really<00:02:10.310> not<00:02:10.519> the<00:02:10.580> most<00:02:10.849> reliable<00:02:11.180> move

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629

r2<00:02:59.130> when<00:02:59.700> transforming<00:03:00.269> like<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:00.630> it

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
r2 when transforming like this it

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.690 
r2 when transforming like this it
actually<00:03:00.930> uses<00:03:01.500> significantly<00:03:02.190> less<00:03:02.459> health

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
than a normal charged r2 in the second

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.060 
than a normal charged r2 in the second
form<00:03:05.220> now<00:03:06.209> getting<00:03:07.110> started<00:03:07.470> with<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.739> second

the first form but the major difference

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.330 
the first form but the major difference
is<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.510> damage<00:03:13.019> you<00:03:13.140> deal<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:14.130> fact<00:03:14.310> that

and<00:03:29.880> you<00:03:30.510> know<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:31.019> is<00:03:31.140> what<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:32.250> longer

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
and you know it is what this the longer

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.250 
and you know it is what this the longer
you<00:03:32.700> hold<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.060> r2<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.450> more<00:03:33.630> damage<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.049> deals

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
you hold the r2 the more damage it deals

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.190 
you hold the r2 the more damage it deals
and<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:35.100> more<00:03:35.250> health<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.640> will<00:03:35.730> drain<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:37.019> if

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
and the more health it will drain so if

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.509 
and the more health it will drain so if
you<00:03:37.290> can<00:03:37.440> bait<00:03:37.650> someone<00:03:37.950> into<00:03:38.160> doing<00:03:38.190> that

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
you can bait someone into doing that

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:39.979

fantastically<00:03:42.989> it's<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.040> good<00:03:44.250> way<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.430> get

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
fantastically it's a good way to get

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.390 
fantastically it's a good way to get
them<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:44.850> drain<00:03:45.180> out<00:03:45.329> their<00:03:45.480> own<00:03:45.600> health<00:03:45.870> and

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
it actually is a follow-up r2 most

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.460 
it actually is a follow-up r2 most
people<00:03:58.980> never<00:03:59.640> use<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.329> have<00:04:00.690> never<00:04:01.049> seen<00:04:01.350> it

to landed a few times throughout this

video but I was never able to land it
myself<00:04:08.220> it's<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:09.030> bit<00:04:09.180> slow<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.660> people<00:04:10.019> take

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
myself it's a bit slow and people take

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.020 
myself it's a bit slow and people take
advantage<00:04:10.410> of<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:10.890> fact<00:04:11.040> that<00:04:11.160> you<00:04:11.400> try<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.730> go

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
advantage of the fact that you try to go

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.970 
advantage of the fact that you try to go
for<00:04:12.329> it<00:04:12.450> they<00:04:12.660> might<00:04:12.810> dodge<00:04:13.320> it<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.739> punish

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
for it they might dodge it and punish

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.890 
for it they might dodge it and punish
you<00:04:14.280> for<00:04:14.489> it<00:04:14.549> that's<00:04:14.880> generally<00:04:15.420> what<00:04:15.630> tends

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
you for it that's generally what tends

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.020 
you for it that's generally what tends
to<00:04:16.049> happen<00:04:16.169> that<00:04:17.010> being<00:04:17.250> said<00:04:17.430> it's<00:04:17.669> really

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
to happen that being said it's really

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.300 
to happen that being said it's really
cool<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.570> if<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.989> do<00:04:19.140> end<00:04:19.350> up<00:04:19.440> getting<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.859> I'm

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
cool and if you do end up getting it I'm

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.920 
cool and if you do end up getting it I'm
sure<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.579> would<00:04:20.700> be<00:04:20.729> very<00:04:21.030> satisfying<00:04:21.600> but<00:04:21.780> I

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
sure it would be very satisfying but I

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.800 
sure it would be very satisfying but I
never<00:04:22.169> managed<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.890> so<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.490> is<00:04:23.729> what<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:23.970> is<00:04:24.090> so

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
never managed it so it is what it is so

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.260 
never managed it so it is what it is so
the<00:04:25.050> attack<00:04:25.320> it's<00:04:25.680> an<00:04:25.860> upward<00:04:26.220> slash<00:04:26.669> in<00:04:27.030> a<00:04:27.150> way

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
the attack it's an upward slash in a way

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.240 
the attack it's an upward slash in a way
it's<00:04:27.479> somewhat<00:04:27.930> reminds<00:04:28.229> me<00:04:28.500> of<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:29.039> Black

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
it's somewhat reminds me of the Black

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.430 
it's somewhat reminds me of the Black

course<00:05:11.940> but<00:05:12.540> it's<00:05:12.840> not<00:05:13.050> incredibly<00:05:13.620> different

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
course but it's not incredibly different

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.310 
course but it's not incredibly different
now<00:05:14.760> as<00:05:15.060> far<00:05:15.300> as<00:05:15.360> baits<00:05:15.630> with<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.870> weapon<00:05:16.170> I

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
now as far as baits with the weapon I

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.140 
now as far as baits with the weapon I
mean<00:05:16.500> there's<00:05:17.010> nothing<00:05:17.130> terribly<00:05:17.700> unique

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
mean there's nothing terribly unique

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.150 
mean there's nothing terribly unique
with<00:05:18.390> it<00:05:18.570> I<00:05:18.750> tried<00:05:19.410> a<00:05:19.440> few<00:05:19.560> different<00:05:19.770> things

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
with it I tried a few different things

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.880 
with it I tried a few different things
to<00:05:20.370> be<00:05:20.400> able<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.730> bait<00:05:20.970> off<00:05:21.180> that<00:05:21.720> a<00:05:21.750> second<00:05:22.590> car

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
to be able to bait off that a second car

to be able to bait off that a second car

weapon the health drain and honestly the

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.730
