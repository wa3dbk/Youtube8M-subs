00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.160
 good bar that assumes the other what 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.650
 they saw in having two new bicycles 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.800
 for the healing of forces 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.100
 supposed 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.730
 and excellent is like the 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.299
 we have static 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.299
 because I do not know 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.270
 the life 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.430
 He blew me away 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.619
 it is preferable to leave the national 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.699
 plus 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.210
 this week 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.310
 The Martians 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.310
 Y 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:13.570
 all this collaboration is intended not 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.800
 I'm also going to not like that 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.800
 expand a little more in the future 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:25.700
 We've been talking for years 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.700
 on the subject and it was explained to us 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.280
 I told our company work 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.350
 a person well brother of him 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.520
 of a fellow of the real oviedo 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.260
 and good 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:47.690
 apart from other fans of the 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:52.420
 company that today still the clock then the 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.420
 linking the sport of cycling to football 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.040
 separated 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.560
 has many similarities that can 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.540
 then fit it directly into the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.759
 Asturian brand that is then try 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:13.060
 support Asturian athletes 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.060
 within its means and in this case it 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:28.739
 good for athletes and promotion 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.739
 for our brand to collaborate with 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.420
 details how are what are the 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.220
 characteristics of the labels good 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.410
 Well, here we have two 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.090
 mountain bikes 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.700
 by last generation of two clamps 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.220
 2013 models with the peculiarity that 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.700
 while complete of wheel of 29 is 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.590
 right now we are in a market of a 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.530
 loom can the wheel size the day 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.750
 inside 26-inch wheel and from 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.580
 a couple of years ago it is 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.920
 popularizing this nothing diameter of 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.130
 suffering from greater rope what we 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.260
 allows the bicycle to advance more and 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.630
 be more stable and pass better by 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.940
 bumps and even that impact for 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.730
 contact he said he was dead 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.850
 sportsman with these bikes the impact 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.520
 of the floor less reaches the cyclist 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.910
 then these looks great news 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.470
 of these two bikes with respect to 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.800
 the usual what to this day still 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.800
 we can 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:37.709
 make popular and we think not 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.709
 all other stops
