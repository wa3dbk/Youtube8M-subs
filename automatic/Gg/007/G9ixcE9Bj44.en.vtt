and remember they sell these at stores

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.729 
and remember they sell these at stores
for<00:03:09.040> example<00:03:09.459> i<00:03:09.609> bought<00:03:10.030> hockey<00:03:10.949> just<00:03:11.949> for<00:03:12.489> a

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
for example i bought hockey just for a

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.179 
for example i bought hockey just for a
minimum<00:03:14.739> of<00:03:14.949> i<00:03:15.760> think<00:03:16.150> like<00:03:16.299> ten<00:03:16.569> dollars

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
minimum of i think like ten dollars

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.970 
minimum of i think like ten dollars
that's<00:03:18.189> sure<00:03:18.519> 10<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.180> 20<00:03:19.540> bucks<00:03:19.780> you'd<00:03:20.680> say<00:03:20.949> a

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
that's sure 10 to 20 bucks you'd say a

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.670 
that's sure 10 to 20 bucks you'd say a
wireless<00:03:21.459> driver<00:03:21.699> i<00:03:21.819> guess

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
wireless driver i guess

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.729 
wireless driver i guess
or<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.939> can<00:03:24.090> just<00:03:24.269> buy<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.540> on<00:03:24.810> ebay<00:03:27.500> anyway

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.099 

this<00:03:31.739> one<00:03:32.040> has<00:03:32.909> the<00:03:32.939> wire<00:03:33.480> thing<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.959> was

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
this one has the wire thing I was

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.069 
this one has the wire thing I was
explaining<00:03:34.530> about<00:03:34.859> I<00:03:35.450> think<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.629> could<00:03:36.840> get

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
explaining about I think it could get

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.099 
explaining about I think it could get
more<00:03:37.290> signal<00:03:37.799> if<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.370> have<00:03:38.609> one<00:03:38.939> but<00:03:39.870> if<00:03:39.989> you

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
more signal if you have one but if you

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.429 
more signal if you have one but if you
don't<00:03:40.639> don't<00:03:41.639> mind<00:03:41.909> it<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.840> happens<00:03:43.319> to

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439
