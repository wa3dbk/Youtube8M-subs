is I'm going to go ahead and mix my
parsley<00:03:19.340> with<00:03:19.520> it<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:19.790> don't<00:03:19.910> have<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.180> use

parsley if you don't want to but I like

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.730 
parsley if you don't want to but I like
the<00:03:22.910> little<00:03:23.060> flecks<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.720> green<00:03:23.930> in<00:03:24.380> there<00:03:24.590> I

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
the little flecks of green in there I

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.620 
the little flecks of green in there I

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.420 
think that makes it look beautiful and
it<00:03:26.720> adds<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:27.080> little<00:03:27.260> bit<00:03:27.350> more<00:03:27.470> texture<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.130> it

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
it adds a little bit more texture to it

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.610 
it adds a little bit more texture to it
