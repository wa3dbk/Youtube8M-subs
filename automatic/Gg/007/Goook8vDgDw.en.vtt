00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.450
 We decided to put Warrior in the story, because after all, he is the favorite of fans. 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.270
 Everyone knows Warrior, his status is as noble as Hogan and Andre. 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.770
 He is an idol. 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.900
 He is a legend. 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.640
 He is full of energy and loud. 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.100
 The way he speaks is unique. 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.430
 The way he wrestles is different. 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.100
 He is full of strength, like a fireball. 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.040
 Everything he has done is both wonderful and swaying. 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.419
 Have influence and make you look good. 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.359
 When you say his name, it will bring you back to childhood memories. 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.940
 Make you feel happy and make you grateful for everything he does for fans. 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.460
 Warrior is amazing because he is different. 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.500
 He is fast and strong, and his power is unmatched. 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.590
 The things he did were wonderful. 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.470
 He is like a superhero! 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.590
 He rushed to the arena, rocking the ropes, everything was so crazy! 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.990
 I mean, he is awesome. Watching his game is super fun. 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.160
 He has had many very fast.. and very fast paced games. 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.240
 I mean, the most exciting Ultimate Warrior game is only a minute long. 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.020
叮, 叮, 叮. Touch, touch, touch. One, two, three, goodbye, nothing else. 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.820
 When you blink, the game is over. He is on the rope. Exploding there. 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.560
 His game may not be the longest, but some games 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.500
 It has brought unprecedented influence to the wrestling world. 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.260
 We tried to present this, relying on numerous short-term events 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.860
 And events, let the players experience it for themselves and let them experience 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.500
 Warrior's fast, fast wrestling style. 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.760
 You will play the championship VS championship game, 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.180
 Steel cage competition, and 2 dozen 3 matches. 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.060
 He defeated "Macho man" Randy Savage in Wrestlemania VII to let him retire 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.240
 I think that is the most memorable in WWE history. 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.340
 One of the games. 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.450
 He defeated Hulk Hogan in Wrestlemania, which is like him. 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.950
 Hulk fans are incredible. 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.030
 We also included a body bag competition with Undertaker, I think 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.890
 It must be fun to play. 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.760
 Warrior pursues Undertaker again! 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.240
 Make another record of Piledriver! 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.760
 This is not a joke! ? 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.799
 From small to big, I am a diehard fan of Ultimate Warrior. 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.620
 I used to put on my face and put a ribbon on my arm. 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.320
 Then I ran across the house, making my mom very angry. 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.980
 This year, he can make him one of the highlights, which is a major goal. 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.940
 Especially he has died in the past year, 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.060
 We really want to honor him. 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.649
 I can't find a second Ultimate Warrior in this world. 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:26.540
 No one can pretend to be him. 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.320
 He is a real guy, I think "show game" 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.240
 Can communicate this to you very well. 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.360
 This "show game" paid 100% respect to Warrior. 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.540
 His life, his great achievements. 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.040
 He is the idol of all of us. 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.540
 2K Exhibition Tournament - 11 players can play the role of the Warrior Road / 8 new arenas are now available.
