00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
that with Vinny leaving there's a lot of

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.070

got a chance to show who you are as a

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.690 
got a chance to show who you are as a
player<00:03:21.980> do<00:03:22.100> you<00:03:22.130> think<00:03:22.310> there's<00:03:22.430> any<00:03:22.550> truth

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
player do you think there's any truth

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.190 
player do you think there's any truth
any<00:03:22.940> of<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:24.280> don't<00:03:25.280> know<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:25.370> feel<00:03:25.700> like<00:03:26.200> any

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
any of it I don't know I feel like any

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.260 
any of it I don't know I feel like any
every<00:03:27.920> team<00:03:28.100> is<00:03:28.250> not<00:03:28.670> a<00:03:28.700> lot<00:03:28.940> of<00:03:28.970> good<00:03:29.090> players

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
every team is not a lot of good players

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.330 
every team is not a lot of good players
so<00:03:29.570> that<00:03:29.750> way<00:03:29.900> i<00:03:29.930> don't<00:03:30.080> think<00:03:30.380> it's<00:03:30.500> big<00:03:30.680> big

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
so that way i don't think it's big big

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.670 
so that way i don't think it's big big
difference<00:03:31.550> but<00:03:31.970> hopefully<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:33.320> always<00:03:33.500> want

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
difference but hopefully you always want

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.340 
difference but hopefully you always want
to<00:03:33.709> play<00:03:33.860> them<00:03:34.690> as<00:03:35.690> much<00:03:35.900> as<00:03:36.050> you<00:03:36.110> can<00:03:36.290> and

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
to play them as much as you can and

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.220 
to play them as much as you can and
hopefully

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
hopefully

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.909 
hopefully
better<00:03:38.159> take<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:38.760> out
