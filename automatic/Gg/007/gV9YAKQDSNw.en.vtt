00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.370
 good evening if the trapper then today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.189
 I find you for a video like the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.620
 game you have a girl that's how 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.559
 you came back to the website shoes 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.000
 but enough a video of the fishing videos 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.580
 yes I 'm going to start making videos 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.670
 fishing then we'll go up there 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.430
 now a line 1 were carbon 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.900
 for roach so I'm using for 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.970
 the other kid's pretty big idea 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:34.110
 carbon 18 hundredths 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:39.860
 1 cd kg corentin 2.1 slaughter waste 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:44.820
 cinsault of 0.70 g and plans so 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:47.730
 for starters I will pass my son 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.289
 of a man in the mud francs for that 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:01:00.829
 I watch you videos that you 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:01:00.829
 to have them is to rethink his ministers 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.850
 then play in the little bit of 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.850
 plastic is rare and son 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.579
 not the right size 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.880
 bah 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.880
 then there 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:52.510
 wow wow it's good then there and I 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.510
 go back to my caps on my daughter 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.050
 here 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.740
 I pass it in the small pvc tubes 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.450
 and I come the file scheer the stem of 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.450
 jester 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.010
 that's me, I have a little street 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:26.500
 is that to avoid knots in fact 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:30.410
 here is today that is to say it 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:38.470
 there will be a front and a behind like 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:51.700
 that the cork does not get involved yeah 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:56.630
 so that's so I put my second 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.010
 world you at the end of Beaufort 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:04.569
 so that the film will be tackling 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:11.989
 especially the mouth years I make my loop 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:15.080
 at the end of the wire obviously the little 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:19.790
 possible if they were techniques 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:26.750
 all this to avoid naming them I cut 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:29.510
 my cedar here then me down 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.290
 pietri line of neil young of 12 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.780
 hundredths of nude had needs of 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.880
 number 16 I take pink wall is this 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.380
 because it's pretty versatile can 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.380
 catch little ones like big tits 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.340
 so I 'm doing my loop in line mode 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.680
 always the smallest possible I 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.680
 well cut another wildlife over 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:14.420
 here I go the bank of my stockings 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:19.070
 line in that of my line and I'm coming 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.580
 to go there seems to me in the loop of 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.580
 line wood 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:41.200
 he and I are here after I look 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.300
 on my beauf one must have marked the 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.800
 weight on the remaining plugs then there 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:51.220
 that could read read 0.70 g so be 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.120
 0.70 g and jean will offer himself so I take 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.240
 the plans for that I'm going to put 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.200
 two shots of 20 grams 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.780
 you have to know that you must not put 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.180
 pilot 70 big not what had the weight 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.760
 from China or vote rech 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:12.400
 the plug will sink so I put my 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:17.800
 foreground he cm shows the shots to 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:25.890
 10 cm from the stopper and the other is 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:29.170
 she who puts of interval represented 40 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:35.670
 and I'm going to bring in and put a 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:35.670
 plan of 2 10 that's it 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.560
 then our talking point of Mellick 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:06:01.370
 had frozen to space the lead 5 cm to 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:02.990
 each time 10 cm from the jester 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.849
 I will fix to premont lead does not get 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:13.099
 touch for me it's seagram in 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:14.380
 condemning the pilot test and then the 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.570
 weight of lech 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.870
 I put about 10 cm seems 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.870
 the man are 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:49.199
 that's it and editing is over I do not have anymore 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:51.860
 than to fix it on my winder way and 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.860
 minutes granted 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:03.750
 here I am going to fix myself on the moment 

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:07.189
 where their is smarter and ends up 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.189
 review and more to give ideas
