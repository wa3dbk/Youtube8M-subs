are extremely good now they're active
noise-cancelling<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.779> that's<00:00:18.930> why<00:00:19.050> I

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
noise-cancelling so that's why I

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.109 
noise-cancelling so that's why I
couldn't<00:00:19.439> my<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.550> know<00:00:20.670> hearing<00:00:21.029> was

quick idea of these em of these

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.960 
quick idea of these em of these
headphones<00:00:28.590> they're<00:00:28.920> built<00:00:29.099> with<00:00:29.160> parts

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
headphones they're built with parts

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.790 
headphones they're built with parts
apart<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.480> metal<00:00:30.869> there<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.439> some<00:00:31.590> metal

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
apart it is metal there is some metal

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.560 
apart it is metal there is some metal
finishes<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.279> there<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.149> majority<00:00:33.420> of

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
finishes on there but the majority of

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.840 
finishes on there but the majority of
the<00:00:33.719> material<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.230> actually<00:00:34.380> tr90<00:00:35.190> which<00:00:35.550> is

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the material is actually tr90 which is

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.000 
the material is actually tr90 which is
actually<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.350> strong<00:00:37.350> composite<00:00:37.860> which<00:00:37.980> is

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
actually a strong composite which is

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.190 
actually a strong composite which is
used<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.399> good<00:00:39.030> quality<00:00:39.180> sunglasses<00:00:39.570> you

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
used for good quality sunglasses you

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.510 
used for good quality sunglasses you
know<00:00:40.290> they<00:00:40.379> don't<00:00:40.469> snap<00:00:40.860> easily<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.370> things

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
know they don't snap easily and things

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.639 
know they don't snap easily and things
like<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.239> there's<00:00:42.840> still<00:00:43.020> quite<00:00:43.320> light

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
like that so there's still quite light

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.650 
like that so there's still quite light
but<00:00:44.010> they<00:00:44.550> retain<00:00:44.910> some<00:00:45.090> really<00:00:45.360> really<00:00:45.450> good

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
but they retain some really really good

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.150 
but they retain some really really good
strength<00:00:45.989> which<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.350> an<00:00:46.530> excellent<00:00:46.829> thing<00:00:46.950> in

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
strength which is an excellent thing in

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.260 
strength which is an excellent thing in
headphones<00:00:47.489> because<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.940> wear<00:00:48.059> them<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.210> your

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
headphones because you wear them on your

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.869 
headphones because you wear them on your
head<00:00:48.510> now<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.649> did<00:00:50.430> say<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:50.850> were

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
head now I did say that they were

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.760 
head now I did say that they were
bluetooth<00:00:51.390> they<00:00:51.690> are<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.260> they<00:00:52.440> still<00:00:52.649> have

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
bluetooth they are and they still have

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.310 
bluetooth they are and they still have
active<00:00:53.760> noise-cancelling<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.870> charge<00:00:55.170> them

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
active noise-cancelling you charge them

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.319 
active noise-cancelling you charge them
just<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.680> micro<00:00:55.980> USB<00:00:56.010> port<00:00:56.699> which<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:56.940> quite

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
just for a micro USB port which is quite

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.389 
just for a micro USB port which is quite
common<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.719> phones<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.500> other<00:00:58.710> devices<00:00:58.800> now

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
common in phones and other devices now

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.209 
common in phones and other devices now
which<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.670> great<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.710> very<00:01:01.770> easy<00:01:01.980> to

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
which is great and and it's very easy to

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.479 
which is great and and it's very easy to
use<00:01:02.430> now<00:01:02.809> like<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.930> had<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> plug<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.470> before<00:01:04.860> you

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
use now like I had a plug in before you

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.460 
use now like I had a plug in before you
can<00:01:05.729> still<00:01:06.000> use<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.390> as<00:01:06.510> purely<00:01:07.110> analog

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
can still use it as purely analog

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.899 
can still use it as purely analog
headphones<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> standard<00:01:08.670> pair<00:01:08.820> of

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
headphones just like a standard pair of

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.910 
headphones just like a standard pair of
headphones<00:01:09.060> plugged<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.560> music<00:01:10.830> will

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
headphones plugged in and the music will

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.679 
headphones plugged in and the music will
come<00:01:11.100> through<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:12.000> then<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.299> flick<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
come through and then you can flick the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.870 
come through and then you can flick the
switch<00:01:12.930> still<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.950> turn<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.549> noise

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
switch still and and turn on the noise

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
switch still and and turn on the noise
cancelling<00:01:15.420> which<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.659> great<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.080> case<00:01:16.320> you're

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
cancelling which is great in case you're

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.469 
cancelling which is great in case you're
you<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.610> not<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> Bluetooth<00:01:18.450> device

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
you know not with a Bluetooth device

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.230 
you know not with a Bluetooth device
such<00:01:19.229> as<00:01:19.259> my<00:01:19.470> laptop<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.759> that's<00:01:20.880> really<00:01:21.030> handy

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
such as my laptop so that's really handy

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.789 
such as my laptop so that's really handy
and<00:01:21.540> then<00:01:21.960> obviously<00:01:22.259> once<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.530> flicked<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
and then obviously once I flicked the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.410 
and then obviously once I flicked the
Bluetooth<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.490> connects<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.790> my<00:01:23.909> phone<00:01:24.180> for

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
Bluetooth on it connects to my phone for

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.510 
Bluetooth on it connects to my phone for
example<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:24.960> I'm<00:01:25.020> or<00:01:25.140> any<00:01:25.350> way<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.470> go<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.979> can

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
example and I'm or any way I go I can

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.190 
example and I'm or any way I go I can
also<00:01:26.610> use<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.090> RAM<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.869> taking

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
also use it for RAM for taking

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.690 
also use it for RAM for taking
hands-free<00:01:28.560> calls<00:01:28.890> because<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.340> got<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
hands-free calls because it's got the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.289 
hands-free calls because it's got the
microphone<00:01:31.159> ports<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.369> reports<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.210> you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
microphone ports here reports if you

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.210 
microphone ports here reports if you
call<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.780> yeah<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.770> actually<00:01:34.799> use<00:01:35.100> it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
call it and yeah I can actually use it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.319 
call it and yeah I can actually use it
to<00:01:35.250> make<00:01:35.460> calls<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.060> actually<00:01:36.270> just

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
to make calls and it's actually just

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.880 
to make calls and it's actually just
done<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.990> flicked<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.500> bluetooth

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
done that I flicked it on to bluetooth

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.010 
done that I flicked it on to bluetooth
it's<00:01:38.070> already<00:01:38.250> paired<00:01:38.520> across<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:42.420> quickly<00:01:42.750> it

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
it's already paired across so quickly it

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.960 
it's already paired across so quickly it
just<00:01:43.049> if<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> plugged<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.640> it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
just if you have a plugged in it

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.969 
just if you have a plugged in it
defaults<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.600> what<00:01:45.960> they<00:01:46.079> plugged<00:01:46.320> into<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
defaults to what they plugged into and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.730 
defaults to what they plugged into and
then<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.909> unplug<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.229> goes<00:01:49.439> back<00:01:49.470> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
then if you unplug it it goes back to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.020 
then if you unplug it it goes back to
bluetooth<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.369> then<00:01:50.460> straight<00:01:50.670> away<00:01:50.729> pairs

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
bluetooth and then straight away pairs

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.490 
bluetooth and then straight away pairs
and<00:01:51.270> I've<00:01:51.329> always<00:01:51.540> got<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.049> know<00:01:52.140> something

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
and I've always got you know something

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.109 
and I've always got you know something
paused<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.009> ready<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.220> play<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.460> my<00:01:53.579> phone<00:01:53.820> so

paused and ready to play on my phone so
it's<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.659> quick<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.110> automatic<00:01:55.710> alike<00:01:55.979> that

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
it's so quick and automatic alike that

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.789 
it's so quick and automatic alike that
now<00:01:56.869> does<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:57.899> look<00:01:58.020> at<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.290> cups<00:01:58.530> because

you're going to get noise leakage in you
lose<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.480> bit<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.690> quality<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.350> don't

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
lose a bit of the quality so you don't

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.740 
lose a bit of the quality so you don't
want<00:02:21.710> that<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.100> you<00:02:23.000> know<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.420> cup<00:02:23.600> is<00:02:23.720> a

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
want that and you know the cup is a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.000 
want that and you know the cup is a
little<00:02:23.930> bit<00:02:24.020> small<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.560> have<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.800> sort<00:02:24.980> of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
little bit small so you have to sort of

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.160 
little bit small so you have to sort of
really<00:02:25.550> move<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.210> around<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.720> you're<00:02:26.840> kind<00:02:27.080> of

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
really move it around and you're kind of

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.260 
really move it around and you're kind of
like<00:02:27.320> you<00:02:27.860> know<00:02:27.950> pushing<00:02:28.280> your<00:02:28.520> ear<00:02:28.820> into<00:02:29.090> the

like you know pushing your ear into the
hole<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> little<00:02:29.780> bit<00:02:30.050> but<00:02:30.440> that<00:02:30.560> my<00:02:30.650> ears<00:02:30.800> is

substantially<00:02:31.460> large<00:02:31.700> it's<00:02:31.970> just<00:02:32.150> something

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
substantially large it's just something

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.120 
substantially large it's just something
to<00:02:32.450> keep<00:02:32.570> in<00:02:32.720> mind<00:02:32.900> because<00:02:33.560> if<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:33.830> do<00:02:33.980> wear

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
just flat on after a while the pressure

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.210 
just flat on after a while the pressure
is<00:02:36.200> just<00:02:36.290> going<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.530> get<00:02:36.650> too<00:02:36.860> much<00:02:37.010> you're

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
is just going to get too much you're

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.540 
is just going to get too much you're
gonna<00:02:37.310> get<00:02:37.490> annoyed<00:02:37.790> after<00:02:38.120> like<00:02:38.240> a<00:02:38.270> day's<00:02:38.540> use

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
gonna get annoyed after like a day's use

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.070 
gonna get annoyed after like a day's use
so<00:02:40.550> there's<00:02:40.670> something<00:02:40.820> there<00:02:41.120> now<00:02:41.600> I<00:02:41.690> love

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
so there's something there now I love

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.810 
so there's something there now I love
the<00:02:42.230> fact<00:02:42.410> that<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:43.280> know<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.460> turns<00:02:43.640> like

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
the fact that you know it turns like

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.070 
the fact that you know it turns like
this<00:02:43.940> because<00:02:44.210> it<00:02:44.300> can<00:02:44.360> lay<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.660> flat<00:02:44.810> on<00:02:45.050> your

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
this because it can lay it flat on your

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.240 
this because it can lay it flat on your
table<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.620> stuff<00:02:45.740> like<00:02:45.890> that<00:02:46.070> when<00:02:46.160> you're

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
table and stuff like that when you're

table and stuff like that when you're
not<00:02:46.340> using<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.790> that's<00:02:47.270> handy<00:02:47.720> now<00:02:48.290> the

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
not using it that's handy now the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.230 
not using it that's handy now the
buttons<00:02:48.830> which<00:02:49.070> I<00:02:49.220> sort<00:02:49.580> of<00:02:49.640> mentioned<00:02:49.970> before

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
buttons which I sort of mentioned before

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.000 
buttons which I sort of mentioned before
the<00:02:50.330> buttons<00:02:50.600> for<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.750> Bluetooth<00:02:51.010> turning

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
the buttons for the Bluetooth turning

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.440 
the buttons for the Bluetooth turning
them<00:02:52.130> on<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.520> turning<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.820> noise<00:02:53.030> canceling

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
them on and turning the noise canceling

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.330 
them on and turning the noise canceling
on<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.660> off<00:02:53.750> as<00:02:53.900> well<00:02:54.020> it's<00:02:54.710> really<00:02:55.010> hidden

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
on and off as well it's really hidden
