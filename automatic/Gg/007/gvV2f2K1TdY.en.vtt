route<00:01:25.470> let's<00:01:25.799> burn<00:01:25.950> more<00:01:26.130> miles<00:01:26.340> get<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
route let's burn more miles get the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.630 
route let's burn more miles get the
challenge<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.180> quicker<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.950> second

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
challenge of in quicker and the second

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.130 
challenge of in quicker and the second
challenge<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.750> first<00:01:31.079> blood<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.450> this<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.689> be

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
challenge is first blood and this can be

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.560 
challenge is first blood and this can be
pretty<00:01:34.320> tricky<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.369> suppose<00:01:36.180> there<00:01:36.540> are

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
pretty tricky but it I suppose there are

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.109 
pretty tricky but it I suppose there are
a<00:01:37.020> couple<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.619> ways<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.979> doing<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.939> best

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
a couple of ways of doing it so the best

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.850 
a couple of ways of doing it so the best
ways<00:01:39.329> I've<00:01:39.540> found<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.900> going<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.229> domination

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
ways I've found is going on domination

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.160 
ways I've found is going on domination
in<00:01:40.979> using<00:01:41.220> an<00:01:41.280> SMG<00:01:41.579> or<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.790> sniper<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:43.020> to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
in using an SMG or a sniper you have to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.420 
in using an SMG or a sniper you have to
ignore<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> objective<00:01:44.040> otherwise<00:01:44.280> you're

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
ignore the objective otherwise you're

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.090 
ignore the objective otherwise you're
not<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.450> beam<00:01:46.140> flag<00:01:46.470> or<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
not going to get to the beam flag or the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.639 
not going to get to the beam flag or the
enemy<00:01:47.340> spawn<00:01:47.750> first<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.140> you're<00:01:49.290> going<00:01:49.530> to

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
enemy spawn first so you're going to

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.580 
enemy spawn first so you're going to
have<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.119> ignore<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.270> objective<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.899> just

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
have to ignore the objective and just

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.380 
have to ignore the objective and just
rush<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.460> should<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.729> first<00:01:53.939> blood<00:01:54.090> a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
rush and you should get first blood a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.840 
rush and you should get first blood a
lot<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.689> times<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.040> was<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.189> SMG<00:01:56.640> and

lot of times so that was the SMG and
this<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.750> sniper<00:01:57.990> snipers<00:01:58.619> are<00:01:58.740> easier<00:01:59.100> to

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
this is the sniper snipers are easier to

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.109 
this is the sniper snipers are easier to
yeah<00:01:59.369> first<00:02:00.000> blood<00:02:00.299> with<00:02:00.479> obviously<00:02:01.020> because

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
yeah first blood with obviously because

you about is captures is probably the

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.970 
you about is captures is probably the

capture<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.829> like<00:02:27.010> 15<00:02:27.430> times<00:02:27.640> there<00:02:27.849> are<00:02:27.909> a

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
capture of like 15 times there are a

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.610 
capture of like 15 times there are a
couple<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.239> tips<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.659> can<00:02:28.720> give<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.230> I'm

couple of tips I can give to you I'm

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.390 
couple of tips I can give to you I'm
about<00:02:30.250> capturing<00:02:31.019> like<00:02:32.019> so<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.950> trick<00:02:33.220> is

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
about capturing like so the trick is

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.220 
about capturing like so the trick is
really<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.879> to<00:02:34.000> take<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.569> least<00:02:34.930> obvious

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
really is to take the least obvious

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.729 
really is to take the least obvious
route<00:02:35.799> so<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:37.299> also<00:02:37.599> stop<00:02:38.049> at<00:02:38.200> nothing<00:02:38.590> like

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
route so and also stop at nothing like

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.670 
route so and also stop at nothing like
there<00:02:38.920> was<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.069> guy<00:02:39.250> who<00:02:39.659> came<00:02:40.659> I<00:02:41.079> rush<00:02:41.349> straight

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
there was a guy who came I rush straight

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.949 
there was a guy who came I rush straight
past<00:02:41.950> which<00:02:42.370> remembers<00:02:42.879> oh<00:02:43.000> it's<00:02:43.329> okay<00:02:43.659> I'm

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
past which remembers oh it's okay I'm

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.119 
past which remembers oh it's okay I'm
trying<00:02:44.139> to<00:02:44.230> get<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.409> flag<00:02:44.620> knocks<00:02:44.889> on<00:02:45.040> it

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
trying to get the flag knocks on it

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.930 
trying to get the flag knocks on it
you're<00:02:45.670> trying<00:02:45.849> to<00:02:45.909> kill<00:02:46.090> everyone<00:02:47.879> so<00:02:48.879> I'm

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
you're trying to kill everyone so I'm

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.149 
you're trying to kill everyone so I'm
just<00:02:49.060> gonna<00:02:49.180> kill<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:50.200> guys<00:02:50.349> defending<00:02:51.040> the

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
just gonna kill the guys defending the

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.580 
just gonna kill the guys defending the
flag<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.870> once<00:02:52.870> again<00:02:53.079> I'm<00:02:53.170> going<00:02:53.349> to<00:02:53.409> take

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
flag and once again I'm going to take

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.789 
flag and once again I'm going to take
the<00:02:53.739> least<00:02:53.950> obvious<00:02:54.250> route<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.560> flag

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
the least obvious route to the flag

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.559 
the least obvious route to the flag
which<00:02:57.010> is<00:02:57.040> obviously<00:02:57.459> round<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.909> back<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.420> mean

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
which is obviously round the back I mean

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.629 
which is obviously round the back I mean
the<00:02:58.870> two<00:02:59.230> more<00:02:59.439> obvious<00:02:59.799> would<00:02:59.980> be<00:03:00.069> around<00:03:00.400> the

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
the two more obvious would be around the

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.179 
the two more obvious would be around the
tire<00:03:01.000> yard<00:03:01.359> in<00:03:01.750> firing<00:03:02.319> range<00:03:02.620> or<00:03:02.980> maybe

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
tire yard in firing range or maybe

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.670 
tire yard in firing range or maybe
straight<00:03:03.579> through<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.909> middle<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:05.500> kill<00:03:05.650> a

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
straight through the middle so I kill a

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.679 
straight through the middle so I kill a
guy<00:03:05.829> trying<00:03:06.099> to<00:03:06.159> take<00:03:06.340> out<00:03:06.519> or<00:03:07.150> try<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.450> take

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
guy trying to take out or try to take

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
and I rushed straight back to our flag

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:47.550

do is maybe set up a claymore limbs and
see<00:03:58.000> for<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.840> best<00:03:59.019> thing<00:03:59.319> I<00:03:59.470> found<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.859> a

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
see for the best thing I found is a

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.349 
see for the best thing I found is a
motion<00:04:00.340> sensor<00:04:00.370> which<00:04:00.940> you<00:04:01.060> can<00:04:01.209> basically

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
motion sensor which you can basically

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.809 
motion sensor which you can basically
see<00:04:01.810> if<00:04:01.900> enemies<00:04:02.229> trying<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:03.129> rush<00:04:03.340> your<00:04:03.519> spawn

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
see if enemies trying to rush your spawn

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.210 
see if enemies trying to rush your spawn
wait<00:04:04.599> for<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:04.810> flag<00:04:05.019> to<00:04:05.199> be<00:04:05.290> captured<00:04:05.799> so<00:04:06.129> they

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
wait for the flag to be captured so they

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.490 
wait for the flag to be captured so they
can<00:04:06.370> pick<00:04:06.489> it<00:04:06.609> up<00:04:06.699> again<00:04:07.000> but<00:04:07.569> I<00:04:07.810> just<00:04:07.870> have<00:04:08.409> to

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
can pick it up again but I just have to

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.819 
can pick it up again but I just have to
wait<00:04:08.650> out<00:04:08.859> and<00:04:09.129> then<00:04:09.459> when<00:04:09.639> you're<00:04:10.680> when<00:04:11.680> your

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
wait out and then when you're when your

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.449 
wait out and then when you're when your
flag<00:04:12.040> returns<00:04:12.400> just<00:04:13.120> literally<00:04:13.510> capture<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:13.989> I

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
flag returns just literally capture it I

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.620 
flag returns just literally capture it I
pick<00:04:15.459> up<00:04:15.549> the<00:04:15.609> motion<00:04:15.909> sensor<00:04:16.239> here<00:04:16.389> because<00:04:16.539> I

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
pick up the motion sensor here because I

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.759 
pick up the motion sensor here because I
want<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.810> keep<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.169> I<00:04:17.199> don't<00:04:17.409> want<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.560> get

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
want to keep it I don't want to get

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.319 
want to keep it I don't want to get
destroyed<00:04:18.130> it's<00:04:18.430> gonna<00:04:18.519> be<00:04:18.669> no<00:04:18.820> use<00:04:19.030> further

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
destroyed it's gonna be no use further

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.089 
destroyed it's gonna be no use further
away<00:04:19.570> from<00:04:19.750> them<00:04:19.840> so<00:04:19.989> if<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.590> repeat<00:04:20.950> these

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
away from them so if you repeat these

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.980 
away from them so if you repeat these
techniques<00:04:21.639> you<00:04:21.969> will<00:04:22.120> eventually<00:04:22.330> get<00:04:22.659> merit

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
techniques you will eventually get merit

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.350 
techniques you will eventually get merit
and<00:04:23.139> pro<00:04:23.430> so<00:04:24.430> anyway<00:04:24.669> I<00:04:24.700> hope<00:04:24.820> this<00:04:25.000> has<00:04:25.120> been

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
and pro so anyway I hope this has been

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.649 
and pro so anyway I hope this has been
official<00:04:25.659> to<00:04:25.810> all<00:04:25.900> of<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.199> and<00:04:27.539> we<00:04:28.539> will
