00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
removing the burr from the cutting edge

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.420 
removing the burr from the cutting edge
if<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:24.119> strap<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.960> between<00:01:25.350> sharpening<00:01:25.920> your

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
if you strap in between sharpening your

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.030 
if you strap in between sharpening your
cutting<00:01:26.790> edge<00:01:26.909> will<00:01:27.119> last<00:01:27.330> longer<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:31.040> make

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
cutting edge will last longer and make

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.200 
cutting edge will last longer and make
for<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> better<00:01:32.490> cutting<00:01:33.000> edge<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.820> you're

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
for a better cutting edge and you're

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.300 
for a better cutting edge and you're
probably<00:01:36.299> asking<00:01:36.600> how<00:01:36.930> how<00:01:37.770> long<00:01:37.829> do<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.189> do

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
probably asking how how long do you do
