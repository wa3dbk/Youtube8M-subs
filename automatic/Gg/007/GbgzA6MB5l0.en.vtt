00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
matter even if there's a reflection of

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.090 
matter even if there's a reflection of
the<00:00:31.820> chiffon<00:00:32.820> left<00:00:33.149> because<00:00:33.920> actually<00:00:34.920> that

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the chiffon left because actually that

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.930 
the chiffon left because actually that
gives<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.700> little<00:00:35.910> bit<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:37.730> rather<00:00:38.730> than

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
gives it a little bit of a rather than

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.000 
gives it a little bit of a rather than
just<00:00:39.180> having<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> gold<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.469> gives<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
just having the gold it just gives a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.160 
just having the gold it just gives a
little<00:00:41.040> bit<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.489> focus<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
little bit of focus this is a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.069 
little bit of focus this is a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
doing is it's giving a slight stiffness

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.280 
doing is it's giving a slight stiffness
and<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:02.610> fabric<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.149> no<00:02:03.420> longer<00:02:03.869> because<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
and the fabric is no longer because the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.490 
and the fabric is no longer because the
