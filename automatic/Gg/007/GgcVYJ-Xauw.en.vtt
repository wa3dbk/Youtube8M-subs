falls on your feet one day you see

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.220 
falls on your feet one day you see
people<00:00:23.490> under<00:00:24.330> pressure<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.080> don't

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
people under pressure that you don't

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.570 
people under pressure that you don't
really<00:00:25.350> get<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.590> see<00:00:25.830> under<00:00:26.039> pressure<00:00:26.279> that

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
really get to see under pressure that

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.089 
really get to see under pressure that
often<00:00:26.970> it's<00:00:27.390> more<00:00:27.840> or<00:00:27.930> less<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.080> free-for-all

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
often it's more or less a free-for-all

00:00:29.099 --> 00:01:13.899 
often it's more or less a free-for-all
the<00:00:29.519> best<00:00:29.730> skaters<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.210> world

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.840 

I<00:01:13.969> guess

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.250 

cut<00:01:21.850> off<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.150> board<00:01:22.360> like<00:01:22.510> that<00:01:22.570> put<00:01:23.080> more

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
cut off the board like that put more

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.660 
cut off the board like that put more
tension<00:01:23.470> in<00:01:23.830> here<00:01:23.980> tonight

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
tension in here tonight

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.360 
tension in here tonight
that's<00:01:25.270> what<00:01:25.510> so<00:01:25.960> safe<00:01:26.260> loosening<00:01:26.770> up<00:01:27.040> that

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
that's what so safe loosening up that

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:39.530 
that's what so safe loosening up that
yeah<00:01:33.420> yeah<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.820> was<00:01:36.940> reviewing<00:01:37.570> your<00:01:37.810> x-rays

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
yeah yeah it was reviewing your x-rays

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.820 
yeah yeah it was reviewing your x-rays
yeah<00:01:40.540> so<00:01:40.870> that<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:41.170> wasn't<00:01:41.470> a<00:01:41.530> compression

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
yeah so that that wasn't a compression

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.800 
yeah so that that wasn't a compression
fracture<00:01:42.220> yeah<00:01:42.550> well<00:01:43.120> it's<00:01:43.450> not<00:01:43.630> a<00:01:43.690> new

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
fracture yeah well it's not a new

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.430 
fracture yeah well it's not a new
compression<00:01:44.470> fracture<00:01:45.010> but<00:01:45.280> there's<00:01:45.610> an<00:01:45.850> old

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
compression fracture but there's an old

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.390 
compression fracture but there's an old
o.selected<00:01:47.440> in<00:01:47.650> at<00:01:47.830> first

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
o.selected in at first

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.670 
o.selected in at first
exactly<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.450> first<00:01:49.750> time

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.940 

you<00:01:56.040> don't<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.700> make<00:01:56.940> a<00:01:57.000> mimosa<00:01:57.800> all<00:01:58.800> right

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
you don't just make a mimosa all right

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.740 
you don't just make a mimosa all right
yes

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
yes

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.190 

no<00:02:04.040> it's<00:02:04.880> passes<00:02:05.300> out<00:02:05.420> when<00:02:05.540> I<00:02:05.570> turned<00:02:05.870> this

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
no it's passes out when I turned this

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.139 
no it's passes out when I turned this
way<00:02:06.440> but<00:02:06.650> not<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.830> other<00:02:06.950> one

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149

to get out of bed I can skate for a few
days

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
days

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.910 
days
when<00:02:34.569> I<00:02:34.599> got<00:02:34.780> home<00:02:34.989> was<00:02:35.260> like<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.530> need<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.739> check

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
when I got home was like I need to check

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.610 
when I got home was like I need to check
this<00:02:36.099> thing<00:02:36.160> out<00:02:37.110> I'll<00:02:38.110> be<00:02:38.170> able<00:02:38.319> to<00:02:38.470> move

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
this thing out I'll be able to move

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.530 
this thing out I'll be able to move
again<00:02:38.830> that's<00:02:39.610> where<00:02:39.760> we<00:02:39.819> take<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.090> x-rays

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
again that's where we take the x-rays

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.570 
again that's where we take the x-rays
because<00:02:40.840> we<00:02:41.050> wanted<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.620> rule<00:02:41.830> out<00:02:42.069> that<00:02:42.489> he

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
because we wanted to rule out that he

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.670 
because we wanted to rule out that he
did<00:02:42.790> have<00:02:43.030> any<00:02:43.209> kind<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.480> fracture

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
did have any kind of fracture

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.729 
did have any kind of fracture
he<00:02:45.040> didn't<00:02:45.400> but<00:02:45.670> we<00:02:45.760> did<00:02:45.909> find<00:02:46.120> an<00:02:46.390> old

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
he didn't but we did find an old

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.650 
he didn't but we did find an old
compression<00:02:47.739> fracture<00:02:48.129> years<00:02:49.030> ago

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
compression fracture years ago

00:02:50.660 --> 00:03:05.390 
compression fracture years ago
you

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.459 

you
