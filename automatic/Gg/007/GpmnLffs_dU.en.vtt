done I will avoid indeed boid if I don't
know<00:00:17.250> if<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.369> can<00:00:17.490> reach<00:00:17.609> your<00:00:17.760> camera<00:00:18.119> over

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
know if you can reach your camera over

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.910 
know if you can reach your camera over
here<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.539> see<00:00:18.690> our<00:00:18.810> first<00:00:19.109> generation<00:00:19.710> solar

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
here and see our first generation solar

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.429 
here and see our first generation solar
panel<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:21.150> one<00:00:21.330> there<00:00:21.510> yeah<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.720> seeks

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
panel that one there yeah that seeks

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.470 
panel that one there yeah that seeks
yup<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.949> right<00:00:23.250> honkin<00:00:23.699> panel<00:00:24.090> there<00:00:24.269> that

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
yup that right honkin panel there that

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.390 
yup that right honkin panel there that
was<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.050> roof<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.439> vehicle<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:25.980> then

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
was on the roof of this vehicle and then

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.920 
was on the roof of this vehicle and then
we've<00:00:26.609> evolved<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.150> now<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.570> second

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
we've evolved that now to the second

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.200 
we've evolved that now to the second
generation<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:28.949> actually<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.849> lot<00:00:30.179> of

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
generation so we actually have a lot of

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.269 
generation so we actually have a lot of
crystalline<00:00:30.810> photovoltaic<00:00:31.320> cells<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
crystalline photovoltaic cells on the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.799 
crystalline photovoltaic cells on the
roof<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.610> vehicle<00:00:33.059> right<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.630> more

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
roof of this vehicle right in a more

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.569 
roof of this vehicle right in a more
streamlined<00:00:34.079> fashion<00:00:34.530> now<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> complement

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
streamlined fashion now to complement

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.190 
streamlined fashion now to complement
the<00:00:35.670> compound<00:00:36.120> curve<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.600> roof<00:00:36.780> right

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the compound curve of the roof right

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.110 
the compound curve of the roof right
what<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.680> vehicle<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.160> doing<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.700> we're

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
what this vehicle is doing is we're

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.760 
what this vehicle is doing is we're
using<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.540> sustainable<00:00:40.079> energy<00:00:40.170> from<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
using the sustainable energy from the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.430 
using the sustainable energy from the
Sun<00:00:41.010> right<00:00:41.550> power<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.180> secondary<00:00:42.780> battery<00:00:43.170> pack

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
Sun right power a secondary battery pack

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.790 
Sun right power a secondary battery pack
that<00:00:43.770> secondary<00:00:44.670> battery<00:00:45.030> pack<00:00:45.270> then

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
that secondary battery pack then

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.860 
that secondary battery pack then
supplements<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.309> charge<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.360> main<00:00:48.570> array

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
supplements the charge in the main array

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.930 
supplements the charge in the main array
so<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.620> state<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.920> charge<00:00:50.100> drops<00:00:50.460> right

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
so the state of charge drops right

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.639 
so the state of charge drops right
rechargeable<00:00:51.750> car<00:00:51.899> battery<00:00:52.230> pack<00:00:52.440> that's

being<00:00:52.829> charged<00:00:53.129> from<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> Sun<00:00:53.760> right<00:00:54.480> it

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
being charged from the Sun right it

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.330 
being charged from the Sun right it

our<00:01:43.039> system<00:01:43.490> is<00:01:43.700> standalone<00:01:44.210> but<00:01:44.539> there's

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
our system is standalone but there's

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.779 
our system is standalone but there's
still<00:01:44.899> a<00:01:44.930> communication<00:01:45.710> protocol<00:01:46.159> right<00:01:46.640> you

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
still a communication protocol right you

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.100

have to be a total Prius any hybrid and

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.640 
have to be a total Prius any hybrid and
we<00:02:13.880> will<00:02:14.030> convert<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.840> solar<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.500> a

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
we will convert it to a solar and a

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.289 
we will convert it to a solar and a
plug-in<00:02:16.130> so<00:02:16.610> at<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.819> front<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.180> vehicle

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
plug-in so at the front of the vehicle

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.410 
plug-in so at the front of the vehicle
girl<00:02:17.720> Oi<00:02:17.930> we're<00:02:18.709> actually<00:02:18.799> plugging<00:02:19.400> in<00:02:19.549> two

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.920 

ah<00:02:22.980> so

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
ah so

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.830 
ah so
we<00:02:26.439> have<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.680> fast<00:02:27.010> charge<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:28.420> regular

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
we have a fast charge and a regular

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.630 
we have a fast charge and a regular
hundred<00:02:29.079> twenty<00:02:29.319> full<00:02:29.530> power<00:02:29.950> supply<00:02:30.430> here

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
hundred twenty full power supply here

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.309 
hundred twenty full power supply here
right<00:02:30.819> so<00:02:31.299> see<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.569> can<00:02:31.599> plug<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.019> in<00:02:32.110> both

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
right so see you can plug it in both

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.440 
right so see you can plug it in both
ways<00:02:32.560> like<00:02:32.860> at<00:02:33.370> home<00:02:33.579> if<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:33.879> put<00:02:34.090> in<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.299> big

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
ways like at home if you put in a big

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.170 
ways like at home if you put in a big
220<00:02:35.049> of<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.379> exact<00:02:35.680> data<00:02:35.920> three<00:02:36.310> but<00:02:36.790> fast

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
220 of the exact data three but fast

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.030 
220 of the exact data three but fast
charge<00:02:37.540> don't<00:02:37.780> batteries<00:02:38.290> get<00:02:38.530> really<00:02:38.829> hot

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
charge don't batteries get really hot

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.679 
charge don't batteries get really hot
when<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.400> do<00:02:39.579> that<00:02:39.730> pump<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.269> that<00:02:40.420> quick

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
when you do that pump it in that quick

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.210 
when you do that pump it in that quick
that<00:02:40.840> corrects<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.349> hold<00:02:41.530> virtue<00:02:41.799> of<00:02:42.099> the

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
that corrects the hold virtue of the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.539 
that corrects the hold virtue of the
speed<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:43.720> Zen's<00:02:44.019> new<00:02:44.470> hyper<00:02:44.829> capacitor

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
speed the Zen's new hyper capacitor

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.670 
speed the Zen's new hyper capacitor
exactly<00:02:46.239> that's<00:02:46.720> right<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.079> there's<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.530> number

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
exactly that's right so there's a number

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.710 
exactly that's right so there's a number
of<00:02:47.799> strategies<00:02:47.950> for<00:02:48.489> that<00:02:48.609> and<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:49.480> fast

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
of strategies for that and the fast

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.050 
of strategies for that and the fast
charge<00:02:50.049> is<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.650> evolution<00:02:51.310> right<00:02:51.670> we're<00:02:51.909> not

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
charge is the evolution right we're not

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.670 
charge is the evolution right we're not
at<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.239> fast<00:02:52.540> charge<00:02:52.840> state<00:02:53.109> with<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.439> car

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
at a fast charge state with this car

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.289 
at a fast charge state with this car
right<00:02:53.890> now<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.099> nickel<00:02:54.489> metal<00:02:54.579> hydride<00:02:54.730> pack

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
right now the nickel metal hydride pack

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.930 
right now the nickel metal hydride pack
that<00:02:55.780> won't<00:02:55.989> do<00:02:56.170> that<00:02:56.319> but<00:02:56.950> our<00:02:57.220> battery<00:02:57.640> pack

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
that won't do that but our battery pack

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.940 
that won't do that but our battery pack
we<00:02:58.180> put<00:02:58.389> a<00:02:58.420> look<00:02:58.629> in<00:02:58.810> my<00:02:58.989> on<00:02:59.170> battery<00:02:59.500> pack<00:02:59.739> in

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
we put a look in my on battery pack in

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.490 
we put a look in my on battery pack in
princess<00:03:00.340> gray<00:03:00.760> we<00:03:00.940> can<00:03:01.269> do<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.810> fast<00:03:02.139> charge

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
princess gray we can do a fast charge

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.680 
princess gray we can do a fast charge
scenario<00:03:03.040> on<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.430> our<00:03:03.849> controller<00:03:04.389> then

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
scenario on that our controller then

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.770 
scenario on that our controller then
will<00:03:04.840> manage<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.349> in<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.889> integration<00:03:06.780> the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
will manage that in that integration the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.710 
will manage that in that integration the
fast<00:03:08.019> charge<00:03:08.379> we<00:03:09.159> also<00:03:09.340> need<00:03:09.609> a<00:03:09.639> big<00:03:09.970> rectifier

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
fast charge we also need a big rectifier

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.500 
fast charge we also need a big rectifier
you<00:03:10.900> need<00:03:11.079> a<00:03:11.159> big<00:03:12.159> inverter<00:03:12.730> that<00:03:13.060> can<00:03:13.269> handle

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
you need a big inverter that can handle

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.390 
you need a big inverter that can handle
that<00:03:13.810> kind<00:03:14.019> of<00:03:14.139> fast<00:03:14.409> charge<00:03:14.739> got<00:03:15.189> to<00:03:15.310> be

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
that kind of fast charge got to be

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.280 
that kind of fast charge got to be
Decius<00:03:15.939> so<00:03:16.090> it's<00:03:16.269> been<00:03:16.389> a<00:03:16.420> pretty<00:03:16.780> big<00:03:17.049> it's

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
Decius so it's been a pretty big it's

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.990 
Decius so it's been a pretty big it's
got<00:03:17.439> to<00:03:17.530> be<00:03:17.590> pretty<00:03:17.739> big<00:03:17.889> so<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.459> strategy<00:03:18.970> is

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
got to be pretty big so the strategy is

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.390 
got to be pretty big so the strategy is
to<00:03:19.510> have<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.900> non-portable<00:03:20.409> rate<00:03:20.769> now<00:03:21.010> right

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
to have that non-portable rate now right

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.670 
to have that non-portable rate now right
but<00:03:21.819> have<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.209> carve<00:03:22.510> able<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.170> accept<00:03:23.590> that

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
but have to carve able to accept that

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.510 
but have to carve able to accept that
power

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
power
