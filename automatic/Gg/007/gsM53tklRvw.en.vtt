they asked the question can he guard his
position<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.170> answer<00:02:42.440> with<00:02:42.560> Oladipo<00:02:43.040> is

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
position so the answer with Oladipo is

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.680 
position so the answer with Oladipo is
yes<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.730> small<00:02:44.030> forward<00:02:44.269> position<00:02:44.360> of

yes and the small forward position of

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.930 
yes and the small forward position of
course<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.050> most<00:02:45.230> difficult<00:02:45.730> position<00:02:46.730> to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
course is the most difficult position to

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.570 
course is the most difficult position to
guard<00:02:47.209> in<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.810> NBA<00:02:47.840> so<00:02:48.500> in<00:02:48.709> that<00:02:49.040> sense<00:02:49.340> I

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
guard in the NBA so in that sense I

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.500 
guard in the NBA so in that sense I
think<00:02:49.610> he's<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:50.000> very<00:02:50.239> very<00:02:50.299> attractive

I'm not convinced that he's going to be
a<00:02:54.769> real<00:02:55.040> high<00:02:55.160> level<00:02:55.489> scorer<00:02:55.760> in<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.360> NBA<00:02:56.390> his

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
a real high level scorer in the NBA his

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.120 
a real high level scorer in the NBA his
three-point<00:02:57.410> percentage<00:02:57.680> went<00:02:58.040> up

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
three-point percentage went up

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.130 
three-point percentage went up
drastically<00:02:58.430> from<00:02:59.150> his<00:02:59.360> sophomore<00:02:59.599> to<00:02:59.989> his

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
drastically from his sophomore to his

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.440 
drastically from his sophomore to his
junior<00:03:00.500> year<00:03:00.530> at<00:03:00.920> Indiana<00:03:01.730> but<00:03:02.030> when<00:03:02.360> you

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
junior year at Indiana but when you

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.960 
junior year at Indiana but when you
watched<00:03:02.720> him<00:03:02.989> play<00:03:03.140> he<00:03:03.560> was<00:03:03.709> still<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.920> guy<00:03:04.160> who

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
watched him play he was still a guy who

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.460 
watched him play he was still a guy who
needed<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.269> be<00:03:05.330> pretty<00:03:05.540> much<00:03:05.690> wide<00:03:05.900> open<00:03:06.260> get

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
needed to be pretty much wide open get

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.620 
needed to be pretty much wide open get
time<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.739> set<00:03:07.040> his<00:03:07.160> feet<00:03:07.340> get<00:03:07.610> in<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:07.819> rhythm<00:03:08.000> to

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
time to set his feet get in a rhythm to

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.120 
time to set his feet get in a rhythm to
be<00:03:09.019> able<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.230> get<00:03:09.349> his<00:03:09.440> shot<00:03:09.620> off<00:03:09.650> I<00:03:09.860> think<00:03:09.890> he's

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
be able to get his shot off I think he's

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.350 
be able to get his shot off I think he's
going<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.340> have<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:10.519> transition<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.150> the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
going to have to transition to the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.660 
going to have to transition to the
shooting<00:03:11.660> guard<00:03:11.810> position<00:03:11.870> at<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.950> NBA<00:03:13.310> and

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
shooting guard position at the NBA and

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.890 
shooting guard position at the NBA and
he's<00:03:13.790> going<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.000> have<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.180> develop<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.660> part

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
he's going to have to develop that part

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.240 
he's going to have to develop that part
of<00:03:14.989> his<00:03:15.080> game<00:03:15.260> but<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.620> thing<00:03:15.799> about<00:03:15.830> Victor

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
of his game but the thing about Victor

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
Oladipo is it's amazing to talk about

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.960 
Oladipo is it's amazing to talk about
him<00:03:18.680> as<00:03:18.799> a<00:03:18.829> lottery<00:03:19.190> pick<00:03:19.220> right<00:03:19.549> now<00:03:19.700> when

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
him as a lottery pick right now when

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.910

coming into his junior season he wasn't

on<00:03:22.010> anybody's<00:03:22.310> top<00:03:22.640> 100<00:03:23.480> list<00:03:23.510> so<00:03:24.230> that's<00:03:24.650> how

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
on anybody's top 100 list so that's how

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.560 
on anybody's top 100 list so that's how
far<00:03:25.100> he's<00:03:25.280> come<00:03:25.310> because<00:03:25.730> of<00:03:25.790> his<00:03:25.970> work<00:03:26.180> ethic

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
far he's come because of his work ethic

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.449 
far he's come because of his work ethic
I<00:03:26.720> see<00:03:27.019> no<00:03:27.170> reason<00:03:27.350> why<00:03:27.530> he<00:03:27.709> can't<00:03:27.980> continue<00:03:28.220> to

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
I see no reason why he can't continue to

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.150 
I see no reason why he can't continue to
develop<00:03:28.730> after<00:03:29.180> college<00:03:29.870> shooting<00:03:30.500> is<00:03:30.620> not<00:03:30.920> a

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
develop after college shooting is not a

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.009 
develop after college shooting is not a
weakness<00:03:31.400> for<00:03:31.700> one<00:03:31.880> guy<00:03:32.030> not<00:03:32.329> in<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:32.720> draft

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
weakness for one guy not in the draft

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.690 
weakness for one guy not in the draft
this<00:03:33.230> year<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.620> that's<00:03:33.709> Doug<00:03:34.010> McDermott<00:03:34.370> from

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
this year and that's Doug McDermott from

this year and that's Doug McDermott from
Creighton<00:03:35.060> did<00:03:35.450> he<00:03:35.540> make<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.750> right<00:03:36.049> call<00:03:36.440> by

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
Creighton did he make the right call by

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.590 
Creighton did he make the right call by
going<00:03:36.980> back<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.400> if<00:03:37.579> you<00:03:37.730> were<00:03:37.910> in<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.299> draft

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
going back and if you were in the draft

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.630 
going back and if you were in the draft
where<00:03:39.049> would<00:03:39.170> he<00:03:39.230> be<00:03:39.319> on<00:03:39.560> your<00:03:39.680> list<00:03:39.829> well<00:03:40.549> from

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
where would he be on your list well from

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.190 
where would he be on your list well from
a<00:03:40.760> basketball<00:03:40.910> standpoint<00:03:41.480> I<00:03:41.780> would<00:03:41.810> say<00:03:42.049> he

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
a basketball standpoint I would say he

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.870 
a basketball standpoint I would say he
did<00:03:42.350> not<00:03:42.500> make<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.799> right<00:03:42.950> call<00:03:43.160> going<00:03:43.400> back

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
did not make the right call going back

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.520 
did not make the right call going back
to<00:03:44.030> school<00:03:44.120> just<00:03:44.690> because<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:45.049> don't<00:03:45.109> see<00:03:45.350> him

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
to school just because I don't see him

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.979 
to school just because I don't see him
drastically<00:03:46.359> enhancing<00:03:47.359> his<00:03:47.480> draft<00:03:47.750> position

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
drastically enhancing his draft position

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.379 
drastically enhancing his draft position
we<00:03:48.290> know<00:03:48.500> what<00:03:49.160> he<00:03:49.310> is<00:03:49.459> what<00:03:49.639> he<00:03:49.819> can<00:03:49.970> do<00:03:50.150> in

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
we know what he is what he can do in

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.690 
we know what he is what he can do in
terms<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.720> his<00:03:50.870> own<00:03:50.989> life<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.769> think<00:03:52.400> is<00:03:52.489> a<00:03:52.519> great

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
terms of his own life I think is a great

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.280 
terms of his own life I think is a great
decision<00:03:53.030> for<00:03:53.389> him<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.690> mean<00:03:53.720> who<00:03:53.959> among<00:03:54.170> us

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
decision for him I mean who among us

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.330 
decision for him I mean who among us
wouldn't<00:03:54.500> want<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.680> go<00:03:54.799> be<00:03:54.920> a<00:03:54.950> senior<00:03:55.250> in

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
wouldn't want to go be a senior in

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.400 
wouldn't want to go be a senior in
college<00:03:55.459> again<00:03:55.730> so<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.389> say<00:03:56.750> more<00:03:56.959> power<00:03:56.989> to<00:03:57.260> him

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
college again so I say more power to him

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.349 
college again so I say more power to him
was<00:03:57.590> great<00:03:57.769> for<00:03:57.920> college<00:03:58.220> basketball<00:03:58.760> looking

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
was great for college basketball looking

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.120 
was great for college basketball looking
at<00:03:59.450> this<00:03:59.569> list<00:03:59.780> I<00:04:00.019> would<00:04:00.170> put<00:04:00.319> him<00:04:00.440> forward<00:04:00.769> in

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
at this list I would put him forward in

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.220 
at this list I would put him forward in
the<00:04:01.370> small<00:04:01.609> forward<00:04:01.880> category<00:04:02.120> so<00:04:02.569> behind<00:04:02.900> all

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
the small forward category so behind all

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.140 
the small forward category so behind all
the<00:04:03.350> depot<00:04:03.680> but<00:04:03.829> ahead<00:04:04.069> of<00:04:04.190> Deshaun<00:04:04.489> Thomas<00:04:04.519> I

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
the depot but ahead of Deshaun Thomas I

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.040 
the depot but ahead of Deshaun Thomas I
think<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:05.989> is<00:04:06.019> a<00:04:06.139> lot<00:04:06.260> of<00:04:06.410> seeing<00:04:06.590> things<00:04:06.799> that

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
think it is a lot of seeing things that

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.310 
think it is a lot of seeing things that
shawn<00:04:07.230> thomas<00:04:07.500> does<00:04:07.940> except<00:04:08.940> for<00:04:09.270> you<00:04:10.230> know

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
shawn thomas does except for you know

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.720 
shawn thomas does except for you know
scoring<00:04:10.830> and<00:04:11.010> shooting<00:04:11.040> from<00:04:11.340> deep<00:04:11.550> that's

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
scoring and shooting from deep that's

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.580 
scoring and shooting from deep that's
something<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.000> Dashon<00:04:12.510> still<00:04:13.200> has<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.440> little

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
something that Dashon still has a little

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.380 
something that Dashon still has a little
bit<00:04:13.740> of<00:04:13.800> a<00:04:13.890> weakness<00:04:14.070> in<00:04:14.340> his<00:04:14.490> game<00:04:14.760> I<00:04:14.970> think

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
bit of a weakness in his game I think

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.460 
bit of a weakness in his game I think
you<00:04:15.570> know<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:15.660> think<00:04:15.840> Doug<00:04:15.960> McDermott<00:04:16.200> is<00:04:16.320> going

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
you know I think Doug McDermott is going
