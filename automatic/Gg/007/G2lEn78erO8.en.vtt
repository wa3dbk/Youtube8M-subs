gig now the first application i'll show
you<00:00:20.089> is<00:00:20.359> the<00:00:22.419> rather<00:00:23.529> is<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:24.859> available

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
you is the rather is the available

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.880 
you is the rather is the available
application<00:00:26.210> from<00:00:26.419> Nokia's<00:00:27.320> website<00:00:27.710> which

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
application from Nokia's website which

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.999 
application from Nokia's website which
is<00:00:27.919> moving<00:00:28.339> ball<00:00:28.550> now<00:00:29.269> it<00:00:29.390> uses<00:00:29.749> a<00:00:30.019> special

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
is moving ball now it uses a special

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.140 
is moving ball now it uses a special
sensor<00:00:31.369> inside<00:00:31.669> the<00:00:31.909> n95<00:00:32.560> called<00:00:33.560> the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
sensor inside the n95 called the

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.400 
sensor inside the n95 called the
accelerometer<00:00:35.150> now<00:00:35.540> basically<00:00:35.720> that<00:00:35.990> detects

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
accelerometer now basically that detects

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.520 
accelerometer now basically that detects
movement<00:00:37.060> in<00:00:38.060> every<00:00:38.330> single<00:00:38.660> direction<00:00:38.960> the

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
movement in every single direction the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.200 
movement in every single direction the
phone<00:00:39.830> moves<00:00:40.100> as<00:00:40.580> you<00:00:40.640> can<00:00:40.730> see<00:00:40.910> here<00:00:41.090> we've

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
phone moves as you can see here we've

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.360 
phone moves as you can see here we've
got<00:00:41.240> a<00:00:41.360> little<00:00:41.510> ball<00:00:41.780> on<00:00:41.930> three<00:00:42.140> if<00:00:42.830> I<00:00:42.950> tilt<00:00:43.160> to

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
got a little ball on three if I tilt to

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.910 
got a little ball on three if I tilt to
the<00:00:43.490> left<00:00:43.580> they're<00:00:44.270> always<00:00:44.420> left<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:45.740> to<00:00:45.890> the

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
the left they're always left and to the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.130 
the left they're always left and to the
right<00:00:46.010> ball<00:00:46.310> is<00:00:46.490> right<00:00:46.670> oh<00:00:46.910> so<00:00:47.720> it<00:00:47.840> works<00:00:48.020> for

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
right ball is right oh so it works for

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.090 
right ball is right oh so it works for
turnaround<00:00:49.720> goes<00:00:50.720> up<00:00:50.930> to<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.080> top<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:51.740> also

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
turnaround goes up to the top and also

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.410 
turnaround goes up to the top and also
it<00:00:52.190> has<00:00:53.470> vertical<00:00:54.470> as<00:00:55.220> well<00:00:55.490> so<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:56.270> if<00:00:56.360> you

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
it has vertical as well so that if you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.630 
it has vertical as well so that if you
can<00:00:56.540> see<00:00:56.750> that<00:00:57.070> but<00:00:58.070> as<00:00:58.220> you<00:00:58.340> move<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.580> around

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
can see that but as you move it around

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.810 
can see that but as you move it around
the<00:00:59.600> ball<00:00:59.780> goes<00:00:59.960> up<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.170> down<00:01:00.230> as<00:01:00.410> well<00:01:00.820> so

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
the ball goes up and down as well so

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.130 
the ball goes up and down as well so
that's<00:01:01.910> from<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.330> few<00:01:02.660> I<00:01:02.690> mean<00:01:02.750> that<00:01:02.990> just

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
that's from the few I mean that just

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.580 
that's from the few I mean that just
showcase<00:01:03.800> how<00:01:04.189> it<00:01:04.309> works<00:01:05.320> so<00:01:06.320> I've<00:01:06.380> come<00:01:06.500> out

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
showcase how it works so I've come out

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.649 
showcase how it works so I've come out
that<00:01:06.830> another<00:01:07.220> one<00:01:07.310> called<00:01:07.549> lightsaber<00:01:10.659> we're

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
that another one called lightsaber we're

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.899 
that another one called lightsaber we're
going<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:11.869> lightsaber<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:13.039> is<00:01:13.249> just<00:01:13.729> as<00:01:13.880> it

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
going to lightsaber it is just as it

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.789 
going to lightsaber it is just as it
sounds<00:01:14.329> it's<00:01:14.509> very<00:01:14.719> cool<00:01:14.990> app<00:01:15.259> something

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
you'd use it's the shartha capable as to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.480 
you'd use it's the shartha capable as to
the<00:01:18.079> phone<00:01:18.289> start<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.009> lights<00:01:19.189> they<00:01:19.340> will

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490

when you slide the phone up to be the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.739 
when you slide the phone up to be the
vertical<00:02:04.340> position<00:02:04.670> they<00:02:04.909> slide<00:02:05.149> down<00:02:05.179> there

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
vertical position they slide down there

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:08.050 
vertical position they slide down there
were<00:02:05.869> sideways<00:02:06.159> this<00:02:07.159> does<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.459> automatically

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
were sideways this does it automatically

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.449 
were sideways this does it automatically
using<00:02:08.569> that<00:02:08.830> accelerometer<00:02:09.830> sensor<00:02:09.979> inside

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
using that accelerometer sensor inside

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.559 
using that accelerometer sensor inside
it

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
it

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.490 
it
as<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.750> can<00:02:12.810> see<00:02:13.049> like<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:15.080> all<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.140> these

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
as you can see like so all of these

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.140 
as you can see like so all of these
applications<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:17.519> shown<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:18.000> can
