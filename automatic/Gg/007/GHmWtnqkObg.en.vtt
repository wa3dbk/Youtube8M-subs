00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 

this<00:00:00.299> project<00:00:01.020> in<00:00:01.110> particular<00:00:01.530> was<00:00:01.740> thinking

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
this project in particular was thinking

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.889 
this project in particular was thinking
about<00:00:02.570> robots<00:00:03.570> that<00:00:03.959> have<00:00:04.879> natural

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:05.899 
about robots that have natural

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:08.990 
about robots that have natural
human-like<00:00:06.899> behaviors<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.859> so<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.700> know<00:00:08.760> one

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
human-like behaviors and so you know one

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.589 
human-like behaviors and so you know one
reason<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.929> do<00:00:10.080> that<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:11.730> think<00:00:11.759> that

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
reason to do that is that we think that

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.250 
reason to do that is that we think that
robots<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.980> have<00:00:14.780> that<00:00:15.780> meet<00:00:15.929> people's

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
robots that have that meet people's

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.140 
robots that have that meet people's
social<00:00:16.650> expectations<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.460> terms<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.850> their

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
social expectations in terms of their

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.720 
social expectations in terms of their
natural<00:00:18.720> behavior<00:00:19.529> would<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.189> easier<00:00:20.670> for

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
natural behavior would be easier for

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.060 
natural behavior would be easier for
people<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.180> understand<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.199> understand<00:00:22.980> how

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
people to understand and understand how

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.340 
people to understand and understand how
to<00:00:23.130> approach<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.600> understand<00:00:25.199> how<00:00:25.320> to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
to approach and and understand how to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.170 
to approach and and understand how to
interact<00:00:25.769> with<00:00:25.830> okay<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.670> for<00:00:27.090> this

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
interact with okay so for this

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.519 
interact with okay so for this
particular<00:00:27.510> motion<00:00:27.960> going<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.170> see<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.380> robot

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
particular motion going to see the robot

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.679 
particular motion going to see the robot
pick<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.130> box<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.730> there's<00:00:29.849> no<00:00:30.000> context

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
pick up a box and there's no context

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.440 
pick up a box and there's no context
there's<00:00:30.840> no<00:00:30.990> box<00:00:31.230> obviously<00:00:31.969> but<00:00:32.969> one<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
there's no box obviously but one of the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.940 
there's no box obviously but one of the
things<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.899> people<00:00:34.110> responded<00:00:34.739> more

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
things that people responded more

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.280 
things that people responded more
favorably<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> human-like<00:00:36.300> motion<00:00:36.780> was

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
favorably to the human-like motion was

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.440 
favorably to the human-like motion was
that<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:38.370> can<00:00:38.550> fill<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:38.910> some<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.300> details

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
that you can fill in some of the details

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.010 
that you can fill in some of the details
that<00:00:39.989> are<00:00:40.230> missing<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.770> original<00:00:41.309> motion

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
that are missing in the original motion

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.380 
that are missing in the original motion
with<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.469> human-like<00:00:44.100> motion<00:00:44.579> simply

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
with the human-like motion simply

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.610 
with the human-like motion simply
because<00:00:45.600> that's<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> things<00:00:46.469> that

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
because that's one of the things that

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.220 
because that's one of the things that
our<00:00:46.739> algorithm<00:00:47.160> buys<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.690> when<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.020> motion

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
our algorithm buys you when the motion

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.910 
our algorithm buys you when the motion
was<00:00:49.590> more<00:00:49.829> human-like<00:00:51.230> human<00:00:52.230> beings<00:00:52.680> were

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
was more human-like human beings were

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.840 
was more human-like human beings were
able<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.480> watch<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.809> motion<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.850> perceive

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
able to watch the motion and perceive

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.450 
able to watch the motion and perceive
what<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.449> robot<00:00:57.960> was<00:00:58.170> doing<00:00:58.559> more<00:00:58.949> easily

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
what the robot was doing more easily

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.689 
what the robot was doing more easily
they<00:01:00.000> were<00:01:00.059> able<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.600> recognize<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.699> label

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
they were able to recognize and label

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.660 
they were able to recognize and label
the<00:01:02.969> motion<00:01:03.420> more<00:01:03.840> accurately<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> field

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the motion more accurately for the field

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.580 
the motion more accurately for the field
of<00:01:05.880> human<00:01:06.180> robot<00:01:06.450> interaction<00:01:06.479> what's<00:01:07.350> really

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
of human robot interaction what's really

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.240 
of human robot interaction what's really
interesting<00:01:07.770> about<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:10.250> typically

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
interesting about this is that typically

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.880 
interesting about this is that typically
we<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.060> don't<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> lot<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.930> metrics<00:01:13.500> or

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
we so we don't have a lot of metrics or

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.030 
we so we don't have a lot of metrics or
quantitative<00:01:14.850> things<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.420> say<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:16.590> one

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
quantitative things to say that one

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.580 
quantitative things to say that one
particular<00:01:17.670> robot<00:01:18.330> motion<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.840> more<00:01:19.140> or<00:01:19.530> less

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
particular robot motion is more or less

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.670 
particular robot motion is more or less
human-like<00:01:20.520> than<00:01:20.850> another<00:01:21.350> it's<00:01:22.350> it's

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
human-like than another it's it's

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.370 
human-like than another it's it's
typically<00:01:23.220> been<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:24.270> judgment<00:01:24.659> calls<00:01:25.110> so

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
typically been just judgment calls so

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.980 
typically been just judgment calls so
you<00:01:25.470> can<00:01:25.650> get<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.220> group<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.909> people<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.750> watch

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you can get a group of people to watch

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.800 
you can get a group of people to watch
your<00:01:28.350> robot<00:01:28.950> behave<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.150> different<00:01:30.180> ways<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
your robot behave in different ways and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.569 
your robot behave in different ways and
say<00:01:30.990> oh<00:01:31.200> yeah<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:31.890> liked<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.549> better

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
say oh yeah we liked that one better

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.850 
say oh yeah we liked that one better
than<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.119> one<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.990> what<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.350> does<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
than that one and so what this does is

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.350 
than that one and so what this does is
it<00:01:34.979> gives<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> quantitative<00:01:35.850> metric

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
it gives you a quantitative metric

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.039 
it gives you a quantitative metric
rather<00:01:36.600> than<00:01:36.840> relying<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.439> people<00:01:37.680> giving<00:01:38.549> you

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
rather than relying on people giving you

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.179 
rather than relying on people giving you
their<00:01:40.490> there's<00:01:41.490> their<00:01:42.270> judgment<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:44.040> so

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
their there's their judgment and and so

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.550 
their there's their judgment and and so
then<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.430> can<00:01:44.579> use<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:45.200> additionally<00:01:46.200> now

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
then you can use that additionally now

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.770 
then you can use that additionally now
that<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.979> have<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> quantitative<00:01:47.970> metric<00:01:48.360> you

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
that you have a quantitative metric you

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.380 
that you have a quantitative metric you
can<00:01:48.810> use<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.740> optimizing<00:01:50.520> behavior<00:01:51.180> so

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
can use that for optimizing behavior so

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.179 
can use that for optimizing behavior so
you<00:01:51.420> can<00:01:51.570> use<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.140> generating<00:01:52.680> lifelike

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
you can use that for generating lifelike

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.749 
you can use that for generating lifelike
behavior<00:01:53.700> rather<00:01:54.420> than<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:55.759> evaluating

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
behavior rather than just evaluating

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.540 
behavior rather than just evaluating
lifelike<00:01:57.119> behavior
