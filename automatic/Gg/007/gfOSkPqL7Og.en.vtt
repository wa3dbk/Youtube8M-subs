it's<00:00:30.990> not<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> bat<00:00:31.320> big<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.619> deal<00:00:31.910> so<00:00:32.910> today

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
it's not a bat big of a deal so today

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.260 
it's not a bat big of a deal so today
that<00:00:34.620> short<00:00:34.890> block<00:00:35.100> didn't<00:00:35.520> drop<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.940> slid<00:00:36.149> up

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
that short block didn't drop and slid up

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.590 
that short block didn't drop and slid up
underneath<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:37.320> key<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:38.550> extremely<00:00:39.329> well

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
underneath this key to go extremely well

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.380 
underneath this key to go extremely well
or<00:00:39.840> extremely<00:00:40.320> bad<00:00:40.760> stay<00:00:41.760> tuned<00:00:42.000> see<00:00:42.210> how<00:00:42.270> it

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
or extremely bad stay tuned see how it

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.250 
or extremely bad stay tuned see how it
works<00:00:43.820> so<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> realized<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.600> video<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.020> kind

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
works so I realized this video is kind

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.959 
works so I realized this video is kind
of<00:00:46.320> short<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:46.770> frankly<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:47.579> one<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.879> those

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
of short but frankly it's one of those

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.139 
of short but frankly it's one of those
sentences<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:49.280> well<00:00:50.280> sometimes<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:50.910> got

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
sentences of well sometimes I just got

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.650 
sentences of well sometimes I just got
to<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:51.300> work<00:00:51.449> done<00:00:53.210> nothing<00:00:54.210> really<00:00:54.360> special

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
to get work done nothing really special

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.020 
to get work done nothing really special
just<00:00:55.079> under<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> bolts<00:00:55.949> under<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> mounts

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
just under the bolts under the mounts

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.630 
just under the bolts under the mounts
motor<00:00:57.480> drops<00:00:57.750> down<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.489> can

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
motor drops down and then you can

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.189 
motor drops down and then you can
actually<00:00:59.760> slide<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.359> through<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.690> wheel<00:01:00.930> well

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
actually slide it through the wheel well

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.189 
actually slide it through the wheel well
as<00:01:02.100> long<00:01:02.280> as<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.629> drive<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> car<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.049> little

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
as long as you drive the car up a little

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.899 
as long as you drive the car up a little
bit<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.680> that's<00:01:05.460> all<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.610> went<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.880> here

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
bit so that's all that went on here

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.359 
bit so that's all that went on here
nothing<00:01:06.510> special<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:09.500> that<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.920> end<00:01:11.130> for

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.710 
the car but if that one bolt and then
fully<00:03:07.010> assembled<00:03:07.489> let's<00:03:08.239> drop<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.629> entire

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
fully assembled let's drop the entire

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.589 
fully assembled let's drop the entire
thing<00:03:09.109> in<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.530> single<00:03:09.769> unit<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.480> then<00:03:11.480> it

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
thing in and the single unit and then it

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.119 
thing in and the single unit and then it
should<00:03:11.840> be<00:03:11.900> even<00:03:12.769> plug<00:03:13.099> and<00:03:13.250> play<00:03:13.370> off<00:03:13.489> of<00:03:13.519> that

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
should be even plug and play off of that

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.750 
should be even plug and play off of that
that's<00:03:16.129> a<00:03:16.310> three

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
that's a three

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.879 
that's a three
stay<00:03:17.419> tuned<00:03:17.659> the<00:03:18.760> again<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:20.510> other<00:03:20.629> part

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
stay tuned the again the other part

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:26.200 
stay tuned the again the other part
we'll<00:03:21.889> pick<00:03:22.040> up<00:03:22.129> our<00:03:22.340> boat<00:03:22.599> cool<00:03:23.599> see<00:03:24.019> that
