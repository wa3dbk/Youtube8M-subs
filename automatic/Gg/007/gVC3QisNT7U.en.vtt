00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.059

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.400
 factories have ever done rely on 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:38.399
 Did you trust them or explain the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:40.170
 story is just the following did not have well 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.070
 I just found out what it was. 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.230
 plate 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.770
 The tip for you guys is there is a method 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.100
 widely used by most users 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.410
 android factory restore 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.210
 your android device 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.160
 it is used in two moments 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.469
 usually first with android is 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.809
 very slow with my record a video 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.320
 How to do this is very simple. 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.220
 It's no secret, it 's too slow. 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.200
 very heavy very application is restores 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.790
 starts from scratch 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.060
 the first tip and the second is if 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.770
 you will sell your smartphone 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.270
 You do before going through another one. 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.610
 person is reserve and restore the patterns 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.280
 so that other people do not 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:39.770
 have access to your password 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:43.680
 photographs in personal data some 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.890
 there is a some research that 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.180
 indicate that this is not 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.270
 enough 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.780
 is not secure and your data may fall 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.320
 in the wrong hands because you trusted pure 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.189
 and simply luno in the restoration of 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.549
 factory 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.040
 Yes, according to these surveys, the problem 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.990
 is in flash memory 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:13.200
 this flash memory she is 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:16.900
 Let's put it this way the flash memory is 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.940
 responsible for saying that when you 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.370
 restore factory defaults 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.730
 those data were erased so that 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.120
 new data can be entered by sim 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.910
 What happens is that these data 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.700
 should have been deleted were not 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.030
 erased and other data are recorded by 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.600
 data not erased right and 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.200
 there with some programs and applications 22 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.819
 other people have been able to access 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.250
 [Music] 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:52.420
 using multiple methods could not have 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:57.120
 access to photos of men in olza 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.590
 password is conversations that are the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.670
 catalogs registered in your 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.930
 smartphone 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.650
 Then you ask me what to do as well. 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:13.120
 I'm here for this tip 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:16.230
 You 're going to have it when you go. 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.200
 do what you will to reverse you are 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:24.489
 restore factory defaults is OK 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:29.040
 What are you going to do before you run into 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:33.730
 settings will look for the 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:38.709
 within the security option 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:42.250
 Are you going to encrypt your phone? 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.850
 function is that she goes from the neighborhood and 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:50.950
 that you put a powder that preferably 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:54.970
 an 18-in-18-letter giant because the 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.910
 what is it used to do to reset the 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.970
 the smartphone if you were not 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.459
 reserved goes in you want to increase 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.620
 your screen with every time you start 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.330
 he hung up his cell phone and called 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.720
 new 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:13.500
 to ask for that anp password at the bank 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.470
 nÃ© number then prevents other people 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.810
 have access to powders is right here the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.519
 sensitive data is all mixed up and 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.600
 those data can not be 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.280
 then extracted when you enter 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.490
 before running 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.430
 if someone tries these processes to 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.630
 access this data in these circus and its 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:40.080
 father will not succeed or will require 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:43.290
 a force for such and a lot of money in the 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.390
 investment for us most 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.240
 Brazilians still do not win this 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:52.650
 investment all right 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.980
 understood now will make you go in 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.100
 encryption security settings 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.710
 encryptor phone because a password 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.230
 giant reserves 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:09.270
 so you'll be relaxed and photos 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.210
 files that are very sensitive 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.730
 personal passwords for accessing the most 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.760
 applications will not be in 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:20.930
 beauty mistakes and I hope I have helped 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.930
 big hug
