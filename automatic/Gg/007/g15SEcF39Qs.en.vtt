00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
now is I'm running the second main on

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.300 
now is I'm running the second main on
the<00:00:21.779> left<00:00:22.020> side<00:00:22.640> okay<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.880> I'm<00:00:24.600> going<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.310> hold

gonna<00:03:08.390> take<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.660> starting<00:03:09.200> clamp<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:11.239> clamp<00:03:11.570> it

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
gonna take a starting clamp you clamp it

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.590 
gonna take a starting clamp you clamp it
on<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.930> outside<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.370> frame<00:03:13.670> on<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.390> top

on the outside of the frame on the top
cross<00:03:17.799> and<00:03:18.799> then<00:03:19.100> is<00:03:19.190> going<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.459> pull<00:03:19.670> tension

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
cross and then is going to pull tension

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.080 
cross and then is going to pull tension
on<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:21.110> top<00:03:21.320> cross<00:03:21.680> against<00:03:22.459> this<00:03:22.610> starting

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.039 
okay the reason I left this top cross on
here<00:04:14.670> is<00:04:16.880> my<00:04:17.880> string<00:04:18.209> bid<00:04:18.510> is<00:04:18.690> going<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:18.900> be<00:04:19.019> a

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
here is my string bid is going to be a

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.680 
here is my string bid is going to be a
little<00:04:19.260> stiffer<00:04:19.769> this<00:04:19.980> way<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.670> because<00:04:21.510> my

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
little stiffer this way and because my

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.350 
little stiffer this way and because my
string<00:04:22.049> bed<00:04:22.350> is<00:04:22.740> stiffer<00:04:23.190> it's<00:04:23.850> going<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.150> hold

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
string bed is stiffer it's going to hold

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.560 
string bed is stiffer it's going to hold
my<00:04:24.890> Mane's<00:04:25.890> in<00:04:26.220> place<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.490> little<00:04:26.790> better<00:04:27.090> when

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
my Mane's in place a little better when

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.270 
my Mane's in place a little better when
it<00:04:27.660> holds<00:04:27.960> my<00:04:28.080> Mane's<00:04:28.350> in<00:04:28.770> place<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.040> little

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
it holds my Mane's in place a little

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.600 
it holds my Mane's in place a little
better<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.970> have<00:04:30.540> a<00:04:30.570> lot<00:04:30.810> less<00:04:31.050> drawback<00:04:31.740> when<00:04:32.580> I

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
better I have a lot less drawback when I

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.070 
better I have a lot less drawback when I
release<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.210> tension<00:04:33.450> than<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:33.960> do<00:04:34.400> if<00:04:35.400> I

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
release the tension than I do if I

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.840 
release the tension than I do if I
didn't<00:04:37.080> have<00:04:37.350> this<00:04:37.710> string<00:04:38.070> bed<00:04:38.310> nice<00:04:38.580> and

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
didn't have this string bed nice and

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.350 
didn't have this string bed nice and
stiff<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:40.169> now<00:04:40.380> what<00:04:40.590> I'm<00:04:40.680> doing<00:04:40.710> is<00:04:41.250> I'm<00:04:42.090> tying

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
stiff so now what I'm doing is I'm tying

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.590 
stiff so now what I'm doing is I'm tying
off<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.870> top<00:04:43.050> cross<00:04:43.380> and<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.910> main<00:04:45.090> reason<00:04:45.480> I

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
off the top cross and the main reason I

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.570 
off the top cross and the main reason I
waited<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:46.080> tie<00:04:46.260> it<00:04:46.320> off<00:04:46.560> just<00:04:47.070> to<00:04:47.250> get<00:04:47.430> that

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
waited to tie it off just to get that

00:04:47.580 --> 00:05:04.610 
waited to tie it off just to get that
stiffer<00:04:47.970> string<00:04:48.360> bed<00:05:01.460> there<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.550> go<00:05:03.440> hold<00:05:04.440> on

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
stiffer string bed there you go hold on

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.360 
stiffer string bed there you go hold on
except<00:05:05.070> for<00:05:05.100> cutting<00:05:05.520> off<00:05:05.640> this<00:05:05.880> table
