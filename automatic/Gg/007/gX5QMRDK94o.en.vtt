that would be pretty cool possibly i'm

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.810 
that would be pretty cool possibly i'm
actually<00:02:18.750> thinking<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:19.950> may<00:02:20.340> come<00:02:20.670> out

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
actually thinking that this may come out

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.000 
actually thinking that this may come out
with<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.060> iphone<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.540> next<00:02:21.720> feature<00:02:22.010> adobe

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
with the iphone the next feature adobe

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.940 
with the iphone the next feature adobe
flash<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.720> millions<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.500> sites<00:02:25.710> that

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
flash this is millions of sites that

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.240 
flash this is millions of sites that
just<00:02:26.730> don't<00:02:26.880> work<00:02:27.000> on<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.510> iphone<00:02:28.070> it<00:02:29.070> would

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
just don't work on the iphone it would

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.210 
just don't work on the iphone it would
make<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.460> a<00:02:29.580> lot<00:02:29.610> easier<00:02:29.970> if<00:02:30.270> they<00:02:30.390> just<00:02:30.540> had<00:02:30.810> it

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
make it a lot easier if they just had it

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.440 
make it a lot easier if they just had it
so<00:02:32.220> hopefully<00:02:32.670> they<00:02:33.000> had<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:35.180> also<00:02:36.180> more

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
so hopefully they had it also more

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.870 
so hopefully they had it also more
control<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.810> guess<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.650> still<00:02:38.250> usually<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:38.850> I

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
control I guess I still usually so I

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.760 
control I guess I still usually so I
don't<00:02:39.030> know<00:02:39.090> why<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.270> do<00:02:39.600> this<00:02:39.780> but<00:02:40.140> just

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
don't know why you do this but just

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.910 
don't know why you do this but just
removing<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.760> stock<00:02:42.090> apps<00:02:42.480> if<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.930> wanted<00:02:43.290> to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.090 

next<00:02:46.920> improve<00:02:47.400> file<00:02:47.790> management<00:02:48.240> um<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:49.230> would

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
next improve file management um I would

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.130 
next improve file management um I would
actually<00:02:50.190> like<00:02:50.490> this<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.730> lot<00:02:50.820> it's<00:02:51.300> basically

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
actually like this a lot it's basically

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.860 
actually like this a lot it's basically
if<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:53.160> could<00:02:53.340> like<00:02:53.640> finder<00:02:54.090> on<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.240> Mac<00:02:54.480> right

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
if you could like finder on a Mac right

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.410 
if you could like finder on a Mac right
here<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.800> browse<00:02:56.010> all<00:02:56.280> your<00:02:56.430> files<00:02:56.610> um<00:02:57.060> if

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
here you can browse all your files um if

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.060 
here you can browse all your files um if
they<00:02:57.570> added<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.200> iphone<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.920> could

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
they added that to the iphone you could

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.920 
they added that to the iphone you could
just<00:02:59.160> download<00:02:59.370> files<00:02:59.880> wherever<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:00.510> wanted

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
just download files wherever you wanted

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.370 
just download files wherever you wanted
make<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.560> lot<00:03:01.860> easier<00:03:02.100> arm<00:03:02.900> just<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.140> much

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
make a lot easier arm just so much

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.080 
make a lot easier arm just so much
better<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:05.040> could<00:03:05.370> store<00:03:05.640> basically

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
better you could store basically

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.950 
better you could store basically
anything<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.750> want<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.170> on<00:03:07.290> your<00:03:07.440> iPhone<00:03:08.960> the

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
anything you want and on your iPhone the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.090 
anything you want and on your iPhone the
next<00:03:10.200> feature<00:03:10.320> that<00:03:10.650> might<00:03:10.830> be<00:03:10.980> available

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
next feature that might be available

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.890 
next feature that might be available
that<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:11.700> actually<00:03:11.940> think<00:03:12.210> is<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.480> second<00:03:12.840> most

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
that I actually think is the second most

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.800 
that I actually think is the second most
likely<00:03:13.290> feature<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:13.830> improved<00:03:14.220> mail<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:14.810> think

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
likely feature is improved mail I think

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.390 
likely feature is improved mail I think
because<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:16.290> ipad<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.800> might<00:03:16.950> improve<00:03:17.190> the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
because the ipad that might improve the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.210 
because the ipad that might improve the
design<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.970> also<00:03:18.090> give<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.540> universal<00:03:19.290> inbox

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
design and also give a universal inbox

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.130 
design and also give a universal inbox
so<00:03:20.790> have<00:03:20.970> if<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.210> had<00:03:21.360> like<00:03:21.510> four<00:03:21.780> email

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
so have if you had like four email

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.360 
so have if you had like four email
account<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:22.650> can<00:03:22.740> read<00:03:22.980> all<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.340> emails

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
account so you can read all the emails

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.170 
account so you can read all the emails
in<00:03:23.910> one<00:03:24.770> thing<00:03:25.770> it'd<00:03:26.100> be<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.430> lot<00:03:26.610> easier<00:03:26.670> one

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
in one thing it'd be a lot easier one

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.030 
in one thing it'd be a lot easier one
inbox<00:03:27.330> um<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.680> think<00:03:28.830> that's<00:03:29.190> very<00:03:29.250> likely<00:03:31.040> next

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
inbox um I think that's very likely next

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.250 
inbox um I think that's very likely next
if<00:03:32.370> they<00:03:32.580> automatically<00:03:33.390> built<00:03:33.720> in<00:03:33.870> social

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
if they automatically built in social

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.930 
if they automatically built in social
networking<00:03:34.680> like<00:03:34.830> Facebook<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.340> MySpace<00:03:35.520> I

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
networking like Facebook and MySpace I

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.370 
networking like Facebook and MySpace I
doubt<00:03:36.270> they<00:03:36.480> will<00:03:36.630> do<00:03:36.810> this<00:03:36.990> because<00:03:37.140> there's

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
doubt they will do this because there's

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.050 
doubt they will do this because there's
already<00:03:37.470> apps<00:03:37.770> for<00:03:38.070> that<00:03:38.190> but<00:03:38.550> I'm<00:03:38.790> not<00:03:38.970> really

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
already apps for that but I'm not really

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.900 
already apps for that but I'm not really
looking<00:03:39.270> forward<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:40.160> power<00:03:41.160> scheduling

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
looking forward to it power scheduling

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.300 
looking forward to it power scheduling
that<00:03:42.240> would<00:03:42.420> be<00:03:42.570> very<00:03:42.990> nice<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.770> blackberries

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
that would be very nice the blackberries

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.730 
that would be very nice the blackberries
already<00:03:44.580> have<00:03:44.820> it<00:03:45.000> as<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.480> says<00:03:45.690> here<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:46.560> can

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
already have it as it says here you can

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.620 
already have it as it says here you can
it's<00:03:47.070> kind<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:47.640> like<00:03:47.730> power<00:03:47.970> management<00:03:48.360> on<00:03:48.570> a

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
it's kind of like power management on a

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.500 
it's kind of like power management on a
Mac<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:49.050> can<00:03:49.200> automatically<00:03:49.710> war<00:03:50.550> pc<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.480> can

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
Mac you can automatically war pc you can

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.570 
Mac you can automatically war pc you can
automatically<00:03:52.080> determine<00:03:53.040> when<00:03:53.190> your<00:03:53.340> thing

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
they add this to the iPhone because I

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.320 
they add this to the iPhone because I
would<00:04:16.920> like<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.250> read<00:04:17.400> books<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.880> currently<00:04:18.120> use

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
would like to read books I currently use

would like to read books I currently use
the<00:04:18.540> app<00:04:18.660> stanza<00:04:19.350> it's<00:04:19.650> pretty<00:04:19.920> good<00:04:20.130> you

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
the app stanza it's pretty good you

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.610 
the app stanza it's pretty good you
could<00:04:20.430> check<00:04:20.790> it<00:04:20.940> out<00:04:21.090> but<00:04:21.660> Apple<00:04:22.020> stock<00:04:22.350> apps

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
could check it out but Apple stock apps

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.890 
could check it out but Apple stock apps
are<00:04:22.800> always<00:04:23.040> much<00:04:23.220> better<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.730> also<00:04:24.660> the

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
are always much better and also the

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.020 
are always much better and also the
design<00:04:25.230> just<00:04:25.740> needs<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:26.130> make<00:04:26.280> it<00:04:26.400> easier

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
design just needs to make it easier

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.730 
design just needs to make it easier
I<00:04:27.120> don't<00:04:27.840> really<00:04:27.930> agree<00:04:28.230> with<00:04:28.410> this<00:04:28.500> I<00:04:28.680> think

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
I don't really agree with this I think

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.200 
I don't really agree with this I think
it's<00:04:28.950> pretty<00:04:29.070> good<00:04:29.310> as<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.639> is<00:04:29.730> now<00:04:29.880> but<00:04:30.150> I

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
it's pretty good as it is now but I

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.110 
it's pretty good as it is now but I
guess<00:04:30.480> that's<00:04:30.510> another<00:04:30.900> option<00:04:33.740> so<00:04:34.740> guys

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
guess that's another option so guys

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.670 
guess that's another option so guys
overall<00:04:36.120> this<00:04:36.330> was<00:04:36.389> just<00:04:36.720> a<00:04:36.840> general<00:04:37.230> rundown

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
overall this was just a general rundown

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.890 
overall this was just a general rundown
of<00:04:37.710> what<00:04:38.100> the<00:04:38.220> iphone<00:04:38.639> OS<00:04:38.850> four<00:04:39.300> point<00:04:39.570> will<00:04:39.870> be

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
like hopefully they I think it's most

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.970 
like hopefully they I think it's most
likely<00:04:43.470> they'll<00:04:43.830> include<00:04:44.040> multitasking<00:04:44.970> and

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
likely they'll include multitasking and
