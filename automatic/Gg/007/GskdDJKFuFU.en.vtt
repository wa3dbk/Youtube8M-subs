video I think it's like 30 minutes very
split<00:01:28.530> up<00:01:28.650> like<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:28.979> 24<00:01:29.490> hours<00:01:29.520> sped<00:01:29.939> up<00:01:30.060> you

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180

again<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.380> matrix<00:01:52.710> P<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.250> can

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
again in that matrix P you know we can

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.020 
again in that matrix P you know we can
figure<00:01:53.850> out<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.180> XP<00:01:54.750> per<00:01:55.470> hour<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.979> believe<00:01:56.219> in

the<00:01:57.450> normal<00:01:57.780> runescape<00:01:58.680> people<00:01:58.860> take<00:01:59.040> that

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the normal runescape people take that

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.920 
the normal runescape people take that
for<00:01:59.430> eventual<00:01:59.820> log<00:01:59.939> days<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.509> share<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.840> on

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
for eventual log days and share it on

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.020 
for eventual log days and share it on
your<00:02:01.140> total<00:02:01.560> experiment<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.430> I'm<00:02:02.579> not<00:02:02.909> too

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
your total experiment that I'm not too

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.850 
your total experiment that I'm not too
sure<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:04.020> some<00:02:04.229> kind<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.469> where<00:02:04.619> stuff

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
sure but in some kind of where stuff

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.910 
sure but in some kind of where stuff
like<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.159> basically<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:06.030> pretty<00:02:06.180> cool

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
like that basically so it's pretty cool

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.350 
like that basically so it's pretty cool
something<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.220> check<00:02:08.399> up<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.640> guess<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:08.970> kind<00:02:09.209> of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
something to check up I guess we kind of

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.420 
something to check up I guess we kind of
just<00:02:09.539> fun<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:09.929> your<00:02:10.229> own<00:02:10.289> sake<00:02:10.619> II<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.800> guess

world<00:03:34.820> basically<00:03:35.299> so<00:03:35.840> I<00:03:35.870> think<00:03:36.079> you<00:03:36.290> mentioned

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
world basically so I think you mentioned

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.050 
world basically so I think you mentioned
that<00:03:36.709> at<00:03:36.890> one<00:03:37.010> time<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.220> gained<00:03:37.579> and<00:03:37.820> one<00:03:37.910> wheel

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
that at one time I gained and one wheel

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.849 
that at one time I gained and one wheel
in<00:03:38.269> fishing<00:03:38.600> spin<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.930> day<00:03:39.200> which<00:03:39.350> am<00:03:39.470> prepared

in fishing spin a day which am prepared

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.860 
in fishing spin a day which am prepared
of<00:03:40.010> which<00:03:40.670> means<00:03:40.850> that<00:03:41.150> I'm<00:03:41.510> most<00:03:41.660> likely

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
of which means that I'm most likely

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.470 
of which means that I'm most likely
going<00:03:42.079> to<00:03:42.140> be<00:03:42.230> able<00:03:42.380> to<00:03:42.560> get<00:03:42.829> 98<00:03:43.609> fishing<00:03:44.120> some
