the honey next up tamarind we've got the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.870 
the honey next up tamarind we've got the
sweet<00:01:57.660> this<00:01:57.900> is<00:01:58.050> kind<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.410> a<00:01:58.470> sour<00:01:58.880> what

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
sweet this is kind of a sour what

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.060 
sweet this is kind of a sour what
exactly<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:00.360> hammering<00:02:00.660> it's<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.530> paste<00:02:01.830> made

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
exactly it's hammering it's a paste made

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.550 
exactly it's hammering it's a paste made
from<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.550> pod<00:02:02.820> that's<00:02:03.090> very<00:02:03.330> very<00:02:03.480> sour<00:02:03.930> but

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
from a pod that's very very sour but

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.170 
from a pod that's very very sour but
really<00:02:05.520> delicious

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
really delicious

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.460 
really delicious
and<00:02:06.420> then<00:02:06.690> at<00:02:06.780> home<00:02:06.930> you're<00:02:07.140> probably<00:02:07.170> what

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
and then at home you're probably what

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.710 
and then at home you're probably what
about<00:02:07.619> half<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.209> splash<00:02:09.450> that

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
about half of that so if you splash that

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.350 
about half of that so if you splash that
in<00:02:09.840> then<00:02:10.500> what<00:02:10.619> we<00:02:10.740> need<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.979> do<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.910> bring<00:02:12.150> all

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
in then what we need to do is bring all

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.560 
in then what we need to do is bring all
the<00:02:12.600> liquid<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.740> rapid<00:02:14.190> boil<00:02:14.400> over<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.360> high

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
the liquid to a rapid boil over a high

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.030 
the liquid to a rapid boil over a high
heat<00:02:15.600> you'll<00:02:16.080> bring<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.470> back<00:02:16.740> up<00:02:16.920> to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
heat you'll bring that back up to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.980 
heat you'll bring that back up to
temperature<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:17.700> in<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.450> meantime<00:02:18.630> we<00:02:18.959> can

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
temperature but in the meantime we can

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.930 
temperature but in the meantime we can
put<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.230> lid<00:02:19.440> on<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.620> trap<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.160> all<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.670> steam

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
put a lid on it trap in all of the steam

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.770 
put a lid on it trap in all of the steam
and<00:02:21.450> we<00:02:22.230> leave<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.740> for<00:02:23.100> about<00:02:23.190> ten<00:02:23.610> minutes

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
and we leave that for about ten minutes

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.910 
and we leave that for about ten minutes
so<00:02:24.780> we're<00:02:24.870> going<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.020> in<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.200> meantime<00:02:25.350> make<00:02:25.890> a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
so we're going to in the meantime make a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.070 
so we're going to in the meantime make a
stir<00:02:26.190> fry<00:02:26.220> boom<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.090> clean<00:02:27.300> your<00:02:27.330> board<00:02:27.570> I'll

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
much the only thing gonna have to do is

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.240 
much the only thing gonna have to do is
pull<00:02:35.790> one<00:02:36.030> over<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.360> other<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:37.020> go<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.890> entire

pull one over the other so go the entire

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.180 
pull one over the other so go the entire
kettle<00:02:38.730> completely<00:02:39.240> submerge<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:40.190> perfect

kettle completely submerge it perfect

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.830 
kettle completely submerge it perfect
and<00:02:41.340> then<00:02:41.730> we'll<00:02:41.850> leave<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.269> for<00:02:42.330> four<00:02:42.720> or
