00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
everyone what we're looking at is a room

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.510 
everyone what we're looking at is a room
that<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.870> really<00:00:58.170> only<00:00:58.350> going<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.190> size

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
that is really only going to be the size

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.660 
that is really only going to be the size
of<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:01.350> screen<00:01:02.219> we're<00:01:02.940> not<00:01:03.090> we're<00:01:03.719> not<00:01:03.750> moving

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
of the screen we're not we're not moving

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.130 
of the screen we're not we're not moving
any<00:01:05.670> background<00:01:06.000> we're<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.630> we're<00:01:07.110> not

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
any background we're not we're not

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.620 
any background we're not we're not
making<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> room<00:01:08.310> that's<00:01:08.490> larger<00:01:09.000> than<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
making a room that's larger than the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.480 
making a room that's larger than the
visible<00:01:09.780> screen<00:01:10.290> area<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:10.799> can<00:01:11.100> talk<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.460> can

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
visible screen area we can talk we can

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.550 
visible screen area we can talk we can
discuss<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:11.909> later<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> border

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
discuss that later so we have a border

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.020 
discuss that later so we have a border
around<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:14.189> visible<00:01:14.909> room<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:16.700> do<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:17.850> have

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
around this visible room and do we have

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.969 
around this visible room and do we have
to<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.360> anything<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> object<00:01:20.689> that<00:01:21.979> that

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
to do anything to the object that that

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.370 
to do anything to the object that that
is<00:01:23.189> represented<00:01:23.850> there<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.780> will<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
is represented there or will the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.770 
is represented there or will the
behavior<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:26.040> predictable<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.780> objects

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
behavior be predictable the objects

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.640 
behavior be predictable the objects
events<00:01:31.170> are<00:01:31.320> already<00:01:31.920> defined<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.750> I'm<00:01:34.140> we

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
events are already defined so I'm we

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.910 
events are already defined so I'm we
want<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.130> make<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> playable<00:01:36.090> level<00:01:36.450> here<00:01:37.049> and

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.200 

so<00:01:40.970> we'll<00:01:41.970> make<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.750> sort<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.320> maze

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
so we'll make it like a sort of maze

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.990 
so we'll make it like a sort of maze
okay<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.540> um<00:01:46.159> meaning<00:01:47.159> what<00:01:47.640> we're<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:47.909> to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
okay so um meaning what we're going to

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.050 
okay so um meaning what we're going to
do<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:50.149> walls<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.659> need<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.380> be

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
do is have walls that need to be

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.880 
do is have walls that need to be
navigated<00:01:54.060> by<00:01:54.450> by<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.990> player<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.710> little

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
navigated by by the player so the little

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.889 
navigated by by the player so the little
green<00:01:56.040> guy<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.790> move<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.299> try<00:01:57.780> to

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
green guy is going to move and try to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.730 
green guy is going to move and try to
avoid<00:01:58.560> yeah<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.630> the<00:02:00.630> walls<00:02:01.290> he's<00:02:01.530> going<00:02:01.680> to

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
avoid yeah the the walls he's going to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.679 
avoid yeah the the walls he's going to
try<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.920> avoid<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.399> sides<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.000> we're<00:02:03.570> going

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
try to avoid the sides and we're going

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.560 
try to avoid the sides and we're going
to<00:02:03.750> set<00:02:03.930> up<00:02:04.020> some<00:02:04.140> walls<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.000> his<00:02:06.000> bad<00:02:06.240> stuff

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
to set up some walls and his bad stuff

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.419 
to set up some walls and his bad stuff
going<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> happen<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.110> him<00:02:07.229> if<00:02:07.290> he<00:02:07.439> hits<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
going to happen to him if he hits the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.930 
going to happen to him if he hits the
walls<00:02:08.789> or<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.090> sides<00:02:09.360> um<00:02:10.459> that<00:02:11.459> would<00:02:11.640> make<00:02:11.910> it

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
walls or the sides um that would make it

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.449 
walls or the sides um that would make it
pretty<00:02:12.450> difficult<00:02:12.660> but<00:02:13.379> we<00:02:14.010> can<00:02:14.220> make<00:02:14.430> that

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
pretty difficult but we can make that

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.910 
pretty difficult but we can make that
well<00:02:15.120> or<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.750> good<00:02:16.020> stuff<00:02:16.230> going<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.530> happen<00:02:16.800> if

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
objects zero and object to the point

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.320 
objects zero and object to the point
object<00:06:47.840> yes<00:06:48.620> that<00:06:48.950> applies<00:06:49.430> to<00:06:49.460> that<00:06:49.910> specific

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
one if we do object object to that would

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.810 
one if we do object object to that would
destroy<00:06:57.710> every<00:06:58.490> single<00:06:58.880> coin<00:06:59.750> object<00:07:00.590> in<00:07:01.400> the

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.020 
because every time he gets a point the

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.750 
because every time he gets a point the
point<00:07:48.440> object<00:07:48.650> will<00:07:48.950> go<00:07:49.070> away<00:07:49.190> let's<00:07:49.520> see<00:07:49.670> how
