wore them down a little bit but I think
after<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:05.080> second<00:05:05.860> half<00:05:05.890> we<00:05:06.190> came<00:05:06.370> out<00:05:06.580> stone

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
after the second half we came out stone

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.940 
after the second half we came out stone
again<00:05:07.840> they're<00:05:08.110> not<00:05:08.200> going<00:05:08.350> back<00:05:08.500> they<00:05:08.800> got
