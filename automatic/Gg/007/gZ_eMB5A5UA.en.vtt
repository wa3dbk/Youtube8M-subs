to<00:04:09.510> create<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.840> classification<00:04:10.320> for<00:04:10.980> players

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
to create a classification for players

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.860 
to create a classification for players
who<00:04:11.400> were<00:04:11.610> here<00:04:12.000> when<00:04:12.150> we<00:04:12.300> implemented<00:04:12.810> the

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
who were here when we implemented the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.320 
who were here when we implemented the
rule<00:04:13.020> we<00:04:13.380> didn't<00:04:13.650> want<00:04:13.800> them<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:13.950> sort<00:04:14.459> of<00:04:14.520> be

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
rule we didn't want them to sort of be

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.360 
rule we didn't want them to sort of be
here's<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.600> rule<00:04:15.780> exactly<00:04:16.410> out<00:04:17.010> here<00:04:17.160> right

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
here's the rule exactly out here right

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.640 
here's the rule exactly out here right
so<00:04:17.910> we<00:04:18.000> wanted<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.270> make<00:04:18.720> sure<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:19.020> there<00:04:19.200> had

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
so we wanted to make sure that there had

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.590 
so we wanted to make sure that there had
local<00:04:20.070> options<00:04:20.549> and<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.180> last<00:04:21.359> day<00:04:21.510> are

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
local options and the last day are

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.909 
local options and the last day are
non-residents<00:04:21.960> or<00:04:22.290> international<00:04:22.740> players

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
non-residents or international players

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.230 
non-residents or international players
that<00:04:23.100> come<00:04:23.190> over<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.640> they<00:04:23.880> haven't<00:04:24.180> been

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
that come over and they haven't been

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.630 
that come over and they haven't been
here<00:04:24.390> for<00:04:24.570> 24<00:04:24.960> months<00:04:25.140> and<00:04:25.950> so<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.250> rule<00:04:26.370> as<00:04:26.490> it

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
here for 24 months and so the rule as it

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.640 
here for 24 months and so the rule as it
states<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.419> was<00:04:27.510> a

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
states and it was a

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.070 
states and it was a
little<00:04:27.889> bit<00:04:28.070> wordy<00:04:28.699> here<00:04:29.000> but<00:04:29.180> you<00:04:29.780> can<00:04:29.810> have

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
little bit wordy here but you can have

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.930 
little bit wordy here but you can have
up<00:04:30.259> to<00:04:30.290> two<00:04:30.650> exempt<00:04:31.040> non-residents<00:04:31.580> I'm<00:04:31.759> sorry

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
up to two exempt non-residents I'm sorry

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.860 
up to two exempt non-residents I'm sorry
you<00:04:32.000> can<00:04:32.090> have<00:04:32.210> as<00:04:32.300> many<00:04:32.449> exempt

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
you can have as many exempt

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.300 
you can have as many exempt
non-residents<00:04:33.380> on<00:04:33.470> your<00:04:33.620> team<00:04:33.800> as<00:04:33.919> you<00:04:34.070> want

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
non-residents on your team as you want

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.310 
non-residents on your team as you want
but<00:04:34.910> if<00:04:35.030> you<00:04:35.120> have<00:04:35.240> two<00:04:35.479> or<00:04:35.660> more<00:04:35.840> you<00:04:36.050> can't

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
but if you have two or more you can't

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.050 
but if you have two or more you can't
add<00:04:36.530> any<00:04:36.830> additional<00:04:37.039> non-resident<00:04:37.850> players

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
add any additional non-resident players

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.879 
add any additional non-resident players
because<00:04:38.539> we<00:04:38.660> want<00:04:38.870> that<00:04:39.020> regional<00:04:39.380> identity

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
because we want that regional identity

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.100 
because we want that regional identity
to<00:04:40.190> remain<00:04:40.430> intact<00:04:40.789> on<00:04:40.970> the<00:04:41.120> team<00:04:41.330> but<00:04:42.020> where

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
to remain intact on the team but where

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.150 
to remain intact on the team but where
it<00:04:42.169> breaks<00:04:42.320> down<00:04:42.470> a<00:04:42.590> little<00:04:42.740> bit<00:04:42.860> is<00:04:43.009> what

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
it breaks down a little bit is what

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.770 
it breaks down a little bit is what
happens<00:04:43.340> if<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.520> want<00:04:43.759> it<00:04:44.030> exactly<00:04:44.600> which<00:04:44.720> is

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
happens if you want it exactly which is

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.420 
happens if you want it exactly which is
what<00:04:45.050> happened<00:04:45.320> with<00:04:45.410> team<00:04:45.590> impulse<00:04:45.919> exactly

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
what happened with team impulse exactly

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.279 
what happened with team impulse exactly
so<00:04:46.550> if<00:04:46.639> you<00:04:46.729> have<00:04:46.910> one<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:47.509> not<00:04:47.720> to<00:04:47.990> you<00:04:48.169> can

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
so if you have one and not to you can

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:49.960 
so if you have one and not to you can
actually<00:04:48.410> still<00:04:48.770> add<00:04:48.919> to<00:04:49.250> non-residents<00:04:49.880> on

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
actually still add to non-residents on

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.610 
actually still add to non-residents on
your<00:04:50.090> team<00:04:50.240> which<00:04:50.630> is<00:04:50.750> what<00:04:50.900> Tina<00:04:51.169> pulse<00:04:51.470> is

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
your team which is what Tina pulse is

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.620 
your team which is what Tina pulse is
done<00:04:51.770> but<00:04:52.130> in<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.250> case<00:04:52.370> of<00:04:52.400> TSM<00:04:52.970> they<00:04:53.180> have<00:04:53.360> a

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
done but in the case of TSM they have a

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.420 
done but in the case of TSM they have a
three<00:04:54.229> exempt<00:04:54.650> non-residents<00:04:55.190> so<00:04:55.310> they're

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
three exempt non-residents so they're

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.249 
three exempt non-residents so they're
not<00:04:55.550> allowed<00:04:55.789> to<00:04:55.880> add<00:04:56.030> any<00:04:56.210> non-resident<00:04:56.810> 113

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
not allowed to add any non-resident 113

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.629 
not allowed to add any non-resident 113
all<00:04:57.500> right<00:04:57.620> so<00:04:57.830> it's<00:04:57.860> all<00:04:58.280> well<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.490> good

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
all right so it's all well and good

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.490 
all right so it's all well and good
TSM's<00:04:59.180> got<00:04:59.330> three<00:04:59.570> example<00:04:59.840> on<00:04:59.930> residents<00:05:00.350> and

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
TSM's got three example on residents and

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.439 
TSM's got three example on residents and

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
before we make a decision in some cases

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.839 
before we make a decision in some cases
you<00:05:33.410> know<00:05:33.500> teams<00:05:33.889> are<00:05:34.160> willing<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.550> sort<00:05:34.699> of

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
you know teams are willing to sort of

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:36.520 
you know teams are willing to sort of
just<00:05:35.000> give<00:05:35.270> us<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.539> information<00:05:35.570> so<00:05:36.289> that<00:05:36.320> we

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
just give us the information so that we

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.469 
just give us the information so that we
know<00:05:36.770> exactly<00:05:37.070> what's<00:05:37.400> going<00:05:37.490> on<00:05:37.820> and<00:05:38.000> in

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
know exactly what's going on and in

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:39.790 
know exactly what's going on and in
those<00:05:38.570> cases<00:05:38.630> it's<00:05:39.080> easy<00:05:39.229> to<00:05:39.380> make<00:05:39.470> a<00:05:39.530> call<00:05:39.770> but

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
those cases it's easy to make a call but

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.070 
those cases it's easy to make a call but
oftentimes<00:05:40.250> we<00:05:40.610> have<00:05:40.729> to<00:05:40.849> do<00:05:41.000> quite<00:05:41.690> a<00:05:41.750> bit<00:05:41.870> of

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
oftentimes we have to do quite a bit of

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.810 
oftentimes we have to do quite a bit of
digging<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:42.830> that<00:05:43.310> can<00:05:43.430> take<00:05:43.460> a<00:05:43.610> bit<00:05:43.789> longer

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
digging and that can take a bit longer

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.850 
digging and that can take a bit longer
so<00:05:44.210> it's<00:05:44.720> not<00:05:44.900> it's<00:05:45.139> not<00:05:45.199> black<00:05:45.470> and<00:05:45.500> white<00:05:45.650> of

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
so it's not it's not black and white of

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.320 
so it's not it's not black and white of
having<00:05:46.159> an<00:05:46.400> exact<00:05:46.849> amount<00:05:47.090> of<00:05:47.120> time

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
having an exact amount of time

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.060 
having an exact amount of time
absolutely<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.229> next<00:05:48.500> one<00:05:48.620> actually<00:05:48.919> comes

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
absolutely the next one actually comes

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.159 
absolutely the next one actually comes
from<00:05:49.250> Andre<00:05:49.789> who<00:05:50.030> wants<00:05:50.630> to<00:05:50.690> know<00:05:50.840> what<00:05:51.139> are

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
from Andre who wants to know what are

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.500 
from Andre who wants to know what are
your<00:05:51.500> views<00:05:51.680> on<00:05:51.770> discipline<00:05:52.669> in<00:05:52.880> eSports<00:05:53.330> kind

your views on discipline in eSports kind
of<00:05:53.570> a<00:05:53.630> broader<00:05:53.840> question<00:05:54.320> yeah<00:05:54.500> that<00:05:54.680> is<00:05:54.770> it's

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
of a broader question yeah that is it's

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.100 
of a broader question yeah that is it's
pretty<00:05:55.370> high<00:05:55.490> level<00:05:55.520> I<00:05:55.849> think<00:05:56.080> discipline<00:05:57.080> is

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
pretty high level I think discipline is

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.689 
pretty high level I think discipline is
really<00:05:57.409> important<00:05:57.860> at<00:05:58.340> the<00:05:58.400> end<00:05:58.490> of<00:05:58.520> the<00:05:58.610> day

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
really important at the end of the day

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.040 
really important at the end of the day
we<00:05:58.849> want<00:05:59.000> to<00:05:59.060> make<00:05:59.180> sure<00:05:59.210> that<00:05:59.510> everyone's

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
we want to make sure that everyone's

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.620 
we want to make sure that everyone's
playing<00:06:00.349> fair<00:06:00.770> to<00:06:01.669> give<00:06:01.820> everyone<00:06:02.030> an<00:06:02.270> equal

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
playing fair to give everyone an equal

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.750 
playing fair to give everyone an equal
chance<00:06:02.810> at<00:06:03.260> winning<00:06:03.440> and<00:06:04.190> discipline<00:06:04.639> is

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
chance at winning and discipline is

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.189 
chance at winning and discipline is
there<00:06:04.909> to<00:06:05.120> ensure<00:06:05.270> that<00:06:05.599> those<00:06:05.780> things<00:06:05.990> are

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
there to ensure that those things are

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.870
