00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.130
 1 05 in front of 5400 spectators on the Alm a visit almost like in ancient times the 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.170
 Second division from rhineland-palatinate with Steam better start Fabrizio Hayer 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.779
 and clear up after 8 minutes a first warning shot at the goal of Klein 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.800
 you heard right Wolfgang Schneider is still playing 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.509
 Bielefeld's evergreen 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.919
 the Arminia and with new coach and numerous new arrivals disrespectful 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:25.970
 export 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.259
 except the boy 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.259
 the greatest opportunity for the hosts 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.960
 hans-werner Moors new coach of Preußen Münster playing in here 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.950
 his team plays with Bielefeld in the Oberliga Westfalen 0 10 11 after the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.430
 Side changes both teams unchanged but the Arminia in December more 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.510
 play 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.090
 even before the young most dangerous attackers 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.950
 one often only with such attacks to stop 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.570
 for driving is completely right the yellow card for Dieter Schäfer vom 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.570
 faultlessly senior referee 4 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.690
 then an early change at Mainz for the injured Norbert may seem 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.020
 UDV likes to call the 57 minute of play 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.710
 and free kick Bielefeld 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.450
 Jörg Brückner you do not find the gap but the Arminia far advanced 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.450
 remains in possession 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.930
 again Brückner idea in midfield on defender Fuhrberg the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.880
 often go forward 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.480
 Header extension and what a fansite chance of team captain 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.630
 the reason 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.790
 because equal two big mistakes of the Mainz back team spared well 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:34.539
 the young 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.609
 then the referee skillfully continues to play the rain of an animal 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:41.079
 highly deserved 1 0 for the Arminia 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.420
 in the 59 minute 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.420
 and then the hurried head stood 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.800
 the hosts flew by the hit to Zurich with a series under 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.520
 opportunities 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.050
 again, the young has no offside but so slowly go the endurance runner 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.970
 Air out 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.909
 a little later, only the replaced new signing Stefan Studtrucker 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.979
 by expecting much here as a new spear in the game to the celebration 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.899
 best man at 1 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.889
 an excellent technician 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:16.349
 With the flop Wachter his name Pauli the 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.980
 Fritz Teuscher this is the new arminen-coach for three weeks in office 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.299
 and he wished of course a good debut but the guests 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.450
 still dangerous Gerd Lulay, he walks almost unrestrained in the direction 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.469
 Goal here would be a possible extension 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.379
 Reinhard pointed out 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.480
 the Platzherren with flute but also that must be said clearly with the 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.819
 more punchy and better game 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.379
 Despite the many newcomers, the mission was a good combination game 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.679
 Understanding each other 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:51.259
 a piece of butter 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:53.910
 Take a look at the Gurzelen 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.730
 the degree and then there is plenty of work left 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.699
 for the coach 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:01.849
 at Mainz goalkeeper in the spotlight of the last four failures score the powder 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.059
 suddenly appeared before Wolfgang Kneib on 22 players in the Bielefeld 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.930
 half 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.189
 that does not happen every day 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.389
 but it did not help anymore 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.499
 the seconds then melt the final whistle 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:15.610
 one to zero 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.850
 for Arminia Bielefeld so that will be remembered in the next round
