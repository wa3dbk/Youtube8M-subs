00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.640 

all<00:00:23.220> right<00:00:23.430> by<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.699> way<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.510> before<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.289> cut

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
in and listen to some of this audio I

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.710 
in and listen to some of this audio I

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
think that this old guy should be

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720 
think that this old guy should be
suspended<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.710> think<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.489> blow

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
suspended I think it's going to blow

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.940 
suspended I think it's going to blow
over<00:00:32.910> eventually<00:00:33.210> as<00:00:34.050> we've<00:00:34.320> seen<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.800> other

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.040 
over eventually as we've seen in other
cases<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.670> think<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.270> should<00:00:36.450> be<00:00:36.570> suspended

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050

comfortable<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> team<00:00:42.870> should<00:00:43.500> be
