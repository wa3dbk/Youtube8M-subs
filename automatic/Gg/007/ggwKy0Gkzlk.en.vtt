00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
these giant onions but they're at the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
these giant onions but they're at the
point<00:00:38.120> now<00:00:38.300> where<00:00:38.510> they<00:00:38.600> need<00:00:38.750> to<00:00:38.840> be

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
point now where they need to be

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.410 
point now where they need to be
fertilized<00:00:39.410> because<00:00:40.070> they've<00:00:40.280> been<00:00:40.460> in<00:00:40.730> these

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
fertilized because they've been in these

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.270 
fertilized because they've been in these
same<00:00:41.629> pots<00:00:41.870> for<00:00:42.199> a<00:00:42.230> while<00:00:42.379> and<00:00:42.710> they<00:00:43.129> haven't

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
same pots for a while and they haven't

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.890 
same pots for a while and they haven't
been<00:00:43.370> fertilized<00:00:43.850> yet<00:00:44.150> so<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.479> want<00:00:44.720> to<00:00:44.780> start

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
been fertilized yet so you want to start

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.990 
been fertilized yet so you want to start
fertilizing<00:00:45.199> now<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.610> that<00:00:46.790> they<00:00:46.879> can

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
fertilizing now so that they can

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.250 
fertilizing now so that they can
continue<00:00:47.210> their<00:00:47.449> growth<00:00:47.720> because<00:00:48.080> if<00:00:48.170> they

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
continue their growth because if they

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.079 
continue their growth because if they
stop<00:00:48.500> growing<00:00:48.710> they're<00:00:49.040> going<00:00:49.250> to<00:00:49.489> realize

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
stop growing they're going to realize

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.969 
stop growing they're going to realize
that<00:00:50.420> they're<00:00:50.600> out<00:00:50.690> of<00:00:50.809> fertilizer<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:51.500> then

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979 
that they're out of fertilizer and then

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:53.200 
that they're out of fertilizer and then
they're<00:00:52.129> going<00:00:52.250> to<00:00:52.339> start<00:00:52.460> balding<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:53.089> we

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
they're going to start balding so we

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.880 
they're going to start balding so we
don't<00:00:53.390> want<00:00:53.659> that<00:00:53.839> so<00:00:53.989> we<00:00:54.049> want<00:00:54.199> to<00:00:54.260> keep<00:00:54.470> the

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
don't want that so we want to keep the

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.829 
don't want that so we want to keep the
flow<00:00:55.129> of<00:00:55.159> fertilizer<00:00:55.640> going<00:00:56.059> to<00:00:56.269> these<00:00:56.390> plants

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
flow of fertilizer going to these plants

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:59.560 
flow of fertilizer going to these plants
here<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:57.710> what<00:00:58.670> I'm<00:00:58.790> going<00:00:59.120> to<00:00:59.150> do<00:00:59.330> is<00:00:59.449> I'm

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
going to just make up a just an organic

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.070 
going to just make up a just an organic
mix<00:01:02.570> here<00:01:02.870> of<00:01:03.040> urea<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:04.250> potash<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:05.000> then<00:01:05.900> I'm

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
mix here of urea and potash and then I'm

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.530 
mix here of urea and potash and then I'm
going<00:01:06.320> to<00:01:06.729> mix<00:01:07.729> that<00:01:07.909> in<00:01:07.970> one<00:01:08.150> gallon<00:01:08.420> of<00:01:08.479> water

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
going to mix that in one gallon of water

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.980 
going to mix that in one gallon of water
one<00:01:09.440> teaspoon<00:01:10.070> of<00:01:10.280> each<00:01:10.850> scoop<00:01:11.240> but<00:01:11.630> is<00:01:11.750> why<00:01:11.869> we

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
one teaspoon of each scoop but is why we

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.780 
one teaspoon of each scoop but is why we
don't<00:01:12.170> have<00:01:12.320> any<00:01:12.440> phosphorous<00:01:13.250> source<00:01:13.520> is

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
don't have any phosphorous source is

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.820 
don't have any phosphorous source is
because<00:01:14.659> you<00:01:15.290> don't<00:01:15.500> want<00:01:15.650> to<00:01:15.740> add

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
because you don't want to add

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.819 
because you don't want to add
phosphorous<00:01:16.399> to<00:01:16.609> your<00:01:17.020> to<00:01:18.020> your<00:01:18.259> onions<00:01:18.619> a

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
phosphorous to your to your onions a

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.980 
phosphorous to your to your onions a
little<00:01:18.979> bits<00:01:19.340> fine<00:01:19.670> but<00:01:20.240> that'll<00:01:20.479> naturally

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
little bits fine but that'll naturally

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.539 
little bits fine but that'll naturally
you<00:01:21.049> found<00:01:21.289> in<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:21.530> soil<00:01:21.799> and<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:22.130> compost

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
you found in the soil and the compost

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.429 
you found in the soil and the compost
that's<00:01:22.789> in<00:01:22.939> there<00:01:23.090> anymore<00:01:23.719> and<00:01:24.170> it<00:01:24.320> would

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
that's in there anymore and it would

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.130 
that's in there anymore and it would
start<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:24.859> send<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.549> signal<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.880> bulb<00:01:26.270> because

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
start to send a signal to bulb because

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.749 
start to send a signal to bulb because
we<00:01:27.259> want<00:01:27.439> to<00:01:27.500> grow<00:01:27.649> leaves<00:01:27.920> we<00:01:28.399> add<00:01:28.520> a<00:01:28.549> lot<00:01:28.700> of

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
we want to grow leaves we add a lot of

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.090 
we want to grow leaves we add a lot of
nitrogen<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.509> then<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.320> potash<00:01:30.799> adds

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
nitrogen and then the potash adds

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.899 
nitrogen and then the potash adds
strength<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.679> vigor<00:01:33.679> of<00:01:33.979> growth<00:01:34.579> to<00:01:34.880> the

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
strength and vigor of growth to the

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.099 
strength and vigor of growth to the
plant<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:35.390> that's<00:01:35.539> why<00:01:35.630> we're<00:01:35.780> adding<00:01:35.840> those

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
plant so that's why we're adding those

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.919 
plant so that's why we're adding those
two<00:01:36.289> together<00:01:36.439> in<00:01:36.979> combination<00:01:37.909> I'm<00:01:38.719> going<00:01:38.869> to

I said they could definitely be growing

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:53.770 
I said they could definitely be growing
a<00:01:52.579> little<00:01:52.759> bit<00:01:52.850> better<00:01:52.969> because<00:01:53.630> we're

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
a little bit better because we're

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.270 
a little bit better because we're
getting<00:01:53.990> quite<00:01:54.409> a<00:01:54.469> bit<00:01:54.530> later<00:01:54.859> in<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.069> season

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
getting quite a bit later in the season

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.330 
getting quite a bit later in the season
and<00:01:56.140> they're<00:01:57.140> not<00:01:57.289> where<00:01:57.560> they<00:01:57.679> should<00:01:57.710> be<00:01:57.979> yet

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
and they're not where they should be yet

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.880 
and they're not where they should be yet
so<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:59.329> get<00:01:59.420> them<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.780> that<00:01:59.869> five-pound<00:02:00.530> range

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
so to get them to that five-pound range

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.440 
so to get them to that five-pound range
we're<00:02:01.609> gonna<00:02:01.700> give<00:02:01.939> them<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.119> little<00:02:02.299> boost

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
we're gonna give them a little boost

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.289 
we're gonna give them a little boost
that's<00:02:02.840> what<00:02:02.929> we're<00:02:03.049> gonna<00:02:03.140> do

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
that's what we're gonna do

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.099 
that's what we're gonna do
alright<00:02:05.299> so<00:02:05.479> now<00:02:05.569> I'm<00:02:05.630> just<00:02:05.719> going<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:05.990> take<00:02:06.079> a

alright so now I'm just going to take a

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.850 
alright so now I'm just going to take a
scoop<00:02:06.530> of<00:02:06.649> potash

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.040 

and<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:12.760> scoop<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.239> urea<00:02:15.390> OOP<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.750> wasn't<00:02:17.020> a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
and a scoop of urea OOP that wasn't a

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.080 
and a scoop of urea OOP that wasn't a
whole<00:02:17.170> scoop<00:02:17.440> there<00:02:18.810> there<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.900> go<00:02:20.700> okay<00:02:21.700> then

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090

whole scoop there there you go okay then
we're<00:02:22.180> gonna<00:02:22.270> mix<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:22.630> up<00:02:22.750> with<00:02:22.900> some<00:02:22.930> water

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
we're gonna mix this up with some water

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.990 
we're gonna mix this up with some water
and<00:02:23.470> we're<00:02:23.920> gonna<00:02:24.010> stir<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.310> up<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.700> kind<00:02:24.970> of

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
and we're gonna stir it up so it kind of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.870 
and we're gonna stir it up so it kind of
just<00:02:25.060> dissolves<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.410> fertilizer<00:02:27.340> into<00:02:27.790> the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
just dissolves the fertilizer into the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.960 
just dissolves the fertilizer into the
water<00:02:28.120> here<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.950> now<00:02:30.160> I'm<00:02:30.250> going<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.519> do<00:02:30.670> is

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
water here and now I'm going to do is

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:50.050 
water here and now I'm going to do is
we're<00:02:31.180> just<00:02:31.209> going<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.450> water<00:02:31.630> them<00:02:31.870> in

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.790 

my<00:02:51.060> need<00:02:51.270> is<00:02:51.360> extremely<00:02:52.319> hard<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.590> do<00:02:52.680> this

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
my need is extremely hard to do this

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:08.330 
my need is extremely hard to do this
one-handed<00:02:53.190> I<00:03:02.870> think<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:03.959> missed<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:04.350> one<00:03:07.340> so

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
one-handed I think I missed this one so

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.979 
one-handed I think I missed this one so
there<00:03:08.700> we<00:03:08.819> go<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.450> onions<00:03:09.780> have<00:03:09.959> been

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
there we go the onions have been

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.530 
there we go the onions have been
fertilized<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.340> going<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.819> do<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.120> once

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
fertilized and going to do that once

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.199 
fertilized and going to do that once
every<00:03:12.810> two<00:03:13.410> weeks<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:14.220> if<00:03:14.459> you'd<00:03:14.610> like<00:03:14.819> to<00:03:15.000> try

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
every two weeks so if you'd like to try

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.180 
every two weeks so if you'd like to try
this<00:03:15.269> I<00:03:15.630> definitely<00:03:16.349> recommend<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.890> it's<00:03:17.069> a

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
this I definitely recommend it it's a

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.800 
this I definitely recommend it it's a
great<00:03:17.459> way<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.640> get<00:03:17.850> your<00:03:18.000> onions<00:03:18.360> up<00:03:18.600> and

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
great way to get your onions up and

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.130 
great way to get your onions up and
going<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:20.180> much<00:03:21.180> bigger<00:03:21.450> than<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:22.019> normal

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
going and much bigger than a normal

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.300 
going and much bigger than a normal
onion<00:03:22.800> so<00:03:23.100> even<00:03:23.850> though<00:03:24.350> these<00:03:25.350> are<00:03:25.410> certified

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
onion so even though these are certified

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.400 
onion so even though these are certified
giant<00:03:26.790> seeds<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.810> can<00:03:27.959> do<00:03:28.080> this<00:03:28.230> with<00:03:28.380> pretty

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
giant seeds you can do this with pretty

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.229 
giant seeds you can do this with pretty
much<00:03:28.709> any<00:03:28.890> onion<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.430> it's<00:03:29.519> going<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.760> respond

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
much any onion and it's going to respond

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.900 
much any onion and it's going to respond
very<00:03:30.450> well<00:03:30.569> to<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:31.080> just<00:03:31.319> because<00:03:31.680> all<00:03:32.250> onions

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
very well to it just because all onions

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.360 
very well to it just because all onions
are<00:03:33.390> bulbs<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:34.380> they<00:03:34.500> all<00:03:34.650> will<00:03:34.860> react<00:03:35.160> the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
are bulbs and so they all will react the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.940 
are bulbs and so they all will react the
same<00:03:35.580> way<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.569> same<00:03:36.950> necessary

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
same way to the same necessary

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.160 
same way to the same necessary
requirements<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.269> think<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:40.019> could

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
requirements so I think you could

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.960 
requirements so I think you could
probably<00:03:40.290> get<00:03:40.860> pretty<00:03:41.040> large<00:03:41.340> onions<00:03:41.790> if<00:03:41.910> you

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
probably get pretty large onions if you

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.080 
probably get pretty large onions if you
tried<00:03:42.209> this<00:03:42.360> even<00:03:42.569> with<00:03:42.690> your<00:03:42.780> smaller<00:03:43.049> onions

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
tried this even with your smaller onions

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.759 
tried this even with your smaller onions
all<00:03:45.090> right<00:03:45.330> that's<00:03:45.600> about<00:03:45.720> it<00:03:45.959> for<00:03:46.140> this<00:03:46.260> am<00:03:46.500> i

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
all right that's about it for this am i

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.710 
all right that's about it for this am i
short<00:03:47.160> hopefully<00:03:47.819> you<00:03:47.970> enjoyed<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:48.569> episode

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
and hopefully you'll all try this method

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.630 
and hopefully you'll all try this method
of<00:03:51.720> fertilizing<00:03:52.109> your<00:03:52.410> onions<00:03:52.680> I've<00:03:53.250> been

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
of fertilizing your onions I've been

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.280 
of fertilizing your onions I've been
leaving<00:03:53.820> phosphorous<00:03:54.510> out<00:03:54.660> of<00:03:54.840> my<00:03:54.989> fertilizer

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
leaving phosphorous out of my fertilizer

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.610 
leaving phosphorous out of my fertilizer
for<00:03:55.950> my<00:03:56.010> onions<00:03:56.570> for<00:03:57.570> probably<00:03:58.019> past<00:03:58.410> two

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
for my onions for probably past two

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.360 
for my onions for probably past two
years<00:03:58.859> I've<00:03:59.130> had<00:03:59.220> excellent<00:03:59.730> results<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.890> so

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
years I've had excellent results and so

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.430 
years I've had excellent results and so
I<00:04:02.400> think<00:04:02.940> it's<00:04:03.600> something<00:04:03.780> definitely<00:04:04.170> worth

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
I think it's something definitely worth

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.560 
I think it's something definitely worth
noting<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.070> trying<00:04:05.430> if<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:06.030> have<00:04:06.150> any<00:04:06.299> other
