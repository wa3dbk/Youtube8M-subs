00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
okay now this is a bit of a mockery here

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.160 
okay now this is a bit of a mockery here
okay<00:00:22.250> now<00:00:23.250> me<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.730> gala<00:00:24.119> 104<00:00:24.779> we<00:00:25.199> talked<00:00:25.500> about

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
okay now me and gala 104 we talked about

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.410 
okay now me and gala 104 we talked about
guys<00:00:28.170> my<00:00:28.740> recurrent<00:00:29.279> video<00:00:29.760> tournament

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
guys my recurrent video tournament

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.850 
guys my recurrent video tournament
videos<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.050> he<00:00:32.009> said<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.460> me<00:00:32.989> that<00:00:33.989> he'll

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
videos and he said to me that he'll

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.940 
videos and he said to me that he'll
basically<00:00:35.100> only<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:36.059> them<00:00:36.329> when<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.350> not<00:00:37.590> we

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
basically only do them when it's not we

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.380 
basically only do them when it's not we
wield<00:00:38.280> controlled<00:00:38.790> only<00:00:39.170> and<00:00:40.910> he<00:00:41.910> prefers

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
wield controlled only and he prefers

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.510 
wield controlled only and he prefers
carts<00:00:42.989> instead<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.530> bikes<00:00:43.969> so<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.520> my

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
carts instead of bikes so this in my

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.010 
carts instead of bikes so this in my
opinion<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.149> complete<00:00:48.539> mockery

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.310 

coincidentally<00:00:52.670> yeah<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> next

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
coincidentally yeah this is the next

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.319 
coincidentally yeah this is the next
tournament<00:00:55.620> after<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.250> conversation<00:00:57.149> took

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
tournament after that conversation took

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.900 
tournament after that conversation took
place<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.930> yeah<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> third<00:01:02.190> time<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.670> say

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
place so yeah for the third time I say

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.250 
place so yeah for the third time I say
that<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.359> kind<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.629> mockery<00:01:04.909> whatever

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
that this is kind of mockery whatever

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.940
