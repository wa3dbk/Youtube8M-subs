00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.379
 hello once again in this new video os 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.780
 I will teach how to make your 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.320
 dog somehow knock on the door 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.910
 I will enter you as you want to call it 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.830
 These can be used especially by those who 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.960
 you have a dog on a terrace or in a 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.970
 backyard and not even scratch the 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.390
 door when you want to enter and it bothers you 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.560
 It's worth it as we always go to 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.860
 need the prizes the clicker and this 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.020
 we're going to need a bell or a 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.490
 rattle what you want to spend tied to 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.320
 a rope or not only the bells 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.150
 but something to tie it and that is 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.360
 hanging vale and we are also going to 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.430
 need a kind of hook the one 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.950
 be I am going to spend an adhesive hook 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.500
 OK 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.880
 and then I will explain exactly for 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.880
 what are we going to need? 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.630
 The first thing we are going to do is that the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.460
 dog learn to ring the bell to 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.920
 we are going to apply it every time 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.020
 touch the bell you can touch it with the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.340
 legs or with the nose as you want 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.340
 I'm going to do it with the mode 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.450
 we put the bell a position 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.620
 comfortable and we'll wait for you to touch it 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.620
 and then we will explain 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.110
 we have to try to touch the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.420
 Bell 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.690
 and not the rope or the hand or any other 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.690
 site 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.009
 if we see that it touches another site we are going to 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.009
 wait for us until 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.100
 very well 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.330
 when we see that the dog already knows 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.250
 to change position 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.840
 so that he learns to look for the bell 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.459
 let's upload it down 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.849
 so that he worries about looking for 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.849
 Bell 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.150
 very well 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.269
 once the dog knows how to touch the 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.819
 bell we will put the order for 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.720
 we are going to say the word 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.879
 immediately we will teach you the 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.329
 bell to associate the word with 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.329
 the bell 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.579
 very well 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.579
 so 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.720
 very well 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.360
 we hide the bell to prevent 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.360
 ring the bell before telling him 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.170
 and so once you hear the word has 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.709
 what to look for 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.709
 such 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.740
 once the dog has already learned to 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.840
 the order and knows how to ring the bell in this 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.120
 position what we're going to do is put 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.740
 a handful of food on the other side of the 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.780
 door and we're going to ask him to touch the 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.670
 bell when we touch it we are going to open it 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.830
 the door has been the dog is going to learn 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.990
 really what is the use of touching the 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.840
 bell in this step we can let that 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:21.700
 explain why the sound of the 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.700
 bell can serve day as a signal 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.990
 we ask 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.810
 I was 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.810
 and the campaign itself 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.970
 let's wait for us not only to touch the 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.460
 bell but it sounds like it does not touch 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.620
 anyway 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.620
 for 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.620
 look 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.950
 and he wins 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.580
 i 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.600
 with nothing 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.390
 or not 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.260
 well with this we could teach the 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.440
 dog to ring the bell when 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.570
 want to leave and then we could teach him 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.090
 to ring the bell to enter 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.370
 when you want to enter in a very 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.080
 quick and simple and the dog the 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.910
 I would learn right away since you already know what 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.910
 makes for the door to open 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.770
 now that the dog already knows how to touch the 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.780
 bell that opens is the force 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.140
 from inside we're going to show it to you from 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.790
 outside we're just going to have the dog 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.850
 outside and we're going to open the door from 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.770
 inside for that I have used a 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.330
 adhesive hook the posts out like that 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.660
 I can hook to the bell of some 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.660
 way 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:39.830
 we are simply going to send the dog 

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:39.830
 outside 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.900
 let's close the door but not the 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.900
 everything like that hears us 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.690
 movement 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.720
 it is the same as what we have done before but 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.760
 upside down 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.940
 and this time the dog empties it immediately 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.540
 because I 've done it before and now 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.540
 we know what to do 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.640
 and knowing all this we can already teach 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.710
 the dog to ring the bell when 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.120
 want to enter or leave and direct and 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.960
 start the door because sometimes it 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.569
 it's a little annoying 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:31.000
 and nothing I hope you liked and if 

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:31.000
 Do you have any questions? Thank you
