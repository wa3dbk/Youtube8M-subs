00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.190 

we<00:00:16.640> brought<00:00:16.910> together<00:00:17.120> and<00:00:17.480> it<00:00:17.570> means<00:00:17.810> surely

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
take a deep breath ya know and I thought

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.870 
take a deep breath ya know and I thought
what<00:00:24.560> we<00:00:24.650> did<00:00:24.800> really<00:00:24.950> well<00:00:25.160> this<00:00:25.340> weekend<00:00:25.760> was

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
what we did really well this weekend was

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.910 
what we did really well this weekend was
we<00:00:26.000> found<00:00:26.180> ways<00:00:26.420> to<00:00:26.450> work<00:00:26.630> out<00:00:26.990> of<00:00:27.200> that<00:00:27.349> so

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
we found ways to work out of that so

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.010 
we found ways to work out of that so
that<00:00:28.310> has<00:00:28.490> to<00:00:28.640> be<00:00:28.730> a<00:00:28.760> constant<00:00:29.240> in<00:00:29.330> practice<00:00:29.810> -

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
that has to be a constant in practice -

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.740 
that has to be a constant in practice -
it<00:00:30.170> can't<00:00:30.380> just<00:00:30.439> be<00:00:30.830> in<00:00:31.039> matches<00:00:31.550> we<00:00:32.210> have<00:00:32.570> to

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
it can't just be in matches we have to

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.450 
it can't just be in matches we have to
have<00:00:32.900> that<00:00:33.050> energy<00:00:33.379> and<00:00:33.530> make<00:00:33.890> everyone<00:00:34.309> else

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
have that energy and make everyone else

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.310 
have that energy and make everyone else
step<00:00:34.730> up<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:35.030> us<00:00:35.239> we<00:00:35.780> need<00:00:35.900> to<00:00:36.020> learn<00:00:36.110> how<00:00:36.170> to

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
step up to us we need to learn how to

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.979 
step up to us we need to learn how to
handle<00:00:36.650> them<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:37.400> get<00:00:37.910> rid<00:00:37.940> of<00:00:38.239> them<00:00:38.420> in<00:00:38.690> three

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
handle them and get rid of them in three
