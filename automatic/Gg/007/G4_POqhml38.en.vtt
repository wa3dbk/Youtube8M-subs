it was like a 180 and I became
fascinated<00:03:09.840> with<00:03:10.410> this<00:03:10.590> movie<00:03:10.889> because<00:03:11.430> not

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
fascinated with this movie because not

only do I think it looks like it has
very<00:03:13.109> good<00:03:13.260> production<00:03:13.799> values<00:03:14.220> which<00:03:14.489> I

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
very good production values which I

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.030 
very good production values which I
really<00:03:14.970> admire<00:03:15.720> because<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.590> often<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.010> know

we'll<00:03:17.280> be<00:03:17.370> talking<00:03:17.549> about<00:03:17.790> divergent<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.540> lot

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
we'll be talking about divergent a lot

they<00:03:23.010> start<00:03:23.310> out<00:03:23.370> very<00:03:23.700> rocky<00:03:24.120> footing<00:03:24.450> and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
they start out very rocky footing and

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.879 
they start out very rocky footing and
they<00:03:24.840> need<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.109> replace<00:03:25.410> their<00:03:25.620> entire

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
they need to replace their entire

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.319 
they need to replace their entire
creative<00:03:26.370> teams<00:03:26.609> they<00:03:26.819> did<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.150> with

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
creative teams they did that with

Twilight they did that with Hunger Games
and<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:29.700> divergent<00:03:30.239> cycle<00:03:30.510> moves<00:03:30.630> ahead

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
and this divergent cycle moves ahead

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.270 
and this divergent cycle moves ahead
which<00:03:31.139> I'll<00:03:31.290> be<00:03:31.410> discussing<00:03:31.650> later<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.100> week

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
which I'll be discussing later this week

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.979 
which I'll be discussing later this week
that<00:03:32.790> creative<00:03:33.329> team<00:03:33.510> has<00:03:33.660> also<00:03:33.840> been

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
that creative team has also been

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.690 
that creative team has also been
replaced<00:03:34.470> but<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:34.920> like<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.310> job<00:03:35.340> that

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
replaced but I like the job that

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.699 
replaced but I like the job that
Westfall<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.269> doing<00:03:36.540> here<00:03:36.720> he<00:03:37.109> is<00:03:37.200> in<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.470> first

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
Westfall is doing here he is in a first

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.229 
Westfall is doing here he is in a first
time<00:03:37.950> director<00:03:38.310> he<00:03:38.400> directed<00:03:38.700> some<00:03:38.849> shorts

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
time director he directed some shorts

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.430 
time director he directed some shorts
he's<00:03:39.389> an<00:03:39.510> artist<00:03:39.780> he's<00:03:39.930> done<00:03:40.109> some<00:03:40.290> work<00:03:40.410> with

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
he's an artist he's done some work with

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.050 
he's an artist he's done some work with
rendering<00:03:40.769> and<00:03:41.160> stuff<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.760> guess<00:03:41.940> that's

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
rendering and stuff so I guess that's

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.930 
rendering and stuff so I guess that's
why<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.269> maze<00:03:42.569> looks<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.109> good<00:03:43.489> but<00:03:44.489> I<00:03:44.519> really

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
why the maze looks so good but I really

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.099 
why the maze looks so good but I really
think<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.269> he's<00:03:45.510> taking<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:45.900> very

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
think that he's taking this very

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.480 
think that he's taking this very
seriously<00:03:46.169> and

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
seriously and

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.460 
seriously and
you<00:03:47.520> know<00:03:47.610> making<00:03:48.540> not<00:03:48.660> just<00:03:48.690> oh<00:03:49.050> this<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.440> a

of that here not only in the way as I

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.580 
of that here not only in the way as I
said<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.270> production<00:04:36.420> values<00:04:36.930> are<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:37.200> good<00:04:37.410> I

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
said the production values are so good I

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.470 
said the production values are so good I
like<00:04:37.920> the<00:04:38.010> sophisticated<00:04:38.310> way<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:39.060> subject

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
like the sophisticated way the subject

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.240 
like the sophisticated way the subject
matter<00:04:39.600> seems<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:39.960> be<00:04:40.080> approached<00:04:40.410> but<00:04:40.920> also

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
matter seems to be approached but also

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.310 
matter seems to be approached but also
the<00:04:41.640> acting<00:04:42.180> looks<00:04:42.360> very<00:04:42.660> good<00:04:42.840> now<00:04:42.990> as<00:04:43.140> I<00:04:43.260> said

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320

fan but I think I like he comes across
very<00:04:48.150> well<00:04:48.660> here<00:04:48.870> is<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.080> lead<00:04:49.230> very<00:04:49.440> likeable

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
very well here is the lead very likeable

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.890 
very well here is the lead very likeable
I<00:04:50.130> liked<00:04:50.820> it<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.090> a<00:04:51.210> Souls<00:04:51.450> from<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:51.720> male

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
I liked it and a Souls from the male

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.570 
I liked it and a Souls from the male
perspective<00:04:51.930> all<00:04:52.800> of<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.160> you<00:04:53.340> know<00:04:53.430> with<00:04:53.550> the

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
perspective all of the you know with the

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.520 
perspective all of the you know with the
exception<00:04:54.060> of<00:04:54.120> beautiful<00:04:54.540> creatures<00:04:55.020> which

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
exception of beautiful creatures which

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.620 
exception of beautiful creatures which
didn't<00:04:55.770> work<00:04:55.920> out<00:04:56.190> all<00:04:56.880> of<00:04:57.120> these<00:04:57.240> young<00:04:57.390> adult

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
didn't work out all of these young adult

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.090 
didn't work out all of these young adult
limitations<00:04:58.170> have<00:04:58.320> been<00:04:58.440> from<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.710> female

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
limitations have been from the female

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.710 
limitations have been from the female
perspective<00:04:59.400> so<00:04:59.820> I<00:04:59.850> think<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:00.240> kind<00:05:00.390> of<00:05:00.480> switch

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
perspective so I think to kind of switch

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.300 
perspective so I think to kind of switch
that<00:05:00.900> around<00:05:01.020> in<00:05:01.440> and<00:05:01.680> of<00:05:01.770> itself<00:05:02.040> is<00:05:02.280> very

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
that around in and of itself is very

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.550 
that around in and of itself is very
refreshing<00:05:02.820> so<00:05:03.450> I<00:05:03.480> like<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:03.930> aspect<00:05:04.110> of<00:05:04.440> it

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
refreshing so I like that aspect of it

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.860 
refreshing so I like that aspect of it
quite<00:05:04.710> a<00:05:04.740> bit<00:05:04.830> will<00:05:05.400> Poulter<00:05:05.790> as<00:05:05.910> I<00:05:06.030> said<00:05:06.270> very

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
him here also I'm not familiar with the

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.390 
him here also I'm not familiar with the
entire<00:05:21.810> cast<00:05:22.140> but<00:05:22.380> you<00:05:22.890> can<00:05:23.010> see<00:05:23.160> from<00:05:23.310> the

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
entire cast but you can see from the

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.190 
entire cast but you can see from the
trailer<00:05:23.520> a<00:05:23.730> lot<00:05:23.970> of<00:05:24.060> diversity<00:05:24.510> and<00:05:24.930> it

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
trailer a lot of diversity and it

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.870 
trailer a lot of diversity and it
doesn't<00:05:25.440> seem<00:05:25.560> playing<00:05:25.860> with<00:05:26.070> tokens<00:05:26.520> it<00:05:26.700> just

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
doesn't seem playing with tokens it just

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.570 
doesn't seem playing with tokens it just
is<00:05:27.000> reflecting<00:05:27.840> society<00:05:28.380> as<00:05:28.980> I<00:05:29.160> say<00:05:29.370> all<00:05:29.490> the

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
is reflecting society as I say all the

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.220 
is reflecting society as I say all the
time<00:05:29.640> on<00:05:29.910> this<00:05:30.060> show<00:05:30.240> I<00:05:30.450> think<00:05:30.720> Hollywood

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
time on this show I think Hollywood

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.720 
time on this show I think Hollywood
needs<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.560> be<00:05:31.650> more<00:05:31.830> diverse<00:05:32.010> in<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.400> product

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
needs to be more diverse in the product

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
the movie-going audience and when I see

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.060 
the movie-going audience and when I see
this<00:05:36.060> group<00:05:36.240> of<00:05:36.420> boys<00:05:36.600> I<00:05:36.990> see<00:05:37.200> a<00:05:37.440> reflection<00:05:37.980> of

the<00:05:38.160> movie-going<00:05:38.400> audience<00:05:39.000> so<00:05:39.210> that's<00:05:39.300> very

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
the movie-going audience so that's very

exciting<00:05:40.010> so<00:05:41.010> I<00:05:41.040> just<00:05:41.280> think<00:05:41.400> this<00:05:41.520> movie

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.080 
seems to be coming together very well
and<00:05:43.290> as<00:05:43.530> I<00:05:43.710> said<00:05:43.950> of<00:05:44.130> a<00:05:44.460> quality<00:05:44.850> that<00:05:44.880> you
