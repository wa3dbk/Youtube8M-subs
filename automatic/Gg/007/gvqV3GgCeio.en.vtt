just rest your head there extendable as
much<00:03:34.810> heads<00:03:35.049> on<00:03:35.260> should<00:03:35.650> be<00:03:35.829> and<00:03:37.680> he<00:03:38.680> looks<00:03:38.890> all

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
much heads on should be and he looks all

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.000 
much heads on should be and he looks all
right<00:03:39.100> so<00:03:39.579> what<00:03:40.420> these<00:03:40.570> two<00:03:41.110> different<00:03:41.530> ports

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
right so what these two different ports

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.869 
right so what these two different ports
you've<00:03:42.310> got<00:03:42.640> this

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.649 

USB<00:03:46.049> plug<00:03:47.049> it<00:03:47.230> doesn't<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.680> computer<00:03:48.659> think

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
USB plug it doesn't the computer think

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.910 
USB plug it doesn't the computer think
this<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:50.019> for<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.260> ps3<00:03:50.709> or<00:03:51.129> something<00:03:51.549> and<00:03:52.920> put

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
this is for the ps3 or something and put

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.819 
this is for the ps3 or something and put
John<00:03:54.400> Carter<00:03:56.670> um<00:03:58.409> have<00:03:59.409> to<00:03:59.560> read<00:03:59.709> the

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
John Carter um have to read the

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.509 
John Carter um have to read the
instructions<00:04:00.689> but<00:04:01.689> I<00:04:01.930> think<00:04:02.379> if<00:04:02.709> it's<00:04:03.310> just

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
instructions but I think if it's just

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.750 
instructions but I think if it's just
for<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.849> computer<00:04:04.810> I<00:04:05.280> don't<00:04:06.280> need<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.579> put

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
for the computer I don't need to put

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.539 
for the computer I don't need to put
this<00:04:06.909> in<00:04:07.180> any<00:04:07.299> way<00:04:07.420> I<00:04:07.540> don't<00:04:07.930> think<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.549> don't

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
this in any way I don't think I don't

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.460 
this in any way I don't think I don't
know<00:04:09.640> how<00:04:09.849> to<00:04:09.909> read<00:04:10.269> into<00:04:10.450> it<00:04:10.599> what<00:04:10.659> was<00:04:11.349> the
