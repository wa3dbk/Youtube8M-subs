00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.430 
they can like cook things on their
driver<00:02:09.179> or<00:02:09.360> something<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.780> don't<00:02:10.050> know<00:02:10.229> but

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
driver or something I don't know but

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.010 
driver or something I don't know but
like<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.709> supposedly<00:02:11.340> melts<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.480> snow

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
like it supposedly melts the snow

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
that was pretty interesting I thought

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.770 
that was pretty interesting I thought
the<00:02:18.840> snow<00:02:19.130> blower<00:02:20.130> was<00:02:20.550> like<00:02:20.760> crazy<00:02:21.390> enough

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
that technology is pretty cool but I

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.240 
that technology is pretty cool but I
mean<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.810> do<00:02:40.230> your<00:02:40.380> neighbors<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:40.890> something
