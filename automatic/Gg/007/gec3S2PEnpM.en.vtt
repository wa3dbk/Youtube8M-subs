might<00:01:21.170> even<00:01:21.350> play<00:01:21.530> one<00:01:22.280> shell<00:01:22.580> voicing<00:01:23.030> and

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
might even play one shell voicing and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.000 
might even play one shell voicing and

jump to a completely different or

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.530 
jump to a completely different or
sometimes<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.730> might<00:01:25.880> just<00:01:26.090> leave<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.270> measure

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
sometimes I might just leave a measure

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.560 
sometimes I might just leave a measure
blank<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.050> let<00:01:27.230> the<00:01:27.350> melody<00:01:27.470> shine<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.790> that's

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
blank and let the melody shine so that's

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.850 
blank and let the melody shine so that's
one<00:01:29.750> thing<00:01:29.930> you<00:01:30.200> can<00:01:30.500> really<00:01:30.740> start

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
one thing you can really start

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.590 
one thing you can really start
experimenting<00:01:31.460> with<00:01:31.670> once<00:01:32.180> you've<00:01:32.330> really

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
experimenting with once you've really

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.260 
experimenting with once you've really
solidified<00:01:33.200> those<00:01:33.740> left<00:01:34.040> hand<00:01:34.280> voicings<00:01:34.760> so

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
solidified those left hand voicings so

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.030 
solidified those left hand voicings so
here's<00:01:35.480> the<00:01:35.600> first<00:01:35.750> course<00:01:36.080> of<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.410> etude<00:01:36.770> and

the key of F with the written out shell
voicings<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:39.710> I'll<00:01:40.130> repeat<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.640> twelve<00:01:40.880> bars

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120
