00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.830
 winner 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:42.760

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.229
 to make those kind of awards 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.970

 in the country because it also motivates 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.250
 new producers who target the 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.250
 julián román's record

 the prizes that are made in the 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.629
 television at least national I do not 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.950
 it seems that they are very objective that 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.140
 has a model a model of what 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.450
 be or how a woman should be and how 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.860
 must be a man and they are usually 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.350
 those who win prizes the most beautiful 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.229
 or the most beautiful are those who earn 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.570

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.890
 who knows more because he really deserves it 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.570
 good and the best program 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.340
 entertainment is the cigars 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.190
 to public television is very 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.840
 important for any country in the world 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.300
 where the country of 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.520
 true where people are necessarily 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.040
 so that it comes out on television they do not have 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.920
 to be operated on silicones from 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.450
 smile design on television 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.700
 national violence is promoted 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.950
 and even if they say no, that's for 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.080
 that children learn and do not repeat it 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.750
 they play to make the gangsters and to kill the 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.750
 friend when we all falleros 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.940
 and one grows and finds in the 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.860
 girls that is girls of tenth of ninth 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.510
 that are supposed to already have a criterion 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.159
 and saying is not that I'm going to marry 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.770
 a narco that I do not know what and that's 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.770
 bothering but it's that that comes in 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.650
 in the unconscious of someone so 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.280
 important entity you and xabi alonso 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.230
 justice a minute of grace that uses 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.290
 the objective they have is to reward 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.420
 as the effort that they have their 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.030
 studies about television and 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.010
 communication but sometimes also this 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.130
 is based much advertising gives you how 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.290
 the privilege to certain people 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.660
 there are people that one does not know if 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.850
 nationally one does not know and has done 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.940
 better things than those that advertising 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.790
 It is up to us the question is not because 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.380
 reward if it is fair or not to whom 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.989
 gives him that prize if he deserves it or not 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.090
 I also think that you should recognize yourself 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.860
 more the work of the people who are 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.230
 behind the cameras societies the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.810
 screenwriters of the directors of the 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.950
 scripts and make-up artists 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:08.030
 that is all that is what makes a 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:10.390
 of a movie from a production something 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.390
 good 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.269
 the prizes later although one does not 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.830
 like always motivates a lot to have 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.220
 new actors to have new 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.879
 presenters that award is like a 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.610
 innovation that builds some step 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.260
 from the television to us then 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.170
 I think that the contributions they make 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.880
 our channels as channel 13 are 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.340
 extremely important for that 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.500
 growth that will be seen in what is 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.269
 see what I want in our house 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.760
 we mentioned the television and I saw and we watched 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.440
 from good society growth 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.150
 these were our opinions about 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.400
 of the awards of television 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.620
