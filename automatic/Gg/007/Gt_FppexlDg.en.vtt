used for delivering anything so first of
all<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:19.670> good<00:00:20.670> idea<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.619> for<00:00:22.619> when<00:00:22.980> building

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
all a good idea is for when building

your<00:00:23.519> van<00:00:24.420> not<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.590> apply<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:25.980> stickers<00:00:26.640> that

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
your van not to apply the stickers that

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.060 
your van not to apply the stickers that
is<00:00:28.140> what<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.410> did<00:00:28.740> but<00:00:29.730> if<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:31.070> applied

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
is what I did but if you have applied

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.810 
is what I did but if you have applied
the<00:00:32.550> stickers<00:00:33.500> then<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:35.219> take<00:00:35.489> them<00:00:35.670> off

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the stickers then just take them off

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.080 
the stickers then just take them off
because<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.809> want<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.160> just<00:00:38.160> rebuild<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
because if you want to just rebuild the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.200 
because if you want to just rebuild the
actual<00:00:39.450> van<00:00:39.660> again<00:00:40.230> then<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:41.399> can<00:00:41.550> always<00:00:41.790> buy

those<00:00:45.629> sorts<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.110> sites<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:48.020> first<00:00:49.020> you're

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
those sorts of sites so first you're

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.819 
those sorts of sites so first you're
gonna<00:00:49.980> need<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.489> think<00:00:50.789> about<00:00:51.230> taking<00:00:52.230> out

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
gonna need to think about taking out

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.389 
gonna need to think about taking out
that<00:00:53.640> cupboard<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.690> there<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.250> you

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
that cupboard you see there so then you

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.090 
that cupboard you see there so then you
have<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> nice<00:00:56.910> big<00:00:57.539> empty<00:00:58.230> space<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> back

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
have a nice big empty space in the back

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.050 
have a nice big empty space in the back
and<00:01:02.059> for<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.870> used<00:01:04.670> these<00:01:05.670> are

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
and for that I have used these are

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.580 
and for that I have used these are
window<00:01:06.960> frames<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.659> don't<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
window frames so if you don't have a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.969 
window frames so if you don't have a
loss<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.280> them<00:01:11.520> then<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.630> use<00:01:12.869> some

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
loss of them then you can just use some

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.499 
loss of them then you can just use some
one<00:01:13.979> blower<00:01:14.220> some<00:01:15.090> 1<00:01:15.570> by<00:01:15.720> 3<00:01:16.020> bricks<00:01:16.460> along

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
one blower some 1 by 3 bricks along

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.660 
one blower some 1 by 3 bricks along
where<00:01:18.509> they<00:01:19.140> go<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:21.920> they<00:01:22.920> are<00:01:23.369> pretty

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
where they go but they are pretty

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.170 
where they go but they are pretty
essential<00:01:24.509> for<00:01:25.140> turning<00:01:25.680> your<00:01:26.250> fire<00:01:26.640> van<00:01:26.880> into

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
essential for turning your fire van into

essential for turning your fire van into
a<00:01:27.360> non-event<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.700> another<00:01:29.700> thing<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.509> noticed

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
a non-event and another thing I noticed

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.850 
a non-event and another thing I noticed
is<00:01:31.579> the<00:01:32.579> LEGO<00:01:32.970> City<00:01:33.210> for<00:01:33.600> van<00:01:33.840> does<00:01:34.380> not<00:01:34.619> have

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
is the LEGO City for van does not have

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.580 
is the LEGO City for van does not have
any<00:01:35.159> doors<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.049> bit<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
any doors and that can be a bit of a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.039 
any doors and that can be a bit of a
problem<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:39.030> think<00:01:39.360> about<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:41.509> in<00:01:42.509> you

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
problem if you think about it so in you

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.190 
problem if you think about it so in you
take<00:01:43.320> out<00:01:43.560> those<00:01:44.810> were<00:01:45.810> 1<00:01:46.259> by<00:01:46.439> 4<00:01:46.860> tiles<00:01:47.790> with

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
take out those were 1 by 4 tiles with

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.730 
take out those were 1 by 4 tiles with
panels<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:50.630> you<00:01:51.630> swap<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.340> 1<00:01:53.970> by<00:01:54.149> 3

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
panels and you swap that for a 1 by 3

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.999 
panels and you swap that for a 1 by 3
door<00:01:55.740> panel<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:58.020> do<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.680> other

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
door panel and you do that on the other

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.410 
door panel and you do that on the other
side<00:01:59.159> as<00:01:59.549> well<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:01.409> we've<00:02:01.619> got<00:02:02.030> one<00:02:03.030> by<00:02:03.210> one

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
side as well and we've got one by one

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.870 
side as well and we've got one by one
gap<00:02:03.689> you've<00:02:03.990> got<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:04.890> always<00:02:05.280> add<00:02:05.700> in

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
gap you've got you can always add in

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.490 
gap you've got you can always add in
some<00:02:06.390> weeding<00:02:07.290> mirrors<00:02:07.640> by<00:02:08.640> adding<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.840> one<00:02:10.319> by

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
some weeding mirrors by adding a one by

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.190 
some weeding mirrors by adding a one by
one<00:02:10.770> with<00:02:10.979> holder<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.819> I

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
one with holder and I

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.490 
one with holder and I
one<00:02:13.410> by<00:02:13.590> one<00:02:13.970> time<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:16.260> they<00:02:16.860> look<00:02:17.069> pretty

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
one by one time and they look pretty

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.960 
one by one time and they look pretty
realistic<00:02:21.410> so<00:02:22.410> another<00:02:22.950> thing<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:23.489> found<00:02:23.730> out

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
realistic so another thing I found out

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.740 
realistic so another thing I found out
was<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.950> looked<00:02:26.190> better<00:02:26.430> if<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.330> colors

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
was that it looked better if the colors

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.400 
was that it looked better if the colors
were<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:28.019> bit<00:02:28.349> more<00:02:28.920> realistic<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.110> do<00:02:31.380> that

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
were a bit more realistic so to do that

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.190 
were a bit more realistic so to do that
you<00:02:31.980> might<00:02:32.400> not<00:02:32.640> see<00:02:32.670> much<00:02:33.300> difference<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:34.050> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
you might not see much difference on the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.580 
you might not see much difference on the
video<00:02:34.470> but<00:02:35.370> I've<00:02:35.700> swapped<00:02:36.180> around<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:37.290> white

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
video but I've swapped around the white

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.080 
video but I've swapped around the white
grille<00:02:37.950> from<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:39.510> 5<00:02:39.959> end<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.650> silver<00:02:41.090> will

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
grille from the 5 end to a silver will

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.789 
grille from the 5 end to a silver will
because<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.200> adds<00:02:43.530> more<00:02:43.799> effect<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:45.360> also

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
because that adds more effect and also

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.740 
because that adds more effect and also
you<00:02:46.799> can<00:02:47.069> keep<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.640> stripes<00:02:48.030> because<00:02:48.540> they

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
you can keep the stripes because they

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.770 
you can keep the stripes because they
look<00:02:48.930> pretty<00:02:49.230> good<00:02:49.410> but<00:02:49.880> I've<00:02:50.880> taken<00:02:51.209> them<00:02:51.599> out

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
look pretty good but I've taken them out

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.890 
look pretty good but I've taken them out
because<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.650> can<00:02:52.890> have<00:02:53.280> any<00:02:53.900> delivering

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
because you can have any delivering

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.380 
because you can have any delivering
company<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:56.489> want<00:02:56.730> Oh<00:02:57.290> something<00:02:58.290> like<00:02:58.410> that

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
company you want Oh something like that

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.220 
company you want Oh something like that
so<00:03:00.390> I've<00:03:00.900> also<00:03:01.260> added<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:02.299> little<00:03:03.299> grill<00:03:03.959> there

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
so I've also added a little grill there

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.960 
so I've also added a little grill there
because<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:05.549> just<00:03:06.170> looks<00:03:07.170> pretty<00:03:07.760> good

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
because that just looks pretty good

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.140 
because that just looks pretty good
and<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.329> looks<00:03:09.599> like<00:03:09.870> it's<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:11.010> headrest<00:03:11.430> for

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
and it looks like it's a headrest for

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.120 
and it looks like it's a headrest for
the<00:03:12.239> minifigure<00:03:12.870> sitting<00:03:13.260> inside<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.860> or

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
the minifigure sitting inside it or

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.789 
the minifigure sitting inside it or
something<00:03:14.519> like<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:16.140> yeah<00:03:16.829> I<00:03:18.410> have<00:03:19.410> I

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
something like that so yeah I have I

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.150 
something like that so yeah I have I
haven't<00:03:20.549> changed<00:03:20.850> her<00:03:21.150> back<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:21.660> much

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
haven't changed her back that much

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.930 
haven't changed her back that much
except<00:03:23.180> that<00:03:24.290> I've<00:03:25.290> swapped<00:03:26.160> over<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.670> grill

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
except that I've swapped over the grill

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.629 
except that I've swapped over the grill
so<00:03:27.299> that<00:03:28.230> would<00:03:28.500> be<00:03:28.709> your<00:03:28.920> good<00:03:29.220> idea

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
so that would be your good idea

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.660 
so that would be your good idea
obviously<00:03:30.389> if<00:03:30.450> rank<00:03:31.079> rule<00:03:31.440> has<00:03:31.980> been<00:03:32.010> swapped

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
obviously if rank rule has been swapped

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.020 
obviously if rank rule has been swapped
a<00:03:32.940> silver<00:03:33.389> then<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:35.090> back<00:03:36.090> real<00:03:36.600> will<00:03:36.870> be<00:03:37.200> Nita

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
a silver then the back real will be Nita

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.640 
a silver then the back real will be Nita
swapped<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.500> silver<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.090> haven't<00:03:42.989> spirts<00:03:43.470> in

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
swapped to silver so I haven't spirts in

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.569 
swapped to silver so I haven't spirts in
