verse<00:04:07.560> note

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.060 

so<00:04:12.560> then<00:04:12.710> we<00:04:12.800> can<00:04:12.950> see<00:04:13.340> here<00:04:14.800> then<00:04:15.800> a<00:04:15.830> show<00:04:16.040> that

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
so then we can see here then a show that

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.910 
so then we can see here then a show that

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
or what was one two three so if it

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.270 
or what was one two three so if it
covers<00:04:22.730> a<00:04:22.880> range<00:04:23.480> of<00:04:23.630> verses<00:04:23.990> you<00:04:24.860> can<00:04:25.010> quickly

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
covers a range of verses you can quickly

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.060 
covers a range of verses you can quickly
get<00:04:25.520> to<00:04:25.580> that<00:04:26.170> then<00:04:27.170> quickly<00:04:27.650> get<00:04:27.890> to<00:04:27.920> that

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
get to that then quickly get to that

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.420 
get to that then quickly get to that
note<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:30.520> then<00:04:31.520> again<00:04:31.820> it<00:04:32.270> has<00:04:32.450> a<00:04:32.480> single<00:04:32.840> icon

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430
