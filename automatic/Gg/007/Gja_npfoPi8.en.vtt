00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.360
 and today is friday is what it is 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.910
 even very well today will bring a tip 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.980
 especially for blondes and that is 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.780
 now we know how hard it is 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.740
 we can keep the legal agreement 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.359
 in the hair 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.760
 We go to the pool and sunbathe. 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.500
 the hair starts to tide there and we 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.699
 starts getting desperate does not know the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.340
 what to do 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.650
 But I'm going to show you two today. 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.750
 products that I 'm always using and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.270
 I like them a lot 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.270
 is in relation to disarming the hair 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.579
 that helped me put that tone together 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.309
 the cheaper the platinum is the correct the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.640
 first I want to show you is 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.430
 so here I've been using for a long time is 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.579
 my floor people disarm and lau 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.710
 he is from l'oréal his name is 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:08.939
 silva silva da l'oreéal 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:13.490
 he has a well- concentrated kitchen is 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.490
 so the floor 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.150
 enough help is to disarm there is the shampoo 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.880
 common as any other ne 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.890
 But there are other advantages of it in 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.990
 Truth is the only one for me, not the only one. 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.659
 disadvantage of it is that it dries a lot 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.060
 hair but I think it's normal does it 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.900
 Foam people usually use lava 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.079
 Leave it for five minutes about that. 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.060
 not much else what sign he can leave 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.979
 the half-headed hair that I started to see 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.979
 well the floor 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.079
 his color is not right then we'll wash 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.649
 usually leaves for five minutes 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.750
 then you take it and you look beautiful like 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.210
 wonderful right 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.909
 now it's who I use to shampoo 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.250
 I advise you to have a good 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.980
 hydration to use later because it is 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.890
 very very much the hair the color stays 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.240
 wonderful but he received enough and 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.310
 so it is 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.470
 I already talked to some hairdressers and 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.010
 they recommend pracon to use shampoo 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.510
 desmazela once a month once 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.670
 every 15 days 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.100
 but as I am exaggerated it is not knowing 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.350
 that's how I really like this thing well 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.680
 clear wide open 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.730
 I every week and sometimes up to 12 in this 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.500
 I'll talk, I'll talk more, but it's him. 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.680
 get enough so it 's always good 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.660
 doing hydrations, you're not 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.360
 conditioner without rinsing also to 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.780
 able to maintain the healthier aspect of the 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.090
 hair right with the whole workbench I 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.880
 I'm going to wash there and I'll come back to show you the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.500
 second product is ready I came back now 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.250
 It's the single that I'll show there. 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.400
 You 're the one here and it's a mask. 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.830
 says it gives a silver- colored color 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.340
 hair 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.180
 her mark is this from here, the law that he 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.330
 would you like 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.330
 the name is this 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.430
 then it's up to I'll let you guys 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.220
 find these two products 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.299
 but talking about the mask is not her different 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.670
 silver 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.060
 she has a very positive point that she 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.810
 do not dry your hair so who already has 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.239
 one more film is susceptible to breakage already 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.660
 more fragile it is interesting to use 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.420
 Products like this right that would not 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.850
 that will not leave your hair as 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.060
 resected, do not abuse so much 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.610
 hair and this mask is very good too 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.950
 now she is not so powerful 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.810
 How silly are you? 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.060
 I notice that when I wash my hair with 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.820
 he only makes a joke with him. 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.910
 very big difference and the mask she 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.220
 say yellow 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.800
 it is a really good product but 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.410
 she does not have much power to yellow pain 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.280
 how much shampoo was a little more 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.840
 soft 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.019
 I'll put here a little hand to 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.260
 you will see 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:26.390
 she is up to her own and you can see 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:29.180
 what a little bit lighter 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:33.260
 than the whistle 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:37.580
 but as I said it has the positive 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:41.420
 not dry out the hair she has or 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.760
 because it is a mask it alone is already 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.990
 given to the site moisturizing the hair, right? 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.450
 the deep hydration he is 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:54.920
 wonderful that will make you super 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:59.180
 satisfied but do not dry it already already 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:01.430
 It is a very good point, she is not used 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.700
 as the normal mask is not 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.070
 one should have their hair washed in 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:11.780
 apply more or less 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:14.480
 two minutes and take a rinse 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.750
 this is a sure tip today these two 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.750
