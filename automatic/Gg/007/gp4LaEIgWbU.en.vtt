 as if it were a picture frame 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.810
 here we have the main power setting 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.370

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.750
 many people call me here at 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.400
 store here we always work with 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.560
 gps update 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.389
 talking to my gps is very dark 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.590
 often followed by regulated light 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:37.650
 here in the light after the light here central 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.739
 to increase 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.250
 sometimes it is so within 10 seconds of 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.870
 water gps it works a little bit it turns off 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.239
 this mistrust is the configuration of 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.940
 late if set to 10 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.700
 seconds and 30 seconds in minute two 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.139
 minutes three minutes or never 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.930
 I recommend leaving it here you go 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.730
 use the gps always on but not 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.829
 that you will be listening to music with 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.580
 He put it there to disconnect more then 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.850
 if you're using it as another way 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.550
 ps leave here as never another tip for 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.160
 you the question of the volume also the 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.900
 people nobody complains much analog 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.110
 already think like a bass 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.330
 No one here is increasing this volume here. 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.900
 this sound that is the sounded click here of the 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:29.160
 that you will use his keys there every 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.300
 one has a taste in that aquino soft pet 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.880
 language that is also 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.330
 Portuguese and Italian French and English 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.280
 always in Portuguese here the information 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.240
 is that you will be looking for the 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.130
 satellites 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.990

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.700
 customer came here that triggered this 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.850
 reset there was a bit tricky to 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.800
 reverse this whole situation we have the date 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.180

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.390

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.540

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.720
