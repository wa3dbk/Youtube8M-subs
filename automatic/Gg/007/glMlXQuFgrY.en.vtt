00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:09.080
 Yes Hello It is length 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:13.620
 I finally started to make it a mini four-wheel drive also recently but yesterday I guess that finally 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:17.660
 And now it feels like this now 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.180
 Black a part on red ma chassis 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:25.340
 This is a 4 thickness of 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:30.619
 I tried to make everything black in the g and h green specials to avoid 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.560
 Hey but it is temporarily assembled just have a little think Te'm red of a Perth mirror 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:38.420
 It is such a feeling 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:40.240
 I have never was little known in the Tteyuu this ma chassis 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.920
 I'm not too 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:48.379
 I have replaced it with a new one 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.660
 I 'm thinking about it a little now, but it's a torque tune 2 motor. 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:55.010
 Combine superspeed gear with 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:01:00.090
 I'm thinking about it, but it's a bit like the big night scene is small with this 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:04.940
 Too is this door a little distracted even though is around now 26 mm 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:10.310
 I think that speed does not come out I think that only about 25 kg comes out at max 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.210
 I think that there is no problem with cornering or rising because acceleration is so good because it is over 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.120
 But 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:21.300
 I think that the clip is also quite low correspondence and it is a bit bad 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:24.570
 In Well I'm such not seen in gold in the upper theme, but of Shito serves as the roller if do here 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:29.340

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.480

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.100

 Yes this is my room 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.880
 Seen from the other side 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.710

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.490

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:03.409
 Yes there are many 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:05.810
 If the green onions and the 9 I could only round of convenience on the cat of Nechotto space, but in the here 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.710
 In that you will be able to die 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.180
 It was brought 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:16.359
 Just a little bit 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.359

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:26.900
