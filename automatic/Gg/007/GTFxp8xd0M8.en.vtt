00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:06.430

 let you show a recorded video this 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.830
 It's a bit more time-consuming to close people. 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.440
 doing here is not slow 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.069
 I will try the faster its 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.379
 next coming years because it is here that 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.610
 I have here look at this bug here not 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:10.750

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:13.180
 source of concerns on something else 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.049
 It's also the single if it's what 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.400
 portal 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.739
 I also learned that this man 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.139
 portal so I will not bring but now 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.740

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:26.340
 do here the channel and also ocelot 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.340
 death knows 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.670
 the more you earn too 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:38.020
 here you can get the 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:42.460
 subway has the head of the bugs that the 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:45.580
 flower pot was not the same 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.360
 because I touched that it was only 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.180
 that 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.440
 the heads thing is also much more 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:05:00.550
 table also also have to nery 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:01.840
 rooms on top golden already had people 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.690
 know a little more time 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:11.320
 close not only show what has to be 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:14.800
 well you will not have dinner 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:22.810
 that's going to show I'm going to try to change looks 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:26.680
 here in this head that I will oppose 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:30.720
 I find it interesting that he will now have 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.720
 position and now will pass through their rival 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.800
 accept your rival 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.650
 and look, now it's got to have food looks 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.810
 food bar and food work 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:52.170
 why the potion when putting the deal 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.170
 do promotion that is going to be put up 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:59.370
 put what to do for Swiss not that 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.370
 I think the opposition is more of this 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:06.480
 Obviously I hope you bring it here. 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:11.490
 The portal will try to find out 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:15.300
 listening to what you 're doing here is 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:19.260
 You want to know that too, so I'm going. 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:21.480
 show that there was a big thank you to 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.510

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:30.620
