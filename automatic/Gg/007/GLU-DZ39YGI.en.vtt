00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
asking what's a good way of training a

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.180 
asking what's a good way of training a
strength<00:04:03.180> pure<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.720> if<00:04:04.290> there's<00:04:04.440> any<00:04:04.590> quests

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
strength pure and if there's any quests

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.580 
strength pure and if there's any quests
like<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:05.670> can<00:04:05.850> be<00:04:05.970> done<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.290> know<00:04:07.380> just

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
like that can be done to you know just

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.470 
like that can be done to you know just
produce<00:04:07.769> strength<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.940> think<00:04:09.299> there's

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
produce strength and I think there's

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.330 
produce strength and I think there's
only<00:04:09.690> one<00:04:09.930> which<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.769> bit<00:04:10.980> annoying<00:04:11.070> but

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
only one which is a bit annoying but

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.190 
only one which is a bit annoying but
that<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:11.880> scorpion<00:04:12.420> catcher<00:04:12.660> so<00:04:12.930> definitely

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
that is scorpion catcher so definitely

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.930 
that is scorpion catcher so definitely
check<00:04:13.290> that<00:04:13.410> out<00:04:13.560> if<00:04:13.650> you're<00:04:13.980> keen<00:04:14.190> with<00:04:14.730> that

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
I think you get like I think it's like

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.000 
I think you get like I think it's like
6k<00:04:16.890> arms<00:04:17.700> strength<00:04:18.630> XP<00:04:18.989> there's<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:19.799> few

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
lot of people have been talking to have

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.710 
lot of people have been talking to have
been<00:04:59.280> you<00:04:59.430> know<00:04:59.550> finding<00:04:59.880> them<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.060> grind<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:00.630> a

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
Slayer I mean that was a lot of fun

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.840 
Slayer I mean that was a lot of fun
that's<00:06:25.860> got<00:06:26.190> a<00:06:26.220> lot<00:06:26.430> of<00:06:26.460> memories<00:06:26.820> and

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
that's got a lot of memories and

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.670 
that's got a lot of memories and
everything<00:06:27.330> and<00:06:27.510> I<00:06:28.110> was<00:06:28.229> actually<00:06:28.410> really

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
everything and I was actually really

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.300 
everything and I was actually really
surprised<00:06:29.370> at<00:06:29.669> how<00:06:29.940> hard<00:06:30.750> L<00:06:31.020> varg<00:06:31.260> was<00:06:31.500> to<00:06:32.070> kill

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
surprised at how hard L varg was to kill

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.010 
surprised at how hard L varg was to kill
but<00:06:32.669> then<00:06:32.880> again<00:06:33.000> I<00:06:33.180> guess<00:06:33.210> I'm<00:06:33.570> really<00:06:33.900> low

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
but then again I guess I'm really low

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.409 
but then again I guess I'm really low
level<00:06:34.320> and<00:06:34.410> everything<00:06:34.770> but<00:06:35.610> yeah<00:06:35.760> I<00:06:35.820> didn't

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
level and everything but yeah I didn't

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:37.850 
level and everything but yeah I didn't

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
remember him being that hard and I was

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.020 
remember him being that hard and I was
really<00:06:38.039> lucky<00:06:38.220> that<00:06:38.400> I<00:06:38.520> actually<00:06:38.610> ended<00:06:38.880> up

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
really lucky that I actually ended up

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.420 
really lucky that I actually ended up
killing<00:06:39.240> him<00:06:39.450> the<00:06:39.900> second<00:06:40.289> attempt

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430
