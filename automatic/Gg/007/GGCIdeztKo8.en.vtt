00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.799
 hello friends with you tiberian 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.340
 and this is the 41st edition of the master category for all 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.230
 tanks 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.480
 heading in which I'm trying to get on 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.400
 klassnost master on technique name 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.410
 which you specify in the comments 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.359
 I remind you that in the description of this video 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.070
 There is a list of tanks that have already been 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.990
 received and mark class master 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.730
 so before you write the name of the tank 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.080
 for the next issue, have a look 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.280
 please to this list 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.540
 but today we will talk about fv215b 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.640
 British heavy tank of the tenth level 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.950
 which you have been asking me for quite a while 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.750
 show in comments below 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.730
 issues in again in collective 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.289
 cooperated and scored pretty 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.360
 many likes just for this 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.730
 comment continue in the same vein and 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.440
 maybe your tank will be a hero 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.660
 one of the following releases 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.190
 a night story about this british 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.230
 please go share with you 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.780
 how many battles did I need to 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.010
 get the wizard do you think 10 fights 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.430
 20 maybe 30 no guys and not even 50 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.740
 I am 60 in the general record of 70 battles 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.450
 which kept us 12 release was 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.010
 beaten because I needed 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.680
 seventy nine fights 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.170
 seventy nine fights on a flash drive to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.810
 get a master and confess to you from me 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.360
 for a long time not burned and burned not from 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.310
 the tank itself from what you learn 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.270
 after i talk about technical 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.610
 characteristics 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.729
 this machine to start as usual 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.799
 let's discuss the dynamics in 215 as for 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.600
 heavy tank it is quite normal 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.070
 maximum speed forward 34 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.470
 kilometers per hour he is gaining it 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.810
 fast enough and can support a 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.549
 here back our british back up pretty 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.860
 slow with just 12 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.329
 kilometers per hour it spins on the spot it 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.729
 pretty fast so not everyone 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.740
 the average tank can spin you but 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.600
 with return to base protection or from shift 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.040
 Directions flash drive there is of course 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.390
 certain problem in mind small 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.250
 maximum speed 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.470
 so if you want to do it then 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.930
 do it in advance 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.450
 as for booking, it's fair 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.420
 speaking from a flash drive I was expecting a little but by 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.800
 compared to the previous British tyazh 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.430
 215 has a pretty good frontal 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.000
 armor 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.650
 and this applies to the hull and tower 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.540
 of course the lower armor smashes in at 7 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.220
 and moreover, one time he makes his way with 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.380
 crit fuel tanks with this 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.720
 lights up not only the tank but also your chair 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.490
 two fires for a flash drive fight 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.740
 OK, but here is the top armor sheet 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.660
 pleasantly surprises he constantly beat off 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.210
 shells from from pawns at tyazhy 10 level 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.890
 sometimes even from tricks but unfortunately 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.690
 against premium shells nowhere 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.510
 trample and they will instill you 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.490
 top admixture without problems in the tower too 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.260
 very good at keeping a punch but since 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.390
 this is the tower itself is in the back 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.880
 the hull is not always her tank 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.250
 it turns out a weak point here is 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.680
 the roof of the tower which breaks through very 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.550
 good because there are only 51 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.560
 millimeter armor 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.140
 but the commander's turret makes its way 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.510
 I do not always want to separately note that 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.430
 to tank on a flash drive overboard is not the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.040
 best idea because in the boards also 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.050
 only 51 millimeters of armor and often 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.450
 enemy shells even under the wildest 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.610
 Angle fly in with no damage 6 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.500
 millimeter screen from subscale or 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.380
 armor-piercing shells unfortunately not 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.870
 will save and now let's talk about 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.230
 the most enjoyable thing a flash drive is I think 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.820
 do not lie if I say that the guns fv215b 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.970
 is the best weapon among all 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.160
 heavy tanks on the tenth level 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.760
 piercing an armor-piercing shell from him 260 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.670
 millimeters 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.090
 subcaliber 326 one-time damage 400 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.040
 units 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.570
 it would seem nothing spectacular 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.120
 let's understand further 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.010
 further accuracy and time information none 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.989
 heavy tank on the tenth level except 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.799
 flash drives can not boast such 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.320
 indicators 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.480
 033 per 100 meters and one whole seven 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.610
 tenths of a second respectively 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.470
 this guns possess are simply awesome 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.420
 stabilize you can shoot on the go 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.970
 you can shoot from the guard and at the same time 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.950
 you will often get recharge 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.930
 with ventilation rammer and combat 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.400
 brotherhood will take a little more than 7 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.500
 seconds and vertical guidance angles 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.900
 pretty good even though 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.689
 that the tower is located 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.019
 back 7 degrees down and 15 degrees 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.450
 up 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.730
 that is why I think it is a weapon 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.890
 is the best among all strands 10 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.900
 its level is probably the only one 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.789
 disadvantage is a small ammunition 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.400
 thirty five shells which with such 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.530
 recharge very quickly ends in 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.930
 conclusion you need to remember about the review he 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.850
 is 410 meters recommend 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.729
 put the coated optics and then 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.070
 you'll be the most sighted heavy tank 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.080
 and now my friends have this 79 fight 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.180
 slowly coming to an end and I will tell 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.280
 why did i burn so badly 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.410
 seventy nine fights this of course 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.280
 quite a lot and in the end I just 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.780
 started getting tired 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.760
 but if this tank were not so 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.740
 cool then bombanulo finally 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.110
 I would be much earlier but it's all the little things 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.240
 but the main cause of fire is not 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.610
 only fuel tanks but also my chair 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.580
 it was of course she and guys 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.740
 precisely the enemy artillery which is a little 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.440
 whether not in every battle there were three or four 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.030
 pieces in a team and you know why 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.669
 in a strange way it turned out that 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.190
 Often this artillery and head cocked 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.130
 and not allied e100 which stood side by side 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.650
 not even the mouse and and not interested in it 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.660
 for some reason she shot at me and even 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.520
 in this battle as you can see the enemy 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.650
 artillery did not cheat me 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.870
 as a result I had to 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.240
 inspect the end of the battle from the hangar and 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.849
 pray will choose to give me 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.430
 finally the master of happiness my prayers 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.979
 have been heard and this week suffering 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.380
 for me finally ended in 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.720
 Conclusion I want to say that the flash drive is very 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.900
 cool so play it while it is still 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.849
 there is less artillery to you in battles on 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.470
 that's all for today thanks for all 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.599
 attention with you was now am 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.760
 subscribe to the feed here's the file and not 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.120
 forget to look at my channel before 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.120
 new meetings
