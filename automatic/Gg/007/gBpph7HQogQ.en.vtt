see<00:01:59.080> this<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.350> slightly<00:01:59.710> more<00:01:59.950> sheer

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
see this is a slightly more sheer

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.850 
see this is a slightly more sheer
formula<00:02:00.820> then<00:02:01.570> never<00:02:02.020> enough<00:02:02.290> nude<00:02:02.530> which<00:02:02.710> I

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
formula then never enough nude which I

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.320 
formula then never enough nude which I
definitely<00:02:03.100> got<00:02:03.280> more<00:02:03.460> opaque<00:02:03.790> coverage<00:02:04.060> you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
definitely got more opaque coverage you

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.840 
definitely got more opaque coverage you
can<00:02:04.390> see<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.690> color<00:02:04.930> of<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:06.160> lip<00:02:06.340> color<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.640> lot

morning<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:22.600> I<00:02:22.630> figured<00:02:22.959> I<00:02:23.020> would<00:02:23.170> do<00:02:23.260> these<00:02:23.380> so

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
morning so I figured I would do these so

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.220 
morning so I figured I would do these so
I'll<00:02:24.790> take<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.060> off<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.920> coral<00:02:27.520> pop<00:02:28.230> and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
I'll take it off this is coral pop and

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.160 
I'll take it off this is coral pop and
it<00:02:29.440> really<00:02:29.620> is<00:02:29.739> true<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.250> color<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:34.170> take

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
it really is true to the color and take

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.449 
it really is true to the color and take
clothes<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:36.209> take<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.300> off<00:02:37.420> when<00:02:41.280> they<00:02:42.280> say

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
clothes and take it off when they say

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.060 
clothes and take it off when they say
lip<00:02:42.610> injection<00:02:43.120> these<00:02:44.050> are<00:02:44.380> meant<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.800> be<00:02:44.830> lip

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
lip injection these are meant to be lip

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:53.490 
lip injection these are meant to be lip
plumping

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.580 

so<00:02:54.500> they're<00:02:54.650> definitely<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:55.010> tingly<00:02:55.580> feel<00:02:56.590> and

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
so they're definitely a tingly feel and

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.570 
so they're definitely a tingly feel and
I<00:02:57.680> don't<00:02:57.709> know<00:02:57.890> you<00:02:58.010> can<00:02:58.159> judge<00:02:58.340> for<00:02:58.519> yourself

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
I don't know you can judge for yourself

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.729 
I don't know you can judge for yourself
whether<00:02:58.909> my<00:02:59.269> lips<00:02:59.510> look<00:02:59.720> plumper<00:02:59.750> I<00:03:00.470> guess

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
whether my lips look plumper I guess

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.580 
whether my lips look plumper I guess
they<00:03:00.920> do<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.099> little<00:03:01.340> bit<00:03:01.519> um<00:03:02.360> maybe<00:03:03.080> not<00:03:03.290> I

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
they do a little bit um maybe not I

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.140 
they do a little bit um maybe not I
don't<00:03:03.860> know<00:03:03.920> let<00:03:04.129> plumping<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.610> me<00:03:04.730> I'm<00:03:04.970> never

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
don't know let plumping to me I'm never

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.570 
don't know let plumping to me I'm never
overawed<00:03:05.900> by<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.290> results<00:03:06.709> i<00:03:06.799> can<00:03:06.980> go<00:03:07.099> yeah<00:03:07.340> I

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
overawed by the results i can go yeah I

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.170 
overawed by the results i can go yeah I
sort<00:03:07.879> of<00:03:07.970> see<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.299> but<00:03:08.629> the<00:03:09.590> coral<00:03:10.040> is<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.760> very

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
sort of see it but the coral is a very

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
sort of see it but the coral is a very
vibrant<00:03:12.340> true<00:03:13.340> coral<00:03:13.730> tone<00:03:13.970> it's<00:03:14.750> maybe<00:03:15.019> got<00:03:15.170> a

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
vibrant true coral tone it's maybe got a

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.809 
vibrant true coral tone it's maybe got a
little<00:03:15.290> bit<00:03:15.590> of<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:15.739> pink<00:03:16.040> undertone<00:03:16.459> I<00:03:16.489> think

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
little bit of a pink undertone I think

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.970 
little bit of a pink undertone I think
too<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:16.940> reminds<00:03:17.450> me<00:03:17.629> kind<00:03:17.840> of<00:03:17.900> I<00:03:18.379> would<00:03:18.860> call
