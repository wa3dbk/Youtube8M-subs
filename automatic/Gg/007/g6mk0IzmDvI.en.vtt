00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.620
 listened to the drum olympic 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.690
 this is a real revolution in the region 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.870
 neck drums he's not just gone for 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.360
 shore and maybe also smooth it 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.890
 I understand the drying programs, including 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.870
 delicate 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.400
 for 6 and so on he has special 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.950
 smoothing programs with 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.790
 the steam generator bar itself is inside the steam 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.849
 steam generator water 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.710
 it is flooded with water 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.270
 for starters you can pour water 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.510
 independently if of course a tablecloth but 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.030
 in general, it is poured 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.380
 automatically 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.740
 this tank 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.630
 in this compartment if its top of the toggle switch 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.250
 worth it 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.490
 if you leave the position of experience new 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.300
 do it by hand but i think big 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.680
 some users of course use 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.760
 it's on the stage to stroke 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.720
 she with the help and with the help of an ax 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.610
 on the right of the country in blue are marked a 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.610
 park-based programs 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.620
 cotton 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.659
 synthetic shirt other fabrics 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.960
 not very interesting program program 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.530
 connections 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.530
 live which is intended for 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.030
 costume 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.150
 and this program allows you to delete for 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.020
 torture 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.380
 for example you were in a restaurant or were in 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.890
 smoky room and smooth out the folds 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.910
 we will lower after the car or after 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.390
 8 9 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.470
 let's try divorce for example 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.340
 rub these two dry naumenko and shirts 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.500
 they are clean but mint not to speak 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.410
 lays 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.360
 big drums 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.500
 a lot of space was successfully done there 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.430
 there is still a cotton shirt 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.520
 so I choose cotton program 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.160
 smoothing shirts with 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.670
 Download buttons here it is in English 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.170
 called tax 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.409
 I'm dying 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.470
 degree of load 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.640
 the minimum is one two shirts average 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.920
 this is 3 4 shirts small max this 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.070
 5 6 shirt 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.970
 we actually have two shirts therefore 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.280
 choosing at least all the rest at the construction site 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.320
 electronics do everything yourself 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.320
 what you need to do press the start key 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:10.359
 notice the screen appeared 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.109
 indication now the first filing set 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:14.159
 couple inside 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.540
 with words began his work 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.400
 and we clearly know when to finish it. 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.439
 because the screen also lights up and 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.329
 time is just 19 minutes by the way say 5 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.930
 6 shirts he will say about 20 20a 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.010
 one minute agree it is very 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.510
 a bit if you don’t try 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.920
 remember how much time you personally spend 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.639
 sometimes even outside at least one shirt 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.169
 back to the novel's films in 15 minutes and 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.129
 look at the result 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.889
 but here comes to the end of the program 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.870
 smoothing literally less 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.520
 minutes 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.090
 what to do after 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.780
 a signal will sound to be made 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.759
 next get shirt 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:53.519
 hang on hangers and fasten the top 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.769
 button by the way pay attention 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.709
 sounded but did not stop working 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.230
 it happened on social security 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.699
 prosperity because if you notice 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:03.189
 go ahead 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.639
 just stop will run the computer 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:06.519
 it came true 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.559
 my father 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:09.650
 in one he stopped work 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.069
 we get 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.309
 one of the shirts 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:16.080
 she will be slightly wet 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.409
 it is felt that it was treated with steam 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.149
 top president 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.799
 and buttoning the top button 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.239
 at the beginning, but as soon as they sent the shirt to 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.859
 it has a little wavy well and not 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.569
 need to give a little time literally two 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.849
 three minutes it will become and you pull then 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.109
 the result will be very noticeable let's 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.189
 wait two three minutes 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:39.389
 so we will distribute the shirt with 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.379
 a couple I hung just a couple of minutes 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.909
 on the shoulders of execution heathens and now 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.999
 well enough to see how 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:50.560
 nice doesn't look like ooo shirt with a point 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:53.059
 view of the lack of stock 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:55.370
 Of course the result of the arena riga 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.230
 never matched 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.400
 but most people are given 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.610
 the results say that this is exactly what 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.689
 them 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.689
 but that's not all that arina knows 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:09.169
 pay attention to this sector of gas 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:12.909
 program here we can find delicately 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.069
 program for drying wool 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.949
 drying sports shoes one of the most 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.899
 big and difficult problems for more 

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:21.780
 parts of families 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.490
 features a period of time it is drying 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.669
 woolen draw because they can not hang 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.919
 because they cannot be stretched 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.370
 all six 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.830
 per hectare special 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.370
 Cyprus devices yen or something else 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.220
 because they simply can’t get dry 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.110
 to iron 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.050
 they can simply be put on breakage 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.310
 towels for some material 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.629
 so many do they see the opportunity 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:47.339
 8 as it is known, it usually leaves 

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:48.919
 a lot of time 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.870
 then nights when the whole day and what not 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.449
 very useful thing is that the longer 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.430
 the fabric contains moisture 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.270
 the more likely the cancer is 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.759
 that there will develop bacteria 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.270
 so a tumble dryer is just 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.500
 indispensable in the device just for 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.749
 such situations program 6 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:08.129
 This is a particularly delicate program that 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:09.189
 It allows us to 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:12.389
 dry one two or even three sweaters when 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.779
 very low temperature and 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:15.760
 gently rotating the drum 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.990
 we avoid the risk of deforming 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.389
 fabric or change the rules of the formula 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.669
 markup we get absolutely 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.509
 neat and gentle listened if u 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:28.580
 you have a particularly delicate even then 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.939
 complete Alena and bring here such 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:33.719
 shelf 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:36.180
 you can put her husband 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.020
 dryer drum 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.849
 like this 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:41.879
 so that two metal frets do not 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:43.060
 grabbed the edge 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.550
 opening the doors of the bus drums and 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.139
 put your sweaters right on top so he 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.919
 did not retreat mechanical 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:50.949
 stresses 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.960
 we choose the program 6 Kyivstar 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.710
 moment dried 7 it will be determined with 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.789
 there is no help of automation 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.910
 the risk of overdrying hryvnia is also 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.139
 shelf can be used for 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:04.350
 drying shoes 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.010
 for the sake of such a gym are well known 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.490
 and that after playing sports both come true 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.860
 wet to avoid 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.469
 problems sportive sports shoes 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:17.649
 and subsequent inconveniences it can 

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:19.669
 use again the program 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:21.610
 6 or areas we acquired here 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.430
 written sports shoes and this 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.169
