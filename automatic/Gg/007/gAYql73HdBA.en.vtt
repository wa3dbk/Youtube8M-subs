00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:20.500
 no this is my career went situation 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:26.120
 exploitation and burn problem i'm on 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:28.960
 track 5 here we have a seeker on 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.960
 if you knock 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.039
 we listened now to the killings this 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.170
 the problem here is not worth the rack 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:53.370
 really flow and it's time them 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.140
 replace rather complicated mode 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.530
 holes cope then I decided 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.089
 to come north and pass is difficult 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.280
 far away 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:05.850
 I already bought competent specialists 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.530
 headlights firm from and 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.110
 Gloriously forge bought rack this firm 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.990
 but you need to make sure the policies of goods breakthrough 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.360
 packing code we have. 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.789
 we erase the protective layer well, or 12 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:28.869
 Digit code to send 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:31.810
 to number 2 420 I received an sms about what 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.710
 I bought Pauline goods just a group from at &amp; t 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.710
 the period is calm 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.159
 for a start we will raise the car on 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.159
 convenient level for us 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.579
 unscrew the wheels 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:58.830
 Now you need to remove the sprint protecting 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.650
 by unscrewing and unscrewing the nut on 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.130
 19 securing steering bipod 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.130
 racks 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.310
 for removing the steering tip from 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.490
 rack nipples we use special 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.490
 ruling 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.270
 we will disconnect the steering tip from 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.080
 stand now proceed so manual 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.420
 the stand itself for this we connect the sensor 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.960
 dogs brake hose from they are not us 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:34.209
 interfered now unscrew the most rack 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:36.700
 knuckle they all pass 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.860
 well it happens that they are very strong 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.820
 sticks on and for this you have to attach 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.520
 efforts neatly there what they need 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.470
 to harm 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.739
 the same operation is punished on 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.940
 the other side here we are seeing what 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.700
 our reception desk is in full 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.890
 working condition since it flowed out 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.940
 oil from sometimes people come and changes 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.489
 how is that just out of order 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.520
 better we recommend changing from both 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.520
 parties 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:18.330
 so finally remove the rack us 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:25.020
 now you need to unscrew 3 nuts for 13 everything 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:28.230
 sang take out how much do we see new 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.540
 we will stand without springs to 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.150
 move the springs from the old racks to 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.520
 new we need to sort and oblique 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.489
 for this we use a stand for 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.800
 disassembly-assembly of steel, we fixed 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:46.820
 spring so that it does not have a shot and 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.820
 after that, unscrew the nut 22 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.980
 your understand here 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:00.269
 here we see that the supports are good 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.860
 state of the bearing should 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:07.409
 good standing not now we relax 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.409
 spring remove it 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.920
 do not forget to shake before installing 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.410
 rack manually 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.410
 5-6 times dress 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:45.240
 all now we tighten the nut on 22 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:47.700
 to fix the spring as we 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.080
 tightened the nut after that check that 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.070
 we returned 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:56.670
 reliance on bearings tincture we 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.120
 ready with the second how much we are doing 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.120
 same 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.730
 Well, all the racks of us are now assembled 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.180
 proceed to install will not be confused 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.070
 left with the right support there is such a 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.190
 the arrow of this arrow we put 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.190
 forward 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.590
 Once we stand still is now no 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.720
 spam to her suspension appearance in order 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.430
 so that the bolts and next time not 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.430
 stuck we grease 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:31.710
 reattach the brake hose to 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:34.080
 rack and about fishing rod delirium we changed to 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:38.360
 this car front desk now 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.360
 you need to walk the villages suffered 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:01.190
 I am glad that I installed the original 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.630
 stand group from me I have to 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:07.210
 long road
