our<00:00:34.380> goal<00:00:34.739> was<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.980> give<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.219> platform<00:00:35.460> and

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
our goal was to give you a platform and

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.610 
our goal was to give you a platform and
you<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.300> some<00:00:36.450> cool<00:00:36.480> stuff<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:36.960> so

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
you can do some cool stuff on it so

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.830 
you can do some cool stuff on it so
first<00:00:37.890> thing<00:00:37.980> I'm<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> do<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.629> I<00:00:39.629> am

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
first thing I'm going to do is I am

first thing I'm going to do is I am
going<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.770> add<00:00:40.920> some<00:00:40.950> media<00:00:42.379> so<00:00:43.379> let's<00:00:43.530> go

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
going to add some media so let's go

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.740 
going to add some media so let's go
ahead<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.129> let's<00:00:44.520> look<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:46.219> all<00:00:47.219> right

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
ahead and let's look for this all right

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.160 
ahead and let's look for this all right
now<00:00:48.750> came<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.829> here<00:00:50.070> earlier<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.600> practice<00:00:51.989> I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
now came in here earlier to practice I

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.900 
now came in here earlier to practice I
could<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.620> used<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.920> whole<00:00:53.129> lot<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.430> different

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
could have used a whole lot of different

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.700 
could have used a whole lot of different
videos<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:55.020> could<00:00:55.199> have<00:00:55.289> shot<00:00:55.379> some<00:00:55.530> cool

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
videos and I could have shot some cool

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.869 
videos and I could have shot some cool
stuff<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.219> whatever<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.640> thought<00:00:56.760> you

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
stuff and whatever but I thought you

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:57.799 
stuff and whatever but I thought you
know<00:00:56.969> be<00:00:57.090> kind<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.270> more<00:00:57.360> meaningful<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.750> I

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
know be kind of more meaningful if I

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.599 
know be kind of more meaningful if I
just<00:00:57.960> use<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.260> rule<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.070> came<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.399> shot

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
just use this rule so I came in I shot

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.560 
just use this rule so I came in I shot
this<00:00:59.730> room<00:00:59.910> when<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.059> was<00:01:00.239> empty<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:02.539> took<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
this room when it was empty and took a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.479 
this room when it was empty and took a
little<00:01:03.719> quick<00:01:03.899> pan<00:01:04.170> across<00:01:04.439> when<00:01:05.250> there<00:01:05.369> was

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489
