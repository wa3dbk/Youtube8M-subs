00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
the things I originally came with it

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.310 
the things I originally came with it
originally<00:00:32.850> came<00:00:32.880> with<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.829> dude<00:00:34.829> dish<00:00:35.989> but<00:00:36.989> I

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
originally came with a dude dish but I

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.750 
originally came with a dude dish but I
use<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.190> as<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> dust<00:00:39.000> bath<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:41.809> I<00:00:43.430> put<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.460> on

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
use it as a dust bath and I put that on

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.940 
use it as a dust bath and I put that on
my<00:00:44.910> second<00:00:45.329> floor<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.260> second<00:00:46.649> floor<00:00:46.680> is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
my second floor and the second floor is

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.810 
my second floor and the second floor is
adjustable<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:49.070> tip<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.550> keep<00:00:50.670> it

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
adjustable to and tip I like to keep it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.029 
adjustable to and tip I like to keep it
low<00:00:51.000> because<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:53.870> moves<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.410> but<00:00:55.800> this

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
low because this moves with it but this

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.299 
low because this moves with it but this
one<00:00:56.100> stays<00:00:56.699> out<00:00:56.940> high<00:00:57.120> no<00:00:57.180> matter<00:00:57.420> what<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.309> so

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
one stays out high no matter what and so

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.330 
one stays out high no matter what and so
this<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.270> thru<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:01.050> up<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.710> second<00:01:02.309> floor

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
this is thru just up to the second floor

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.289 
this is thru just up to the second floor
and<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.850> goes<00:01:03.090> all<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.420> way<00:01:03.690> through<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
and this goes all the way through to the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.660 
and this goes all the way through to the
bingo<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.659> my<00:01:07.080> history<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.100> hideout

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.590 

and<00:01:12.470> this<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.680> adjustable<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:15.090> turn<00:01:15.420> it

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
and this is adjustable you can turn it

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:24.410

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
blockers or two black holes for tubes

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.460 
blockers or two black holes for tubes
and<00:02:36.270> then<00:02:37.270> what<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.290> put<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.830> in<00:02:38.980> here<00:02:39.090> was<00:02:40.090> a
