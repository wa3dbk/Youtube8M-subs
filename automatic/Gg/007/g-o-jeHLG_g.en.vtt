this is really I mean this is where all
the<00:00:59.290> functionality<00:00:59.890> is<00:00:59.950> that<00:01:00.100> right<00:01:00.309> here

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
the functionality is that right here

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.569 
the functionality is that right here

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
this is a little iPhone dock right here

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.280 
this is a little iPhone dock right here
it's<00:01:03.579> got<00:01:03.730> the<00:01:03.850> standard<00:01:04.030> 30<00:01:04.570> peg<00:01:04.809> connector

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
if you don't actually have a cord into

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.529 
if you don't actually have a cord into
this<00:01:11.289> thing<00:01:11.590> all<00:01:12.579> the<00:01:12.880> sound<00:01:13.090> is<00:01:13.240> actually

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
this thing all the sound is actually

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.090 
this thing all the sound is actually
going<00:01:13.659> to<00:01:13.899> be<00:01:14.049> coming<00:01:14.380> out<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.770> iPhone

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
going to be coming out of the iPhone

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.129 
going to be coming out of the iPhone
itself<00:01:15.490> it's<00:01:16.329> a<00:01:16.420> there's<00:01:16.719> a<00:01:16.749> little<00:01:16.869> bit<00:01:17.049> of

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:17.139 
itself it's a there's a little bit of

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:18.809 
itself it's a there's a little bit of
acoustic<00:01:17.529> amplification<00:01:17.920> in<00:01:18.340> here<00:01:18.549> in<00:01:18.670> this

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:18.819 
acoustic amplification in here in this

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:20.639 
acoustic amplification in here in this
little<00:01:18.880> dock<00:01:19.299> right<00:01:19.479> here<00:01:19.659> so<00:01:19.840> it<00:01:20.259> does<00:01:20.469> get

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
little dock right here so it does get

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.069 
little dock right here so it does get
pretty<00:01:20.679> loud<00:01:21.329> at<00:01:22.329> least<00:01:22.509> loud<00:01:22.689> enough<00:01:22.959> to

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
pretty loud at least loud enough to

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.370 
pretty loud at least loud enough to
drown<00:01:23.259> out<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.439> sound<00:01:23.529> of<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.670> strings<00:01:25.380> which

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
drown out the sound of the strings which

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.830 
drown out the sound of the strings which
are<00:01:26.909> totally<00:01:27.909> out<00:01:27.939> of<00:01:28.060> tune<00:01:28.299> right<00:01:28.450> now<00:01:28.630> that

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
are totally out of tune right now that

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.809 
are totally out of tune right now that
doesn't<00:01:29.020> really<00:01:29.259> matter<00:01:29.920> though<00:01:30.279> I<00:01:30.310> mean<00:01:30.639> all

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
doesn't really matter though I mean all

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.989 
doesn't really matter though I mean all
of<00:01:30.849> the<00:01:31.319> all<00:01:32.319> the<00:01:32.709> sensing<00:01:33.130> is<00:01:33.249> being<00:01:33.789> down<00:01:33.969> to

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999 
of the all the sensing is being down to

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:35.039 
of the all the sensing is being down to
the<00:01:34.090> bridge<00:01:34.359> right<00:01:34.509> here<00:01:34.569> and<00:01:34.899> there's

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
the bridge right here and there's

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.749 
the bridge right here and there's
there's<00:01:35.349> some<00:01:35.560> touch<00:01:35.740> sensors<00:01:36.130> here<00:01:36.429> as<00:01:36.520> well

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
there's some touch sensors here as well

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.120 
there's some touch sensors here as well
this<00:01:37.299> is<00:01:37.479> basically<00:01:37.899> an<00:01:38.139> educational<00:01:38.859> device

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
this is basically an educational device

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.599 
this is basically an educational device
so<00:01:39.819> you<00:01:40.599> use<00:01:40.929> the<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.499> free<00:01:41.740> gee-tar<00:01:42.099> app<00:01:42.340> down

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
so you use the the free gee-tar app down

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:44.609 
so you use the the free gee-tar app down
here<00:01:43.029> there's<00:01:43.779> a<00:01:43.840> number<00:01:43.990> of<00:01:44.109> different

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
here there's a number of different

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.889 
here there's a number of different
settings<00:01:44.919> we<00:01:45.009> have<00:01:45.130> an<00:01:45.219> easy<00:01:45.549> right<00:01:45.819> now<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.869> I

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
settings we have an easy right now so I

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.359 
settings we have an easy right now so I
don't<00:01:47.169> look<00:01:47.289> like<00:01:47.349> too<00:01:47.649> much<00:01:47.770> of<00:01:47.829> an<00:01:48.009> ass<00:01:48.130> on
