I<00:03:56.459> don't<00:03:56.970> think<00:03:57.239> it's<00:03:57.419> worth<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:57.989> for<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.440> one

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
I don't think it's worth it for that one

I don't think it's worth it for that one
mpg<00:03:59.400> gain<00:03:59.669> just<00:04:00.299> keep<00:04:00.540> your<00:04:00.720> tires<00:04:00.989> pumped<00:04:01.319> up

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.420 
mpg gain just keep your tires pumped up
and<00:04:01.709> you<00:04:01.799> can<00:04:01.949> do<00:04:02.069> that<00:04:02.280> much<00:04:02.489> better

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.559 

now<00:04:09.430> I've<00:04:09.519> mentioned<00:04:09.909> before<00:04:09.939> when<00:04:10.299> I<00:04:10.329> Drive

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
now I've mentioned before when I Drive

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.179 
now I've mentioned before when I Drive
these<00:04:10.810> cars<00:04:11.109> right<00:04:11.349> when<00:04:11.530> they<00:04:11.650> arrive<00:04:11.920> at<00:04:12.099> the

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:12.189 
these cars right when they arrive at the

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:13.979 
these cars right when they arrive at the
scene<00:04:12.370> at<00:04:12.519> garage<00:04:12.760> first<00:04:13.239> time<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:13.480> get<00:04:13.750> in<00:04:13.870> I

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
scene at garage first time I get in I

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.539 
scene at garage first time I get in I
don't<00:04:14.049> look<00:04:14.230> at<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:14.500> badges<00:04:15.010> at<00:04:15.129> all<00:04:15.280> I<00:04:15.430> don't

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
don't look at the badges at all I don't

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.310 
don't look at the badges at all I don't
want<00:04:15.909> to<00:04:16.000> know<00:04:16.120> what<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.329> powertrain<00:04:16.840> is<00:04:17.109> I

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
want to know what the powertrain is I

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.620 
want to know what the powertrain is I
want<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.620> guess<00:04:17.919> cuz<00:04:18.699> that<00:04:18.850> tells<00:04:19.120> me<00:04:19.299> how<00:04:19.449> well

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
want to guess cuz that tells me how well

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.749 
want to guess cuz that tells me how well
it's<00:04:19.780> doing<00:04:19.900> its<00:04:20.139> job<00:04:20.380> so<00:04:21.100> when<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.280> got<00:04:21.459> in<00:04:21.639> this

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 
it's doing its job so when I got in this

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.580 
it's doing its job so when I got in this
car<00:04:22.000> I<00:04:22.300> figured<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:22.750> was<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:22.870> 2-liter<00:04:23.229> four

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
car I figured it was a 2-liter four

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.980 
car I figured it was a 2-liter four
that's<00:04:24.039> pretty<00:04:24.310> obvious<00:04:24.490> but<00:04:25.449> I<00:04:25.479> thought<00:04:25.810> it

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
that's pretty obvious but I thought it

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.529 
that's pretty obvious but I thought it
had<00:04:26.020> a<00:04:26.169> CVT<00:04:26.770> a<00:04:27.100> continuously<00:04:28.000> variable

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
had a CVT a continuously variable

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.120 
had a CVT a continuously variable
transmission<00:04:29.350> in<00:04:29.470> fact<00:04:29.740> it's<00:04:29.949> got<00:04:30.070> a

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
transmission in fact it's got a

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.370 
transmission in fact it's got a
six-speed<00:04:30.699> with<00:04:30.880> real<00:04:31.090> gears<00:04:31.419> that's<00:04:32.139> not<00:04:32.350> a

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
six-speed with real gears that's not a

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.189 
six-speed with real gears that's not a
good<00:04:32.620> thing<00:04:32.830> because<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.789> CVT<00:04:34.389> is<00:04:34.419> a<00:04:34.600> kind<00:04:35.110> of

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
good thing because the CVT is a kind of

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.320 
good thing because the CVT is a kind of
slippery<00:04:35.710> thing<00:04:36.099> in<00:04:36.280> most<00:04:36.490> cars<00:04:36.789> kind<00:04:37.210> of<00:04:37.270> an

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
slippery thing in most cars kind of an

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.180 
slippery thing in most cars kind of an
indecisive<00:04:37.780> gearbox<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.710> this<00:04:38.830> one<00:04:39.039> feels

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
that way to me I've got this eco button

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.900 
that way to me I've got this eco button

but it makes the car very numb so I

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.100 
but it makes the car very numb so I
disengage<00:04:59.440> it<00:04:59.650> and<00:05:00.090> it's<00:05:01.090> still<00:05:01.389> got<00:05:01.660> lots<00:05:01.870> of

disengage it and it's still got lots of

disengage it and it's still got lots of

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
gearbox programming it's not awful but

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.210
