00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:04.490 

okay<00:00:02.429> in<00:00:02.639> this<00:00:02.790> part<00:00:03.110> I'll<00:00:04.110> tell<00:00:04.350> you<00:00:04.410> about

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
okay in this part I'll tell you about

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.650 
okay in this part I'll tell you about
the<00:00:04.680> match<00:00:04.859> porting<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.430> them<00:00:05.580> doing<00:00:05.970> on<00:00:06.359> the

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
the match porting of them doing on the

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.330 
the match porting of them doing on the
intake<00:00:06.960> manifold<00:00:07.610> when<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.639> ordered<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:10.340> blown

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
intake manifold when I ordered the blown

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.160 
intake manifold when I ordered the blown
up<00:00:11.519> engine<00:00:11.849> from<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.059> records<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.750> asked<00:00:13.080> him

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
up engine from the records I asked him

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.259 
up engine from the records I asked him
to<00:00:13.290> throw<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.650> an<00:00:13.799> extra<00:00:13.889> intake<00:00:14.610> manifold<00:00:15.089> so

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
to throw in an extra intake manifold so

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.670 
to throw in an extra intake manifold so
I<00:00:15.330> could<00:00:15.480> port<00:00:15.719> match<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.080> while<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.350> head<00:00:16.500> was

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
I could port match it while the head was

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.910 
I could port match it while the head was
off<00:00:17.359> I<00:00:18.359> decided<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:19.170> go<00:00:19.289> with<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.680> gasket

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
off I decided to go with the gasket

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.400 
off I decided to go with the gasket
porting<00:00:20.460> method<00:00:20.850> because<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.990> mismatch

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
porting method because the mismatch

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.710 
porting method because the mismatch
between<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.880> head<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:26.480> manifold<00:00:27.480> on

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
between the head and the manifold on

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.550 
between the head and the manifold on
this<00:00:28.070> combination<00:00:29.070> was<00:00:29.340> very<00:00:29.880> very<00:00:30.210> tiny<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
this combination was very very tiny the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.560 
this combination was very very tiny the
I<00:00:31.830> was<00:00:32.070> actually<00:00:32.340> impressed<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.969> how<00:00:33.239> close

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
I was actually impressed that how close

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.190 
I was actually impressed that how close
they<00:00:34.140> matched<00:00:34.440> already<00:00:35.660> so<00:00:36.660> that's<00:00:36.840> why<00:00:36.960> using

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
they matched already so that's why using

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.160 
they matched already so that's why using
the<00:00:37.440> gasket<00:00:37.950> method<00:00:38.460> I've<00:00:38.930> not<00:00:39.930> really

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the gasket method I've not really

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.580 
the gasket method I've not really
changing<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.680> port<00:00:41.010> shape<00:00:41.340> hardly<00:00:41.850> at<00:00:41.940> all

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
changing the port shape hardly at all

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.840 
changing the port shape hardly at all
some<00:00:43.590> engines<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.399> careful

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
some engines you have to be careful

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.930 
some engines you have to be careful
because<00:00:45.739> you<00:00:46.739> can't<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.160> put<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> gasket<00:00:47.670> on

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
because you can't just put the gasket on

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.930 
because you can't just put the gasket on
and<00:00:48.120> then<00:00:48.210> scribe<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> outlines<00:00:49.110> because<00:00:49.940> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and then scribe the outlines because you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.420 
and then scribe the outlines because you
may<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.600> hold<00:00:52.350> like<00:00:52.620> half<00:00:52.829> an<00:00:53.039> inch<00:00:53.190> of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
may have to hold like half an inch of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.290 
may have to hold like half an inch of
aluminium<00:00:53.850> out<00:00:54.559> which<00:00:55.559> will<00:00:55.710> drastically

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
aluminium out which will drastically

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.930 
aluminium out which will drastically
change<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> shape<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> port<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
change the shape of the port and

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.729 
change the shape of the port and
possibly<00:00:59.940> slow<00:01:00.270> down<00:01:00.510> flow<00:01:00.899> which<00:01:01.199> would

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
possibly slow down flow which would

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.759 
possibly slow down flow which would
defeat<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.070> purpose<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.670> doing<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.439> on<00:01:04.439> these

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
defeat the purpose of doing it on these

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.429 
defeat the purpose of doing it on these
intake<00:01:05.129> ports<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.580> can<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:06.000> I've<00:01:06.780> used<00:01:07.020> ultra

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
intake ports you can see I've used ultra

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.039 
intake ports you can see I've used ultra
blue<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.890> what<00:01:08.820> I've<00:01:08.939> done<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.570> smeared

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
blue and what I've done is just smeared

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.130 
blue and what I've done is just smeared
it<00:01:10.140> around<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.590> outside<00:01:11.390> put<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> guy<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
it around the outside put the guy the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.260 
it around the outside put the guy the
manifold<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.189> bolted<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.610> together<00:01:14.970> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
manifold on and bolted it together and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.260 
manifold on and bolted it together and
then<00:01:15.450> let<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.659> cure<00:01:15.930> overnight<00:01:16.909> when<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> pulled

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
then let it cure overnight when I pulled

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.200 
then let it cure overnight when I pulled
it<00:01:18.390> apart<00:01:19.100> there<00:01:20.100> was<00:01:20.189> yeah<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
it apart there was yeah the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.270 
it apart there was yeah the
corresponding<00:01:21.840> marks<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.979> intake

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
corresponding marks on the intake

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.289 
corresponding marks on the intake
manifold<00:01:24.920> this<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.100> after<00:01:26.460> I've<00:01:26.580> just<00:01:27.150> get

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
manifold this is after I've just get

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.359 
manifold this is after I've just get
matched<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> head<00:01:27.869> exact<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.009> see<00:01:29.310> it

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
matched the head exact you can see it

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.179 
matched the head exact you can see it
there<00:01:29.549> I'll<00:01:29.700> get<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.850> bit<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.090> extra<00:01:30.270> light<00:01:31.189> what

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
there I'll get a bit of extra light what

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.590 
there I'll get a bit of extra light what
I<00:01:32.220> did<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> gasket<00:01:32.939> match<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.270> head<00:01:33.420> where

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
I did the gasket match the head where

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.240 
I did the gasket match the head where
you<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.810> see<00:01:34.020> there<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> very<00:01:34.740> small<00:01:35.100> amount

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
you can see there is a very small amount

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.819 
you can see there is a very small amount
on<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.670> port<00:01:36.119> there's<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.079> small<00:01:37.409> amount<00:01:37.680> on

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
on that port there's a small amount on

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.440 
on that port there's a small amount on
the<00:01:37.920> upper<00:01:38.159> right<00:01:38.340> corner<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.060> second

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the upper right corner of the second

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.100 
the upper right corner of the second
port<00:01:39.659> then<00:01:40.200> up<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.439> light<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.829> hoping<00:01:41.100> or<00:01:41.220> not

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
port then up this light is hoping or not

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.630 
port then up this light is hoping or not
the<00:01:43.110> second<00:01:43.470> port<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:44.250> most<00:01:44.490> of

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the second port here you can see most of

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.030 
the second port here you can see most of
that<00:01:44.759> wall<00:01:44.939> I've<00:01:45.149> barely<00:01:45.390> skimmed<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
that wall I've barely skimmed it and the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.499 
that wall I've barely skimmed it and the
first<00:01:47.310> port<00:01:47.579> there<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.970> there's<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.450> a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
first port there is there's just a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.660 
first port there is there's just a
little<00:01:48.720> up<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.990> corner<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:50.549> is

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
little up in the corner there so this is

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.410 
little up in the corner there so this is
how<00:01:50.790> close<00:01:51.090> they<00:01:51.899> were<00:01:51.930> already<00:01:52.380> matched<00:01:53.420> what

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
how close they were already matched what

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.190 
how close they were already matched what
I<00:01:54.450> did<00:01:54.720> was<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.470> set<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:57.570> head<00:01:57.750> as<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.079> is

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
I did was I just set the head as it is

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.660 
I did was I just set the head as it is
now<00:01:58.490> put<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> studs<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.689> then<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.460> put<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
now put the studs in and then I put the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.380 
now put the studs in and then I put the
gasket<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:04.549> did<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.729> way<00:02:05.790> because<00:02:06.119> this

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
gasket on I did it this way because this

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.609 
gasket on I did it this way because this
would<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.869> way<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.229> head<00:02:07.409> would<00:02:07.530> be

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
would be the way the head would be

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.900 
would be the way the head would be
orientated<00:02:08.009> when<00:02:08.280> you're<00:02:08.429> putting<00:02:08.819> it

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
orientated when you're putting it

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.780 
orientated when you're putting it
together<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.720> gasket<00:02:10.110> will<00:02:10.140> sit

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
together so the gasket will sit

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.770 
together so the gasket will sit
according<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:11.970> way<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.180> gravity<00:02:12.510> holds

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
according to the way the gravity holds

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.460 
according to the way the gravity holds
it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.770 
it
but<00:02:13.920> as<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.310> turns<00:02:14.550> out<00:02:14.760> anyway<00:02:15.300> these<00:02:15.540> are

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
but as it turns out anyway these are

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.780 
but as it turns out anyway these are
spaced<00:02:16.080> far<00:02:16.380> enough<00:02:16.560> apart<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.550> holes

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
spaced far enough apart that the holes

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.400 
spaced far enough apart that the holes
when<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.450> slide<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.810> gasket<00:02:19.170> on<00:02:19.260> there's

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
when you slide the gasket on there's

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.720 
when you slide the gasket on there's
actually<00:02:19.650> tension<00:02:20.070> there<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.400> gasket

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
actually tension there and the gasket

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.160 
actually tension there and the gasket
can't<00:02:20.940> move<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:22.200> as<00:02:22.890> long<00:02:23.040> as<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.310> use<00:02:24.170> gravity

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
can't move so as long as you use gravity

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.930 
can't move so as long as you use gravity
basically<00:02:25.740> as<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.280> tighten<00:02:26.610> all<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.730> bolts

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
basically as you tighten all the bolts

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.860 
basically as you tighten all the bolts
up<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:28.290> should<00:02:28.590> realign<00:02:29.190> itself<00:02:29.520> so<00:02:30.510> close

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
up that should realign itself so close

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.590 
up that should realign itself so close
that<00:02:31.230> any<00:02:31.800> minor<00:02:32.310> misalignment<00:02:32.910> won't<00:02:33.090> matter

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.120 

so<00:02:36.600> yeah<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.960> tried<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.320> with<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.620> ultra<00:02:37.920> blue

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
so yeah I tried that with the ultra blue

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.000 
so yeah I tried that with the ultra blue
and<00:02:38.490> it<00:02:39.390> didn't<00:02:39.630> really<00:02:39.750> work<00:02:40.110> on<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.470> head<00:02:40.680> it

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
and it didn't really work on the head it

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.280 
and it didn't really work on the head it
left<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.430> mark<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.450> could<00:02:42.600> see<00:02:42.870> but<00:02:43.080> not

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
left the mark that you could see but not

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.230 
left the mark that you could see but not
enough<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.650> be<00:02:43.680> confident<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.340> go<00:02:44.610> running<00:02:45.150> out

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
enough to be confident to go running out

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.280 
enough to be confident to go running out
metal<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.280> got<00:02:48.030> on<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.150> net<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.780> found<00:02:49.140> a

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
metal so I got on the net and I found a

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.650 
metal so I got on the net and I found a
fellow<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:50.100> pinches<00:02:50.850> his<00:02:51.000> wife's<00:02:51.270> lipstick

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
fellow that pinches his wife's lipstick

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.870 
fellow that pinches his wife's lipstick
and<00:02:51.780> does<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.080> same<00:02:52.260> thing<00:02:52.670> so<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.700> thought

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
and does the same thing so I thought

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.000 
and does the same thing so I thought
that's<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.150> bloody<00:02:54.360> good<00:02:54.510> idea<00:02:54.740> you<00:02:55.740> can<00:02:55.860> just

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
that's a bloody good idea you can just

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.699 
that's a bloody good idea you can just
me<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.250> lipstick<00:02:56.640> all<00:02:56.880> around<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.360> edge<00:02:57.709> bolt

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
me a lipstick all around the edge bolt

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:59.720 
me a lipstick all around the edge bolt
it<00:02:58.860> up<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.100> then<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.250> havin<00:02:59.400> gotta<00:02:59.520> wait

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
it up and then you havin gotta wait

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.190 
it up and then you havin gotta wait
overnight<00:03:00.030> or<00:03:00.330> anything<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.750> just<00:03:00.780> pull<00:03:01.110> it

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
overnight or anything you just pull it

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.160 
overnight or anything you just pull it
apart<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.890> there's<00:03:02.100> your<00:03:02.280> marks<00:03:02.580> ready<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.970> go

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
apart and there's your marks ready to go

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.480 
apart and there's your marks ready to go
run<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.200> scribe<00:03:04.500> around<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.010> inside<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.340> the

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
run a scribe around the inside of the

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.160 
run a scribe around the inside of the
marks<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:05.970> then<00:03:07.580> take<00:03:08.580> your<00:03:08.900> dog<00:03:09.900> running

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
marks and then take your dog running

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.730 
marks and then take your dog running
burr<00:03:11.600> now<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:12.720> one<00:03:12.930> isn't<00:03:13.350> actually

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
burr now this one isn't actually

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.910 
burr now this one isn't actually
intended<00:03:14.160> for<00:03:14.310> aluminium<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:15.270> is<00:03:15.740> one<00:03:16.740> you'd

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
intended for aluminium this is one you'd

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.759 
intended for aluminium this is one you'd
use<00:03:17.070> on<00:03:17.220> steel<00:03:17.519> or<00:03:17.760> cast<00:03:17.940> iron<00:03:18.410> but<00:03:19.410> if<00:03:19.650> you

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
use on steel or cast iron but if you

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.229 
use on steel or cast iron but if you
keep<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:19.980> little<00:03:20.190> bit<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.459> oil<00:03:20.580> in<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.940> flutes

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
keep a little bit of oil in the flutes

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.650 
keep a little bit of oil in the flutes
and<00:03:21.570> I<00:03:22.080> use<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.350> scribe<00:03:22.800> as<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.940> starts<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.390> clog

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
and I use a scribe as it starts to clog

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.509 
and I use a scribe as it starts to clog
up<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:25.320> just<00:03:25.530> scrape<00:03:25.769> down<00:03:26.010> with<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.190> scribe

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
up you just scrape down with a scribe

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.330 
up you just scrape down with a scribe
and<00:03:26.760> flick<00:03:27.750> all<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.989> alum<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.380> map<00:03:28.560> if<00:03:29.190> you

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
and flick all the alum in you map if you

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.340 
and flick all the alum in you map if you
don't<00:03:29.730> do<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.239> they'll<00:03:30.480> overheat<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.140> chip

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
don't do that they'll overheat and chip

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.170 
don't do that they'll overheat and chip
the<00:03:31.500> teeth<00:03:31.709> off<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.280> these<00:03:32.820> things<00:03:33.030> are

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
the teeth off and the these things are

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.850 
the teeth off and the these things are
about<00:03:33.360> fifty<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.780> sixty<00:03:33.959> dollars<00:03:34.410> each<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:34.830> you

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
about fifty to sixty dollars each so you

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.759 
about fifty to sixty dollars each so you
want<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.220> take<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.820> slow<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.060> take<00:03:36.360> care<00:03:36.769> the

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
want to take it slow and take care the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.430 
want to take it slow and take care the
main<00:03:37.920> reason<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.400> chose<00:03:38.459> this<00:03:39.150> one<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.630> it

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
main reason I chose this one is it

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.860 
main reason I chose this one is it
doesn't<00:03:40.709> rip<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.489> massive<00:03:41.880> amount<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.269> material

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
doesn't rip a massive amount of material

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.289 
doesn't rip a massive amount of material
app<00:03:43.049> it's<00:03:44.040> very<00:03:44.280> easy<00:03:44.519> with<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.760> spinning<00:03:45.150> die

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
app it's very easy with a spinning die

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.259 
app it's very easy with a spinning die
grinder<00:03:45.600> an<00:03:46.049> aggressive<00:03:46.560> bit<00:03:46.830> to<00:03:47.400> chop<00:03:47.970> drag

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
basically ruin them

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.860 
basically ruin them
okay<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.959> intake<00:03:55.320> manifold<00:03:55.830> that<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.070> got

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
okay the intake manifold that I got

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.289 
okay the intake manifold that I got
supplied<00:03:57.870> with<00:03:58.200> that<00:03:58.410> head<00:03:59.150> didn't<00:04:00.150> look<00:04:00.239> like

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
supplied with that head didn't look like

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.370 
supplied with that head didn't look like
this<00:04:00.570> one<00:04:00.780> I<00:04:00.810> got<00:04:01.049> it

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
this one I got it

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.330 
this one I got it
it<00:04:01.620> was<00:04:01.830> filthy<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:02.340> rusted<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.980> intake

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
it was filthy and rusted the intake

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.310 
it was filthy and rusted the intake
that's<00:04:05.549> where<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.790> car<00:04:06.000> beast<00:04:06.239> hits<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.780> all

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
that's where the car beast hits and all

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.770 
that's where the car beast hits and all
up<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.590> runners<00:04:07.980> was<00:04:08.400> just<00:04:08.640> choked<00:04:09.000> with<00:04:09.390> oil

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
up the runners was just choked with oil

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.900 
up the runners was just choked with oil
and<00:04:10.430> built<00:04:11.430> up<00:04:11.580> carbon<00:04:12.950> I<00:04:13.950> thought<00:04:14.580> of<00:04:14.700> several

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
and built up carbon I thought of several

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.330 
and built up carbon I thought of several
ways<00:04:15.180> they're<00:04:15.420> trying<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.840> clean<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.140> I<00:04:16.680> have<00:04:17.310> a

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
ways they're trying to clean it I have a

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.570 
ways they're trying to clean it I have a
parts<00:04:17.760> washer<00:04:18.830> thought<00:04:19.830> of<00:04:19.950> soaking<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.549> I

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
parts washer thought of soaking it I

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.730 
parts washer thought of soaking it I
thought<00:04:20.760> of<00:04:20.880> pressure<00:04:21.150> washing<00:04:21.359> it<00:04:21.599> and<00:04:21.810> then

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
thought of pressure washing it and then

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.160 
thought of pressure washing it and then
I<00:04:22.800> read<00:04:22.979> about<00:04:23.099> soda<00:04:23.820> blasting<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.900> know

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
I read about soda blasting you know

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.460 
I read about soda blasting you know
Time<00:04:25.380> magazine<00:04:25.920> so<00:04:26.430> I<00:04:26.880> took<00:04:27.840> it<00:04:27.990> over<00:04:28.140> to<00:04:28.350> the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
Time magazine so I took it over to the

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.010 
Time magazine so I took it over to the
site<00:04:28.650> of<00:04:28.680> last<00:04:28.950> place<00:04:29.220> in<00:04:29.790> depo<00:04:30.150> Road<00:04:30.420> in<00:04:30.630> davao

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
site of last place in depo Road in davao

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.210 
site of last place in depo Road in davao
that<00:04:31.650> is<00:04:31.770> called<00:04:31.980> Davao<00:04:32.250> soda<00:04:32.580> blast<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:34.220> I

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
that is called Davao soda blast and I

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.390 
that is called Davao soda blast and I
left<00:04:35.850> it<00:04:36.030> with<00:04:36.150> him<00:04:36.710> he<00:04:37.710> rings<00:04:37.920> me<00:04:38.070> two<00:04:38.250> days

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
left it with him he rings me two days

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.190 
left it with him he rings me two days
later<00:04:38.760> and<00:04:39.030> says<00:04:39.180> come<00:04:39.420> over<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:39.810> pick<00:04:39.990> it<00:04:40.020> up

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
later and says come over and pick it up

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.810 
later and says come over and pick it up
and<00:04:40.650> this<00:04:40.770> is<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.040> condition<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.490> came<00:04:41.640> back

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
and this is the condition it came back

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.690 
and this is the condition it came back
in<00:04:42.060> it's<00:04:42.390> absolutely<00:04:43.170> spotless<00:04:43.590> inside<00:04:44.490> and

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
in it's absolutely spotless inside and

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.800 
in it's absolutely spotless inside and
out<00:04:44.960> there<00:04:45.960> is<00:04:46.140> no<00:04:46.850> feed<00:04:47.850> blast<00:04:48.180> marks<00:04:48.510> or

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
out there is no feed blast marks or

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.390 
out there is no feed blast marks or
damage<00:04:49.110> or<00:04:49.230> anything<00:04:49.410> to<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:49.920> parent<00:04:50.280> level

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
damage or anything to the parent level

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.400 
damage or anything to the parent level
and<00:04:50.750> it<00:04:51.750> only<00:04:51.870> cost<00:04:52.200> $15<00:04:53.240> so<00:04:54.240> what<00:04:55.080> would<00:04:55.290> you

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
and it only cost $15 so what would you

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.500 
and it only cost $15 so what would you
do<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:55.650> any<00:04:55.770> other<00:04:55.860> way<00:04:59.210> there<00:05:00.210> was<00:05:00.300> a<00:05:00.360> little

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
do it any other way there was a little

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.530 
do it any other way there was a little
bit<00:05:00.690> of<00:05:00.780> corrosion<00:05:00.960> around<00:05:02.450> where<00:05:03.450> the

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
bit of corrosion around where the

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.910 
bit of corrosion around where the
thermostat<00:05:03.930> sits<00:05:04.380> but<00:05:04.560> it's<00:05:04.650> mostly

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
thermostat sits but it's mostly

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.820 
thermostat sits but it's mostly
eliminated<00:05:05.160> that<00:05:05.990> there<00:05:06.990> was<00:05:07.080> quite<00:05:07.350> corroded

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
eliminated that there was quite corroded

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.480 
eliminated that there was quite corroded
in<00:05:07.950> this<00:05:08.100> corner<00:05:08.580> where<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:10.490> temperature

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
in this corner where the temperature

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.510 
in this corner where the temperature
sensor<00:05:11.850> goes<00:05:12.120> so<00:05:12.990> I<00:05:13.020> had<00:05:13.410> to<00:05:13.620> get<00:05:13.890> it<00:05:14.040> welded<00:05:14.250> up

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
sensor goes so I had to get it welded up

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.370 
sensor goes so I had to get it welded up
and<00:05:15.450> then<00:05:15.540> I<00:05:15.600> dropped<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:15.960> whole<00:05:16.080> thing<00:05:16.290> at

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
and then I dropped the whole thing at

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.320 
and then I dropped the whole thing at
the<00:05:16.410> machine<00:05:16.770> shop<00:05:16.800> and<00:05:17.070> they<00:05:17.370> machined<00:05:18.180> the

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
the machine shop and they machined the

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.420 
the machine shop and they machined the
surface<00:05:18.720> smooth<00:05:18.990> again<00:05:19.260> so<00:05:20.040> I'll<00:05:20.100> just<00:05:20.250> have

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
surface smooth again so I'll just have

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.880 
surface smooth again so I'll just have
to<00:05:20.610> file<00:05:21.480> a<00:05:21.510> doubt<00:05:21.930> for<00:05:22.140> it<00:05:22.260> to<00:05:22.320> fit<00:05:22.500> back<00:05:22.650> in

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
to file a doubt for it to fit back in

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.790 
to file a doubt for it to fit back in
but<00:05:23.690> yeah<00:05:24.690> so<00:05:25.020> now<00:05:25.170> we've<00:05:25.260> got<00:05:25.350> a<00:05:25.380> nice<00:05:25.530> smooth

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
but yeah so now we've got a nice smooth

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.890 
but yeah so now we've got a nice smooth
surface<00:05:25.980> I<00:05:26.580> can<00:05:26.610> use<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:27.120> lipstick<00:05:27.480> and<00:05:27.660> port

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
surface I can use the lipstick and port

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
surface I can use the lipstick and port
match<00:05:28.080> it<00:05:29.360> while<00:05:30.360> I'm<00:05:30.600> here<00:05:30.900> I'll<00:05:31.080> just<00:05:31.740> go

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
match it while I'm here I'll just go

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.250 
match it while I'm here I'll just go
under<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.250> manifold<00:05:32.730> the<00:05:33.150> manifold<00:05:34.140> the

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
under the manifold the manifold the

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.150 
under the manifold the manifold the
timing<00:05:34.620> cover<00:05:36.320> this<00:05:37.320> is<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.620> timing<00:05:38.010> cover

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
timing cover this is the timing cover

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.940 
timing cover this is the timing cover
that<00:05:38.370> came<00:05:38.610> with<00:05:38.850> the<00:05:39.000> engine<00:05:39.500> as<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:40.650> can<00:05:40.770> see

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
that came with the engine as you can see

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.770 
that came with the engine as you can see
there's<00:05:41.220> a<00:05:41.280> lot<00:05:41.400> of<00:05:41.490> scale<00:05:41.820> and<00:05:42.120> buildup<00:05:42.480> in<00:05:42.630> it

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
there's a lot of scale and buildup in it

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.530 
there's a lot of scale and buildup in it
and<00:05:42.960> it's<00:05:43.260> in<00:05:43.410> pretty<00:05:43.770> poor<00:05:44.010> condition<00:05:44.540> this

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
and it's in pretty poor condition this

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.800 
and it's in pretty poor condition this
area<00:05:45.960> here<00:05:46.260> is<00:05:46.590> where<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:47.280> impeller<00:05:47.910> for<00:05:48.630> your

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
area here is where the impeller for your

cavitation or holes like that the pump
won't<00:05:53.760> pump<00:05:54.120> properly<00:05:54.570> and<00:05:54.960> it'll<00:05:55.770> cause

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
won't pump properly and it'll cause

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.310 
won't pump properly and it'll cause
bubbles<00:05:56.280> and<00:05:56.760> what<00:05:57.390> they<00:05:57.510> call<00:05:57.690> cavitation

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320
