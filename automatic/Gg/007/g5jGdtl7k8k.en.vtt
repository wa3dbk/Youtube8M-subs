00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 Hello dear channel subscribers 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:12.809
 nights glad to see me and glad today i 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:15.089
 I'll show you a rybnik rafting and so I know 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.300
 that and so there is a fish in minecraft 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.670
 Well, how would they they do not swim that is 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.880
 we do not see them that they swim as if 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.340
 propagated by example to made as it were 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:35.219
 floating fish that breeds 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:36.739
 which does and so they they they they 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.440
 even look 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.469
 Look, they even took out just they do not care 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:49.110
 they they nihilists you understand it this 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:51.539
 such Chelyabinsk fish want to say 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.449
 why did not i have because 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.680
 the beginning flew the Windows they first 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.870
 the Internet went out then the Windows fell off 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.030
 then this microphone broke if you 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.489
 noticed then I'm recording with a friend now 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.500
 microphone from old and that new microphone 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.990
 I broke down here and now 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.420
 reinstalled Windows and a4 Windows 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.560
 then the microphone driver will not go away the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.100
 driver's from a microphone speaker 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.070
 walked 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.659
 then the Windows do not install 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.460
 it was established guys are very corrected 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:34.340
 like these ones 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:37.790
 installed windu about 44 help 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.000
 reduce literally nothing is in 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.650
 it is wended besides internet explorer 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.870
 minecraft and proper fraps 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:50.750
 with which through both sous and this some 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:54.110
 sony vegas and but also all sorts of folders there 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.140
 I will connect the Internet safely but 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.170
 Unfortunately, all the files that were 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.810
 on the computer everybody retired and 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.110
 I started everything from scratch 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.210
 Well, you can say pure Windows from me 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.320
 It was 705 seven now I have 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:15.650
 eight and so actually let's 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.630
 back to himself to the fish itself and since 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.920
 as I said, they are Chelyabinsk Iraqi and 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.500
 they swim in the water 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:29.030
 they do not care that is, and outside and the water they are on 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.340
 all don't care how and so yes by the way they 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.580
 sometimes they die sometimes the world can 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.530
 I want to say to create these fish 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.310
 we will need such here quite fish 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:49.150
 here is fish salman han fish fish and on 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:49.150
 no, because here fish fish &amp; salman 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:01.630
 and so myself to create a fisherman we must 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.310
 just enter the water or poke here 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.180
 actually invoke and quietly gbp so 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.390
 let's say call as we see it 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.880
 purchase floats away such well you know 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.030
 Yes, as the fish swims away that can also 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.430
 create the water itself like this 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.590
 they they really swim guys they they 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.560
 float away if we want 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.569
 Oh my God 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.110
 Well, how would Chelyabinsk fish to understand 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:37.790
 yes and 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:40.980
 and the tassel of the castle paris are greasy and so 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.100
 let's create a billboard nut though this 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.959
 fish is very very very similar to 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:52.050
 fish and take off if you know on him 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:57.209
 she is so cool 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:59.670
 Salman briefly like pike pike 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.110
 I know for sure well, very cool guys 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.680
 agree very cool you can also 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.570
 so here I do not know what kind of lake and 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.300
 in her in them in 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.480
 that is, in the lake the statics of such fish 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.720
 and the whole thing looked like this so if we 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.709
 we want to kill them that is to kill we 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.560
 hit them once because they are weak 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:27.060
 and since they're about enough that's enough 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:34.729
 do after see how to devote so 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:37.590
 get back kill and so to kill them you 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.080
 delete once and career they would 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:44.190
 very weak you take so remove 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.200
 first the guts come out of them then they 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.300
 themselves die then they fall 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:53.720
 experience can be so 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.889
 Che did not hit 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.569
 such mod night 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.530
 then if you hear very much now 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:05.979
 hear so much the keyboard of the city 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:13.330
 I don't have such a microphone 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:16.389
 on my head how do we see a microphone 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:21.939
 honestly not table and talk is very difficult 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:25.090
 so remove from his first fall from 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:32.699
 guts then here then she herself dies 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:32.699
 then later experience falls like this 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:43.120
 capacity fish i we see it falls out 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.000
 guts 4 sleep too much a lot of things 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:51.270
 Dropped it has a lot of guts and what 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.270
 a lot of weight so over there is the mechanism itself 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:06:00.009
 so here is the mechanism so guys 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:02.770
 asked why did you start building here 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:04.029
 so here is why are you doing in 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.759
 one team blocks but how would 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:08.680
 vertically build because i am so 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.039
 more convenient because the team is so 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:18.250
 it turns out very small if I am 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:22.330
 build like this i usually 40 ta 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.790
 the team will turn out great and plus I don't 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.520
 means 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:29.970
 here in one word the team will be big 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.570
 so here I will tell you this thing 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.990
 compact 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:38.730
 what I could think of is build 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:40.890
 I think vertically is not worth it I think 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.800
 I will not explain how to work 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.600
 I think you're not new 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.420
 who subscribe to my channel think you 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.220
 novice you understand how it works 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:55.040
 this requires a winter scoreboard here 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:58.800
 here is a sheet soon from called fish 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.320
 by the way then why don't you go 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.300
 so parts of the video before you walked very 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.230
 often seen because now I do not know 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.530
 what should I do 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:13.980
 day no you suggest ideas that 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:15.330
 I do not like it and I, I probably 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.910
 did everything you can do 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.730
 minecraft 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:23.580
 I think that's probably it, and am now 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:26.010
 take off all sorts of mini-game and do not go 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:29.460
 tyrant I don't know for sure 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:32.490
 to be and I will shoot a counter-strike 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.770
 if not understood or others who are there 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:38.040

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:40.020

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.140
