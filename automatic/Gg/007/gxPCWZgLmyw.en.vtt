00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 Hi everybody, I'm collecting fruits. 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.840
 and I want to show you something 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.370
 very special look this here is a molt 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.380
 from acerola 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.120
 the sale is who is filming the video 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.020
 here Érika is showing up 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.920
 Érika Muda 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.960
 Look here looks flowers and she 's in a 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.849
 pot is already making you 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.340
 ask several ong is this 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.340
 look this is a fashion produced by clone 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.750
 and the seedlings produced by clone them 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.340
 they start flowering and 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.680
 very quickly because it is a change 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.230
 that is born adult does not pass through 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.090
 juvenile growth yesterday 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.180
 need to grow 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.620
 to be an adult she was already an adult then 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.090
 what we people always me 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.370
 ask a lot why I 'm giving 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.920
 these explanations because it is the following 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.809
 that it can be produced in the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.809
 Vase in the garden because it will not give 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.540
 much attention to growth because it 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.330
 already feels adult she was born adult 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.710
 so all her energy will be 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.990
 directed to flowering and fruiting 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:20.070
 so it's one to be the motto this is a 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.920
 Very delicious variety for a fruit 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.640

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.500
 it contains everyone says that Mrs. 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.209

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.430
 Vitamin C has a lot of 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.010
 Vitamin C 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.840
 it gives about 1,800 milligrams 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.879
 for every 100 grams of fruit but she 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.879
 I also do not know what anyone is talking about 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.890
 calcium phosphorus and it is rich in potassium 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:43.290
 There are 200 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:45.420
 it has 240 milligrams of potassium to 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.880
 every 100 grams of fruit 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.780
 so it's a pity a very fruit 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.000
 Special 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.160
