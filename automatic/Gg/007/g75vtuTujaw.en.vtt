00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.779
 Hello everyone with today's tutorial 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.389
 we're going to see how to shorten a pipe 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.290
 hydraulic brake shimano especially 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.369
 some shimano xtr mo to shorten the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.930
 hose is not necessary to purge 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.119
 the plant therefore all the work does not 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.070
 absolutely requires having to purge 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.529
 from the plant clearly to minutes not 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.820
 make a few mistakes 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.000
 starting from what we 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.890
 need is a parrot wrench a 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.960
 hammer a cutter with which 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.920
 we will cut the pipe 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.579
 It serves a wrench 8 mm 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:47.840
 3 mm Allen wrench hunt tires in 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:51.440
 an olive plastic is a new thorn and if 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.719
 we bought these new brakes 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.610
 scenes also provided these accessories 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.640
 you need this yellow accessory for 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.100
 put the tube in the middle at the moment 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.250
 which we are going to insert the new plug 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.140
 therefore clearly the braking system 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.710
 that we must shorten 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.299
 as the first fundamental thing is before 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.280
 remove the brake from the bike frame 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:21.390
 measure how much we have to cut the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.810
 tube ok so at this point the first one 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.890
 what to do is remove the plug that 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.340
 keeps the pads inside 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.340
 wait for the plug 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.700
 We raise the tablets obviously when 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.430
 we do these jobs we always go to 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.770
 evaluate different things then wear them 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.540
 pads maybe we go to see i 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.370
 pistons therefore also clean 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.710
 pistons at the same time ok at this 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:56.960
 Next point and step is to press 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:00.880
 lightly brake lever so as to 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.880
 let the pistons come out slightly 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.830
 then proceed gradually own 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.720
 to prevent the pistons from coming out 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.270
 because if they come out of the pistons it comes out 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.450
 the oil and then they will go 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.750
 purged the system will be purged 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.790
 then gently we will do the canal floor 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.430
 out-piston is not necessary to 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.300
 succeed even a few few i 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.690
 a few millimeters perfect end to this 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.820
 point I know if we see at this point there 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.770
 stop 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.320
 just enough so we can clean 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.770
 clearly little pistons since there 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.200
 we find 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.959
 we remove the pistons after which the lever 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.150
 we put the brake in the part in one 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.950
 higher part while the clamp is the 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.540
 let's put it in a lower part then 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.769
 we will then work on the slaver 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.170
 so at this point after removing 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.019
 the plastic cap that covers the nut 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.640
 of the avoidance we proceed without 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.970
 clearly press the lever to unscrew 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.970
 this figure 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.959
 so at this point after having invited 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.060
 this gives this this 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.830
 we must do we must strongly because 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.080
 especially if it has never been done 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.450
 this work so maybe the brakes are 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.590
 standard 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.750
 therefore we must make a certain strength 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.840
 without frightening us on the one hand we pull 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.610
 the brake hose from the other la 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.709
 part of the game comes up to that 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.880
 do not separate clearly what doing 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.050
 this work must always be done 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.550
 be careful not to press 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:40.130
 he had perfect so at this point there 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.230
 we will find with the pipe detached from the 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.920
 we must take this point only 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.050
 therefore we will find the olive already inserted 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.850
 then we will decide the length where 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.250
 cut the tube with the other one either 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.840
 we're going to cut the tube 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.150
 same when we have to cut 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.150
 tronchesina even if it is not the method 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.460
 ideal for cutting these tubes 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.440
 the important thing is to give a sure shot 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.140
 blow dry so that the tube cuts 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:11.690
 uniformly so we proceed to 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:14.030
 cut the pipe ok then with a stroke 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.380
 sure we're going to easily cut the 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.239
 cable 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.890
 care must be taken because the part 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.690
 of the cable that is cut loses 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.280
 enough oil this is the reason for 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.740
 which these usually work when you do 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.570
 work on the brakes it is better to do them with 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.680
 the braking system is disconnected from the 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:34.210
 frame so that the oil may not go 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.210
 on others on other components 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.100
 don't ruin other components though 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.680
 the Shimano oil and a mineral oil 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.230
 it's not corrosive like oil, maybe 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.530
 is used by other systems such as i 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.140
 rapid systems so at this point we 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.700
 we will then have our tube cut is 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:57.840
 the next step is to go to 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.840
 insert both the plug and the new olive 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.260
 so now let's proceed insert the new one 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:09.430
 there it simply goes into the in 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:13.000
 so historic tube with these accessories 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:16.060
 yellows are used to do this job 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.690
 here is to put the tube of the vehicle with the 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.510
 we will keep the parrot wrench 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.970
 two ends and we will have to insert then 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.630
 the plug in the front then 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.130
 until the end 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.940
 so in practice as we do 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.460
 we insert this plug in the middle with the 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.250
 we hold the parrot wrench the 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.710
 yellow part and with 23 decided strokes of 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.940
 hammer the plug will go inside 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.940
 of the tube 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.930
 so basically work to do this 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.190
 keep the parrot wrench on 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:53.530
 tube in the appropriate yellow accessories 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:06:02.650
 firmly here it is a few tub 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:06:04.170
 Decided strokes on the plug are present 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.000
 plug will have entered inside 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.520
 so be careful to do it 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.070
 enter up to the end then 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.010
 that the flat part touches completely 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:20.620
 the youtube you see at this point we can 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:22.090
 then proceed to perfect refitting 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:27.030
 at this point we have to reassemble the 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.030
 so let's insert the initial part 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:35.140
 center we will find then the olive that we would have 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:37.590
 inserted the dice we should 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.850
 restrict then insert the whole 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:44.050
 after which we can also start 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:45.920
 manually grab the data until 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.410
 there is no resistance 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.110
 so let's take the key to the key 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:56.270
 English is that we serve the that 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:58.430
 we hosted ok then at the beginning 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.040
 after striking the bolt it holds 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.410
 combined the cable to the lever 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.960
 we can then close it with this 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.780
 rubber cap and at this point for 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.360
 finish the job with a paragraph kick 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.490
 in plastic we have to bring back the 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.930
 pistons together then pistons that 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.300
 we had gone out slightly 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.820
 at the beginning we bring them back 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.250
 inside then that work is 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:25.550
 finished we can reassemble everything 

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:27.980
 on his bike if the work went to 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.230
 good end when we will then go to brake 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:33.830
 once reassembled both the tablets and 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:36.410
 have clearly in the middle of the disc the 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.570
 lever will turn out not to be empty 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.570
 that the case where you need to 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.850
 perform a purge example but the 

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:47.060
 feline will normally brake as before 

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:49.220
 no cutting of the tube 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.140
 worry if during all 

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.990
 the operation a few drops of oil 

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.810
 is lost because this clearly 

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.190
 does not compromise absolutely 

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.620
 brake operation then to this 

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:03.050
 point we have finished I refer you to the 

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:05.090
 other tutorials there are other tutorials 

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:07.400
 clearly on my other channel 

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:10.090
 I work and I always hope to do others 

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.090
 Hi everyone
