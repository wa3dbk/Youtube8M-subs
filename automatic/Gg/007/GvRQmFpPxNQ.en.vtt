three<00:00:26.810> styrofoam<00:00:27.810> balls<00:00:28.429> there's<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.550> wooden

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
three styrofoam balls there's a wooden

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.799 
three styrofoam balls there's a wooden
down<00:00:30.090> style<00:00:30.720> going<00:00:31.019> through<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.380> center<00:00:31.710> I

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
down style going through the center I

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.330 
down style going through the center I
used<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:34.020> pair<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.380> scissors<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.800> cut<00:00:35.100> some

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
used a pair of scissors to cut some

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.670 
used a pair of scissors to cut some
lollipop<00:00:35.820> sticks<00:00:35.989> there's<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.079> regular<00:00:37.410> pair

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
lollipop sticks there's a regular pair

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.670 
lollipop sticks there's a regular pair
of<00:00:37.710> scissors<00:00:38.390> what<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.420> also<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.170> also<00:00:40.379> use

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
of scissors what I also you can also use

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.440 
of scissors what I also you can also use
pair<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.100> wire<00:00:41.280> cutters<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.120> might<00:00:42.270> make

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
pair of wire cutters so that might make

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.850 
pair of wire cutters so that might make
it<00:00:42.480> easier<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.020> cut<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:44.340> lollipop<00:00:44.850> stick<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
it easier to cut the lollipop stick and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.190 
it easier to cut the lollipop stick and
although<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.070> use<00:00:47.520> regular<00:00:48.000> styrofoam<00:00:48.539> balls<00:00:48.840> I

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
although I use regular styrofoam balls I

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.860 
although I use regular styrofoam balls I
also<00:00:49.890> say<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.000> could<00:00:51.329> probably<00:00:51.629> get

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
also say that you could probably get

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.150 
also say that you could probably get
away<00:00:51.960> with<00:00:52.050> using<00:00:53.840> floral<00:00:54.840> foam<00:00:55.079> because<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
away with using floral foam because the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.060 
away with using floral foam because the
floral<00:00:56.579> foam<00:00:57.020> might<00:00:58.020> actually<00:00:58.500> hold<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
floral foam might actually hold the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.349 
floral foam might actually hold the
sticks<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.489> little<00:00:59.609> bit<00:00:59.789> better<00:01:00.059> because

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
sticks a little bit better because

00:01:00.359 --> 00:05:11.790 
sticks a little bit better because
that's<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.739> made<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.280> holding

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.860 

okay<00:05:12.800> so<00:05:13.070> I've<00:05:13.310> gotten<00:05:13.639> to<00:05:13.730> the<00:05:13.790> top<00:05:14.000> tier<00:05:14.300> and

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
okay so I've gotten to the top tier and

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.080 
okay so I've gotten to the top tier and
I<00:05:15.110> just<00:05:15.320> wanted<00:05:15.530> to<00:05:15.680> share<00:05:16.280> this<00:05:16.340> little<00:05:16.669> tip

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
I just wanted to share this little tip

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.440 
I just wanted to share this little tip
with<00:05:17.360> you<00:05:17.510> guys<00:05:18.400> for<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.520> dum-dum<00:05:19.940> some<00:05:20.300> of

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
with you guys for the dum-dum some of

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.430 
with you guys for the dum-dum some of
them<00:05:20.570> are<00:05:20.780> slightly<00:05:21.730> unwrapped<00:05:22.730> and<00:05:23.450> rats

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
them are slightly unwrapped and rats

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.210 
them are slightly unwrapped and rats
quite<00:05:24.740> far<00:05:25.010> down<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:26.350> lollipop<00:05:27.350> stick<00:05:27.620> so

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
quite far down the lollipop stick so

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.750 
quite far down the lollipop stick so
what<00:05:28.400> I've<00:05:28.520> been<00:05:28.550> doing<00:05:28.700> is<00:05:29.060> swirling<00:05:29.720> out<00:05:29.930> a

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
what I've been doing is swirling out a

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.890 
what I've been doing is swirling out a
little<00:05:31.760> bit<00:05:31.940> because<00:05:32.150> they<00:05:32.389> do<00:05:32.450> have<00:05:32.720> like<00:05:32.840> a

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
little bit because they do have like a

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.020 
little bit because they do have like a
wax<00:05:33.200> type<00:05:33.470> coating<00:05:33.860> so<00:05:34.040> it<00:05:34.100> does<00:05:34.280> help<00:05:34.520> hold<00:05:34.880> it

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
wax type coating so it does help hold it

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.390 
wax type coating so it does help hold it
a<00:05:35.120> little<00:05:35.150> better<00:05:35.510> so<00:05:36.470> when<00:05:36.620> I<00:05:36.650> cut<00:05:37.010> it<00:05:37.130> I<00:05:37.220> can

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
a little better so when I cut it I can

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.390 
a little better so when I cut it I can
cut<00:05:37.669> it<00:05:37.790> almost<00:05:38.180> right<00:05:38.600> to<00:05:38.780> where<00:05:38.990> I<00:05:39.410> can<00:05:40.190> cut

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
cut it almost right to where I can cut

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.400 
cut it almost right to where I can cut
it<00:05:40.520> almost<00:05:40.790> to<00:05:41.030> right<00:05:41.240> where<00:05:41.510> the<00:05:41.810> lot<00:05:42.080> of<00:05:42.229> pop

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
it almost to right where the lot of pop

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:49.719 
it almost to right where the lot of pop
sting<00:05:42.680> and<00:05:43.990> placing<00:05:44.990> it<00:05:45.139> in<00:05:45.350> I<00:05:47.830> push<00:05:48.830> but<00:05:49.580> then

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
sting and placing it in I push but then

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.890 
sting and placing it in I push but then
I'm<00:05:49.880> also<00:05:50.060> swirl<00:05:50.840> the<00:05:51.620> lollipop<00:05:52.040> as<00:05:52.280> I<00:05:52.520> push

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
I'm also swirl the lollipop as I push

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.010 
I'm also swirl the lollipop as I push
going<00:05:53.900> with<00:05:54.110> the<00:05:55.000> the<00:05:56.000> way<00:05:56.180> the<00:05:56.419> wrapper<00:05:56.840> is

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
going with the the way the wrapper is

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.900 
going with the the way the wrapper is
twisted<00:05:57.590> and<00:05:57.740> that<00:05:57.979> way<00:05:58.160> I<00:05:58.190> can<00:05:58.460> get<00:05:58.729> them

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
twisted and that way I can get them

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.600 
twisted and that way I can get them
further<00:05:59.210> in<00:05:59.540> and<00:05:59.860> therefore<00:06:00.860> have<00:06:01.400> them

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
further in and therefore have them

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.600 
further in and therefore have them
tighter<00:06:01.940> on<00:06:02.210> the<00:06:02.240> top<00:06:02.570> wall<00:06:02.870> okay<00:06:03.800> just<00:06:04.460> one

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
tighter on the top wall okay just one

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.310 
tighter on the top wall okay just one
