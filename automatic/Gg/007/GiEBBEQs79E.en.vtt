00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.850
 Hi, I'm Mayo Gomez and in this video, 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:09.240
 I'm going to tell you how to improve your performance 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.240
 sports with these 5 keys we started 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.090
 or not 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.800
 The first key compromise with you is 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.650
 vital a firm commitment decided with 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.140
 security makes you feel very much 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.210
 stronger with a lot more energy if 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.890
 forms part of a team if all 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.199
 members are also really 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.879
 committed to the goal is no longer going to 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.400
 being a team is going to be something very much 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.400
 stronger so you know creates a 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.589
 really strong commitment and whatever 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.080
 pass with yourself the second key in 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:44.280
 discipline gives you freedom yes I know 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.110
 that sometimes sounds a little weird because 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.659
 we have the word discipline associated 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.460
 with something negative and it's time that 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.900
 change because when you really are 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.600
 committed to what you are doing 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.089
 you are disciplined and that is going to make you 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.309
 become whoever you want to be, that's why 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.350
 discipline gives you freedom let's 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.939
 change that negative connotation and we're going 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.920
 to give it the strength that that discipline 

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:06.840
 is going to lead you to get those 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.700
 results since you are the person who 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.729
 you want to be 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.289
 the third key uses your imagination the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.539
 imagination is a very tool 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.429
 powerful when it comes to sports and 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.890
 above all time to get good 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:22.259
 results is not just about imagining 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.030
 to visualize how many times we follow 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.590
 it's also about feeling that 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.329
 we are visualizing if you are 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.280
 preparing for a sports career and 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.679
 You want to win it because it visualizes you 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.990
 passing that goal as a winner and not only 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.000
 Imagine passing it but you feel those 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.030
 sensations that you would feel and gain 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.890
 when we really make people feel 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.840
 our body that feeling our 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.789
 mind what he's going to do is pursue that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.860
 objective so that we really feel it 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.689
 since our mind does not know how to differentiate 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.819
 between what is real and what is 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.649
 imagination so visualization is 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.679
 a great tool to win in 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.540
 trust and to feel what we want 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.690
 get 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.730
 the fourth key leads the leadership is 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.070
 something fundamental to mark the 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.020
 difference when you feel leader of what 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.729
 what you do in each moment in each 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.340
 competition in each training 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.290
 you maintain that attitude of triumph that 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.930
 leadership attitude you feel 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.260
 much more energetic with much more 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.940
 clarity and with much more determination 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.620
 if you are part of a team it is also 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.090
 fundamental that you show your leadership 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.880
 because with that what you will be doing 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.160
 is to bring out the best in your classmates and 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.440
 they seeing that example will take their 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.330
 part more leader imagine if all the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.610
 world had that idea that commitment and 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.530
 that leadership put on the track put 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.270
 in every situation how can you 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.120
 imagine the results are very 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.670
 different 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.370
 and the fifth key win or lose are 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.470
 just as impostors win or lose is a 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.870
 result is a consequence of what 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.769
 you've done that's why it does not have that much value 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.959
 how it looks 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.340
 the important thing is that you give it your best shot 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.890
 same because there the result 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.260
 it will simply be a consequence if you 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.810
 you give the best and you do not get that triumph 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.730
 it simply analyzes that you can improve and 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.530
 keep giving the best you really 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.420
 You will feel great because in many 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.129
 occasions having that victory of having 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.340
 got that does not give you the best 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:16.190
 feeling if you have not given the best for 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.859
 that has pending the result but have 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.680
 very present to give the best of yourself 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:24.170
