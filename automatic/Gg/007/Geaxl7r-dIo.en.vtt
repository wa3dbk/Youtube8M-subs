00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
because if you do need it you can find

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.040 
because if you do need it you can find
it<00:04:23.520> accurate<00:04:24.030> which<00:04:24.150> also<00:04:24.360> would<00:04:24.600> open<00:04:24.840> up<00:04:24.900> the

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
it accurate which also would open up the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.360 
it accurate which also would open up the
possibility<00:04:25.229> of<00:04:25.560> maybe<00:04:25.710> holding<00:04:25.979> cavern<00:04:26.280> of

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
possibility of maybe holding cavern of

after<00:05:29.689> game<00:05:30.529> one<00:05:30.770> the<00:05:30.979> jug<00:05:31.189> matchup<00:05:31.580> I<00:05:32.229> become

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
after game one the jug matchup I become

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:34.450 
after game one the jug matchup I become
a<00:05:33.259> John<00:05:33.499> Beck<00:05:33.680> they<00:05:33.830> become<00:05:34.069> a<00:05:34.129> gun<00:05:34.279> back

except one of us has a similar Legion
yeah<00:05:36.319> it<00:05:36.529> seems<00:05:36.740> really<00:05:37.069> incredible<00:05:37.430> in<00:05:37.580> the

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
yeah it seems really incredible in the

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.040 
yeah it seems really incredible in the
John<00:05:37.879> matchup<00:05:38.210> specifically<00:05:38.749> where<00:05:38.899> they're

John matchup specifically where they're

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.570 
John matchup specifically where they're

not going to even be bringing in a card

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.489 
not going to even be bringing in a card
with<00:05:40.699> an<00:05:40.849> answer<00:05:40.969> though<00:05:41.330> some<00:05:41.990> gin<00:05:42.199> decks<00:05:42.379> are

with an answer though some gin decks are
now<00:05:42.589> aware<00:05:42.889> that<00:05:43.159> they<00:05:43.249> are<00:05:43.279> vulnerable<00:05:43.669> to

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
now aware that they are vulnerable to

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:45.399 
now aware that they are vulnerable to
assemble<00:05:44.059> agent<00:05:44.419> and<00:05:44.659> that<00:05:44.689> people<00:05:45.050> play<00:05:45.199> it

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
assemble agent and that people play it

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:47.260 
assemble agent and that people play it
yeah<00:05:45.680> but<00:05:46.129> you<00:05:46.819> know<00:05:46.909> they're<00:05:47.089> not<00:05:47.120> gonna

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
yeah but you know they're not gonna

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.610 
yeah but you know they're not gonna
expect<00:05:47.569> it<00:05:47.689> out<00:05:47.809> of<00:05:47.899> the<00:05:47.960> mirror<00:05:48.199> generally

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
expect it out of the mirror generally

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.559 
expect it out of the mirror generally
speaking<00:05:48.860> even<00:05:49.279> if<00:05:49.370> they<00:05:49.490> see<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:49.819> white<00:05:50.029> you

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
speaking even if they see the white you

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:52.299 
speaking even if they see the white you
know<00:05:50.599> like<00:05:50.990> it's<00:05:51.379> it's<00:05:51.710> pretty<00:05:51.889> hard<00:05:52.039> to<00:05:52.099> make

00:05:52.299 --> 00:05:52.309 
know like it's it's pretty hard to make

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:53.829 
know like it's it's pretty hard to make
that<00:05:52.430> logical<00:05:52.939> leap<00:05:53.059> at<00:05:53.240> this<00:05:53.419> juncture

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:53.839 
that logical leap at this juncture

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:55.480 
that logical leap at this juncture
