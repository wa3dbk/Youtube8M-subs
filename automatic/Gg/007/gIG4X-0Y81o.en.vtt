a<00:00:09.910> fairly<00:00:10.910> recent<00:00:11.210> innovation<00:00:11.930> for<00:00:12.139> artists

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
a fairly recent innovation for artists

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.400 
a fairly recent innovation for artists
is<00:00:12.860> the<00:00:13.370> development<00:00:13.910> of<00:00:14.059> this<00:00:14.660> I'll<00:00:14.960> call<00:00:15.290> it

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
is the development of this I'll call it

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.009 
is the development of this I'll call it
a<00:00:15.500> water<00:00:15.769> brush<00:00:16.129> it's<00:00:16.849> a<00:00:16.970> brilliant<00:00:17.150> idea<00:00:17.390> I'm

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:18.019 
a water brush it's a brilliant idea I'm

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:19.689 
a water brush it's a brilliant idea I'm
so<00:00:18.230> smooth<00:00:18.769> him<00:00:18.890> that<00:00:18.980> I<00:00:19.009> always<00:00:19.220> have<00:00:19.489> some

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
so smooth him that I always have some

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.790 
so smooth him that I always have some
now<00:00:19.880> in<00:00:19.999> my<00:00:20.089> sketching<00:00:20.569> bag<00:00:21.259> that<00:00:21.529> I<00:00:21.589> take

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
now in my sketching bag that I take

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.339 
now in my sketching bag that I take
around<00:00:22.039> with<00:00:22.189> me<00:00:22.310> very<00:00:23.239> simply<00:00:23.689> it's<00:00:23.810> this<00:00:24.050> and

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
around with me very simply it's this and

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:25.960 
around with me very simply it's this and
I<00:00:24.529> they're<00:00:24.890> based<00:00:25.130> on<00:00:25.279> fountain<00:00:25.759> pen

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
I they're based on fountain pen

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.779 
I they're based on fountain pen
technology<00:00:26.509> you<00:00:26.630> have<00:00:26.779> a<00:00:26.810> brush<00:00:27.169> at<00:00:27.349> one<00:00:27.499> end

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
technology you have a brush at one end

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.669 
technology you have a brush at one end
there's<00:00:28.789> at<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:28.939> brush<00:00:29.149> here<00:00:29.390> and<00:00:29.569> the<00:00:30.259> handle

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
there's at the brush here and the handle

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.760 
there's at the brush here and the handle
is<00:00:30.859> hollow<00:00:31.759> made<00:00:32.270> of<00:00:32.450> flexible<00:00:32.630> plastic<00:00:33.080> you

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
is hollow made of flexible plastic you

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.550 
is hollow made of flexible plastic you
fill<00:00:33.980> it<00:00:34.070> with<00:00:34.100> water<00:00:34.370> I<00:00:35.290> expect<00:00:36.290> there's<00:00:36.410> some

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
fill it with water I expect there's some

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.350 
fill it with water I expect there's some
kind<00:00:36.770> of<00:00:36.830> complicated<00:00:37.310> valve<00:00:37.640> inside<00:00:38.090> here

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
kind of complicated valve inside here

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
kind of complicated valve inside here
but<00:00:38.540> we<00:00:38.630> don't<00:00:38.720> need<00:00:38.870> to<00:00:38.930> concern<00:00:39.320> ourselves

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
but we don't need to concern ourselves

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.950 
but we don't need to concern ourselves
with<00:00:39.860> that<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:40.820> upshot<00:00:41.150> of<00:00:41.180> this<00:00:41.390> is<00:00:41.630> that<00:00:41.840> if

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
with that the upshot of this is that if

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.840 
with that the upshot of this is that if
you<00:00:41.990> squeeze<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.920> handle<00:00:43.250> very<00:00:43.460> slightly

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
you squeeze the handle very slightly

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.940 
you squeeze the handle very slightly
some<00:00:44.780> of<00:00:44.870> that<00:00:44.930> water<00:00:45.110> comes<00:00:45.500> through<00:00:45.590> to<00:00:45.860> the

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
some of that water comes through to the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.490 
some of that water comes through to the
brush<00:00:46.220> which<00:00:47.000> means<00:00:47.240> you<00:00:47.390> now<00:00:47.600> have<00:00:47.630> a<00:00:48.170> water

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
brush which means you now have a water

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.010 
brush which means you now have a water
brush<00:00:48.850> without<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:49.880> water<00:00:50.240> pot<00:00:50.540> to<00:00:50.690> knock<00:00:50.840> over

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
brush without a water pot to knock over

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.300 
brush without a water pot to knock over
which<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:51.560> can<00:00:51.680> carry<00:00:51.860> around<00:00:52.010> in<00:00:52.220> your

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
which you can carry around in your

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.520 
which you can carry around in your
pocket<00:00:52.670> because<00:00:52.790> they<00:00:53.030> all<00:00:53.150> have<00:00:53.530> little

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
pocket because they all have little

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.530 
pocket because they all have little
watertight<00:00:55.130> lids<00:00:55.430> on<00:00:55.579> them<00:00:55.610> these<00:00:56.329> ones

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
watertight lids on them these ones

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.180 
watertight lids on them these ones
happened<00:00:56.840> to<00:00:56.900> be<00:00:56.960> doing<00:00:57.350> water<00:00:57.590> brushes<00:00:58.010> they

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
happened to be doing water brushes they

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.680 
happened to be doing water brushes they
are<00:00:58.220> available<00:00:58.670> in<00:00:58.790> three<00:00:59.090> different<00:00:59.420> tips

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
are available in three different tips

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.729 
are available in three different tips
this<00:01:00.110> is<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.440> fine<00:01:01.340> tip<00:01:01.960> and<00:01:02.960> if<00:01:03.079> I<00:01:03.170> just<00:01:03.200> show

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
this is the fine tip and if I just show

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.190 
this is the fine tip and if I just show
you<00:01:03.770> what<00:01:03.950> it<00:01:03.980> does<00:01:04.100> it's<00:01:04.759> wet<00:01:05.030> I've<00:01:05.659> applied

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
you what it does it's wet I've applied

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.639 
you what it does it's wet I've applied
some<00:01:06.740> very<00:01:07.369> simple<00:01:07.759> drawing<00:01:07.999> here<00:01:08.359> with<00:01:09.200> some

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
some very simple drawing here with some

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.709 
some very simple drawing here with some
inktense<00:01:10.219> blocks<00:01:10.700> now<00:01:10.909> inktense<00:01:11.240> is<00:01:11.450> a<00:01:11.479> water

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:11.719 
inktense blocks now inktense is a water

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.630 
inktense blocks now inktense is a water
soluble<00:01:12.170> medium<00:01:12.499> the<00:01:12.950> minute<00:01:13.189> I<00:01:13.249> apply<00:01:13.579> the

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
soluble medium the minute I apply the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.050 
soluble medium the minute I apply the
brush<00:01:14.229> which<00:01:15.229> has<00:01:15.409> water<00:01:15.590> in<00:01:15.859> it<00:01:15.889> it<00:01:16.490> dissolves

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
brush which has water in it it dissolves

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.179 
brush which has water in it it dissolves
the<00:01:17.179> pigment<00:01:18.789> and<00:01:20.499> the<00:01:21.499> pigment<00:01:21.859> becomes

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
the pigment and the pigment becomes

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.760 
the pigment and the pigment becomes
usually<00:01:22.609> a<00:01:22.639> little<00:01:22.789> stronger<00:01:23.590> because<00:01:24.590> it's

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
usually a little stronger because it's

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.370 
usually a little stronger because it's
now<00:01:24.950> going<00:01:25.219> to<00:01:25.280> be<00:01:25.340> absorbed<00:01:25.880> into<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.380> tooth

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
now going to be absorbed into the tooth

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.949 
now going to be absorbed into the tooth
of<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.590> paper<00:01:29.560> so<00:01:30.560> there<00:01:31.069> we<00:01:31.159> go<00:01:31.630> no<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:32.840> this

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:32.959 
of the paper so there we go no so this

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.989 
of the paper so there we go no so this
is<00:01:33.109> a<00:01:33.139> fine<00:01:33.560> one<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:36.770> don't<00:01:37.490> need<00:01:37.609> to<00:01:37.700> carry<00:01:37.909> a

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:37.999 
is a fine one you don't need to carry a

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:40.899 
is a fine one you don't need to carry a
water<00:01:38.179> pot<00:01:38.450> around<00:01:38.749> with<00:01:38.869> you<00:01:39.020> I<00:01:39.909> usually

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
water pot around with you I usually

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.309 
water pot around with you I usually
carry<00:01:41.090> a<00:01:41.209> little<00:01:41.359> bit<00:01:41.450> of<00:01:41.509> tissue<00:01:41.689> I've<00:01:42.200> nearly

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
carry a little bit of tissue I've nearly

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:43.599 
carry a little bit of tissue I've nearly
always<00:01:42.560> got<00:01:42.679> tissue<00:01:42.859> of<00:01:43.009> a<00:01:43.100> pocket<00:01:43.130> anyway

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
always got tissue of a pocket anyway

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.209 
always got tissue of a pocket anyway
just<00:01:43.819> to<00:01:43.939> wipe<00:01:44.209> the<00:01:44.499> the<00:01:45.499> color<00:01:45.740> from<00:01:45.889> the<00:01:45.979> end

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
just to wipe the the color from the end

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.190 
just to wipe the the color from the end
so<00:01:46.639> you<00:01:46.700> don't<00:01:46.819> transfer<00:01:47.479> too<00:01:47.719> much<00:01:47.869> color

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
so you don't transfer too much color

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.059 
so you don't transfer too much color
from<00:01:48.950> one<00:01:49.299> area<00:01:50.299> to<00:01:50.479> another<00:01:50.679> so<00:01:51.679> this<00:01:51.829> is<00:01:51.950> the

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
from one area to another so this is the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.969 
from one area to another so this is the
fine<00:01:52.399> tipped<00:01:53.389> one<00:01:53.659> great<00:01:54.439> for<00:01:54.649> details

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
fine tipped one great for details

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.419 
fine tipped one great for details
actually<00:01:55.310> does<00:01:55.520> even<00:01:56.479> though<00:01:56.569> it's<00:01:56.689> a

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
actually does even though it's a

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.480 
actually does even though it's a
synthetic<00:01:58.429> brush<00:01:59.920> point<00:02:00.920> really<00:02:01.219> is<00:02:01.459> very

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
synthetic brush point really is very

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.169 
synthetic brush point really is very
fine<00:02:02.920> it's<00:02:03.920> available<00:02:04.189> in<00:02:04.459> a<00:02:04.520> broader<00:02:04.789> tip

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
fine it's available in a broader tip

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.850 
fine it's available in a broader tip
that's<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:07.130> number<00:02:07.340> two<00:02:08.320> it's<00:02:09.320> better<00:02:09.619> for

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
that's the number two it's better for

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.220

once inktense dries because it's ink

once inktense dries because it's ink
based<00:02:43.520> it<00:02:44.060> becomes<00:02:44.510> permanent<00:02:45.700> yeah<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.910> think
