00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.820
 to store the parameters of the bios 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.530
 the pc plates carry a battery one 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.450
 battery makes when 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.990
 disconnect from the current it 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.279
 keep that configuration happens that that 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.460
 battery has a life time 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.939
 normally 5 years can be others 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.250
 reasons that make that battery 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.820
 in advance it spoils or leaves 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.559
 of having the most important load is 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.360
 know how to change it that we will explain 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.030
 now first thing let's see what 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.340
 symptoms can give a pc if you have a 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.170
 problem in the battery is first date 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.090
 and wrong time the pc when what 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.910
 we turn on and turn it off again and 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.670
 We turn on again does not keep the date 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.950
 and time and it gives us an error in which in the 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.190
 start of the plane tells us that the date 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.649
 and time is incorrect 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.129
 Another error message can cause 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.430
 directly the pc tells us that the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.100
 Checking the battery causes an error and 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.860
 which therefore has been commissioned 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.869
 default configuration of the bios 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.270
 some may indicate that the battery 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.270
 is bad or with little energy 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.390
 it may not even load the system 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.890
 operative indicate that overclocking 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.650
 what we have done to the computer 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.380
 is failing even that has detected 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.390
 a new cpu although we have not changed 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.610
 and other failures because they are 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.130
 unpredictable in any case there is no 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.590
 that frightening the process is very easy what 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.360
 first we have to think is that 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.900
 you have to open the computer and so 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.510
 both have some safety rules 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.730
 First step remove the power cable 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.320
 previous previously that turn off the pc 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.450
 obviously good to remove the cable from 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.340
 electric current that enters the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.750
 power door on the back 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.270
 of the computer 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.190
 then we will have to knock it down 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.710
 horizontally so that the plate 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.020
 base is at the bottom of the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.960
 plate and horizontally that we see from 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.880
 up the motherboard once we see 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.730
 the motherboard must locate where 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.280
 is the battery or the battery very easy 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.930
 normally it is a visible site the 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.300
 point is that not many cables 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.030
 by means or things to remove in the case 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.940
 hypothetical that there are cables that we 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.580
 clog if we have it clear there is no 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.200
 problem but if we have doubts the best 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.989
 what you have to do is write down the position 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.740
 of the cables and even take a picture 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.050
 with the mobile 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.270
 we remove the cables if they come and 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.140
 we will see that it is a pile of 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:44.350
 known button type batteries that have the 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.700
 approximate size of a coin and that 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:53.110
 they know as cr 2032 the indication of 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:57.280
 closure is of is a lithium battery on 20 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.180
 the diameter in millimeters and 32 is the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.480
 thickness 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.550
 well then once it is located 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.380
 you just have to remove it a very 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.330
 important is that you download by the 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.740
 static electricity that we can have 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.380
 accumulated in the body due 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.470
 mainly to the clothes that we wear and 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.900
 the friction with the air simply 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.300
 we will have to touch with some hand 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.730
 metallic object that has takes the earth 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.060
 for example the bathroom faucet and the 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.730
 enough or even the grate of a house 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.980
 or anything that is suspicious of 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.540
 that is in contact with the soil of that 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.700
 way we will discharge the electricity 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.560
 accumulated static and we will prevent it from 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.600
 download on the motherboard or 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.700
 any other component with damage 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.220
 that causes can even leave the 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.530
 useless plates start the process 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.480
 also very easy well embedded in a 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.980
 sort of socket and we will see that it has 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.410
 a metal cap not a border 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.830
 pressing on that metal cap 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.420
 directly jumps the battery in case of 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.390
 that we did not have it built 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.190
 defective can be extracted by helping us 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.980
 of a finite screwdriver for 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.040
 lifting them on that step should not 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.350
 to be very hard we can apply certain 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.510
 strength but always taking care of 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.640
 do not break anything once we have 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.080
 withdrawn the battery the only thing we have 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.400
 what to do is buy a new 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.100
 so we bought it previously 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.070
 or we go to any bazaar or store 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.720
 electronics is always normally going to 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.610
 cost considerably less than four euros 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.230
 even by ebay 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.400
 we have come to buy us 50 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.560
 batteries of that type for two euros 50 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.200
 well once we have the battery what 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.680
 what you have to do is insert the new 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.200
 in the socket it always fits with the 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.720
 Upward symbol is important 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.900
 position and press lightly 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.000
 will sound a click and that battery will already be 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.350
 stayed put and perfectly for 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.570
 function 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.610
 when we turn on the pc we have to 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.390
 keep in mind that the computer has 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.980
 the rioja 0 by default so good and 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.640
 knows what needs to be done is entered into the 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.770
 bios the current date is set and if 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.930
 previously we have already configured 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.820
 our good taste because we can touch up 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.070
 if values are not loaded by 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.170
 defect and little by little we are adjusting 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.240
 the so that our pc has a better 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.580
 performance 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.250
 one thing in the case that the motherboard 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.250
 be very old the battery may not 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.259
 is a button type but this axis is 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.530
 a cylindrical cylinder type battery 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:32.060
 like a barrel in that case it is extracted 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.220
 of the two supports that have two 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.630
 sides in the same process is a little more 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.300
 hard to find but also the 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.030
 there are already very bad ones if you are welded 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.099
 with a lot of patience and being careful 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.009
 of not heating it little by little with the 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.750
 welder we are giving him to be able 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.669
 extract it so you do not have to be scared 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.199
 when life gives a problem almost 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.199
 he always makes the battery
