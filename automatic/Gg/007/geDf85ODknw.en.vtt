00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.050
 lately since you already know that I am 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.690
 doing less in xbox than at the moment of 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.210

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.240
 I speak the game by subscribers worth 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.820
 You already know about the events of the 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.320
 direct and all that then this audio 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.410
 as you already know the audio of the micros 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.060
 normally heard on TV by 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.430
 they play all that because they lose a lot 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.380
 quality and I do not see it well upload it to 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.850

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.420

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.310
 upload everything to the secondary channel voucher 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.020

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.470
 is going to listen to your audio is not going to be 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.940
 the best audio in the world but 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.830
 obviously you listen well and you 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.350
 understand then all these careers 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.090
 that I recorded with your audio I'm going to 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.370
 go up to the secondary channel then 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.600
 aside guys I invite you if someone 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.240
 wants to see me play to game 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.070
 subscribe here the channel the races of 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.930
 gta vale you can subscribe the channel 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.600
 just follow us or nothing is for 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.390
 inform you and also worth another of the 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.160
 very important things this channel I what 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.590
 I did when they closed when there was the 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.780
 time many channels closed 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.100
 that went up gta vale I was worried 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.110
 evidently by my channel and by 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.420
 you and I made a secondary channel 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.240
 in case one day will happen let's hope that 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.590
 something will happen then for the people 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.540
 I said why do not you make yourself a channel 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.430
 secondary or if one day pass it and all 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.380
 that and obviously prevents me 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.510
 then ok I will explain to you for the 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.640
 people who want can subscribe 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.920
 subscribe to this channel if one day 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.720
 something will happen in my main one and so 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.250
 we can inform is worth saying what I am is 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.050
 upload a video there that has happened to me 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.490
 It's good for you to be informed and not 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.270
 disappear it's worth it guys because if I 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.890
 they close the channel 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.440
 then it is very difficult because people 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.390
 that follows you on twitter is not as much as 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.040
 in the channel would be lost a lot 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.080
 a lot of people and it's very difficult 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.060
 recover it and me because I would not like 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.489
 ok since I love having them all 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.650
 with me then that's why that's why 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.210
 is this channel that you are going to have the 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.010
 link in the description of the video is my 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.780
 channel 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.370
 and for example if you do not like 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.290
 gameplays because you are subscribed because they give 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.940
 gameplay channels there are a lot in 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.380
 youtube obviously and you do not like what 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.750
 that I upload you can remove the 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.400
 notifications you subscribe and only you 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.440
 you stay there in case one day something happens 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.360
 that you see my important video explaining 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.310
 that has happened then you do not need 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.620
 that ends this subscribe you remove the 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.750
 notifications and you do not see any video and 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.030
 nothing else that you like because I 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.160
 very nice that you are in this channel 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.320
 that's why I leave you the description and 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.570
 now I ask you to subscribe 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.180
 obviously forced us but for 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.130
 if you move to any two and then another 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.080
 of the things kids is that I'm going to do to myself 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.940
 well, it's done right now 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.290
 missing is missing the wolf and all that 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.510
 that I will be preparing this 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.490
 week or I'll explain it 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.590
 channel with a friend added from many of 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.930
 you already meet bertone people one 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.610
 is a friend of mine is a neighbor a friend in 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.680
 real life is very good friend of mine 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.900
 We are going to make a channel of 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.360
 Android mobile gameplays seems 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.240
 moment is going to be the channel is going to be called 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.100
 I think it's android gameplays and now 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.440
 I'm going to explain the one that's worth here 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.320
 we are going to climb more or less every day 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.540
 every two days a review about a game 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.580
 from android then well many of 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.290
 you suppose that you will have mobiles 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.000
 Android at the moment I can only do it 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.250
 with android mobile because most of 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.440
 Games here are free and if there is payment 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.820
 we will also have them then I will 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.680
 explain then that we would give rise to a 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.170
 game is worth the first video for example 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.570
 that open modem combat 5 channels a 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.830
 game that you have uploaded to the secondary 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.050
 but we're very handsome as me 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.360
 soteras and mixed between battlefield and 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.710
 call of duty is very very handsome and I'm going 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.970
 to go up there to see what is going to serve 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.220
 Well, for all the people who love it 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.680
 play with mobile games can see 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.660
 games there is worth it already then it's going to 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.610
 to be able to see will be able to see the review if 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.170
 like the game is going to buy it if not 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.360
 he likes the game he is not going to buy it 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.490
 in the case that it's free because I know 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.530
 download and until then another of the 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.260
 things you can say to me hey more I 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.210
 I want him to go up to the game such his 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.040
 get this game do a review we 're going 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.840
 to do is also going to have the 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.820
 My friend's twitter can you also 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.770
 follow and do not and by twitter and if not in the 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.050
 channel in comments you can not ask 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.060
 what game do you want us to climb? 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.729
 then we will take the ones we are going to upload 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.520
 so as there are no channels 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:40.110
 It's worth for youtube videos or there's almost no 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.449
 channels so here you can have 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.819
 many gameplays of games so that 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:47.099
 you can see since there are many games 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:48.779
 Well here you can see them and 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:50.819
 decide if then if you want it if you 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:52.650
 you want to download and all that is worth nothing 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:54.479
 more kids you will have the three channels
