00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.020
 hello to all these gains off I hope 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.730
 that you're fine 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.530
 and today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.510
 party in domination on the raid map 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.580
 and yes again on the remedy map but at 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.420
 the base is not this set because it 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.300
 was doing here that I wanted to show you 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.619
 but it's rather this one, yes, just the 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.119
 part right after actually i did 1 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.160
 121 0 but the game did not want that that 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.230
 I actually recorded it downright 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.720
 been removed black servers 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.190
 ops of some parts are a little 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.900
 delete like that from time to time we 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.129
 was a bit of a shame because he was 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.229
 more beautiful than this one I find 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.699
 I had done - elimination with my 

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:44.900
 series and more with my army was a 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.030
 little higher a little more pleasant to 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.220
 look but well in the meantime I'll you 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.110
 propose this one I have slightly 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.120
 accelerated anyway the passages to the 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.440
 I use the strict story scores that 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.120
 it's not too boring to watch 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.239
 then it's a bit a little bit 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.129
 more alive so let's go back without a 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.170
 gameplay then in this part as 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.340
 class I use my favorite class with 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.640
 typing w 57 the muffler and the 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.289
 ergonomic handle in trump I use 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.869
 determination and ghosts 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.490
 we all have one in both use 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.039
 robustness and we have however I use 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.750
 the tactical mask and dexterity then 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.299
 I use neither secondary weapons nor 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.310
 the state nor tactics all that I do not 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.659
 absolutely not serve so this is city 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.300
 quickly for the presentation of my 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.040
 place then 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.290
 now so this gold which surprises me 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.090
 domination but more specifically in fact 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.230
 we look at the territory because it 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.440
 must know that in fact at the base I do not 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.570
 I'm not at all a day of domination 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.800
 on modern warfare 3 I played almost 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:48.130
 only in team deathmatch so in 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.720
 a team death match and in fact he 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.490
 turned out that on this black ops the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.930
 team death match is really 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.630
 way too short and a lot 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.160
 less interesting than domination and 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.870
 the fact that the developers 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.630
 have put strict relief rather than 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.590
 killstreaks that really made me 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.720
 change my point of view on the 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.160
 domination and there is also other 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.170
 thing that makes that I have a sudden 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.200
 want to play the domination on this 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.700
 boycott of these than to make three 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.830
 cantons try to take a point 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.560
 when we were trying to when we were trying 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.620
 to take a goal every time we 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.400
 was taking off the grenades and 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.140
 everything that goes with 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.330
 we also took flashes and 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.890
 paralyzing at every turn and 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.570
 honestly that's what made me the 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.530
 more enraged on my lover do you 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.730
 I did not stop making myself 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.410
 flashing did not stop me 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.360
 paralyzed I could never do anything 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.250
 because I was on the points and 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.750
 it's not at all the case of a block 2/4 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.680
 as used tactical mask 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.300
 I'm almost insensitive to 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.280
 everything that is flashing and paralyzing 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.880
 electric boats also and so that 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.860
 it is 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.420
 it's really terran what I like 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.180
 in fact a black ops is that every 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.620
 once we have that there is an asset a 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.880
 accessory that is a little bit 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.950
 powerful bahia always inevitably 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.140
 something to counter it and that's 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.550
 shape frankly that I love and that's 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.940
 it makes me love you 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.140
 black ops 2 so then why do I 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.070
 plays in territory war and not in 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.080
 classic domination 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.990
 in fact the reason is very simple it is 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.670
 to say that 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.960
 in fact you had it in a kind of 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.120
 way I want to ride a little my 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.920
 ratio because after everything set 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.700
 all diamond weapons need to know 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.430
 how is it seen anyway 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.660
 dropped especially with the with all 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.370
 weapons of the kind the big ones 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.190
 machine guns just like that things 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.570
 very very heavy first run for himself 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.940
 move it's really very very 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.810
 annoying and reassure me well dropped from the 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.720
 I'm a little bit in a phase 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.010
 ratio rise is so to go up 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.240
 their assaults I use both sets 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.830
 which in my opinion are the most 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.800
 powerful of the game ie the lot of 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.030
 stars and the fighting adaf then the 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.100
 problem is that when I play in 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.630
 normal domination I'm balancing a lot 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.400
 of stars is a nadal leads from elsewhere 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.660
 when I only swing the leinster 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.890
 three-quarters so half or even 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.230
 the three make the team in front rage 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.490
 who simply and that's great 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.780
 boring because there is no one in 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.880
 face well see I understand them well 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.240
 obviously it does not necessarily happen 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.680
 it's not necessarily easy do not think 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.120
 inevitably pleasure when you get killed 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.410
 in chain 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.940
 but you must know that 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.020
 I have come across some parts where 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.020
 people were taking out their rocket launcher 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.880
 and and kill me my lot of stars at the same 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.290
 not a few seconds and that I have a little 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.240
 hard to understand why people when 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.170
 they see a loti late in the face why 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.580
 does not he just come out of 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.840
 rocket launcher and then I mean in 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.270
 The smallest star five seconds one does 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.960
 speak more what so well here are the people 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.700
 they prefer to buy 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.810
 so suddenly in normal domination in 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.960
 Swiss account here it's a bit difficult 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.610
 down just more of finding some 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.080
 world counts who plays and digs for 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.910
 that I play in territory war 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.410
 the week had more people 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.060
 people tend still to 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.160
 morges that when one is at war of 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.500
 territory so that's what I play 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.970
 in this mode then I told you that 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.010
 I used to claude star and adaf 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.370
 fighting for us your pieces and in 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.080
 made 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.240
 finally the good reasons for that is 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.000
 that the star in my opinion is the series the 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.710
 more powerful black ops 2 this is the 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.510
 series with which I made the most of 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.460
 no more elimination no matter which mode 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.110
 game no matter whatever map 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.550
 finally maybe of course surepress 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.800
 of this kind of my place it's a bit 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.970
 more complicated but I think that even 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.830
 the other series are very complicated 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.910
 on express because honestly once 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.820
 I swung the dogs they did 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.830
 three eliminations finally he's what 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.730
 it's not terrible so 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.390
 honestly the star I think it's 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.740
 really the best series 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.850
 of eliminations and on average I do 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.590
 with a roadster I have to do in 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.620
 is in the es15 elimination it's 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.550
 really huge and the adaf it's a small 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.560
 little the same thing even if it's a bit 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.760
 less powerful even though the trend when 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.680
 even to fall faster with the 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.750
 launches rockets 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.640
 he still does very good scores 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.970
 in general I am between 12 and 15 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.920
 nation to the must so that's really 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.440
 controllable series we will say the 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.360
 more powerful the more powerful of 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.710
 this black ops 2 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.890
 so I think we are here you want 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.150
 quickly raise your ratio finally if 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.830
 you feel capable of course madam 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.419
 is one of those series there because good 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.950
 it's not necessarily obvious 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.419
 to reach all the time I do not 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.250
 each part that I show a little the 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.540
 best gameplay I do I want 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.860
 not either show you parties a 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.510
 a little bit moldy where I do 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.750
 gameplay where I do not scores 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:02.420
 terrible so if you feel 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.040
 you feel good enough to do 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.720
 series like that I think it's 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.790
 this is the best way to rate this 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.580
 monster really does a very very big 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:13.400
 massacre and in general people have 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.260
 not the presence of mind let us say the 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.210
 want to get out their rocket launcher and 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.690
 So that's what made a lot of amended 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.040
 very big part with his mother so I 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.660
 you stick talking about other series 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.430
 of eliminations that end of the big other 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.580
 big series of eliminations namely the 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.870
 dogs and the helley the drones the 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.450
 customs hunting the squadron to turn 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.710
 the chan here are the dogs I had failed 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.480
 tonight I still was very disappointed 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.740
 on dogs on this black ops 2 then 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.600
 I do not really remember anymore on black 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.940
 ops was super efficient quickly 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.100
 it did not seem ineffective but on 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.480
 this black of the honestly I 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.520
 really a lot of trouble doing more than 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.660
 five eliminations with the dogs then 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.820
 I do not know if it's because they 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.620
 are easier to kill if I finally 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.090
 do not know too much but five nominations I 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.680
 find it pretty weak for the number of 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.850
 points it takes to get out 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.870
 dogs 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.980
 after that, for sure, you will tell me 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.990
 that dogs are not bad 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.250
 enemies then in the end you can not d 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.360
 disposal with your weapon a lot 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.530
 more easily but who are the 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.690
 enemies are busy with dogs 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.760
 but all the same I think it's a 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.130
 little damage and if not the last series 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.020
 So hunting rights so that there 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.850
 she is finally I have a little opinion 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.560
 mixed on this series because actually 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.510
 sometimes I really do things 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.770
 huge kind it's coming out of quarters of 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.690
 humiliation and then other times I 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.700
 do two or three years we do not know 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.780
 really why ends so she has 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.580
 still the advantage destroying everything 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.080
 who's funny about anti drones 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.230
 all that is to the helicopters all 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.730
 that's still an advantage but 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.680
 it's really pretty random I think 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.330
 as controllable series compario series 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.020
 where we are a little bit sure of this 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.090
 what are we going to do 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.830
 and so to finish I also wanted you 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.940
 talk about a benefit concert to put 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.000
 the series against the ap that make 

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.650
 a lot of elimination is that it 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.690
 brings you a lot for mint 

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.700
 for the for the next series at each 

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:52.100
 times like I miss maybe two 

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.750
 or three eliminations no more for 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.100
 have the orbital station since yesterday the 

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.450
 orbital station got anyway 

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.000
 as I know exactly where are the 

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.320
 enemies in general there are not too many 

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.990
 problems to finish the series 

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.180
 so here's this video for this 

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.410
 gameplay i hope it will have you pleased if 

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.640
 this cabin do not hesitate to put a 

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.320
 jet but if you have questions 

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.320
 the comment space is there go hi
