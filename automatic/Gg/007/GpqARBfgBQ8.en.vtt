00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
1500 again I bought this to modify I

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.800 
1500 again I bought this to modify I
just<00:02:02.939> haven't<00:02:03.180> gotten<00:02:03.299> around<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.630> yet<00:02:03.750> I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
just haven't gotten around to it yet I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.330 
just haven't gotten around to it yet I
don't<00:02:03.930> actually<00:02:04.259> collect<00:02:04.560> things<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:04.950> that

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
don't actually collect things like that

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.370 
don't actually collect things like that
because<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.299> don't<00:02:06.450> find<00:02:06.570> much<00:02:06.780> value<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.259> just

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
because I don't find much value in just

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.820 
because I don't find much value in just
having<00:02:07.619> your<00:02:07.920> flashers<00:02:08.340> like<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.580> around

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
having your flashers like that around

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.589 
having your flashers like that around
this<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> deploy<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.000> whiteout<00:02:12.239> paint

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
this is a deploy in the whiteout paint

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.240 
this is a deploy in the whiteout paint
scheme<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.110> don't<00:02:13.620> care

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
scheme I don't care

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.240 
scheme I don't care
for<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.430> deploy<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.870> started<00:02:16.770> liking<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
for the deploy but I started liking the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.770 
for the deploy but I started liking the
whiteout<00:02:17.550> scheme<00:02:17.940> after<00:02:18.210> it<00:02:18.540> was<00:02:18.660> out<00:02:18.750> of

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
whiteout scheme after it was out of

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.390 
whiteout scheme after it was out of
stores<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.440> saw<00:02:19.740> this<00:02:19.860> at<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> yard<00:02:20.160> sale

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
stores and so I saw this at a yard sale

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.340 
stores and so I saw this at a yard sale
and<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:20.760> figured<00:02:21.000> I'd<00:02:21.090> get<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.510> put<00:02:22.260> in

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
and I just figured I'd get it and put in

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.410 
and I just figured I'd get it and put in
homemade<00:02:22.650> internals<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.000> still<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.300> it

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
homemade internals and I still have it

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.610 
homemade internals and I still have it
but<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.500> light<00:02:25.830> works<00:02:26.160> here<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.790> think<00:02:27.330> yeah

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
but the light works here I think yeah

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.530 
but the light works here I think yeah
so<00:02:29.310> I'm<00:02:29.400> actually<00:02:29.550> probably<00:02:29.940> he's<00:02:30.180> really

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
so I'm actually probably he's really

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.690 
so I'm actually probably he's really
cool<00:02:30.720> with<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.070> cuz<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:32.190> I'll<00:02:32.520> actually

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
cool with this cuz I just I'll actually

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.920 
cool with this cuz I just I'll actually
like<00:02:33.060> how<00:02:33.209> does<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.390> deploy<00:02:33.660> looks

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
like how does the deploy looks

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.390 
like how does the deploy looks
especially<00:02:34.709> in<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:34.830> paint<00:02:35.040> scheme<00:02:35.250> but<00:02:35.370> I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
especially in this paint scheme but I

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.780 
especially in this paint scheme but I
just<00:02:35.550> don't<00:02:35.730> like<00:02:36.080> how<00:02:37.080> crap<00:02:37.410> they<00:02:37.650> are<00:02:37.790> I

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
just don't like how crap they are I

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.730 
just don't like how crap they are I
might<00:02:39.420> make<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:40.100> they<00:02:41.100> called<00:02:41.870> like<00:02:42.870> what<00:02:43.110> ARF

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
might make a they called like what ARF

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
might try that or I'll just do something

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.530 
might try that or I'll just do something

actually<00:03:49.890> kind<00:03:50.190> of<00:03:50.280> funny<00:03:50.549> this<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.850> I<00:03:51.060> guess

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
actually kind of funny this is I guess

actually kind of funny this is I guess
one<00:03:51.390> of<00:03:51.420> my<00:03:51.510> other<00:03:51.660> collectors<00:03:52.079> items

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
one of my other collectors items

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.350 
one of my other collectors items
it<00:03:53.400> doesn't<00:03:53.640> really<00:03:53.730> have<00:03:53.910> much<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.150> value

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
it doesn't really have much of a value

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.930 
it doesn't really have much of a value
but<00:03:54.450> basically<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:55.280> pull<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.489> handle

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
but basically you pull this handle

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.430 
but basically you pull this handle
backwards<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.750> every<00:03:57.959> time<00:03:58.140> you<00:03:58.200> pull<00:03:58.350> it

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
backwards and every time you pull it

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.590 
backwards and every time you pull it
backwards<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.920> fires<00:03:59.220> out<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.299> different

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
backwards it fires out of a different

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.720 
backwards it fires out of a different
barrel<00:04:00.780> so<00:04:01.079> it<00:04:01.170> was<00:04:01.320> almost<00:04:01.500> like<00:04:01.769> a<00:04:01.829> ancient

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
barrel so it was almost like a ancient

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.069

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.699 
version of SLAM fire and they're pretty
funny<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:08.220> use<00:04:08.430> these<00:04:08.670> mega<00:04:09.000> darts<00:04:09.410> as<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.590> can

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
funny to use these mega darts as you can

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.280 
funny to use these mega darts as you can
