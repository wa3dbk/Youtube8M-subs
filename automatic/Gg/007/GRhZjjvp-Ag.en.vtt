all right I got some update information
on<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.390> RV<00:00:06.390> 30<00:00:07.309> and<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:08.460> have<00:00:08.639> some<00:00:08.820> questions

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
on the RV 30 and I have some questions

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.779 
on the RV 30 and I have some questions
are<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.550> remember<00:00:11.849> as<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:13.370> had<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:15.320> running<00:00:16.320> rich

wanted to put into this car until I was
able<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.469> drive<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.309> don't<00:00:38.610> even<00:00:38.670> know<00:00:38.820> if

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
able to drive it I I don't even know if

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.500 
able to drive it I I don't even know if
I<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.360> car<00:00:39.590> drove<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.860> got<00:00:41.850> into<00:00:42.120> some

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
I like the car drove it got into some

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.470 
I like the car drove it got into some
boost<00:00:42.719> went<00:00:43.020> down<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.350> road<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.940> I<00:00:44.940> don't

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
boost went down the road and I don't

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.940 
boost went down the road and I don't
like<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.629> got<00:00:45.989> into<00:00:46.200> some<00:00:46.230> boost<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.860> I

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
like it got into some boost and I

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.850 
like it got into some boost and I
freaking<00:00:47.309> liked<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.410> now<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.469> fun<00:00:49.829> begins

know I got the Z everything anyway i
bought<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.109> haltech<00:00:58.859> platinum<00:00:59.430> pro<00:01:00.770> plug<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
bought a haltech platinum pro plug and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.889 
bought a haltech platinum pro plug and
play<00:01:02.160> ECU<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.090> some<00:01:03.300> questions<00:01:03.420> all

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
play ECU but I have some questions all

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.969 
play ECU but I have some questions all
right<00:01:05.869> there's<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.080> little<00:01:07.229> girl<00:01:07.530> when<00:01:07.770> she

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
right there's the little girl when she

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.330 
right there's the little girl when she
was<00:01:08.130> little<00:01:09.049> let's<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.229> into<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:13.100> it<00:01:14.100> has

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
was little let's get into this it has

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.050 
was little let's get into this it has
base<00:01:14.640> maps<00:01:15.229> when<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> load<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.250> beat<00:01:17.580> now

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
base maps when I load the are beat now

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.990 
base maps when I load the are beat now
this<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.420> rb30<00:01:19.229> with<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> 25<00:01:20.130> head<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:20.850> got

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
this is rb30 with a 25 head so it's got

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.710 
this is rb30 with a 25 head so it's got
all<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.270> electronics<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.200> an<00:01:22.470> rb25<00:01:23.689> when<00:01:24.689> I

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
all the electronics of an rb25 when I

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.660 
all the electronics of an rb25 when I
load<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:26.600> rb25de<00:01:27.600> base<00:01:28.320> map<00:01:28.619> meaning<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.369> want

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
load the rb25de base map meaning I want

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.940 
load the rb25de base map meaning I want
to<00:01:29.759> use<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.270> internal<00:01:30.869> map<00:01:31.170> sensor<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
to use the internal map sensor in the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
to use the internal map sensor in the
haltech<00:01:32.700> ECU<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:37.820> not<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.240> mass<00:01:39.540> air<00:01:39.840> flow

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
haltech ECU and not the mass air flow

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.510 
haltech ECU and not the mass air flow
sensor<00:01:42.290> it<00:01:43.290> will

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.969 

trying<00:01:47.329> to<00:01:47.390> get<00:01:47.509> it<00:01:47.570> get<00:01:48.170> it<00:01:48.200> going<00:01:48.590> here<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:48.950> I

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
trying to get it get it going here so I

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.190 
trying to get it get it going here so I
can<00:01:49.070> show<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:49.369> it'll<00:01:50.240> start<00:01:50.539> but<00:01:51.140> then<00:01:52.149> stall

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
can show you it'll start but then stall

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.690 
can show you it'll start but then stall
instantly<00:01:54.200> try<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.590> give<00:01:54.770> it<00:01:54.890> gas<00:01:55.039> doesn't<00:01:55.579> do

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
instantly try to give it gas doesn't do

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:07.959 
instantly try to give it gas doesn't do
anything<00:01:56.000> when<00:01:56.750> i<00:01:56.780> load<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.229> RB<00:02:00.069> the<00:02:01.069> RB<00:02:01.490> 26<00:02:06.969> ve

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
anything when i load the RB the RB 26 ve

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.670 
anything when i load the RB the RB 26 ve
map<00:02:08.599> it<00:02:09.470> starts<00:02:10.069> and<00:02:10.250> runs<00:02:11.080> but<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.200> but<00:02:12.560> it's

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
map it starts and runs but it but it's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.270 
map it starts and runs but it but it's
once<00:02:13.310> again<00:02:13.459> it's<00:02:13.910> running<00:02:14.269> well<00:02:16.750> i<00:02:18.160> was<00:02:19.160> going

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
once again it's running well i was going

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.920 
once again it's running well i was going
to<00:02:19.310> say<00:02:19.400> it's<00:02:19.610> running<00:02:19.940> rich<00:02:20.239> but<00:02:20.569> it's<00:02:20.690> really

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
to say it's running rich but it's really

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.580 
to say it's running rich but it's really
not<00:02:21.230> because<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.790> RV<00:02:23.120> 26<00:02:24.670> has<00:02:26.590> 440cc

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
not because the the RV 26 has 440cc

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:35.500 
not because the the RV 26 has 440cc
injectors<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.310> i<00:02:28.640> have<00:02:28.970> three<00:02:29.660> 70s<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:34.510> should

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
injectors and i have three 70s so should

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.690 
injectors and i have three 70s so should
be<00:02:35.660> running<00:02:35.840> leaner<00:02:36.200> right<00:02:36.590> because<00:02:37.010> if<00:02:37.040> the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
be running leaner right because if the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.690 
be running leaner right because if the
440<00:02:38.299> map<00:02:38.510> is<00:02:38.810> saying<00:02:39.110> give<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.069> this<00:02:40.190> much<00:02:40.400> fuel

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
440 map is saying give it this much fuel

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.589 
440 map is saying give it this much fuel
it<00:02:41.030> thinks<00:02:41.930> it's<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.200> bigger<00:02:42.380> injector<00:02:43.599> anyway

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
it thinks it's a bigger injector anyway

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.750 
it thinks it's a bigger injector anyway
I'm<00:02:44.840> confusing<00:02:45.560> myself<00:02:45.680> but<00:02:48.579> alright<00:02:49.579> check

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
I'm confusing myself but alright check

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.220 
I'm confusing myself but alright check
this<00:02:49.819> out

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.009 

all<00:02:56.230> right<00:02:56.349> this<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.680> 25<00:02:57.250> map<00:02:57.610> rb25<00:02:58.480> map

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
all right this is the 25 map rb25 map

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:13.320 
all right this is the 25 map rb25 map
right<00:02:59.319> here<00:03:11.370> that's<00:03:12.370> about<00:03:12.580> all<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:12.879> can<00:03:13.120> get

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
right here that's about all I can get

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.050 
right here that's about all I can get
out<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:14.160> with<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.190> 25<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:17.790> I'm<00:03:18.790> just<00:03:18.910> going

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
out of it with the 25 so I'm just going

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.400 
out of it with the 25 so I'm just going
to<00:03:19.120> video<00:03:19.450> this<00:03:19.750> also<00:03:20.080> because<00:03:20.769> I<00:03:22.170> don't<00:03:23.170> know

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
to video this also because I don't know

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.910 
to video this also because I don't know
really

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.790 

alright<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:29.819> here's<00:03:30.060> let's<00:03:30.599> go<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.990> RB<00:03:31.290> 26

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:41.199 

ve<00:03:34.800> map<00:03:36.349> loading<00:03:37.349> her<00:03:37.440> up<00:03:38.989> now<00:03:39.989> with<00:03:40.170> this<00:03:40.290> map

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
ve map loading her up now with this map

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.630 
ve map loading her up now with this map
the<00:03:42.209> only<00:03:42.480> difference<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:43.170> can<00:03:43.349> tell<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:44.340> I

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
the only difference I can tell and I

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.120 
the only difference I can tell and I
tried<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.180> comparing<00:03:45.780> maps<00:03:46.050> thing<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.860> I

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
tried the comparing maps thing and I

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.800 
tried the comparing maps thing and I
don't<00:03:47.520> know<00:03:47.700> how<00:03:47.819> to<00:03:47.880> work<00:03:48.090> this<00:03:48.239> program<00:03:48.660> at

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
don't know how to work this program at

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.210 
don't know how to work this program at
all<00:03:48.930> because<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.950> Hal<00:03:50.130> tank<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:50.550> my<00:03:50.580> Z<00:03:50.970> is<00:03:52.220> it's

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
all because the Hal tank in my Z is it's

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.710 
all because the Hal tank in my Z is it's
old<00:03:53.580> school<00:03:54.239> so<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.900> program<00:03:55.350> is<00:03:56.720> completely

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
old school so the program is completely

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.360 
old school so the program is completely
different<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.650> only<00:03:58.830> thing<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.160> can<00:03:59.220> tell

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
different the only thing I can tell

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.110 
different the only thing I can tell
that's<00:04:00.239> different<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:01.069> in<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.220> set<00:04:02.519> up<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:03.660> 26

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
that's different is in the set up the 26

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.020 
that's different is in the set up the 26
base<00:04:06.120> map<00:04:06.980> uses<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.220> throttle<00:04:08.580> position

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
base map uses the throttle position

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.449 
base map uses the throttle position
sensor<00:04:09.060> as<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:10.970> fuel<00:04:11.970> additive<00:04:12.660> adding<00:04:13.620> agent

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
sensor as the fuel additive adding agent

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.900 
sensor as the fuel additive adding agent
instead<00:04:14.880> of<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.569> map<00:04:15.810> sensor<00:04:16.579> but<00:04:17.579> when<00:04:17.880> I

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
instead of the map sensor but when I

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.120 
instead of the map sensor but when I
went<00:04:18.120> into<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.540> 25<00:04:18.989> set<00:04:19.380> up<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.739> tried<00:04:19.950> to

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
went into the 25 set up and tried to

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.700 
went into the 25 set up and tried to
switch<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.519> from<00:04:20.639> the<00:04:20.850> map<00:04:21.229> to<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.380> throttle

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
switch it from the map to the throttle

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.190 
switch it from the map to the throttle
position<00:04:23.580> didn't<00:04:24.389> make<00:04:24.540> any<00:04:24.690> difference<00:04:24.900> so

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
position didn't make any difference so

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.010 
position didn't make any difference so
something<00:04:25.950> is<00:04:26.070> different<00:04:26.660> so<00:04:27.660> that<00:04:27.870> the

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
something is different so that the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.320 
something is different so that the
freaking<00:04:28.590> car<00:04:28.889> runs<00:04:29.310> okay<00:04:29.669> look<00:04:29.880> here's<00:04:30.240> the

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
freaking car runs okay look here's the

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:45.719 
freaking car runs okay look here's the
26<00:04:31.550> watch<00:04:32.550> this

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.170 

now<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:47.069> got<00:04:48.069> to<00:04:48.159> keep<00:04:48.279> my<00:04:48.339> foot<00:04:48.699> on<00:04:48.729> the<00:04:48.969> gas<00:04:49.120> a

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
now I got to keep my foot on the gas a

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.939 
now I got to keep my foot on the gas a
little<00:04:49.419> bit<00:04:49.719> because<00:04:50.520> there<00:04:51.520> is<00:04:51.699> no<00:04:51.939> idle<00:04:52.300> air

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
little bit because there is no idle air

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.929 
little bit because there is no idle air
see<00:04:53.949> this<00:04:54.069> is<00:04:54.249> what<00:04:54.460> I'm<00:04:54.580> idling<00:04:55.089> it<00:04:56.759> so<00:04:57.759> I<00:04:57.819> can

00:04:57.929 --> 00:04:57.939 
see this is what I'm idling it so I can

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:59.129 
see this is what I'm idling it so I can
go<00:04:58.029> out<00:04:58.120> there<00:04:58.150> and<00:04:58.360> idle<00:04:58.659> up<00:04:58.779> the<00:04:58.839> throttle

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
go out there and idle up the throttle

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.049 
go out there and idle up the throttle
body<00:04:59.349> but<00:04:59.830> I<00:05:00.039> don't<00:05:00.339> want<00:05:00.460> to<00:05:00.520> do<00:05:00.610> that<00:05:00.669> I<00:05:00.849> want

00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:01.059 
body but I don't want to do that I want

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:10.999 
body but I don't want to do that I want
to<00:05:01.210> know<00:05:01.330> why<00:05:06.839> why<00:05:07.839> is<00:05:07.900> it<00:05:08.379> running<00:05:08.620> on<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.979> 26

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
to know why why is it running on the 26

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.570 
to know why why is it running on the 26
set<00:05:12.009> up<00:05:12.159> but<00:05:12.759> not<00:05:12.879> for<00:05:13.089> 25<00:05:13.539> which<00:05:13.900> I<00:05:14.430> guess<00:05:15.430> it

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
set up but not for 25 which I guess it

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.710 
set up but not for 25 which I guess it
really<00:05:15.699> doesn't<00:05:15.909> matter<00:05:16.180> i<00:05:16.360> could

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
really doesn't matter i could

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.110 
really doesn't matter i could
I<00:05:19.280> can<00:05:20.280> use<00:05:20.490> this<00:05:22.190> map<00:05:23.190> and<00:05:23.490> then<00:05:23.610> just<00:05:23.790> tweak

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
I can use this map and then just tweak

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.700 
I can use this map and then just tweak
this<00:05:24.420> but

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:54.780 

but<00:05:30.710> I<00:05:30.740> want<00:05:30.980> to<00:05:31.070> have<00:05:31.280> my<00:05:32.080> idol<00:05:33.080> and<00:05:33.200> all<00:05:33.530> that

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.470 

runs<00:05:55.390> great<00:05:55.660> that's<00:05:56.110> how<00:05:56.890> thick<00:05:57.250> but<00:05:57.520> so<00:05:58.330> my

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
runs great that's how thick but so my

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.470 
runs great that's how thick but so my
question<00:05:58.900> is<00:05:59.020> why<00:05:59.560> is<00:05:59.620> it<00:06:00.100> running<00:06:00.370> on<00:06:00.790> the<00:06:01.000> RB

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
question is why is it running on the RB

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:07.920 
question is why is it running on the RB
26<00:06:01.930> ve<00:06:02.710> base<00:06:03.280> map<00:06:03.640> and<00:06:04.420> not<00:06:05.350> the<00:06:05.560> 25<00:06:06.930> what

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
26 ve base map and not the 25 what

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.300 
26 ve base map and not the 25 what
setting<00:06:08.350> is

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
setting is

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.310 
setting is
anyway
