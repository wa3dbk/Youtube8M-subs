sort of a letter to my mother who

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.490 
sort of a letter to my mother who
treated<00:01:04.229> me<00:01:04.530> badly<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.460> an<00:01:05.670> exploration<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:07.260> a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
treated me badly but an exploration of a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.950 
treated me badly but an exploration of a
life<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.549> somebody<00:01:09.060> who<00:01:09.210> doesn't<00:01:09.659> know<00:01:09.780> your

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960

tend<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> think<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.500> fiction<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.189> most

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
tend to think that fiction is the most

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.200 
tend to think that fiction is the most
difficult<00:01:15.060> form<00:01:15.950> partly<00:01:16.950> because<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
difficult form partly because of the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.950 
difficult form partly because of the
lack<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.420> constraints<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.640> but<00:01:20.640> our<00:01:21.540> good

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
lack of constraints on it but our good

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.530 
lack of constraints on it but our good
memoir<00:01:22.619> or<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.040> good<00:01:23.430> piece<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.700> life<00:01:24.119> writing

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
memoir or a good piece of life writing

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.140 
memoir or a good piece of life writing
is<00:01:25.020> partly<00:01:25.590> good<00:01:25.950> not<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.000> what

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
is partly good not just because of what

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.179 
is partly good not just because of what
it<00:01:27.299> says<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.869> because<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.470> way<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.920> says

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
it says but because of the way it says

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.210 
it says but because of the way it says
it<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.640> those<00:01:30.270> rules<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:31.170> how<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.560> learn<00:01:31.950> to
