00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
work for most of the missions but it's

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.220 
work for most of the missions but it's
quite<00:02:44.400> exhilarating<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.180> gunplay<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.900> great

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
quite exhilarating the gunplay is great

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.229 
quite exhilarating the gunplay is great
it<00:02:46.440> handles<00:02:46.860> fantastic<00:02:47.550> which<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:48.090> was

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
it handles fantastic which that was

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.400 
it handles fantastic which that was
something<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.570> really<00:02:48.690> surprised<00:02:49.230> me

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
something that really surprised me

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.170 
something that really surprised me
because<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.220> wasn't<00:02:50.400> expecting<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.030> handle

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
because I wasn't expecting it to handle

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.460 
because I wasn't expecting it to handle
to<00:02:51.420> Ray<00:02:51.540> but<00:02:51.690> after<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.930> get<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.110> controls

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
to Ray but after you get the controls

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.070 
to Ray but after you get the controls
down<00:02:52.590> it's<00:02:53.310> not<00:02:53.489> half<00:02:53.730> bad<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.480> control

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
down it's not half bad the control

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.810 
down it's not half bad the control
scheme<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.410> definitely<00:02:55.860> different<00:02:56.190> from<00:02:56.489> a

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
scheme is definitely different from a

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.130 
scheme is definitely different from a
lot<00:02:56.850> of<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.150> third<00:02:57.330> person<00:02:57.690> shooters<00:02:57.959> that

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
lot of the third person shooters that

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.900 
lot of the third person shooters that
I'd<00:02:58.530> played<00:02:58.739> in<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.890> past<00:02:59.130> so<00:02:59.400> when<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.640> came<00:02:59.730> to

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
I'd played in the past so when I came to

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.580 
I'd played in the past so when I came to
this<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.390> did<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> little<00:03:01.019> bit<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.320> difficult

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
this I did a little bit of a difficult

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.440 
this I did a little bit of a difficult
time<00:03:01.739> adjusting<00:03:01.940> especially<00:03:02.940> since<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.330> know

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
time adjusting especially since you know

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.330 
time adjusting especially since you know
you<00:03:03.510> can't<00:03:03.840> shoulder<00:03:04.170> your<00:03:04.350> weapon<00:03:04.680> or<00:03:04.860> have

you can't shoulder your weapon or have

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.949 
you can't shoulder your weapon or have

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
it up continuously because what I

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.570 
it up continuously because what I
compare<00:03:07.320> this<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:08.280> other<00:03:08.400> third

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
compare this to is the other third

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
compare this to is the other third
person<00:03:08.880> shooters<00:03:09.150> I've<00:03:09.269> been<00:03:09.390> playing

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
person shooters I've been playing

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.660 
person shooters I've been playing
recently<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> whole<00:03:11.130> lot<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.400> ARMA

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
recently and that is a whole lot of ARMA

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.280 
recently and that is a whole lot of ARMA
3<00:03:11.940> which<00:03:12.180> we<00:03:12.360> know<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.720> these<00:03:12.840> are<00:03:12.989> very<00:03:13.170> very

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
3 which we know that these are very very

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.290 
3 which we know that these are very very
different<00:03:13.590> games<00:03:14.100> if<00:03:14.280> he<00:03:14.400> has<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.610> plate<00:03:14.820> ARMA<00:03:15.060> 3

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
different games if he has a plate ARMA 3

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.930 
different games if he has a plate ARMA 3
so<00:03:16.260> going<00:03:16.920> into<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.160> game<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.340> didn't<00:03:17.700> expect

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
so going into the game I didn't expect

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.699 
so going into the game I didn't expect
too<00:03:18.150> much<00:03:18.329> I<00:03:18.540> expected<00:03:18.989> like<00:03:19.110> I<00:03:19.140> said<00:03:19.410> an<00:03:19.500> over

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
too much I expected like I said an over

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.410 
too much I expected like I said an over
glorified<00:03:19.829> demo<00:03:20.519> but<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.090> was<00:03:21.209> really

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
glorified demo but it was really

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.030 
glorified demo but it was really
surprised<00:03:21.810> at<00:03:22.019> how<00:03:22.170> well<00:03:22.200> put<00:03:22.590> together<00:03:22.680> this

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
surprised at how well put together this

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.470 
surprised at how well put together this
is<00:03:23.220> it's<00:03:23.400> kind<00:03:23.579> of<00:03:23.610> like<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.760> teaser<00:03:24.120> for<00:03:24.269> the

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
is it's kind of like a teaser for the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.300 
is it's kind of like a teaser for the
phantom<00:03:24.840> pain<00:03:24.870> because<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.829> see<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.070> great

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
phantom pain because you see the great

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.580 
phantom pain because you see the great
visuals<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.940> greatest<00:03:27.269> statics<00:03:27.660> especially

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
visuals the greatest statics especially

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.460 
visuals the greatest statics especially
the<00:03:28.680> combat<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.989> responsiveness<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.110> the

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
the combat to the responsiveness of the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.740 
the combat to the responsiveness of the
system<00:03:31.829> is<00:03:32.040> pretty<00:03:32.280> good<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:33.209> graphics<00:03:33.450> look

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
system is pretty good the graphics look

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.479 
system is pretty good the graphics look
great<00:03:34.110> as<00:03:34.320> well<00:03:34.350> as<00:03:34.620> in<00:03:34.709> free<00:03:34.860> agency<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.370> is

again<00:03:35.670> on<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.880> xbox<00:03:36.209> one<00:03:36.450> I've<00:03:36.840> been<00:03:37.019> told

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
again on the xbox one I've been told

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.990 
again on the xbox one I've been told
that<00:03:37.320> it<00:03:37.440> does<00:03:37.590> look<00:03:37.799> visually<00:03:38.280> better<00:03:38.549> on<00:03:38.790> the

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
that it does look visually better on the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.060 
that it does look visually better on the
ps4<00:03:39.329> just<00:03:39.930> because<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.290> ps4<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.769> running<00:03:41.010> in

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
ps4 just because the ps4 is running in

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.030 
ps4 just because the ps4 is running in
native<00:03:41.700> 1080p<00:03:41.910> but<00:03:42.870> outside<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.769> there

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
native 1080p but outside of that there

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.500 
native 1080p but outside of that there
hasn't<00:03:44.190> been<00:03:44.340> too<00:03:44.700> much<00:03:44.820> of<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:45.090> difference

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
hasn't been too much of a difference

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.090 
hasn't been too much of a difference
it's<00:03:45.720> still<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:45.959> stunning<00:03:46.380> game<00:03:46.560> on<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.860> xbox

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
it's still a stunning game on the xbox

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.090 
it's still a stunning game on the xbox
one<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:47.850> also<00:03:48.570> from<00:03:49.049> what<00:03:49.260> I've<00:03:49.350> heard<00:03:49.380> on<00:03:49.860> the

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
one and also from what I've heard on the

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.920 
one and also from what I've heard on the
previous<00:03:50.519> gen<00:03:50.670> systems<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.150> ps3<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:51.900> the

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
previous gen systems the ps3 and the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.680 
previous gen systems the ps3 and the
xbox<00:03:52.680> 360<00:03:53.160> so<00:03:53.820> it's<00:03:53.940> nice<00:03:54.090> there's<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.510> lot<00:03:54.660> of

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
xbox 360 so it's nice there's a lot of

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.030 
xbox 360 so it's nice there's a lot of
stuff<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:55.049> here<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.260> I'm<00:03:55.440> still<00:03:55.650> trying<00:03:55.890> to

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
stuff in here that I'm still trying to

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.199 
stuff in here that I'm still trying to
experiment<00:03:56.400> with<00:03:56.579> because<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.180> a

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
experiment with because this is a

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.569 
experiment with because this is a
sandbox<00:03:57.680> while<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.739> lot<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:58.950> people<00:03:59.130> think<00:03:59.370> it

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
sandbox while a lot of people think it

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.069 
sandbox while a lot of people think it
is<00:03:59.610> just<00:03:59.880> a<00:04:00.000> demo<00:04:00.299> that<00:04:00.329> you'll<00:04:00.570> play<00:04:00.750> through

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
is just a demo that you'll play through

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.660 
is just a demo that you'll play through
and<00:04:01.320> I<00:04:01.860> know<00:04:01.920> there's<00:04:02.160> been<00:04:02.220> some<00:04:02.489> controversy

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
and I know there's been some controversy

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.300 
and I know there's been some controversy
articles<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.600> think<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.530> was<00:04:04.590> from<00:04:04.709> Eurogamer

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
articles I think it was from Eurogamer

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.250 
articles I think it was from Eurogamer
who<00:04:05.489> brought<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:05.850> up<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.870> they<00:04:06.959> talked<00:04:07.170> about

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
who brought it up and they talked about

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.449 
who brought it up and they talked about
we<00:04:07.530> were<00:04:07.620> able<00:04:07.709> to<00:04:07.860> beat<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.070> game<00:04:08.190> in<00:04:08.310> 10

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
we were able to beat the game in 10

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.550 
we were able to beat the game in 10
minutes<00:04:08.640> so<00:04:09.000> that<00:04:09.209> spiked<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.170> lot<00:04:10.350> of<00:04:10.470> people

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
minutes so that spiked a lot of people

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.560 
minutes so that spiked a lot of people
just<00:04:10.799> be<00:04:10.890> like<00:04:11.010> oh<00:04:11.130> no<00:04:11.549> not<00:04:11.579> gonna<00:04:12.090> play<00:04:12.329> it<00:04:12.480> you

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
just be like oh no not gonna play it you

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.940 
just be like oh no not gonna play it you
know<00:04:12.690> complete<00:04:13.079> waste<00:04:13.170> of<00:04:13.320> my<00:04:13.440> time<00:04:13.650> and

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
know complete waste of my time and

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.099 
know complete waste of my time and
that's<00:04:14.430> simply<00:04:14.579> not<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.910> truth<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.959> nice

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
that's simply not the truth the nice

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.259 
that's simply not the truth the nice
thing<00:04:16.140> is<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.769> this<00:04:17.310> game<00:04:17.549> does<00:04:17.789> offer<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.150> lot

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
thing is that this game does offer a lot

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.909 
thing is that this game does offer a lot
of<00:04:18.390> things<00:04:18.479> I<00:04:18.690> beat<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.930> actual<00:04:19.620> campaign
