 first to our portal 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.580
 and see how our thing is doing 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.320

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.780
 the battle 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.350
 It seems that we have already returned 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.350
 and this son of a bitch 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.020

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.010
 already marta that almost kill him that lasted me 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.370
 an eternity in trying to ride this 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.370
 Sir 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.610
 know how 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.289
 and there everything is I hope to know 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.790
 and here I have something left 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.730
 is that 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.130
 until the end 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.130
 how 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.360
 what is going on inhabit 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.060
 you 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.069
 it seems that there is just 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.069
 It seems 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.840
 I have never seen an ending 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.840
 an end of these 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.420
 as it says 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.920
 it seems that 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:46.680
 and then I think I think that's all 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.980
 I think that's it and we'll see each other 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.980
 battle 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.460
