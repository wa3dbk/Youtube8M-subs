based<00:02:10.759> your<00:02:11.390> phone<00:02:11.570> based<00:02:11.960> on<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.230> red<00:02:12.350> color

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
based your phone based on the red color

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.850 
based your phone based on the red color
you<00:02:12.770> have<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.950> red<00:02:13.160> color<00:02:14.000> ferrule<00:02:14.960> pretty

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
you have a red color ferrule pretty

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.860 
you have a red color ferrule pretty
cheap<00:02:16.240> your<00:02:17.240> phone's<00:02:17.540> world<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:18.680> think<00:02:19.870> other

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
cheap your phone's world I think other

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.780 
cheap your phone's world I think other
manufacturers<00:02:21.860> at<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.040> price<00:02:22.250> point<00:02:22.460> don't

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
manufacturers at this price point don't

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.670 
manufacturers at this price point don't
include<00:02:23.150> red<00:02:23.360> phones<00:02:23.570> especially<00:02:23.810> shiny<00:02:24.290> and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
include red phones especially shiny and

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.200 
include red phones especially shiny and
the<00:02:24.740> like<00:02:24.890> so<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.190> think<00:02:25.250> Samsung<00:02:25.610> is<00:02:25.820> including

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
the like so I think Samsung is including

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.630 
the like so I think Samsung is including
one<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.530> should<00:02:27.710> probably<00:02:27.950> sound<00:02:28.400> decent

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
one so and should probably sound decent

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.880 
one so and should probably sound decent
enough<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.210> think<00:02:29.390> it's<00:02:29.930> for<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.470> price<00:02:30.710> it

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
enough I think it's for the price it

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.030 
enough I think it's for the price it
should<00:02:30.920> be<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.220> think<00:02:31.340> ferry<00:02:32.090> vision<00:02:32.450> and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
should be I think ferry vision and

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.990 
should be I think ferry vision and
yellow<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.220> phone<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.490> said<00:02:34.640> let's<00:02:34.850> actually

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
yellow the phone and said let's actually

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.880 
yellow the phone and said let's actually
open<00:02:35.180> up<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.540> back<00:02:35.750> cover<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.200> pop<00:02:36.680> in<00:02:36.860> the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
open up the back cover and pop in the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.530 
open up the back cover and pop in the
battery<00:02:37.310> as<00:02:37.490> you<00:02:37.610> can<00:02:37.700> see<00:02:37.820> this<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.150> full<00:02:38.360> size

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
battery as you can see this is full size

amps here is a slot for a micro SD card

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.470 
amps here is a slot for a micro SD card
here<00:02:42.770> so<00:02:44.200> 64<00:02:45.200> GB<00:02:45.410> cards<00:02:45.680> are<00:02:45.770> supported<00:02:45.860> and

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
here so 64 GB cards are supported and

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.530 
here so 64 GB cards are supported and
let's<00:02:47.480> put<00:02:48.020> in<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.230> battery<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:49.390> it's<00:02:50.390> a

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
let's put in the battery and it's a

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.930 
let's put in the battery and it's a
three<00:02:50.900> point<00:02:51.380> really<00:02:51.709> go<00:02:52.040> in<00:02:52.190> camera<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.550> three

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
three point really go in camera a three

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.460 
three point really go in camera a three
point<00:02:53.209> one<00:02:53.360> megapixel<00:02:53.600> camera<00:02:54.170> on<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.290> back

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
point one megapixel camera on the back

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.750 
point one megapixel camera on the back
and<00:02:56.170> it's<00:02:57.170> a<00:02:57.260> VGA<00:02:57.620> front-facing<00:02:57.980> camera<00:02:58.550> it's

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
and it's a VGA front-facing camera it's

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.550 
and it's a VGA front-facing camera it's
only<00:02:58.970> if<00:02:59.030> I<00:02:59.120> thought<00:02:59.300> 100<00:02:59.570> but<00:02:59.930> still<00:03:00.140> what<00:03:00.530> I

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
only if I thought 100 but still what I

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.230 
only if I thought 100 but still what I
think<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:00.860> it'd<00:03:01.040> mean<00:03:01.190> oneness<00:03:01.820> is<00:03:02.000> about

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
think that it'd mean oneness is about

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.600 
think that it'd mean oneness is about
five<00:03:02.480> triple<00:03:02.810> nine<00:03:02.990> and<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:04.100> terms<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.430> price

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
five triple nine and in terms of price

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.550 
five triple nine and in terms of price
is<00:03:04.760> taking<00:03:05.090> on<00:03:05.239> that<00:03:05.600> device<00:03:05.959> that's<00:03:06.410> an

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
is taking on that device that's an

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.270 
is taking on that device that's an
Android<00:03:06.920> phone

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.380 

Taizo<00:03:10.280> noise<00:03:10.610> phone<00:03:10.880> I<00:03:11.000> think<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.239> apps

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
Taizo noise phone I think the apps

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.720 
Taizo noise phone I think the apps
support<00:03:11.720> ecosystem<00:03:12.500> is<00:03:12.650> not<00:03:12.830> as<00:03:13.070> great<00:03:13.459> as

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
support ecosystem is not as great as

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.720 
support ecosystem is not as great as
standard<00:03:14.239> on<00:03:14.420> Tyson<00:03:14.600> it's<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.989> fairly<00:03:15.200> new

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
standard on Tyson it's a fairly new

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.580 
standard on Tyson it's a fairly new
platform<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.650> let's<00:03:18.880> let's<00:03:19.880> power<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.150> on<00:03:20.590> you

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
platform and let's let's power it on you

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.520 
platform and let's let's power it on you
can<00:03:21.739> see<00:03:21.920> it's<00:03:22.040> powering<00:03:22.730> on<00:03:22.970> Samsung<00:03:23.750> z1

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
can see it's powering on Samsung z1

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.370 
can see it's powering on Samsung z1
powered<00:03:24.830> by<00:03:25.040> Tyson<00:03:25.640> it<00:03:26.360> just<00:03:26.570> gives<00:03:26.720> Li<00:03:26.989> me<00:03:27.200> go

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
powered by Tyson it just gives Li me go

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.330 
powered by Tyson it just gives Li me go
and<00:03:27.560> previously<00:03:28.130> you<00:03:28.880> know<00:03:29.120> what<00:03:29.420> moblin<00:03:30.190> Nemo

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
and previously you know what moblin Nemo

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.390

so<00:03:31.489> that<00:03:31.670> cos<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.269> evolved<00:03:32.720> from<00:03:33.560> Nokia<00:03:34.070> to

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
so that cos is evolved from Nokia to

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.930 
so that cos is evolved from Nokia to
integral<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.090> Samsung<00:03:35.570> so<00:03:36.410> as<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.560> can<00:03:36.680> see

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
integral to Samsung so as you can see

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.400 
integral to Samsung so as you can see
decent<00:03:37.940> display<00:03:38.870> but<00:03:39.440> not<00:03:39.709> as<00:03:39.890> great<00:03:41.410> probably

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
decent display but not as great probably

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.199 
decent display but not as great probably
decent<00:03:42.890> viewing<00:03:43.070> angles<00:03:45.610> what<00:03:46.610> is<00:03:46.790> nice<00:03:47.180> is

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
decent viewing angles what is nice is

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.440 
decent viewing angles what is nice is
that<00:03:47.600> they've<00:03:47.750> managed<00:03:48.050> to<00:03:48.640> package<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:49.670> pretty

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
that they've managed to package a pretty

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.699 
that they've managed to package a pretty
nice<00:03:50.630> OS<00:03:51.080> into<00:03:51.410> a<00:03:52.690> entry-level<00:03:53.709> smartphone

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
nice OS into a entry-level smartphone

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.930 
nice OS into a entry-level smartphone
form<00:03:55.400> factor<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:57.350> here<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.100> have<00:03:58.250> it<00:03:58.400> so<00:03:58.790> this

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
form factor so here you have it so this

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.080 
form factor so here you have it so this
is<00:03:59.440> the<00:04:00.440> kind<00:04:00.620> of<00:04:00.680> widget<00:04:01.220> screen<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:02.000> have

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
is the kind of widget screen you have

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.330 
is the kind of widget screen you have
some<00:04:02.269> apps<00:04:02.420> pre-loaded<00:04:03.019> here<00:04:03.200> so<00:04:03.799> there's<00:04:03.950> 4gb

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
some apps pre-loaded here so there's 4gb

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.250 
some apps pre-loaded here so there's 4gb
of<00:04:04.430> internal<00:04:04.519> it<00:04:05.060> is<00:04:05.180> fairly<00:04:05.420> low<00:04:05.799> and

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
of internal it is fairly low and

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.200 
of internal it is fairly low and
this<00:04:09.260> is<00:04:09.410> a<00:04:09.440> dialer<00:04:09.920> so<00:04:10.490> it's<00:04:10.610> a<00:04:10.670> fact<00:04:10.880> it's<00:04:11.090> a

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
this is a dialer so it's a fact it's a

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.970 
this is a dialer so it's a fact it's a
new<00:04:11.330> OS<00:04:11.480> it's<00:04:11.810> not<00:04:11.959> on<00:04:12.110> right<00:04:12.140> so<00:04:12.650> that's<00:04:12.830> the

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
new OS it's not on right so that's the

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.650 
new OS it's not on right so that's the
main<00:04:13.160> story<00:04:13.490> here<00:04:13.700> it's<00:04:13.970> something<00:04:14.300> different

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
main story here it's something different

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.479 
main story here it's something different
but<00:04:15.230> still<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:15.620> can<00:04:15.770> see<00:04:15.920> a<00:04:15.950> similarity<00:04:16.280> of

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
but still you can see a similarity of

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.660 
but still you can see a similarity of

I<00:04:42.140> think<00:04:42.470> a<00:04:42.620> first<00:04:42.800> attempt<00:04:43.370> at<00:04:43.490> it<00:04:43.640> so<00:04:44.240> I<00:04:44.900> don't

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
I think a first attempt at it so I don't

Android<00:04:47.480> range<00:04:48.200> with<00:04:48.440> Tizen<00:04:49.220> so<00:04:49.520> that's<00:04:49.700> the

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
Android range with Tizen so that's the

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
Android range with Tizen so that's the
reason<00:04:49.880> I'm<00:04:50.060> seeing<00:04:50.270> only<00:04:50.360> a<00:04:50.480> low<00:04:50.630> end<00:04:50.780> device

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
reason I'm seeing only a low end device

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.490

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
and not I in device so as a data usage

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.550 
and not I in device so as a data usage
indicator<00:04:54.860> as<00:04:55.040> well<00:04:55.990> so<00:04:56.990> something<00:04:57.350> is<00:04:57.410> kind

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560

very limited apps is up now and I think
I'm<00:05:37.850> sure<00:05:38.270> that's<00:05:38.390> going<00:05:38.570> to<00:05:38.660> get<00:05:38.780> better

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
I'm sure that's going to get better

does<00:05:39.620> YouTube<00:05:40.040> as<00:05:40.250> well<00:05:40.280> I<00:05:40.930> think<00:05:41.930> it<00:05:42.169> looks

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
does YouTube as well I think it looks

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.950 
does YouTube as well I think it looks
like<00:05:42.440> an<00:05:42.560> HTML<00:05:42.650> wrapper<00:05:43.100> for<00:05:43.700> the<00:05:44.030> app<00:05:44.150> so<00:05:44.780> it's

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
like an HTML wrapper for the app so it's

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.730 
like an HTML wrapper for the app so it's
a<00:05:45.140> pretty<00:05:45.560> much<00:05:45.710> trying<00:05:46.070> to<00:05:46.870> pitch<00:05:47.870> the<00:05:48.169> kind

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
a pretty much trying to pitch the kind

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.620 
a pretty much trying to pitch the kind
of<00:05:48.800> find<00:05:49.190> a<00:05:49.280> slot<00:05:49.520> between<00:05:49.970> a<00:05:50.000> feature<00:05:50.360> phone

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
of find a slot between a feature phone

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.020 
of find a slot between a feature phone
under<00:05:51.020> smartphone<00:05:51.560> I<00:05:51.830> wouldn't<00:05:52.580> really<00:05:52.729> call

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
under smartphone I wouldn't really call

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.640 
under smartphone I wouldn't really call
this<00:05:53.150> a<00:05:53.270> feature<00:05:53.419> pond<00:05:53.720> but<00:05:53.870> it<00:05:54.050> ain't<00:05:54.380> of

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
this a feature pond but it ain't of

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.880 
this a feature pond but it ain't of
smartphone<00:05:55.220> either<00:05:55.520> so<00:05:56.240> what<00:05:56.510> still<00:05:56.890> think

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
smartphone either so what still think

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.529 
smartphone either so what still think
it'd<00:05:58.370> be<00:05:58.520> interesting<00:05:58.669> to<00:05:58.970> watch<00:05:59.150> how<00:05:59.330> this

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
it'd be interesting to watch how this

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.480 
it'd be interesting to watch how this
one<00:05:59.780> does<00:05:59.810> in<00:06:00.140> the<00:06:00.229> market<00:06:00.590> I<00:06:00.800> think<00:06:01.190> it<00:06:01.280> can<00:06:01.460> be

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
one does in the market I think it can be

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.460 
one does in the market I think it can be
priced<00:06:01.820> even<00:06:02.150> more<00:06:02.330> comfortably<00:06:02.750> at<00:06:03.200> about

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470
