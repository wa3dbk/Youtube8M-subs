00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 will play elder scrolls online in 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.850
 consoles we have wanted it much the same 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.480
 to see a project with 60 images 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.610
 constant away from a pc but today he plays 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.620
 also talk about blood for its patches 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.260
 and the lawsuits against the creators 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.810
 of okur fritz I am eva white and here 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.230
 start your fix of May 26, 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.230
 2015 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.780
 henson and they have met and we already have the 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.360
 update for plot born one that 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.370
 takes the game to version 1.4 and what 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.320
 prepares for the expansion that is 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.390
 on the way but the patch makes many 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.970
 interesting things with its 300 megs 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.309
 to download as it solves the 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.050
 problems with passwords expand the 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.809
 ammo limit in some cases 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.270
 levels the weapons and eliminates several failures 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.449
 let's make this beast even better 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.100
 of the playstation 4 catalog before 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.960
 question of whether it would be possible to see a 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.780
 project at 60 images per second 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.250
 constant in xbox one your 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.290
 developers seem to have it 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.899
 very clear they would have to remove the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.729
 weather effects to start with 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.560
 what would not be the same game to what 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.390
 they add that they have worked for three years 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.729
 the versions for consoles and what 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.259
 we have is the fruit of your effort 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.210
 combined with the contributions of microsoft and 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.149
 but there will be improvements in the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.970
 next months and this includes direct x12 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:25.289
 for example with what we will not only see 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.030
 those 150 cars or more that promise 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:31.250
 it also seems that they will be more fluid 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.650
 here at Christmas and who knows 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.140
 because at the moment there is no news of a 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.050
 project 2 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.790
 we have seen virtual reality glasses 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.650
 decades have passed 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.590
 analog screens and a handful of 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.690
 polygons to the demos of today and 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.060
 everyone is happy even if we think 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.780
 that the thing is going slow everyone happy 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.479
 it not because there is a company of hawai 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.670
 call total recall technologies as 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.590
 the good car movie good this is 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.020
 it makes interesting the case is with the 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.970
 Hawaiians call for damages 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.759
 palmer the key to work with them in 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.660
 2011 and launch the kickstarter of 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.820
 oculus in 2012 makes sense then if 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.730
 they say it and a judge gives them the 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.150
 reason maybe two billion 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.630
 who paid facebook change hands in 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.220
 a few months what to buy a game online 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.709
 and have it at the time they give the 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.930
 exit is the truth truth at least if not 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.390
 there are servers to play before that 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.420
 helps control things and what game 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.010
 It's a little bit of caramel because ten of 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.290
 online for ps 4 xbox 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.239
 in the microsoft console you can already 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.150
 download and leave it waiting for that 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.069
 arrives on June 9 may even 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.540
 I went ahead a bit but for now 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.549
 will have to wait with the game in the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.700
 hard drive and some updates that 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.640
 will arrive in the next few days and now the 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.519
 question will you throw yourself back to so reel 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.970
 or you will become saturated between neverwinter and 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.650
 widget is after all we are not going to 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.989
 take off the jacket that sometimes 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.540
 cool and with this phrase that does not come to 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.670
 tale we reached the end of your daily fix 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.519
 today remember that you can see many 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.079
 more videos in ig in spain 'in our 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.290
 Youtube channel and with apps
