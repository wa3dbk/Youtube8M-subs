00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
here you're going to block the room for

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.670 
here you're going to block the room for
your<00:00:44.800> gate<00:00:44.980> so<00:00:45.820> you<00:00:45.880> want<00:00:46.030> to<00:00:46.120> just<00:00:46.150> be<00:00:46.480> just<00:00:47.320> a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
your gate so you want to just be just a

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.990 
your gate so you want to just be just a
little<00:00:47.710> bit<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.160> overhang<00:00:48.400> right<00:00:49.060> here<00:00:51.000> and

little bit of overhang right here and
then<00:00:52.120> you're<00:00:52.240> going<00:00:52.390> to<00:00:52.530> build<00:00:53.530> your

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
then you're going to build your

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.160 
then you're going to build your
inability<00:00:54.070> gateway<00:00:54.520> here<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.540> then<00:00:56.050> you're

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
inability gateway here and then you're

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.690 
inability gateway here and then you're
going<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:56.320> build<00:00:56.470> your<00:00:56.590> cyberport<00:00:57.130> here<00:00:57.520> and

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
going to build your cyberport here and

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.270 
going to build your cyberport here and
it's<00:00:58.540> going<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:58.720> leave<00:00:58.840> this<00:00:59.020> one<00:00:59.350> space<00:00:59.710> right

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
it's going to leave this one space right

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.240 
it's going to leave this one space right
here<00:01:00.480> where<00:01:01.480> you<00:01:01.540> can<00:01:01.660> put<00:01:01.810> a<00:01:01.870> zealot<00:01:02.320> and<00:01:02.470> if

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
here where you can put a zealot and if

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.690 
here where you can put a zealot and if
you<00:01:03.340> put<00:01:03.580> whole<00:01:03.910> position<00:01:04.089> on<00:01:04.809> that<00:01:04.869> zealot

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
you put whole position on that zealot

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.969 
you put whole position on that zealot
she's<00:01:06.700> going<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:06.970> be<00:01:07.090> tight<00:01:07.630> walled<00:01:07.900> off<00:01:08.079> so
