00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello guys, he looks at the dude 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.280
 on the number is written 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.920
 hurricane hurricane but abbreviated of course 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.059
 because in the state of Pennsylvania 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:20.189
 number probably yes probably seven letters too 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.369
 you can set the maximum I want to do 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.140
 such a short video is one of those 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.300
 video that blow a bunch and and 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.360
 begs for dislikes love doing 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.850
 sometimes a video but quantity 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.820
 Dislike in this video will of course 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.000
 equal to the number of apple fans of his 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.500
 looked so here means a couple of days 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.450
 back was the presentation of the new iphone 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.420
 I'll tell you honestly right now I haven't watched it 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.260
 because so something went at work 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.559
 launched browser yes it says that 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:03.690
 see and can only be like this 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.970
 i can handle you in a safari browser with i 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.659
 and immediately thought it went on as if not 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.939
 Well worth it's mean and I then 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.340
 looked read about it yes it 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.580
 of course fun thorough 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.930
 that is, dear apple fans welcome 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.869

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.810

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:32.340
 iphone and the whole technology world of felco 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.610
 medications which incidentally is in 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.740
 my phone I bought in October 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.880
 2012 but the phone is actually released 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.190
 in June or May well, in short, somewhere 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.190
 the summer of 2012 already it was all 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.510

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.220
 now now such a new thing which 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.770
 which all of course now believe that 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.730
 it was necessary before, it was not necessary because 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.770
 what ash 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.960

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.500
 through there somehow apple pay or somehow 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.720
 so this is called shorter like 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.120

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.680
 great 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:42.300

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:06.360
 cheers comrades but very much such 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:08.170
 such here are a brief impression of it 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.380
 event 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.569
 but now waiting, I already know even among 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.250
 my acquaintances are already people who 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:22.330
 ordered from pre-order and made on the 19th 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.250
 they must deliver by mail I am so 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.260
 I understand, yes , the exact mail should 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.319
 deliver 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.890
 phone 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:33.049
 well, most likely as always possible 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.930
 Someone is standing in line in Manhattan 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.799
 in new york because i remember in my 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.079
 a year ago or 2 years ago some 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.760
 very healthy head people stood there 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.840
 in my nearly two weeks 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.560
 in order to be the first 8 am 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.629
 get this well, very well, right 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.169
 hi-tech thing in general iphone 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:04:00.650
 in 2007 it was certainly a bomb it 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:02.629
 was the first smartphone but let's guys 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.819
 let's face it all 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:10.849
 released after the first iphone is all 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:13.969
 marketing hat nothing grand 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:18.169
 new nothing radically new after 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:21.349
 no one made an apple 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.750
 not someone else and there other from koreans 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:28.849
 or Chinese or something else that is 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:32.570
 seven years ago and a breakthrough 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:36.139
 there is no more technology here 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.880
