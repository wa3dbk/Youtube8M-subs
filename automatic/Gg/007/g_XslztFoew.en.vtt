00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.230
 jorge mario time on November 30th 2012 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.760
 will be remembered in the annals of 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.840
 video games thanks to the launch of the wii u 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.880
 in the old continent 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.189
 a launch finally accompanied by a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.779
 new title supermario adventure 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.550
 we are talking about is that new super 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.650
 mario bros who proposes himself as a candidate 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.210
 to best 2d platformer in history 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.099
 thanks to a wise dosage of 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.520
 traditional elements and find children 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.520
 and nowadays 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.120
 the story mode my super mario 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.010
 bros takes the prerequisite money washes 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.539
 in fact the narrative pretexts conceived 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.680
 to allow mario to travel in 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.090
 long and wide throughout the game world 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.310
 they never played a role 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.540
 fundamental and also this time yes 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.670
 it's simple excuses for 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.170
 justify successive levels of the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.790
 difficulty curve is all in all 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.799
 in line with that appreciated in 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.689
 chapter for nintendo wii with a first 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.189
 accessible but not free area is a 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.960
 next growing up in a vortex of 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.450
 increasingly daring game design choices 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.380
 usual stimulants each scheme to more 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.909
 reading levels 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.409
 in the sense that it lends itself to different 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.540
 approaches depending on the type of 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.400
 player involved a user at first 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.020
 weapons will simply be satisfied 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.000
 reaching the final flag within 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.650
 the time limit an average player will want 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.420
 recover all three coin stars 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.159
 while the most skilled will not find peace 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.020
 until they have felt the pace 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.970
 step every centimeter passable 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.860
 discovering every secret and capturing 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.450
 as many coins as possible if in 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.310
 first few levels these three different 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.079
 approaches are not radically separated 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.610
 the further one proceeds the more the roads divide 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.950
 calling into question the life of the player 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.630
 in levels over half of the game at 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.040
 capture any star coin 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.140
 it can be able to challenge 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.689
 the expert while some secret passages 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.250
 they are cleverly hidden where, however, the 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.899
 so-called hard core gamer will find bread 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.390
 for his teeth and in challenge mode 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.100
 true paradise of the completist 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.720
 able to tease even better among 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.280
 the impersonated of mario 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.690
 it is a copious collection of 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.520
 levels in which to reach 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.260
 precise goals within a time limit 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.970
 we start from the race towards the dancer 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.350
 final to get to the hunt at 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.459
 coins pass through the jumps of 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.350
 precision among the enemies 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.730
 each of these activities seems to be 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.070
 consecration of what was already done 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.540
 for pure personal pleasure thanks to 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.280
 a level design simply without 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.050
 equals able to create a perfect one 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.520
 pace of play for those who know how to cheat the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.900
 first dance step 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.370
 our feats then come 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.650
 automatically registered via 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.239
 special replay super over worthing 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.040
 mario bros is a single body without 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.420
 continuity solution that sees the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.820
 player cross the various zones 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.080
 harmonious way as it happens now for 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.760
 tradition also in this last one 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.110
 chapter it is possible to meet gods 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.000
 limit two other movement from one level 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.560
 to the other so as to be transported 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.630
 clashes from which to obtain 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.590
 items to keep food for 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.870
 difficult moments 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.310
 also the huts defined as the come back 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.470
 in which to participate in simple 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.060
 games to get the power ups and do 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.160
 their appearance among different types of 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.239
 baby yoshi to take advantage of for their own 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.830
 capacity 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.480
 there are plenty of adults to ride 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.549
 within the levels and to which to do 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.260
 eat these enemies and fruits 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.850
 last allow the completion of a 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.440
 indicator of receiving a gift 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.850
 useful object among which can only 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.350
 make her look good and new 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.239
 upgrade introduced for this 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.470
 chapter by eating an acorn you can 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.600
 in fact wear one's costumes 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.739
 flying squirrel able to glide the 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.420
 managing these power ups is 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.739
 significantly different from the descent 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.209
 controlled mushroom and vika 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.410
 avoiding the danger of one 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.000
 capacity overlap e 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.860
 confirming that the gameplay of the series 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.390
 though incredibly solid 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.730
 willingly accept the news that 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.290
 are inserted then we arrive that one 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.910
 which paradoxically is perhaps the 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.070
 less successful feature of the whole 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.170
 production nintendo the integration of 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.880
 wiki gamepad capabilities like now 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.470
 we all know in multiplayer games 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.060
 a player can hold the tablet 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.160
 nintendo controller to create 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.360
 platforms in the local gaming world 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
 enemies some elements of the 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.260
 settings and particular activation 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.459
 switches here the reporter must 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.660
 make an effort and evaluate the 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.620
 interactions with the new device 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.720
 of the great n 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.220
 from two different points of view the first 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.120
 of which will be that of the player 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.709
 capable expert 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.630
 in this regard it seems difficult 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.120
 imagine refined connoisseur of 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.680
 game 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.630
 of the series rely on the care of a 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.769
 second player as well who would finish 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.690
 to break the rhythm so much 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.940
 carefully orchestrated by nintendo 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.080
 on the other hand if we talk about many verne 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.250
 to the series we have in mind 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.290
 an experience that is anything but 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.340
 perfectionist at the tip of a fork 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.540
 it is instead a merry 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.830
 bunch of characters that 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.080
 trot along the screen 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.970
 shoving him in exalting 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.680
 a view of this kind in effect the 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.970
 seized widzew seemed to us capable of 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.530
 add that extra something to the 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.479
 pleasant climate for a trip with friends 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.130
 that is created by presenting a 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.720
 fifth capable player with only one 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.430
 imposing the nib type 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.139
 companions on the brink of the abyss o 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.419
 condemn them to the most ruinous of the 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.039
 the third hypothesis falls perhaps that one 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.539
 less realistic to see it player 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.160
 chasing the perfect synchrony in the 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.840
 thought thus creating a path 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.060
 alternative to that thought by 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.410
 developers but it seems difficult to that 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.970
 putting leave specially 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.590
 unexplored a better route than 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.050
 the one proposed for the sole taste of 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.699
 see it designed by users where he is 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.800
 gamepad convinces and instead on the front 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.539
 of convenience the peripheral of the 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.430
 big n doesn't regret the controllers 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.770
 traditional even after several hours of 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.270
 intense use 2 due to its lightness 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.010
 either because it happened to us more than once 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.570
 rediscover ourselves intent on staring at the screen 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.070
 the place of that of the television 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.840
 thus noting the last cleaning 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.410
 title technique you hear holes in the touch 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.120
 screen 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.620
 after all if it's been six years now 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.210
 all the specialized press asks 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.610
 great voice a nintendo game in hd there 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.870
 it will be a reason and the reason is that also 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.580
 without display of power or 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.200
 special technical flashes new super 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.910
 mario bros cubed of the usual 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.539
 very good artistic direction 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.539
 of the series 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.880
 new super mario bros is great 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.650
 platformer perhaps the best exponent 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.330
 of the port series of a level design 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.550
 particularly inspired and an offer 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.590
 variegated and tantalizing playful for each 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.390
 type of player the various challenges 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.070
 above all they seem capable of 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.750
 capture enthusiasts like 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.850
 supermario grossi is undoubtedly the 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.230
 killer application for wiew whether you are 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.970
 talk to the alcohol gamer that a player 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.710
 last hour even if it is not certain 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.460
 best title to show skills 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.460
 of the gamepad
