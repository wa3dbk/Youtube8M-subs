00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
speaker system the srt8 really should

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.160 
speaker system the srt8 really should
have<00:01:14.140> this<00:01:14.409> because<00:01:15.479> much<00:01:16.479> more<00:01:16.689> powerful

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
have this because much more powerful

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.679 
have this because much more powerful
sound<00:01:17.350> down<00:01:17.650> than<00:01:17.830> one<00:01:17.950> of<00:01:18.070> those<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:19.540> I

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
sound down than one of those but I

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.920 
sound down than one of those but I
really<00:01:20.500> like<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.860> way<00:01:20.979> they<00:01:21.159> redid<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.700> new

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
really like the way they redid the new

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.840 
really like the way they redid the new
system<00:01:22.930> but<00:01:23.110> I<00:01:23.200> prefer<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:24.010> kicker<00:01:24.250> speakers

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850

to<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.509> beats<00:01:26.439> by<00:01:26.650> dre<00:01:26.710> speakers<00:01:27.430> however

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
to the beats by dre speakers however

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.060 
to the beats by dre speakers however
with<00:01:28.540> 19<00:01:28.960> speakers<00:01:29.409> in<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.650> car<00:01:29.860> it's

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
with 19 speakers in the car it's

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.970 
with 19 speakers in the car it's
actually<00:01:30.430> pretty<00:01:30.700> well<00:01:31.020> evened<00:01:32.020> out<00:01:32.140> so<00:01:32.860> that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
actually pretty well evened out so that

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.100 
actually pretty well evened out so that
the<00:01:33.070> sounds<00:01:33.430> actually<00:01:33.610> pretty<00:01:33.820> strong<00:01:34.360> but

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
the sounds actually pretty strong but

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.600 
the sounds actually pretty strong but
it's<00:01:35.260> not<00:01:35.380> as<00:01:35.530> strong<00:01:35.590> as<00:01:35.770> I<00:01:35.950> expected<00:01:36.430> it<00:01:36.550> to

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
it's not as strong as I expected it to

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.080 
it's not as strong as I expected it to
be

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
be

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.260

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
the Audi a8 like I did know that if you

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.979 
the Audi a8 like I did know that if you
nudge<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.880> shift<00:02:17.120> or<00:02:17.300> whatever<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:17.840> can

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
nudge the shift or whatever you can

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.630 
nudge the shift or whatever you can
actually<00:02:18.470> take<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.709> out<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.250> mode<00:02:19.459> that

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
actually take it out of the mode that

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.530 
actually take it out of the mode that
you<00:02:19.760> want<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.120> be<00:02:20.330> in<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:21.940> also<00:02:22.940> if<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.360> put

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
you want it to be in and also if you put

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.320 
you want it to be in and also if you put
too<00:02:23.720> much<00:02:23.840> pressure<00:02:24.110> on<00:02:24.319> it<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:25.220> can<00:02:26.060> actually

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
too much pressure on it it can actually

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.309 
too much pressure on it it can actually
like<00:02:26.959> pop<00:02:27.230> right<00:02:27.530> off<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:29.660> realized<00:02:30.170> that

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
like pop right off and I realized that

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.850 
like pop right off and I realized that

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.430 
when I was driving an Audi a8 and I got
into<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.250> car<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:34.730> my<00:02:35.060> leg<00:02:35.360> brushed<00:02:35.900> by<00:02:36.380> this

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
into the car and my leg brushed by this

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.640 
into the car and my leg brushed by this
thing<00:02:36.980> when<00:02:37.190> I<00:02:37.220> got<00:02:37.519> in<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:38.630> popped<00:02:38.930> right

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
thing when I got in and it popped right

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.979 
thing when I got in and it popped right
off<00:02:39.680> because<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.340> my<00:02:40.430> leg<00:02:40.640> so<00:02:41.299> I<00:02:41.600> don't<00:02:41.780> think

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
off because of my leg so I don't think

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.120 
off because of my leg so I don't think
this<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.200> gonna<00:02:42.319> be<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.500> problem<00:02:42.709> because<00:02:43.010> it

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
this is gonna be a problem because it

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.860 
this is gonna be a problem because it
looks<00:02:43.340> like<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.670> pins<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.180> are<00:02:44.390> in<00:02:44.569> here<00:02:44.810> are

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
looks like the pins that are in here are

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.990 
looks like the pins that are in here are
a<00:02:45.019> little<00:02:45.230> bit<00:02:45.350> thicker<00:02:45.739> than<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.549> ones<00:02:46.819> that

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
a little bit thicker than the ones that

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.470 
a little bit thicker than the ones that
were<00:02:47.090> in<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.299> a8<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:47.870> had<00:02:48.140> but<00:02:48.769> um<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.480> don't

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
were in the a8 that I had but um I don't

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.750 
were in the a8 that I had but um I don't
know<00:02:50.620> maybe<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.769> problem<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.220> may<00:02:52.340> not<00:02:52.519> be

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
know maybe a problem it may not be

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.310 
know maybe a problem it may not be
hopefully<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.269> won't<00:02:53.359> be<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.600> problem<00:02:53.840> or<00:02:54.140> if

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
hopefully it won't be a problem or if

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.239 
hopefully it won't be a problem or if
they<00:02:54.470> add<00:02:54.709> better<00:02:55.280> pins<00:02:55.609> it'll<00:02:55.910> be<00:02:56.030> fun
