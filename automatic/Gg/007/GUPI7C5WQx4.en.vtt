this<00:00:58.980> thermo<00:00:59.430> but<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.879> very<00:01:00.180> unlikely

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
this thermo but it is very unlikely

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.080 
this thermo but it is very unlikely
because<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> triac<00:01:01.800> think<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.820> course

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
because that is a triac think of course

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
fun but it kind of had its limits and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.649 
fun but it kind of had its limits and
boundaries<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.090> got<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> little<00:01:12.479> bit

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659

boundaries and it got a little bit
boring<00:01:13.229> quicker<00:01:13.560> than<00:01:13.799> zombies<00:01:14.040> does<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.729> it

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180

guys<00:01:27.150> thought<00:01:27.479> about<00:01:27.659> possibility<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.829> doing

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
guys thought about possibility of doing

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.969 
guys thought about possibility of doing
kind<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> co-op<00:01:30.479> campaign<00:01:31.200> because<00:01:31.740> we

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
kind of like a co-op campaign because we

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.920 
kind of like a co-op campaign because we
had<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.340> cod<00:01:32.610> five<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.090> world<00:01:33.329> at<00:01:33.479> war<00:01:33.659> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
had it in cod five in world at war and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.289 
had it in cod five in world at war and
where<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.740> could<00:01:34.920> play<00:01:35.100> over<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.880> internet

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
where you could play over the internet

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.749 
where you could play over the internet
with<00:01:36.509> your<00:01:36.689> friends<00:01:37.110> playing<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.189> core<00:01:38.430> duty

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
with your friends playing the core duty

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.179 
with your friends playing the core duty
cod5<00:01:39.390> campaign<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.590> thought<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.040> was

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
cod5 campaign and I thought that was

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.010 
cod5 campaign and I thought that was
pretty<00:01:41.340> fun<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.970> kind<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.270> makes<00:01:42.420> sense<00:01:42.720> to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
pretty fun and it kind of makes sense to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.870 
pretty fun and it kind of makes sense to
bring<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.350> back<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.979> call<00:01:44.369> duty<00:01:44.579> ghosts

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
bring it back in call duty ghosts

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.609 
bring it back in call duty ghosts
because<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.240> think<00:01:45.299> people<00:01:45.659> kind<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.439> lose

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
because I think people kind of lose

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.859 
because I think people kind of lose
interest<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.549> campaign<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.750> know

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
interest in the campaign and you know

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.380 
interest in the campaign and you know
call<00:01:49.110> duty<00:01:49.320> put<00:01:50.070> most<00:01:50.310> people<00:01:50.640> would<00:01:50.759> buy<00:01:50.909> for

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
call duty put most people would buy for

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.600 
call duty put most people would buy for
the<00:01:51.509> multiplier<00:01:51.930> experience<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.799> then<00:01:53.460> it

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the multiplier experience and then it

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.819 
the multiplier experience and then it
might<00:01:53.759> kind<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.180> induce<00:01:54.720> entice<00:01:55.290> some<00:01:55.649> more

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
might kind of induce entice some more

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.709 
might kind of induce entice some more
people<00:01:56.189> into<00:01:56.579> play<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.060> campaign<00:01:57.420> that

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
people into play in the campaign that

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.209 
people into play in the campaign that
you<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:58.140> wouldn't<00:01:58.469> normally<00:01:58.590> play<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
you know wouldn't normally play it and

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.190 
you know wouldn't normally play it and
being<00:02:00.210> able<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.570> play<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.810> with<00:02:00.960> your<00:02:01.079> friends

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
being able to play it with your friends

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.990 
being able to play it with your friends
is<00:02:01.530> something<00:02:01.950> pretty<00:02:02.189> cool<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.670> think

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
is something pretty cool that I think

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.539 
is something pretty cool that I think
and<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:04.140> would<00:02:04.290> link<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.860> guess<00:02:05.130> kind<00:02:05.430> of

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
and it would link in I guess kind of

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.819 
and it would link in I guess kind of
with<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.909> spec<00:02:06.600> ops<00:02:06.840> from<00:02:07.020> modern<00:02:07.290> warfare<00:02:07.439> 2

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
with the spec ops from modern warfare 2

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.559 
with the spec ops from modern warfare 2
where<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.429> can<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:08.910> two<00:02:09.090> people<00:02:09.420> one

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
where you can have like two people one

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.140 
where you can have like two people one
person<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.379> an<00:02:10.530> ac-130<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.550> can't<00:02:12.030> really

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
person in like an ac-130 I can't really

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.600 
person in like an ac-130 I can't really
well<00:02:12.330> out<00:02:12.480> what<00:02:12.810> that

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
well out what that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.550 
well out what that
got<00:02:13.790> some<00:02:13.940> missions<00:02:14.180> called<00:02:14.510> but<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.230> really

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
got some missions called but I really

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.650 
got some missions called but I really
like<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:15.830> one<00:02:15.890> wears<00:02:16.340> one<00:02:16.730> guy<00:02:16.850> in<00:02:16.970> an<00:02:17.060> AC<00:02:17.210> 13

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
like that one wears one guy in an AC 13

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.930 
like that one wears one guy in an AC 13
another<00:02:18.650> one<00:02:18.770> on<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:19.070> floor<00:02:19.310> taking<00:02:19.550> out<00:02:19.760> the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
the enemies on the floor and you have to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.710 
the enemies on the floor and you have to
work<00:02:21.680> together<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.310> take<00:02:23.090> out<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.270> guys<00:02:23.510> from

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
work together and take out the guys from

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.870 
work together and take out the guys from
the<00:02:23.840> sky<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.110> things<00:02:24.770> like<00:02:24.920> that<00:02:24.980> working

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
the sky and things like that working

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.520 
the sky and things like that working
together<00:02:26.030> through<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:26.630> campaign<00:02:27.050> level<00:02:27.410> I

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
together through this campaign level I

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.320 
together through this campaign level I
think<00:02:27.560> that's<00:02:27.950> pretty<00:02:28.190> cool<00:02:28.460> and<00:02:28.730> if<00:02:29.210> you

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
think that's pretty cool and if you

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.030 
think that's pretty cool and if you
could<00:02:29.510> do<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:29.960> in<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.560> actual

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
could do that in the in the actual

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.700 
could do that in the in the actual
campaign<00:02:31.250> I'll<00:02:31.820> definitely<00:02:32.360> do<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:32.840> is<00:02:33.260> I

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
campaign I'll definitely do that is I

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.130 
campaign I'll definitely do that is I
think<00:02:33.860> it's<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.340> definitely<00:02:34.580> a<00:02:35.150> cool<00:02:35.690> thing<00:02:35.960> for

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
think it's a definitely a cool thing for

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.750 
think it's a definitely a cool thing for
them<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.380> put<00:02:36.560> in<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.890> something<00:02:37.430> that<00:02:37.460> I

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
them to put in and something that I

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.490 
them to put in and something that I
personally<00:02:37.790> would<00:02:38.480> like<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.720> have<00:02:39.110> in<00:02:39.320> there

all know what that survival and the
zombies<00:02:48.980> mode<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.580> now<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.209> thing<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.480> whether

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
zombies mode is now the thing is whether

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.780 
zombies mode is now the thing is whether
they're<00:02:51.440> going<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.830> stick<00:02:52.100> with<00:02:52.340> something

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
they're going to stick with something

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.220 
they're going to stick with something
like<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.300> I<00:02:53.480> don't<00:02:53.690> think<00:02:53.780> it's<00:02:53.989> going<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.170> be

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
like that I don't think it's going to be

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.660 
like that I don't think it's going to be
zombies<00:02:54.650> personally<00:02:55.190> because<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.430> think

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
zombies personally because I think

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.060 
zombies personally because I think
that's<00:02:55.820> Trey<00:02:56.120> och<00:02:56.270> I<00:02:56.530> think<00:02:57.530> they<00:02:57.770> might

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
that's Trey och I think they might

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.610 
that's Trey och I think they might
actually<00:02:58.340> go<00:02:58.700> further<00:02:59.320> survival<00:03:00.320> mode<00:03:00.470> again

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
actually go further survival mode again

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.130 
actually go further survival mode again
because<00:03:01.070> I<00:03:01.220> think<00:03:01.850> they<00:03:02.090> know<00:03:02.270> what<00:03:02.630> kind<00:03:03.050> of

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
because I think they know what kind of

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.660 
because I think they know what kind of
cells<00:03:03.410> this<00:03:03.620> they've<00:03:03.860> seen<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.190> zombies<00:03:04.489> mode

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
cells this they've seen the zombies mode

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.699 
cells this they've seen the zombies mode
its<00:03:04.910> massive<00:03:05.330> it's<00:03:05.480> probably<00:03:05.810> it's<00:03:06.320> not<00:03:06.500> quite

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
its massive it's probably it's not quite

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.440 
its massive it's probably it's not quite
as<00:03:06.860> big<00:03:07.040> as<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.220> multiplayer<00:03:07.700> in<00:03:07.940> black<00:03:08.150> ops<00:03:08.330> 2

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
as big as the multiplayer in black ops 2

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.660 
as big as the multiplayer in black ops 2
but<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:08.840> is<00:03:09.020> a<00:03:09.230> massive<00:03:09.860> massive<00:03:09.890> part<00:03:10.459> of<00:03:10.550> the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
but it is a massive massive part of the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.300 
but it is a massive massive part of the
game<00:03:11.050> they<00:03:12.050> know<00:03:12.200> what<00:03:12.380> they're<00:03:12.560> doing<00:03:12.590> but<00:03:13.100> I

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
game they know what they're doing but I

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.530 
game they know what they're doing but I
don't<00:03:13.670> know<00:03:13.790> whether<00:03:13.970> they're<00:03:14.239> going<00:03:14.390> to

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
don't know whether they're going to

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.449 
don't know whether they're going to
improve<00:03:14.959> it<00:03:15.140> on<00:03:15.290> modern<00:03:15.500> warfare<00:03:15.770> 3<00:03:15.950> or

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
improve it on modern warfare 3 or

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.280 
improve it on modern warfare 3 or
actually<00:03:17.209> just<00:03:17.420> model<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.019> same<00:03:18.260> as

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
actually just model it the same as

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.170 
actually just model it the same as
modern<00:03:18.709> warfare<00:03:18.860> 3<00:03:19.040> maybe<00:03:19.760> with<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.030> few

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
modern warfare 3 maybe with a few

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.000 
modern warfare 3 maybe with a few
different<00:03:20.780> tweaks<00:03:21.080> I'll<00:03:21.290> personally<00:03:21.680> like

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
different tweaks I'll personally like

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.670 
different tweaks I'll personally like
them<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.340> kind<00:03:22.489> of<00:03:22.610> remodel<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.530> survival<00:03:24.530> mode

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
them to kind of remodel a survival mode

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.860 
them to kind of remodel a survival mode
of<00:03:24.950> some<00:03:25.220> sort<00:03:25.549> anyway<00:03:26.150> that's<00:03:26.299> enough<00:03:26.630> of<00:03:26.750> me

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
of some sort anyway that's enough of me

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.630 
of some sort anyway that's enough of me
telling<00:03:27.110> you<00:03:27.260> my<00:03:27.440> dears<00:03:27.799> I<00:03:28.010> want<00:03:28.190> to<00:03:28.280> hear<00:03:28.430> some

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
of your ideas on what this third mode

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.080 
of your ideas on what this third mode
could<00:03:30.709> be<00:03:30.860> what<00:03:31.040> your<00:03:31.190> ideas<00:03:31.580> are<00:03:31.790> what<00:03:31.970> you

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
think it's possible for them to do put

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.130 
think it's possible for them to do put
them<00:03:34.280> in<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.459> comments<00:03:34.820> section<00:03:34.850> below<00:03:35.269> also
