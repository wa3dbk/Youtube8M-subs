your lightning which is probably the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.740 
your lightning which is probably the
best<00:01:01.649> right<00:01:02.070> now<00:01:02.280> or<00:01:02.579> not<00:01:03.149> right<00:01:03.300> now<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:03.719> just

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
best right now or not right now but just

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.510 
best right now or not right now but just
in<00:01:04.170> general<00:01:04.309> for<00:01:05.309> Iron<00:01:05.489> Man<00:01:06.080> ah<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.740> well

in general for Iron Man ah because well

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.000 
in general for Iron Man ah because well
his<00:01:08.729> lasers<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.439> most<00:01:10.619> like<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
his lasers it's the most like the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.420 
his lasers it's the most like the
lightning<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.820> sky<00:01:12.409> so<00:01:13.409> not<00:01:13.710> even<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.010> dragon

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
lightning in sky so not even a dragon

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.120 
lightning in sky so not even a dragon
can<00:01:14.580> take<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.000> with<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.740> um<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.070> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
can take you on with that um so you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.039 
can take you on with that um so you
shouldn't<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.210> use<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.390> fire<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:18.930> you

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
shouldn't have to use a fire but if you

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.890 
shouldn't have to use a fire but if you
want<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.590> mean<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.729> one<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.090> them<00:01:21.210> well<00:01:21.780> it

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
want to I mean it's one of them well it

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.980 
want to I mean it's one of them well it
it<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.650> better<00:01:22.890> than<00:01:23.070> lightning<00:01:23.570> just<00:01:24.570> because

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
it is better than lightning just because

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.649 
it is better than lightning just because
it<00:01:25.320> has<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> burn<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:27.119> you're<00:01:27.390> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.600> get

it has a burn but if you're going to get

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.390 
it has a burn but if you're going to get
stages<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.350> course<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.549> lightning<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.000> better

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
stages of course the lightning is better

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:39.590 
stages of course the lightning is better

you want to go fast

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.110 
you want to go fast
um<00:03:10.680> but<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:12.299> don't<00:03:12.600> need<00:03:13.519> which<00:03:14.519> one<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.820> it

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
um but you don't need which one is it

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.340

one<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.570> them<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.810> think<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:16.049> makes<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.290> go

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
one of them I think it makes it go

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.050 
one of them I think it makes it go
faster<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.950> probably<00:03:17.400> don't<00:03:17.579> need<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:17.730> cuz

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
faster you probably don't need that cuz

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.210 
faster you probably don't need that cuz
you<00:03:18.120> can<00:03:18.209> have<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.420> steed<00:03:18.690> song<00:03:18.959> about<00:03:19.950> you
