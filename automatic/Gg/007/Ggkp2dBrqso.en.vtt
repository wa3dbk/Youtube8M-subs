00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.540
 good the first year of crowdfunding has 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.800
 served to really establish those 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.510
 estate 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.619
 this second year has to serve for 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.950
 empower to water those plants and 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.950
 grow 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.800
 There's going to be a jump, I think a lot more 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.230
 great that in this last year a 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.060
 project that has created from nothing with the 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.620
 support from people that that's the most 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.110
 difficult of all professionalism 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.510
 Work skill is the only remedy 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.040
 What it has is that something goes well and 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.080
 do it often but the goal is that 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.610
 be a reference project but not 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.580
 let's go from being one of them to a 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.650
 Affiliate titled Bieber remains a lot 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.530
 see from the summit island faith and this is going 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.510
 it was very good to me I like to question 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.989
 of what had to happen and is 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.989
 happening 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.710
 within a year, the only thing that can 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.699
 change is that you have more listeners because 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.110
 the radio that is doing 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.110
 is radio is united 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.929
 a multi-channel radio so that any 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.939
 person from any field in any 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.359
 fan of musical taste can enter 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.359
 the island 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.490
 thrill the djs to the producers already 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.890
 the announcers who want to do radio 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.890
 that as a starting point they support 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.780
 ideas ideas that we are talking about today 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.780
 try to put them into practice tomorrow 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.830
 all this supported by the web supported by 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.150
 the mobile apps to try 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.439
 interact with putting listeners and 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.110
 collaborators 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:53.680
 it's about changing a bit the way 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.680
 do things 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.420
 the first thing is to get on my own 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.579
 portable radio so you can always travel 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.360
 with the parallel ong doing four 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.220
 different programs in berlin 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.720
 and also doing a program for 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.720
 strangers who are living in london 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.270
 ah 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.390
 there are very few things and very few 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.630
 projects right now that have soul is 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.390
 different from quality the vega a 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.590
 godparent expansion growth that 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.770
 we feel we have to be here 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.140
 winning I like yesterday the future that goes 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.250
 to be something very big and the others go 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.190
 connecting are connecting your mind is 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.100
 trying on account but the radio that 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.850
 are you doing 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.400
 is the future 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:56.400
 but philosophy purposes is good vibes 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:56.400
 and community to this day we do not know that 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.220
 anyone who wants to participate in this 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.650
 project that is participating in your 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.070
 project has to think about the island and 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.070
 in the listeners 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.000
 it's my destiny to go where I'm going 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.360
 there's a person 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.360
 let me take you to her and I'll show you 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.610
 in the test a person the same as 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.610
 will teach us how to return to the island tango
