00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.580 
just bring it slightly over so there's a
little<00:01:51.390> bit<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.570> space<00:01:51.750> between<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.170> two<00:01:52.350> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
little bit of space between the two and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.429 
little bit of space between the two and
let<00:01:52.950> go<00:01:53.130> now<00:01:53.880> without<00:01:54.299> deselecting<00:01:55.290> this

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
let go now without deselecting this

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.340 
let go now without deselecting this
don't<00:01:55.710> deselect<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.490> or<00:01:56.640> anything<00:01:56.790> yet<00:01:57.350> go

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.730 
ahead and do ctrl D and okay and on Mac
this<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.780> where<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.049> use<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.350> controller

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
this is where you use the controller

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.850 
this is where you use the controller
command<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.939> Mac<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> command<00:02:06.960> D<00:02:07.170> okay

command on Mac do the command D okay
what<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.819> shortcut<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.599> object

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
what that is it's a shortcut to object

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.130 
what that is it's a shortcut to object
transform<00:02:10.830> transform<00:02:11.700> again<00:02:12.000> whatever<00:02:12.780> we

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
transform transform again whatever we

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.890 
transform transform again whatever we
just<00:02:13.170> did

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
just did

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.190 
just did
it<00:02:13.989> applies<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.650> same<00:02:15.069> thing<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.879> new

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
it applies the same thing to the new

it applies the same thing to the new
selected<00:02:17.200> object<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:18.519> I'll<00:02:18.610> hit<00:02:18.730> control<00:02:19.090> D<00:02:19.120> a

selected object so I'll hit control D a
couple<00:02:19.599> times<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:21.640> creates<00:02:21.939> this<00:02:22.180> pattern

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
couple times and it creates this pattern

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.630 
couple times and it creates this pattern
here<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:22.989> with<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.010> selection<00:02:24.280> tool<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.579> can

move it around and what you want to do

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.520 
move it around and what you want to do
we<00:02:28.450> need<00:02:28.629> this<00:02:29.170> pattern<00:02:29.590> now<00:02:30.159> to<00:02:30.220> move

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
we need this pattern now to move

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.839 
we need this pattern now to move

and click and drag hold shift it'll

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.000 
and click and drag hold shift it'll
maintain<00:02:42.189> that<00:02:42.930> proportion<00:02:43.930> or<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.379> angle

maintain that proportion or that angle

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.220 
maintain that proportion or that angle
and<00:02:45.159> then<00:02:45.819> let<00:02:46.000> go<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.329> then<00:02:46.450> do<00:02:46.659> control<00:02:47.079> D

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
and then let go and then do control D

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.750 
and then let go and then do control D
again<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:48.030> that's<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.120> pretty<00:02:49.329> basic<00:02:49.510> pattern

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
again and that's a pretty basic pattern

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.990 
again and that's a pretty basic pattern
that<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:52.090> can<00:02:52.359> create<00:02:52.690> you<00:02:52.870> can<00:02:53.790> go<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.849> the

that you can create you can go to the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.530 
that you can create you can go to the
color<00:02:55.180> guide<00:02:55.389> even<00:02:56.069> and<00:02:57.239> let's<00:02:58.239> say<00:02:58.359> you<00:02:58.450> want

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
color guide even and let's say you want

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.559 
color guide even and let's say you want
to<00:02:58.629> do<00:02:58.720> analogous<00:02:59.139> colors<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.829> you<00:03:00.760> can<00:03:00.939> click

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
to do analogous colors and you can click

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.020 
to do analogous colors and you can click
this<00:03:01.769> you<00:03:02.769> know<00:03:02.859> and<00:03:02.980> change<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.430> color<00:03:03.670> of

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
this you know and change the color of

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.129 
this you know and change the color of
the<00:03:04.150> different<00:03:04.389> ones<00:03:04.450> you<00:03:04.659> can<00:03:05.139> make<00:03:05.700> various

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
the different ones you can make various

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:13.140 
the different ones you can make various
patterns<00:03:08.139> and<00:03:08.859> shapes<00:03:09.459> in<00:03:09.609> here<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:12.670> just

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
patterns and shapes in here and just

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.039 
patterns and shapes in here and just
kind<00:03:13.209> of<00:03:13.389> experiment<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.019> try<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.930> know

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
kind of experiment and try you know

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.640 
kind of experiment and try you know
adding<00:03:17.349> different<00:03:17.470> colors<00:03:18.840> around<00:03:19.840> you<00:03:20.470> can

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
adding different colors around you can

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.089 
adding different colors around you can
also<00:03:21.810> delete<00:03:22.810> some<00:03:23.169> of<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.349> edges<00:03:23.769> for

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
also delete some of the edges for

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.430 
also delete some of the edges for
specific<00:03:24.609> shapes<00:03:24.849> as<00:03:25.060> well<00:03:25.269> so<00:03:26.230> if<00:03:26.290> you're

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
specific shapes as well so if you're

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.460 
specific shapes as well so if you're
looking<00:03:26.530> for<00:03:26.709> some<00:03:27.010> kind<00:03:27.190> of<00:03:27.629> unique<00:03:28.629> shape

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.559 

let's<00:03:32.470> say<00:03:32.650> almost<00:03:32.919> like<00:03:33.099> a<00:03:33.129> continent<00:03:33.699> or

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
let's say almost like a continent or

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.740 
let's say almost like a continent or
some<00:03:35.409> kind<00:03:35.650> of<00:03:35.709> shape<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.280> a<00:03:37.030> landmass<00:03:37.449> you

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
some kind of shape of a landmass you

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.360 
some kind of shape of a landmass you
could<00:03:37.870> try<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.079> or<00:03:38.650> any<00:03:38.919> other<00:03:39.099> kind<00:03:39.310> of

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
could try that or any other kind of

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.420 
could try that or any other kind of
symbol<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:41.049> you<00:03:41.109> can<00:03:41.230> get<00:03:41.319> the<00:03:41.440> idea<00:03:41.470> there

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
symbol and you can get the idea there

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.509 
symbol and you can get the idea there
for<00:03:42.819> a<00:03:43.090> pretty<00:03:43.569> basic<00:03:43.750> pattern<00:03:44.590> so<00:03:45.370> I'm<00:03:45.430> gonna

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
for a pretty basic pattern so I'm gonna

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.479 
for a pretty basic pattern so I'm gonna
click<00:03:45.639> and<00:03:45.819> drag<00:03:45.970> around<00:03:46.120> all<00:03:46.329> that<00:03:47.489> hit

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
click and drag around all that hit

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.610 
click and drag around all that hit
backspace<00:03:48.729> to<00:03:48.970> delete<00:03:49.150> it<00:03:49.540> now<00:03:50.049> over<00:03:50.440> on<00:03:50.470> the

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
backspace to delete it now over on the

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.379 
backspace to delete it now over on the
lips<00:03:50.979> tool<00:03:51.190> click<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.519> hold<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:51.970> go<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:52.180> the

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
lips tool click and hold and go to the

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.199 
lips tool click and hold and go to the
star<00:03:52.690> tool<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:54.340> click<00:03:54.849> and<00:03:54.879> drag

star tool and click and drag

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.349 
star tool and click and drag
I'll<00:03:55.419> hold<00:03:55.510> shift<00:03:55.840> so<00:03:56.109> it's<00:03:56.290> level<00:03:56.769> and<00:03:57.430> so<00:03:58.329> I

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
I'll hold shift so it's level and so I

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.300 
I'll hold shift so it's level and so I
have<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.569> star<00:03:58.870> here<00:03:59.169> this<00:03:59.530> is<00:03:59.680> a<00:03:59.739> different<00:03:59.769> way

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
have a star here this is a different way

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.699 
have a star here this is a different way
doing<00:04:00.579> it<00:04:00.639> instead<00:04:00.970> of<00:04:01.030> all<00:04:01.359> or<00:04:02.229> option

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709

transform<00:04:06.010> and<00:04:06.310> then<00:04:07.090> transform<00:04:07.629> each<00:04:08.099> what

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
transform and then transform each what

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.159 
transform and then transform each what
this<00:04:09.250> does<00:04:09.519> is<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:11.440> will<00:04:12.190> make<00:04:12.699> it<00:04:13.659> smaller<00:04:13.959> or

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
this does is it will make it smaller or

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.979 
this does is it will make it smaller or
larger<00:04:14.500> depending<00:04:14.799> on<00:04:15.010> scale<00:04:15.539> it'll<00:04:16.539> move<00:04:16.720> it

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
larger depending on scale it'll move it

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.000 
larger depending on scale it'll move it
okay<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:18.190> also<00:04:18.849> rotate<00:04:19.299> it<00:04:19.449> depending<00:04:20.079> on<00:04:20.229> our

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
okay and also rotate it depending on our

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.529 
okay and also rotate it depending on our
settings<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:21.789> if<00:04:21.909> we<00:04:22.000> go<00:04:22.150> ahead<00:04:22.180> and<00:04:22.389> click

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539

preview and that will preview where it
will<00:04:24.460> move<00:04:24.700> so<00:04:25.510> horizontal

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
will move so horizontal

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.680 
will move so horizontal
let's<00:04:27.500> just<00:04:27.650> say<00:04:27.890> I'll<00:04:28.400> just<00:04:28.460> make<00:04:28.730> the<00:04:28.820> 75%<00:04:29.600> of

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
let's just say I'll just make the 75% of

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.910 
let's just say I'll just make the 75% of
what<00:04:29.780> it<00:04:29.900> was<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.910> 75%<00:04:31.910> of<00:04:32.210> that<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.920> move

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
what it was and 75% of that and move

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.000 
what it was and 75% of that and move
horizontal<00:04:35.080> I'm<00:04:36.080> going<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.320> click<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.650> preview

of<00:04:40.280> what<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.550> new<00:04:40.670> one<00:04:40.820> will<00:04:40.970> look<00:04:41.120> like<00:04:41.300> when

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
of what the new one will look like when

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.010 
of what the new one will look like when
you<00:04:41.540> have<00:04:41.570> preview<00:04:41.960> selected<00:04:43.690> I'll<00:04:44.690> move<00:04:44.870> it

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
you have preview selected I'll move it

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.110 
you have preview selected I'll move it
over<00:04:45.260> just<00:04:45.290> a<00:04:45.590> little<00:04:45.620> bit<00:04:45.830> more<00:04:46.090> okay<00:04:47.090> so

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
over just a little bit more okay so

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.360 
over just a little bit more okay so
something<00:04:47.450> like<00:04:47.480> that<00:04:47.570> so<00:04:48.500> I<00:04:48.530> have<00:04:48.680> 85<00:04:49.160> points

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
something like that so I have 85 points

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.390 
something like that so I have 85 points
over<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:49.970> also<00:04:50.750> want<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:50.960> rotate<00:04:51.320> it<00:04:51.470> I'll

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
over and also want to rotate it I'll

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.750 
over and also want to rotate it I'll
just<00:04:52.610> say<00:04:54.010> 16<00:04:55.010> degrees<00:04:55.280> something<00:04:55.460> like<00:04:55.610> that

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
just say 16 degrees something like that

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.120 
just say 16 degrees something like that
and<00:04:56.210> I'll<00:04:56.330> hit<00:04:56.450> copy<00:04:56.690> instead<00:04:57.020> of<00:04:57.140> okay<00:04:57.440> if<00:04:57.860> hit

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
and I'll hit copy instead of okay if hit

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.110 
and I'll hit copy instead of okay if hit
copy<00:04:58.460> that<00:04:58.970> keeps<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.480> original<00:04:59.590> but<00:05:00.590> also

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
copy that keeps the original but also

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.940 
copy that keeps the original but also
produces<00:05:02.120> this<00:05:02.330> new<00:05:02.600> one<00:05:02.810> what<00:05:03.650> you<00:05:03.710> want<00:05:03.890> to

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
produces this new one what you want to

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.400 
produces this new one what you want to
do<00:05:04.040> then<00:05:04.250> again<00:05:04.790> we're<00:05:05.000> going<00:05:05.090> to<00:05:05.150> go<00:05:05.410> into

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
do then again we're going to go into

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.230 
do then again we're going to go into
objects<00:05:06.860> transform<00:05:07.310> transform<00:05:07.670> again<00:05:07.970> by

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
objects transform transform again by

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.960 
objects transform transform again by
hitting<00:05:08.420> command<00:05:08.630> E<00:05:08.990> or<00:05:09.200> ctrl<00:05:09.620> D<00:05:09.800> so<00:05:10.790> I'll<00:05:10.850> do

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
hitting command E or ctrl D so I'll do

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.000 
hitting command E or ctrl D so I'll do
ctrl<00:05:11.390> D<00:05:11.540> on<00:05:11.660> the<00:05:11.780> PC<00:05:12.140> command<00:05:12.650> D<00:05:12.770> on<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:12.920> Mac

ctrl D on the PC command D on the Mac

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.260 
ctrl D on the PC command D on the Mac
and<00:05:13.430> what<00:05:14.300> it's<00:05:14.450> doing<00:05:14.690> is<00:05:15.910> doing<00:05:16.910> the<00:05:17.000> same

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
and what it's doing is doing the same

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.230 
and what it's doing is doing the same
equation<00:05:18.220> applying<00:05:19.220> it<00:05:19.400> that<00:05:19.850> we<00:05:19.970> used

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
equation applying it that we used

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.620 
equation applying it that we used
originally<00:05:20.960> seventy-five<00:05:21.680> percent<00:05:22.630> smaller

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
originally seventy-five percent smaller

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.300 
originally seventy-five percent smaller
Center<00:05:24.050> five<00:05:24.200> percent<00:05:24.470> smaller<00:05:24.650> over<00:05:25.190> and

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
Center five percent smaller over and

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.990 
Center five percent smaller over and
over<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:25.520> over<00:05:25.550> also<00:05:26.330> the<00:05:26.480> same<00:05:26.750> offset

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
over and over also the same offset

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.450 
over and over also the same offset
horizontally<00:05:29.650> from<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.830> center<00:05:31.100> even<00:05:31.340> though

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
horizontally from the center even though

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.650 
horizontally from the center even though
it<00:05:31.550> looks<00:05:31.730> like<00:05:31.820> the<00:05:31.910> farther<00:05:32.270> apart

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
it looks like the farther apart

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.950 
it looks like the farther apart
it's<00:05:32.810> from<00:05:33.380> the<00:05:33.500> center<00:05:33.830> of<00:05:34.040> each<00:05:34.220> one<00:05:34.250> is

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
it's from the center of each one is

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.250 
it's from the center of each one is
offset<00:05:35.960> and<00:05:37.150> it's<00:05:38.150> also<00:05:38.330> slightly<00:05:38.510> rotating

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
offset and it's also slightly rotating

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.380 
offset and it's also slightly rotating
with<00:05:39.380> each<00:05:39.500> one<00:05:39.740> okay<00:05:40.250> so<00:05:40.550> with<00:05:41.090> this<00:05:41.180> you

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
with each one okay so with this you

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.260 
with each one okay so with this you
could<00:05:41.510> actually<00:05:41.690> click<00:05:42.020> and<00:05:42.230> drag<00:05:42.470> and<00:05:43.270> alt

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
could actually click and drag and alt

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.170 
could actually click and drag and alt
click<00:05:44.870> it<00:05:45.020> or<00:05:45.170> option<00:05:45.590> click<00:05:45.680> it<00:05:45.920> and<00:05:46.180> you

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
click it or option click it and you

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.360 
click it or option click it and you
could<00:05:47.330> rotate<00:05:47.540> it<00:05:49.930> and<00:05:50.930> you<00:05:51.380> create<00:05:51.710> some<00:05:52.250> kind

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
could rotate it and you create some kind

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.010 
could rotate it and you create some kind
of<00:05:52.460> pattern<00:05:52.670> there<00:05:54.460> you<00:05:55.460> can<00:05:55.580> also<00:05:55.930> hold<00:05:56.930> down

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
of pattern there you can also hold down

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.380 
of pattern there you can also hold down
command<00:05:57.680> and<00:05:59.770> press<00:06:00.770> C<00:06:01.010> or<00:06:01.190> on<00:06:01.520> the<00:06:01.610> PC<00:06:01.910> control

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
command and press C or on the PC control

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.430 
command and press C or on the PC control
C<00:06:02.600> and<00:06:02.810> then<00:06:03.560> control<00:06:04.100> B<00:06:04.280> or<00:06:04.520> command<00:06:05.180> B<00:06:05.440> and

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
C and then control B or command B and

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.470 
C and then control B or command B and
you<00:06:06.650> can<00:06:06.740> copy<00:06:06.920> and<00:06:07.160> paste<00:06:07.190> it<00:06:10.210> so<00:06:11.210> you<00:06:11.270> have

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:11.480 
you can copy and paste it so you have

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.290 
you can copy and paste it so you have
this<00:06:11.570> pattern<00:06:11.840> here<00:06:12.260> that<00:06:12.440> can<00:06:13.340> be<00:06:13.460> used<00:06:13.700> in<00:06:13.970> an

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
this pattern here that can be used in an

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.300 
this pattern here that can be used in an
illustration<00:06:14.840> design<00:06:15.230> that's<00:06:16.070> pretty

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
illustration design that's pretty

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.010 
illustration design that's pretty
uniform<00:06:16.820> and<00:06:19.480> you<00:06:20.480> can<00:06:20.630> do<00:06:20.720> a<00:06:20.750> bunch<00:06:20.930> of

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
uniform and you can do a bunch of

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.300 
uniform and you can do a bunch of
different<00:06:21.110> things<00:06:21.320> with<00:06:21.560> that<00:06:21.650> transform

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
different things with that transform

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:28.030 
different things with that transform
each<00:06:23.060> command<00:06:23.770> so<00:06:24.770> if<00:06:24.890> you<00:06:26.410> for<00:06:27.410> example<00:06:27.440> went

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
each command so if you for example went

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.490 
each command so if you for example went
back<00:06:28.220> to<00:06:28.520> say<00:06:29.390> rounded<00:06:29.780> rectangle<00:06:31.120> object

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
back to say rounded rectangle object

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.909 
back to say rounded rectangle object
transform<00:06:33.850> transform<00:06:34.850> each

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
transform transform each

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:41.309 
transform transform each
again<00:06:36.669> you<00:06:36.789> can<00:06:36.909> rotate<00:06:37.150> it<00:06:39.840> you<00:06:40.840> can<00:06:41.020> make<00:06:41.199> it

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 
again you can rotate it you can make it

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:44.309 
again you can rotate it you can make it
scaled<00:06:41.710> certain<00:06:42.310> ways<00:06:42.520> and<00:06:42.909> you<00:06:43.449> hit<00:06:43.599> copy<00:06:43.870> and

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 
scaled certain ways and you hit copy and

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:46.230 
scaled certain ways and you hit copy and
it<00:06:44.469> creates<00:06:44.740> a<00:06:44.830> new<00:06:44.979> one<00:06:45.189> of<00:06:45.789> course<00:06:46.029> you<00:06:46.120> can

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
it creates a new one of course you can

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.600 
it creates a new one of course you can
also<00:06:46.360> go<00:06:46.479> to<00:06:46.569> object<00:06:46.960> transform<00:06:47.409> move<00:06:47.740> it<00:06:48.490> you

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
also go to object transform move it you

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.649 
also go to object transform move it you
don't<00:06:48.759> really<00:06:48.939> need<00:06:49.090> to<00:06:49.210> use<00:06:49.240> that<00:06:49.449> you<00:06:49.539> can

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:49.659 
don't really need to use that you can

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.300 
don't really need to use that you can
use<00:06:49.749> a<00:06:49.779> selection<00:06:50.199> tool<00:06:50.349> rotate<00:06:50.860> you<00:06:51.039> can<00:06:51.159> just

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
use a selection tool rotate you can just

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.519 
use a selection tool rotate you can just
hover<00:06:51.460> around<00:06:51.849> the<00:06:51.969> corner<00:06:52.389> but<00:06:53.110> reflects

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:53.529 
hover around the corner but reflects

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:54.929 
hover around the corner but reflects
scale<00:06:53.830> share<00:06:54.099> those<00:06:54.310> other<00:06:54.550> different<00:06:54.849> ones

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:54.939 
scale share those other different ones

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:57.779 
scale share those other different ones
of<00:06:55.090> transform<00:06:55.629> but<00:06:56.169> transform<00:06:56.590> each<00:06:56.800> allows

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:57.789 
of transform but transform each allows

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:02.670 
of transform but transform each allows
you<00:06:58.060> to<00:06:59.849> do<00:07:00.849> specific<00:07:01.479> settings<00:07:01.810> here<00:07:02.080> and<00:07:02.259> you

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 
you to do specific settings here and you

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.920 
you to do specific settings here and you
can<00:07:02.830> also<00:07:02.949> copy<00:07:03.279> any<00:07:03.639> of<00:07:03.789> those<00:07:03.969> and<00:07:04.240> repeat

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
can also copy any of those and repeat

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.540 
can also copy any of those and repeat
them<00:07:05.020> again<00:07:05.110> with<00:07:05.379> the<00:07:05.499> transform<00:07:06.159> again<00:07:06.340> to

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
them again with the transform again to

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.170 
them again with the transform again to
create<00:07:06.849> patterns<00:07:07.090> and<00:07:07.569> Adobe<00:07:08.379> Illustrator

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
create patterns and Adobe Illustrator

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.300 
create patterns and Adobe Illustrator
thank<00:07:10.180> you
