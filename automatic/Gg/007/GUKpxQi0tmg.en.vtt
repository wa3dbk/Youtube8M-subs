00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.030
 covers are the most beautiful thing that has been 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.390
 never done 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.489
 what it is about is a dystopian world 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.260
 which is called and read where a 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.270
 contest to choose the future 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.000
 princess and good story about 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.370
 america singer who is a girl of low 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.070
 resources she is poor choose her to go 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.899
 to the selection to the contest she does not 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.789
 he wants to go because then at first he does not 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.859
 it matters to be a princess she does not want the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.860
 crown and in second because it is 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.510
 deeply in love with a boy of 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.220
 which was in love with his girl 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.810
 and with which leads a relationship to 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.310
 hidden but good starts to have 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.570
 a lot of pressure because the boyfriend 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.850
 he says is that you can not lose this 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.290
 opportunity to be a princess and family 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.910
 because he also starts to press because 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.920
 They are very poor and they have many 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.010
 shortcomings and I would be losing a great 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.530
 opportunity to have not to have 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.380
 money to be the princess of ilea and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.900
 future queen then go then she 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.460
 decides at the end to go to this contest to 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.730
 the selection but good the interesting thing 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.460
 begins when she meets the prince 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.770
 that turns out to be a big guy my god is 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.050
 so divine is so romantic standard 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.360
 Now, well, I'm not going to tell you more 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.300
 basically his treats I loved it 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.860
 loved the truth is that yes yes it is 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.660
 too corny if it's too much 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.270
 romantic if you like 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.810
 romantic stories but not so much such 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.280
 you do not like them but if everything is like that 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.290
 an inveterate romantic that nothing else 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.330
 like to be reading love things and 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.890
 sigh every little while these books are 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.930
 for you really have to read 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.910
 they are very parents 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.860
 Many people seem to complain about a 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.720
 little of these books in the sense of 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.170
 how good we are used to 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.810
 one 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.880
 dystopian always tell you how 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.360
 they know the games of divergent hunger 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.310
 it's like a whole story of that place and 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.020
 why it works like this and society 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.480
 and the government and politics and good 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.700
 a thousand things and then comes the part 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.069
 romantic here is upside down here what 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.680
 important is the romantic story and 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.350
 everything that happens in this place called 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.260
 idea is a little bit secondary, that is if 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.580
 they tell you things but not so much then 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.080
 maybe if you like books like 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.319
 the hunger or divergent games that 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.910
 they are like more than society wave of 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.340
 actions and things like that 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.260
 rather than the romance because you might not 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.959
 like but I 'm not like that, so 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.640
 I loved it I love it since you already 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.640
 they read it talk and here below that 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.720
 they seemed to tell me if they are team maxon 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.670
 or team aspen and if they do not read the real ones 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.400
 they will like it if they are romantic read 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.810
 if they are not romantic salons that was 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.209
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.340
 I love this video very much and I 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.340
 I see cock very soon
