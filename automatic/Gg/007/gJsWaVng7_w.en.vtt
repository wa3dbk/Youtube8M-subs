00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
audience can't be discriminating but the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.970 
audience can't be discriminating but the

fundamental nature of the sign and our

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.069 
has mentioned here and elsewhere that
virgo<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.550> the<00:01:00.180> sign<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.719> sort<00:01:01.020> of

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
virgo is the sign that sort of

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.260 
virgo is the sign that sort of
discriminates<00:01:02.070> well<00:01:02.399> we<00:01:02.579> don't<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.850> much<00:01:03.239> of

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
discriminates well we don't have much of

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.390 
discriminates well we don't have much of
that<00:01:03.570> today<00:01:03.899> no<00:01:04.170> because<00:01:04.409> actually<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.159> Sun

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
that today no because actually the Sun

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.280 
that today no because actually the Sun
which<00:01:05.580> has<00:01:05.760> been<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.210> Virgo<00:01:06.600> for<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> month<00:01:07.110> has

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
which has been in Virgo for a month has

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.100 
which has been in Virgo for a month has
just<00:01:07.590> moved<00:01:07.740> into<00:01:08.210> Libra<00:01:09.210> everything's<00:01:09.780> nice

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
just moved into Libra everything's nice

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.890 
just moved into Libra everything's nice
that's<00:01:10.500> right<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.100> as<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.970> moon<00:01:12.150> today<00:01:12.600> is

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that's right and so as the moon today is

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.590 
that's right and so as the moon today is
in<00:01:13.229> early<00:01:13.680> Gemini<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.430> makes<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.939> harmonious

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
in early Gemini it makes a harmonious

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.840 
in early Gemini it makes a harmonious
shrine<00:01:16.020> with<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> Sun<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.950> Libra<00:01:17.430> which

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
shrine with the Sun and Libra which

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.179 
shrine with the Sun and Libra which
doesn't<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.509> anything<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.380> slow<00:01:19.740> down<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
doesn't do anything to slow down the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.550 
doesn't do anything to slow down the
intake<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.880> all<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.270> data<00:01:21.509> there's<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.200> sense

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
intake of all the data there's a sense

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.240 
intake of all the data there's a sense
today<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:24.450> upside<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.130> be

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
today of the upside is that we can be

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.429 
today of the upside is that we can be
incredibly<00:01:26.850> charming<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.900> clever<00:01:28.140> and

socially<00:01:29.070> interactive<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.689> have

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
socially interactive and we can have

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.660 
socially interactive and we can have
just<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:31.290> much<00:01:31.470> fun<00:01:31.530> having<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.280> conversation
