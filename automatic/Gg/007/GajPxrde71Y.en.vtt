00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:09.679 
respecting God for who he is but I think

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:12.490 
respecting God for who he is but I think
an<00:01:09.770> even<00:01:09.830> better<00:01:10.280> way<00:01:10.610> is<00:01:10.910> simply<00:01:11.630> this<00:01:11.929> to

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
an even better way is simply this to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.020 
an even better way is simply this to
value<00:01:13.100> what<00:01:13.640> God<00:01:13.939> values<00:01:14.710> with<00:01:15.710> your<00:01:16.100> kids<00:01:16.490> in
