00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello everyone this is the sixth video of 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.720
 the sixth idea for our spheres of 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.420
 Christmas and for this we are going to need 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.250
 Unicel spheres the size of your sphere 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.629
 it depends on the size your 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.920
 spheres 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:19.210
 we're going to need pom-pom clips 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.920
 enamel with glitter for nails or 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.779
 diamonds where it is corrugated or can 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.550
 be well any type of cardboard quoted 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.740
 who can handle it before paper 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.470
 kraft or paper that is coffee 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.180
 any other type but also that 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.390
 they can manipulate it, we are going to use it 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.020
 a down or a brown color to decorate 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.080
 the cone on our side 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.680
 and in this type of frost or I do not know how 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.720
 it's called but they're like bits of 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.490
 of plastic that you shine obviously in 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.830
 our hot silicone lands we're going 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.230
 to start with the cupcakes and for this 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.950
 let's take our ball of unicel and 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.950
 I'm going to paint 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.480
 it's already pink I'm going to apply a 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.879
 little bit of the frost as if they were 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.549
 the little ones or something like that of my 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.380
 cupcake in what dries we're going to 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.690
 cut out on our corrugated paper a 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.159
 strip that for my cupcake is going to be 2 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.159
 centimeters and a half wide 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.270
 now that our school is dry 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.860
 I do not have more or less because all the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.390
 unicel spheres bring as a one 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.159
 line marked in the middle of each sphere 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.440
 so me from there half to 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.960
 up because I painted it with the varnish and 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.650
 the frost and in that same line 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.650
 I'm going to put silicone 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.190
 and I'm going to start training 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.220
 this is what we have in this way 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.220
 so that it does not look so ugly and bottomless 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.780
 you can put a circle here of the same 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.410
 cardboard so what I'm going to do is 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.410
 cut him 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.980
 I think I'm going to start bending towards 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.980
 in 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.900
 since we doubled it now let's take 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.900
 our clip 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.739
 and yourself because you know as videos 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.739
 previous we are going to unfold it 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.489
 let's take our pompom quoted 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.489
 and we are going to nail the clip 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.459
 today we are going to insert it in the part of 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.459
 up to our coke 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.270
 and it's finished 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:57.040
 now for our side let's do what 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.040
 same with the sphere of the isr 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.260
 with the clip 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.260
 and with the pompom 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.150
 for your color let's take the paper 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.150
 coffee 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.520
 and this does not matter the measures 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.470
 they are simply calculating that 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.880
 more or less he 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.880
 the cornito the mixture 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.260
 we do not obviously double, I think everyone 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.260
 they know how to make a nice 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.890
 We calculate where you will fit 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.890
 our sphere 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.610
 and now we are going to paste it 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.660
 photos of the remainder and also cut them 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.660
 the peak of here 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.460
 now we are going to put our sphere 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.460
 pretty silicone 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.070
 was to the truth that metamos as 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.240
 that spills a little and it seems that 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.240
 our side is melting 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.780
 with the brown down I'm going to mark the 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.730
 diagonal lines 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.730
 as it normally enters the cones 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.009
 and that's it, that's how our side is 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.689
 finished 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.119
 and well this is how our 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:37.879
 frozen cage finished as you can see 

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:39.919
 They look beautiful I think I have enough 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:41.539
 sweet this Christmas I hope you have them 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.219
 liked the video and see you in a 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.580
 seventh and last chapter of this 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:45.580
 miniseries
