00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
course in primal origin which is a set

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.140 
course in primal origin which is a set
that's<00:00:13.620> coming<00:00:13.980> out<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.130> believe<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.670> end<00:00:14.880> of

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
that's coming out I believe the end of

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.750 
that's coming out I believe the end of
this<00:00:15.389> week<00:00:15.660> for<00:00:16.020> Japan<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.500> we'll<00:00:17.369> be<00:00:17.490> getting

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
this week for Japan and we'll be getting

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.599 
this week for Japan and we'll be getting
it<00:00:17.850> next<00:00:18.000> as<00:00:18.270> well<00:00:18.420> which<00:00:18.660> will<00:00:18.960> be<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.590> think<00:00:20.430> it

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
it next as well which will be I think it

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.429 
it next as well which will be I think it
was<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:20.939> March<00:00:21.150> if<00:00:21.570> I'm<00:00:21.750> not<00:00:21.840> mistaken<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.410> think

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
was in March if I'm not mistaken I think

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.170 
was in March if I'm not mistaken I think
we're<00:00:22.740> getting<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> primal<00:00:23.580> origin<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.970> March

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
we're getting a primal origin to March

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.390 
we're getting a primal origin to March
so<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.779> can't<00:00:25.050> wait<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.619> course<00:00:25.949> yet

might be able to save up out of money to
get<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> case<00:00:41.160> I'm<00:00:41.399> not<00:00:41.520> gonna<00:00:41.670> promise

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879

anything but I really am hoping that I
can<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:45.629> enough<00:00:45.750> money<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.230> do<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.800> of

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
can get enough money to do that and of

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.950 
can get enough money to do that and of
course<00:00:47.100> we'll<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> no<00:00:47.670> CG<00:00:47.969> opening<00:00:48.329> uh<00:00:48.360> maybe

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
course we'll do a no CG opening uh maybe

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.360 
course we'll do a no CG opening uh maybe
next<00:00:49.350> week<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:49.710> something<00:00:49.950> like<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.070> I'll

or<00:01:27.540> less<00:01:28.409> than<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.770> total<00:01:29.009> number<00:01:29.130> of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280

monsters changed to face down the fence
position<00:01:31.860> yeah<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:34.470> seems<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.860> pretty

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
position yeah it seems like a pretty

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.740 
position yeah it seems like a pretty
awesome<00:01:35.189> card<00:01:35.670> honestly<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> was<00:01:36.540> kind<00:01:36.720> of

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
awesome card honestly I was kind of

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.910 
awesome card honestly I was kind of
laughing<00:01:36.869> because<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.350> don't<00:01:37.740> know<00:01:37.799> how<00:01:37.860> many

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
laughing because I don't know how many

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
laughing because I don't know how many
times<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.460> say<00:01:38.610> face<00:01:39.150> down<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> fence

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
times we have to say face down the fence

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.410 
times we have to say face down the fence
position<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.409> ah<00:01:40.759> maybe<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.119> me

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
position it's like ah maybe it's just me

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.850 
position it's like ah maybe it's just me
I<00:01:42.450> don't<00:01:42.689> know<00:01:42.860> anyway<00:01:43.860> uh<00:01:44.329> yeah<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:46.049> effect

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
all the shenanigans that go Strix do

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.730 
all the shenanigans that go Strix do
when<00:02:11.220> they're<00:02:11.370> face<00:02:11.489> down<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:11.910> that

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
when they're face down like that

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.140 
when they're face down like that
and<00:02:12.860> not<00:02:13.250> only<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.460> it<00:02:13.640> has<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> little<00:02:13.910> bit<00:02:14.090> of

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
and not only that it has a little bit of

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.820 
and not only that it has a little bit of
a<00:02:14.240> searching<00:02:14.690> effect<00:02:15.020> as<00:02:15.200> well<00:02:15.380> for<00:02:15.680> all<00:02:15.740> the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
a searching effect as well for all the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.440 
a searching effect as well for all the
Watchers<00:02:16.100> flip<00:02:16.280> facedown<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:16.790> get<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:16.970> monster

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
Watchers flip facedown you get a monster

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.790 
Watchers flip facedown you get a monster
whose<00:02:18.170> level<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.730> it's<00:02:19.730> from<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.800> yeah

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
whose level is it's from that so yeah

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.560 
whose level is it's from that so yeah
that's<00:02:22.160> pretty<00:02:22.520> awesome<00:02:22.640> this<00:02:23.030> level<00:02:23.330> is

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
that's pretty awesome this level is

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.210 
that's pretty awesome this level is
equal<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:24.020> or<00:02:24.170> less<00:02:24.350> than<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.770> guess<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:25.040> should

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
equal to or less than I guess I should

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.160 
equal to or less than I guess I should
say

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
say

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.360 
say
yeah<00:02:27.170> that's<00:02:27.380> pretty<00:02:27.710> easy<00:02:27.830> especially

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
yeah that's pretty easy especially

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.580 
yeah that's pretty easy especially
seeing<00:02:29.030> as<00:02:29.210> that<00:02:29.270> most<00:02:29.720> go<00:02:29.870> streaks<00:02:30.170> really

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
seeing as that most go streaks really

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.220 
seeing as that most go streaks really
don't<00:02:30.740> have<00:02:30.890> high<00:02:31.070> levels<00:02:31.490> it<00:02:31.930> would<00:02:32.930> not<00:02:33.080> be

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
don't have high levels it would not be

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.650 
don't have high levels it would not be
hard<00:02:33.440> at<00:02:33.620> all<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:34.040> be<00:02:34.280> able<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.600> pretty<00:02:35.600> much

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
hard at all to be able to pretty much

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.700 
hard at all to be able to pretty much
get<00:02:35.870> whatever<00:02:36.140> goes<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.320> your<00:02:36.410> monster<00:02:36.620> you

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
get whatever goes to your monster you

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.350 
get whatever goes to your monster you
mean<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:37.070> think<00:02:37.550> this<00:02:37.760> card<00:02:37.970> is<00:02:38.030> gonna<00:02:38.120> really

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
mean I think this card is gonna really

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.580 
mean I think this card is gonna really
come<00:02:38.510> in<00:02:38.570> handy<00:02:38.810> for<00:02:38.840> them<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.320> can't<00:02:39.500> wait

how they were just you could just like
make<00:03:55.160> it<00:03:55.280> where<00:03:55.400> your<00:03:55.520> opponent<00:03:55.580> gets<00:03:55.910> some

anything that can you protect themselves

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.070 
anything that can you protect themselves
I<00:03:58.010> mean<00:03:58.730> for<00:03:58.910> all<00:03:59.210> kinds<00:03:59.510> of<00:03:59.570> different<00:03:59.660> combos

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
I mean for all kinds of different combos

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.780 
I mean for all kinds of different combos
back<00:04:00.290> then<00:04:00.470> when<00:04:00.980> people<00:04:01.100> really<00:04:01.550> used<00:04:01.700> so

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
back then when people really used so

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.700 
back then when people really used so
much<00:04:01.850> elements<00:04:02.240> to<00:04:02.330> do<00:04:02.450> that<00:04:02.630> and<00:04:02.960> it<00:04:03.470> was

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
much elements to do that and it was

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.740 
much elements to do that and it was
pretty<00:04:04.070> scary<00:04:04.220> because<00:04:05.120> I<00:04:05.360> could<00:04:05.510> literally

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
pretty scary because I could literally

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.300 
pretty scary because I could literally
just<00:04:06.020> cut<00:04:06.200> off<00:04:06.260> your<00:04:06.380> monster<00:04:06.740> zones<00:04:06.920> and<00:04:07.160> that

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
just cut off your monster zones and that

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.790 
just cut off your monster zones and that
kind<00:04:07.520> of<00:04:07.550> is<00:04:07.850> what<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.330> reminds<00:04:08.930> me<00:04:09.110> of<00:04:09.260> you

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800
