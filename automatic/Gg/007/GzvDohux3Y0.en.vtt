switch I think is causing it not to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.710 
switch I think is causing it not to
close<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.520> kill<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.880> yeah<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.210> left<00:01:21.360> pull

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
close so to kill it yeah it's left pull
