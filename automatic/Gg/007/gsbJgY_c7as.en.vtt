00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
as a bit of a ancillary speculation is

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.160

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
they like pearl or non-combat gems

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.159 
they like pearl or non-combat gems
explaining<00:05:42.669> why<00:05:42.759> Jasper<00:05:43.389> who<00:05:43.750> seems<00:05:44.020> to<00:05:44.110> have

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
explaining why Jasper who seems to have

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.439 
explaining why Jasper who seems to have
an<00:05:44.409> extreme<00:05:44.800> respect<00:05:45.669> for<00:05:45.909> fighting<00:05:46.270> prowess

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
an extreme respect for fighting prowess

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.990 
an extreme respect for fighting prowess
says<00:05:47.349> to<00:05:47.529> garnet<00:05:47.889> oh<00:05:48.039> great

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
says to garnet oh great

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.769 
says to garnet oh great
you're<00:05:49.419> both<00:05:49.810> out<00:05:50.110> and<00:05:50.469> you're<00:05:51.069> fused<00:05:51.430> again

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:51.779 
you're both out and you're fused again

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:55.620 
you're both out and you're fused again
why<00:05:53.039> Fusion<00:05:54.039> is<00:05:54.130> just<00:05:54.190> a<00:05:54.610> cheap<00:05:54.639> tactic<00:05:55.449> to

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
why Fusion is just a cheap tactic to

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.930 
why Fusion is just a cheap tactic to
make<00:05:55.659> weak<00:05:55.810> gems<00:05:56.199> stronger<00:05:57.069> quit

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
make weak gems stronger quit

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.360 
make weak gems stronger quit
embarrassing<00:05:58.090> yourself<00:05:59.080> I<00:05:59.440> see<00:06:00.009> what<00:06:00.219> you

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
embarrassing yourself I see what you

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.409 
embarrassing yourself I see what you
really<00:06:00.699> are

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
really are

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.899 
really are
she's<00:06:01.779> almost<00:06:02.050> disgusted<00:06:02.800> with<00:06:02.889> garnet<00:06:03.279> is<00:06:03.759> it

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:03.909 
she's almost disgusted with garnet is it

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:05.909 
she's almost disgusted with garnet is it
because<00:06:04.240> she<00:06:04.690> looks<00:06:04.990> down<00:06:05.199> on<00:06:05.409> fusions

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
because she looks down on fusions

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.830 
because she looks down on fusions
because<00:06:06.279> the<00:06:06.430> power<00:06:06.610> that<00:06:06.879> a<00:06:07.120> fusion<00:06:07.479> receives

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
because the power that a fusion receives

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.080 
because the power that a fusion receives
isn't<00:06:08.229> its<00:06:08.319> own<00:06:08.469> I<00:06:08.740> don't<00:06:09.129> think<00:06:09.610> so

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
isn't its own I don't think so

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.850 
isn't its own I don't think so
since<00:06:10.389> we<00:06:10.539> actually<00:06:10.900> see<00:06:11.080> Jasper<00:06:11.349> fuse

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
since we actually see Jasper fuse

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.980 
since we actually see Jasper fuse
herself<00:06:12.279> later<00:06:12.550> in<00:06:12.699> the<00:06:12.789> episode<00:06:12.879> now<00:06:13.719> I<00:06:13.750> think

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
herself later in the episode now I think

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.719 
herself later in the episode now I think
she<00:06:14.409> was<00:06:14.529> disgusted<00:06:15.099> with<00:06:15.219> garnet<00:06:15.580> because

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
she was disgusted with garnet because

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.930 
she was disgusted with garnet because
the<00:06:16.029> power<00:06:16.210> granted<00:06:16.659> by<00:06:16.840> fusion<00:06:17.580> allows<00:06:18.580> her

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
the power granted by fusion allows her

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.540 
the power granted by fusion allows her
to<00:06:18.969> play<00:06:19.539> at<00:06:20.199> being<00:06:20.469> a<00:06:20.560> fighter<00:06:20.800> when<00:06:21.129> that

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
to play at being a fighter when that

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.700 
to play at being a fighter when that
isn't<00:06:22.029> what<00:06:22.150> she<00:06:22.330> was<00:06:22.479> supposed<00:06:22.779> to<00:06:22.900> be<00:06:23.110> in

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
isn't what she was supposed to be in

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.369 
isn't what she was supposed to be in
terms<00:06:24.009> of<00:06:24.250> gem<00:06:24.460> society<00:06:25.150> I<00:06:25.300> don't<00:06:26.080> know<00:06:26.169> maybe

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:26.379 
terms of gem society I don't know maybe

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:28.050 
terms of gem society I don't know maybe
I'm<00:06:26.590> reaching<00:06:27.039> but<00:06:27.190> I<00:06:27.250> definitely<00:06:27.819> feel<00:06:28.029> like

I'm reaching but I definitely feel like

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.240 
I'm reaching but I definitely feel like
the<00:06:28.360> evidence<00:06:28.629> is<00:06:28.900> there<00:06:29.139> what<00:06:29.770> do<00:06:29.830> you<00:06:29.949> think

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
the evidence is there what do you think

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.070 
the evidence is there what do you think
does<00:06:30.610> this<00:06:30.789> theory<00:06:31.060> hold<00:06:31.389> any<00:06:31.509> weight<00:06:31.750> for<00:06:31.779> you

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
does this theory hold any weight for you
