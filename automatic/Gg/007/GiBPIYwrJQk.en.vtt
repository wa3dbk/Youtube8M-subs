00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.240
 good idea 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.090
 reluctantly the older is resigned to 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.680
 the same element of balanced 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.179
 it's true that the word harmony does not exist 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.560
 not in French balanced element in 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.590

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.670
 apple jack are exactly the same 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.190

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.210
 disappeared on the camp following me not 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.610
 looked up to someone who does the

 half of its size 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.070
 logically monastery at the age where 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.270
 twilight I do not see why this pack 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.449

 this book a golden title here and silver there 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.409
 I would be surprised that this book is a 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.100
 100% natural color and even in sight 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.020
 climatic 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.180
 all the white people except the one 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:18.330
 which interests us it is about weapons 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:21.689
 idea so much the audacity alcorn you see 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.060

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.650
 think celestial has seen that it's 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.650

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.789
 she left no you will not make me 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.469
 never ridden in this tank I am 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.149
 certain that there have been deaths especially 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.409
 with spike that visibly handed the 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.890
 letter in loop since their departure from 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.890
 as for the lot 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.119
 we should also explain 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.200
 why the Pegasus Pegasus flying he 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.990
 I would have to explain why 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.369
 the summer galopons flying gas or how the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.119
 translators massacre france pivot 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.500
 of an episode you will not see often 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.869
 twilight because this monk's head check 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.869
 list what's that beautiful with a fagot 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.420
 why very hard and we especially they 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.230
 have nothing to do with the dishes sent 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.239
 eat a green apple 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.579
 when a nice move wands and pegasates them 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:26.579
 most talented of all equestria it's 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:27.660
 well forgiveness of pony city stole to 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.230
 the place for what to do 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.970
 but the company mockups that spike 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.160
 pancake batter stolen from where it's 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.739
 so mainstream I will reside at 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.200
 pony been the null chopper being a big 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.250

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.250

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.819
 he's organizing the game in 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.319
 question hung the tail of the pony and 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.269
 some people did not give themselves 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.379
 the need to clarify 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.180
 I will have some time to study the 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.230
 elements balancing but as 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.420
 mayor of pony city 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.849
 it's an honor for me that a call 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.219
 of offers of legitimacy after an exile 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.540
 a thousand years technically no 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:19.379
 and use his mane as 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.379
 of a currency changes nothing
