these<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:40.560> there's<00:01:40.710> six<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.070> them<00:01:41.130> these

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
these I think there's six of them these

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.170 
these I think there's six of them these
funky<00:01:42.630> Torx<00:01:43.470> head<00:01:43.560> bolts<00:01:43.829> get<00:01:44.700> them<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:45.030> of

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
funky Torx head bolts get them out of

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.889 
funky Torx head bolts get them out of
the<00:01:45.240> way<00:01:45.360> first

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
the way first

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.530 
the way first
then<00:01:46.170> drop<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.920> CV<00:01:47.310> or<00:01:47.399> get<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.850> CV<00:01:48.240> out<00:01:48.390> of

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
then drop that CV or get that CV out of

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.960 
then drop that CV or get that CV out of
that<00:01:48.770> area<00:01:49.770> there<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.070> into<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> CV<00:01:50.729> axle

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that area there that into the CV axle

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.130 
that area there that into the CV axle
and<00:01:51.450> then<00:01:52.290> push<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.520> push<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.329> other<00:01:54.869> side

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and then push the push to the other side

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.560 
and then push the push to the other side
pop<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.590> out<00:01:55.680> with<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.890> hammer<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.420> come<00:01:57.420> out

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
pop it out with a hammer and come out

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.940 
pop it out with a hammer and come out
pretty<00:01:57.750> easily<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.469> think<00:01:58.710> I'll<00:01:58.799> probably

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
pretty easily then I think I'll probably

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.370 
pretty easily then I think I'll probably
even<00:01:59.280> take<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.390> shock<00:02:00.689> off<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.049> take<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
even take this shock off you take the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.499 
even take this shock off you take the
shock<00:02:01.619> off<00:02:01.860> here<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> drop<00:02:03.119> down<00:02:03.329> another

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
shock off here it a drop down another

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.190 
shock off here it a drop down another
inch<00:02:04.049> or<00:02:04.409> two<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.119> anyway<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.180> get<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.570> you

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
inch or two and anyway you get this you

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.630 
inch or two and anyway you get this you
know<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.409> further<00:02:07.649> down<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> wheel<00:02:08.160> goes<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
know the further down the wheel goes the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.490 
know the further down the wheel goes the
longer<00:02:08.940> your<00:02:09.090> CV<00:02:09.420> joint<00:02:09.690> has<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.319> to

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
longer your CV joint has to be to

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.010 
longer your CV joint has to be to
compensate<00:02:11.129> for<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:12.180> easier<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.900> get

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
compensate for it and that easier to get

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.380 
compensate for it and that easier to get
that<00:02:13.140> stupid<00:02:13.410> thing<00:02:13.650> out<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.980> there<00:02:14.129> so<00:02:14.430> anyway

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
that stupid thing out of there so anyway

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.300 
that stupid thing out of there so anyway

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
a contraption I got like three 3/8 inch

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.520 
a contraption I got like three 3/8 inch
extension<00:03:02.610> bars<00:03:02.970> coming<00:03:03.360> out<00:03:03.480> here<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.440> they

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
extension bars coming out here and they

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.619 
extension bars coming out here and they
got<00:03:04.680> my<00:03:04.769> handy<00:03:05.069> dandy<00:03:05.099> pneumatic<00:03:06.060> right<00:03:06.239> angle

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
got my handy dandy pneumatic right angle

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.470 
got my handy dandy pneumatic right angle
so<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.230> break<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.099> free<00:03:08.280> by<00:03:08.459> hand<00:03:08.790> then<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.300> use

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
so I break it free by hand then I use

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.869 
so I break it free by hand then I use
that<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.980> know<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.220> zip<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.489> bolts<00:03:11.760> out

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
that to you know the zip the bolts out

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.160 
that to you know the zip the bolts out
the<00:03:12.030> rest<00:03:12.239> of<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.420> way<00:03:12.540> makes<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.110> little

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
the rest of the way makes it a little

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.970 
the rest of the way makes it a little
quicker<00:03:13.470> what<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.280> do<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.489> just<00:03:14.610> take<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.269> little

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
quicker what I do I just take a little

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.770 
quicker what I do I just take a little
vise<00:03:16.980> grip<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.489> clamp<00:03:17.909> a<00:03:18.150> little<00:03:18.209> bit<00:03:18.510> on<00:03:18.629> the

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
vise grip and clamp a little bit on the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.809 
vise grip and clamp a little bit on the
disc<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.800> way<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.069> keeps<00:03:20.190> from<00:03:20.489> spinning

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
disc that way it keeps from spinning

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.580 
disc that way it keeps from spinning
otherwise<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.540> know<00:03:21.659> and<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:21.900> start<00:03:22.170> loosing

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
otherwise you know and you start loosing

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.830 
otherwise you know and you start loosing
this<00:03:22.800> this<00:03:23.010> disc<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:23.940> going<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.209> run<00:03:24.360> around<00:03:24.599> if

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
this this disc is going to run around if

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.780 
this this disc is going to run around if
you<00:03:24.989> got<00:03:25.140> somebody<00:03:25.379> to<00:03:25.560> put<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.430> brakes<00:03:26.640> on

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
you got somebody to put the brakes on

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.729 
you got somebody to put the brakes on
that'll<00:03:27.060> work<00:03:27.150> too<00:03:27.390> but<00:03:27.629> working<00:03:28.200> alone<00:03:28.379> so

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
that'll work too but working alone so

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.920 
that'll work too but working alone so
anyway<00:03:29.580> I<00:03:29.610> just<00:03:29.640> blocked<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.209> disc<00:03:30.599> a<00:03:30.720> little

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
anyway I just blocked the disc a little

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.199 
anyway I just blocked the disc a little
bit<00:03:31.080> there<00:03:31.319> keep<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.159> from<00:03:32.280> going<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.849> I'll

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
bit there keep it from going so I'll

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.630 
bit there keep it from going so I'll
take<00:03:33.450> all<00:03:33.629> these<00:03:33.780> off<00:03:34.080> I'll<00:03:34.950> get<00:03:35.099> that<00:03:35.280> CV

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
take all these off I'll get that CV

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.309 
take all these off I'll get that CV
joint<00:03:35.940> out<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.450> way<00:03:36.599> I'll<00:03:36.870> knock<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:37.080> to

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
joint out of the way I'll knock it to

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.100 
joint out of the way I'll knock it to
the<00:03:37.409> left<00:03:37.620> there<00:03:37.860> then<00:03:38.610> I'll<00:03:38.760> loosen<00:03:39.150> up<00:03:39.420> this

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
the left there then I'll loosen up this

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.649 
the left there then I'll loosen up this
bolt<00:03:40.440> that's<00:03:41.069> not<00:03:41.310> here<00:03:41.610> then<00:03:41.819> not<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.330> CV

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
bolt that's not here then not the CV

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.490 
bolt that's not here then not the CV
joint<00:03:42.900> out<00:03:43.099> okay<00:03:44.870> okay<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.170> looks<00:03:46.200> in<00:03:46.440> the

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
joint out okay okay so it looks in the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.960 
joint out okay okay so it looks in the
six<00:03:46.739> bolts<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.159> got<00:03:47.310> them<00:03:47.430> all<00:03:47.489> out<00:03:47.519> of<00:03:47.700> there

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
six bolts I got them all out of there

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.240 
six bolts I got them all out of there
there's<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.450> CV<00:03:48.840> joint<00:03:49.140> laying<00:03:49.620> right<00:03:49.830> there

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
there's a CV joint laying right there

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.250 
there's a CV joint laying right there
they<00:03:50.640> axle<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.060> should<00:03:51.239> say<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.900> it's<00:03:52.049> sitting

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
they axle I should say and it's sitting

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.110 
they axle I should say and it's sitting
on<00:03:52.439> top<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:52.860> that<00:03:52.980> it's<00:03:53.459> sitting<00:03:53.700> on<00:03:53.760> top<00:03:53.970> of

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
on top of that it's sitting on top of

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.600 
on top of that it's sitting on top of
that<00:03:54.209> block<00:03:54.480> for<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:55.769> sway<00:03:55.980> bar<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.310> can<00:03:56.459> see

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
that block for the sway bar you can see

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.259 
that block for the sway bar you can see
it<00:03:56.730> right<00:03:56.849> there

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
it right there

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.690 
it right there
so<00:03:57.510> again<00:03:58.319> I<00:03:58.349> loosened<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.129> up<00:03:59.189> pulled<00:03:59.519> it<00:03:59.610> out

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
so again I loosened it up pulled it out

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.960 
so again I loosened it up pulled it out
of<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.879> way<00:04:00.090> now<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:00.989> took<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.890> nut<00:04:02.069> off<00:04:02.220> and

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
of the way now I took the nut off and

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.270 
of the way now I took the nut off and
I'll<00:04:03.180> punch<00:04:03.599> this<00:04:03.810> thing<00:04:04.080> back<00:04:04.319> push<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.129> back

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
I'll punch this thing back push it back

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.250 
I'll punch this thing back push it back
through<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.549> splines<00:04:05.909> there<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.450> again<00:04:07.140> if

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
through the splines there and again if

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.190 
through the splines there and again if
you<00:04:07.349> do<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.739> other<00:04:07.769> way<00:04:08.689> if<00:04:09.689> you<00:04:09.750> push<00:04:10.049> this

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
you do it the other way if you push this

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.660 
you do it the other way if you push this
thing<00:04:10.409> out<00:04:10.530> first<00:04:10.860> you're<00:04:11.159> pushing<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.549> back

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
thing out first you're pushing it back

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.759 
thing out first you're pushing it back
like<00:04:11.879> two<00:04:12.120> inches<00:04:12.450> not<00:04:12.629> CV<00:04:12.989> joint<00:04:13.260> only<00:04:13.439> has<00:04:13.590> so

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
like two inches not CV joint only has so

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.770 
like two inches not CV joint only has so
much<00:04:13.830> travel<00:04:14.400> so<00:04:14.939> it's<00:04:15.090> real<00:04:15.239> tight<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.659> get

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
much travel so it's real tight to get

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.900 
much travel so it's real tight to get
the<00:04:15.900> thing<00:04:16.109> out<00:04:16.229> of<00:04:16.290> there<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:17.190> if<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.639> drop

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
the thing out of there so if you drop

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.240 
the thing out of there so if you drop
the<00:04:18.030> thing<00:04:18.180> down<00:04:18.359> first<00:04:18.720> then<00:04:19.620> punch<00:04:19.889> it<00:04:20.040> back

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
the thing down first then punch it back

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.390 
the thing down first then punch it back
it's<00:04:20.790> a<00:04:21.090> lot<00:04:21.389> easier<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.810> get<00:04:21.989> out<00:04:22.169> so<00:04:22.560> that's

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
it's a lot easier to get out so that's

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.950 
it's a lot easier to get out so that's
about<00:04:23.580> all<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:24.000> excitement<00:04:24.330> in<00:04:24.509> this<00:04:24.660> video

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
about all the excitement in this video

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.490 
about all the excitement in this video
I'm<00:04:25.080> sure<00:04:25.259> the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
I'm sure the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.250 
I'm sure the
if<00:04:25.890> you<00:04:26.010> can<00:04:26.240> handle<00:04:27.240> getting<00:04:27.360> cv<00:04:27.780> joints<00:04:27.990> out

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
if you can handle getting cv joints out

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.690 
if you can handle getting cv joints out
if<00:04:28.440> you<00:04:28.530> got<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.800> right<00:04:28.950> equipment<00:04:29.190> this<00:04:29.520> is<00:04:29.580> a
