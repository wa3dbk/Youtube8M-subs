00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
and fortunately serif was mostly just

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.930

but that last fight that was really the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.979 
but that last fight that was really the
heartbreaker<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.940> entire<00:00:35.989> TDK

very<00:00:38.760> well<00:00:39.239> yeah<00:00:39.690> serif<00:00:40.050> was<00:00:40.170> an<00:00:40.260> absolute

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
very well yeah serif was an absolute

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.350 
very well yeah serif was an absolute
monster<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:41.370> as<00:00:41.489> far<00:00:41.640> as<00:00:41.700> actually<00:00:42.120> dealing

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
monster but as far as actually dealing

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.490 
monster but as far as actually dealing
with<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.629> by<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.809> end<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> game<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.350> felt

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
with the by the end of the game it felt

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.740 
with the by the end of the game it felt
like<00:00:43.590> enemy<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.219> auxes<00:00:44.820> Kassadin<00:00:45.300> was

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
like enemy in auxes Kassadin was

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.090 
like enemy in auxes Kassadin was
crushing<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> backline<00:00:46.590> he<00:00:46.739> didn't<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.070> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
crushing the backline he didn't have to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.160 
crushing the backline he didn't have to
build<00:00:47.370> zhonya's<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.030> pretty<00:00:48.629> much<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> full

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
build zhonya's in pretty much a full

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.080 
build zhonya's in pretty much a full
item<00:00:49.410> build<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.370> new<00:00:50.520> change<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
item build with the new change to the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.970 
item build with the new change to the
Cassadine<00:00:51.600> having<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.050> lower<00:00:52.289> cooldown<00:00:52.649> on

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
Cassadine having that lower cooldown on

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.979 
Cassadine having that lower cooldown on
wrist<00:00:53.309> walk<00:00:53.489> he's<00:00:53.699> able<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:54.120> really<00:00:54.539> mobile

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
wrist walk he's able to be really mobile

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.479 
wrist walk he's able to be really mobile
so<00:00:55.199> even<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.770> get<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.980> lot<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.219> crowd

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
so even if you get a lot of crowd

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.920 
so even if you get a lot of crowd
control<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.879> mean<00:00:57.149> he<00:00:57.270> went<00:00:57.510> with<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> Merc

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
control I mean he went with the Merc

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.290 
control I mean he went with the Merc
treads<00:00:58.230> bill<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.829> he's<00:00:58.949> able<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.430> more<00:01:00.090> than

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
treads bill so he's able to more than

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.760 
treads bill so he's able to more than
likely<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.780> dodge<00:01:01.050> out<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.320> any<00:01:01.500> crowd

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
likely just dodge out of any crowd

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.950 
likely just dodge out of any crowd
control<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.430> he<00:01:02.789> becomes<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.149> really<00:01:03.570> annoying

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
control so he becomes a really annoying

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.509 
control so he becomes a really annoying
champion<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.589> deal<00:01:04.769> with<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.070> coupled<00:01:05.400> with<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
champion to deal with and coupled with a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.210 
champion to deal with and coupled with a
rail<00:01:05.790> yet<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.180> pic<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.900> Israel<00:01:07.830> isn't<00:01:08.100> going

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
rail yet a pic like Israel isn't going

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.039 
rail yet a pic like Israel isn't going
to<00:01:08.280> be<00:01:08.369> able<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.580> stand<00:01:08.850> when<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.750> get<00:01:09.869> though

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
to be able to stand when you get though

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.960 
to be able to stand when you get though
by<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.439> couple<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.220> silver<00:01:11.460> speed<00:01:11.820> up

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
by that couple with a silver speed up

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.280 
by that couple with a silver speed up
yeah<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.479> throughout<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.930> game<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.229> were

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
yeah and throughout the game we were

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.020 
yeah and throughout the game we were
trying<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.619> find<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.130> right<00:01:14.340> clip<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.909> this

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
trying to find the right clip for this

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.999 
trying to find the right clip for this
because<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.900> was<00:01:16.080> back<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> forth<00:01:16.590> back<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
because it was back and forth back and

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.469 
because it was back and forth back and
forth<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.670> kill<00:01:17.880> fight<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.240> or<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.450> go

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
forth the to kill fight here or to go

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.820 
forth the to kill fight here or to go
fight<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.409> really<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
fight here so it's really just the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.530 
fight here so it's really just the
game-deciding<00:01:20.220> fight<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.180> clip<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
game-deciding fight we have that clip to

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.560 
game-deciding fight we have that clip to
pull<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.810> up<00:01:21.900> right<00:01:22.530> here<00:01:23.240> because<00:01:24.240> really

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
pull it up right here because really

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.140 
pull it up right here because really
this<00:01:25.170> was<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.439> moment<00:01:25.860> where<00:01:26.040> GDK<00:01:26.759> still

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
this was a moment where GDK still

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.580 
this was a moment where GDK still
absolutely<00:01:27.570> could<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.020> won<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.229> game<00:01:28.320> it

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
absolutely could have won this game it

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.679 
absolutely could have won this game it
could<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.860> gone<00:01:29.040> either<00:01:29.340> way<00:01:29.579> enemy<00:01:30.119> decided

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
could have gone either way enemy decided

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.270 
could have gone either way enemy decided
to<00:01:30.810> force<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> split<00:01:31.829> push<00:01:32.040> and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
to force this with the split push and

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.830 
to force this with the split push and
then<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.850> end<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.119> getting<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.450> fight<00:01:33.659> here

and once sarap was item capped it really
felt<00:02:28.410> like<00:02:28.500> TDK<00:02:28.980> needed<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.280> change<00:02:29.580> their

strategy<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.360> team<00:02:30.540> fighting<00:02:30.750> because<00:02:30.900> enemy

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
strategy of team fighting because enemy

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.390 
had it figured out and if they continued
that<00:02:33.150> style<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.660> killing<00:02:34.260> Kyle<00:02:34.440> letting<00:02:35.250> auto

that style of killing Kyle letting auto

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.010

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
we know both teams were under a huge

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.370 
we know both teams were under a huge
amount<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.510> pressure<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.870> that's<00:03:13.050> one<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.320> the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
amount of pressure and that's one of the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.600 
amount of pressure and that's one of the
big<00:03:13.500> things<00:03:13.680> we<00:03:13.830> were<00:03:13.920> kind<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.130> looking<00:03:14.280> at

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
big things we were kind of looking at

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.120 
big things we were kind of looking at
coming<00:03:15.239> into<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.630> series<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.110> we<00:03:16.260> knew<00:03:16.530> enemy

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
coming into this series is we knew enemy

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.370 
coming into this series is we knew enemy
was<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.060> dominant<00:03:18.360> during<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.049> regular

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
was so dominant during the regular

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.110 
was so dominant during the regular
season<00:03:19.530> but<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.250> was<00:03:20.489> actually<00:03:20.670> thinking<00:03:20.850> it

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
season but I was actually thinking it

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.460 
season but I was actually thinking it
was<00:03:21.209> going<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.390> be<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.510> 30<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:22.110> were<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.350> one

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
was going to be a 30 you were the one

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.660 
was going to be a 30 you were the one
saying<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.860> was<00:03:22.980> going<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.160> be<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.280> much<00:03:23.459> closer

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
saying it was going to be a much closer

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.850 
saying it was going to be a much closer
series<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.299> it<00:03:24.720> was<00:03:24.930> actually<00:03:25.140> much<00:03:25.470> closer<00:03:25.709> i

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
series and it was actually much closer i

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.789 
series and it was actually much closer i
think<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.820> stage<00:03:27.239> presence<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.200> fact

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
think the stage presence and the fact

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.140 
think the stage presence and the fact
that<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.070> LCS<00:03:29.489> ball<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:29.850> on<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.030> line

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
that the LCS ball is on the line

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.910 
that the LCS ball is on the line
