quick where we can make this box but
really<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> Box<00:01:08.790> started<00:01:09.240> off<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.600> being<00:01:09.830> just

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
a flat sheet that we that we die-cut so

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.130 
a flat sheet that we that we die-cut so
as<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.340> see<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.729> looks<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.240> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
as you can see it looks like this and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.929 
as you can see it looks like this and
then<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.740> print<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.220> way<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.640> then

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
then we print it this way and then

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.840 
then we print it this way and then
die-cut<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.630> out<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.409> glue<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.729> that

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
die-cut it out and then glue it so that

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.570 
die-cut it out and then glue it so that
it<00:01:20.939> does<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.299> thing<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.369> fold

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it does this thing and then you can fold

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.499 
it does this thing and then you can fold
it<00:01:23.759> then<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.409> fold<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.799> into<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> box<00:01:26.509> so

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
it then you can fold it into a box so

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.969 
it then you can fold it into a box so
like<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.780> was<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.259> was<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> table

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
like this was a this was like a table

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.999 
like this was a this was like a table
ten<00:01:29.270> idea<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> customer<00:01:31.020> where<00:01:31.530> they<00:01:31.799> you

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.170 
we can put that you put like a tables or
whatever<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.890> totally<00:01:41.640> dimensional

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
whatever so totally dimensional

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.969 
whatever so totally dimensional
different<00:01:42.810> than<00:01:42.930> folders<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.500> still<00:01:43.710> really

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
different than folders but still really

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.179 
different than folders but still really
cool<00:01:44.390> die-cutting<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.689> great<00:01:46.079> way<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.619> come

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
cool die-cutting is a great way to come

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.359 
cool die-cutting is a great way to come
up<00:01:47.310> with<00:01:47.780> really<00:01:48.780> impactful<00:01:49.619> pieces<00:01:50.130> or

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
up with really impactful pieces or

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.460 
up with really impactful pieces or
pieces<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:51.060> impact<00:01:51.479> when<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.200> really

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
pieces that have impact when you really

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.600 
pieces that have impact when you really
need<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.950> stand<00:01:53.189> out<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.369> make<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.520> difference

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
need to stand out and make a difference

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.310 
need to stand out and make a difference
what<00:01:54.299> we'd<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.570> do<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.840> maybe<00:01:54.990> show<00:01:55.259> you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
what we'd like to do is maybe show you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.679 
what we'd like to do is maybe show you
how<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.890> whole<00:01:56.100> die<00:01:56.310> cut<00:01:56.549> process<00:01:56.969> works<00:01:57.180> come

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
how the whole die cut process works come

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:07.100 
how the whole die cut process works come
on<00:01:57.780> I'll<00:01:57.899> show<00:01:57.930> you

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.169 

so<00:02:08.110> die-cutting<00:02:08.619> really<00:02:09.429> like<00:02:09.580> I<00:02:09.729> said<00:02:10.000> is

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
so die-cutting really like I said is

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.120 
so die-cutting really like I said is
just<00:02:10.360> taking<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:10.720> flat<00:02:10.990> sheet<00:02:11.230> of<00:02:11.290> paper<00:02:11.500> and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
just taking a flat sheet of paper and

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.340 
just taking a flat sheet of paper and
cutting<00:02:12.459> slits<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:13.060> slots<00:02:13.390> into<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.319> now

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
cutting slits and slots into it so now

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.800 
cutting slits and slots into it so now
if<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.890> can<00:02:15.040> imagine<00:02:15.250> all<00:02:15.640> this<00:02:16.209> really<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.630> a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
if you can imagine all this really is a

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.110 
if you can imagine all this really is a
folder<00:02:17.260> let's<00:02:17.470> fall<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:18.630> die<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:21.459> with<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.819> few

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
folder let's fall and die so with a few

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.720 
folder let's fall and die so with a few
twists<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.720> turns<00:02:22.959> we<00:02:23.950> can<00:02:24.100> assemble<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.550> whole

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
twists and turns we can assemble a whole

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.210 
twists and turns we can assemble a whole
folder<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.660> looks<00:02:25.840> like<00:02:25.959> this<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.380> mean<00:02:26.709> we'll

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
folder that looks like this I mean we'll

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.770 
folder that looks like this I mean we'll
make<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.430> look<00:02:27.580> better<00:02:27.730> but<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.360> can<00:02:28.480> see<00:02:28.660> how

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
make it look better but you can see how

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.600 
make it look better but you can see how
the<00:02:28.840> die-cutting<00:02:29.319> works<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:30.190> make<00:02:30.340> blue

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
the die-cutting works to make blue

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.420 
the die-cutting works to make blue
strips<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.690> make<00:02:31.900> business<00:02:32.830> card<00:02:33.100> slots

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
strips and to make business card slots

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.030 
strips and to make business card slots
and<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:34.060> make<00:02:34.209> pamphlet<00:02:34.720> slots<00:02:35.019> that's<00:02:35.739> really

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
and to make pamphlet slots that's really

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.280 
and to make pamphlet slots that's really
the<00:02:36.160> simplest<00:02:36.580> way<00:02:36.940> that<00:02:36.970> die-cuts<00:02:37.630> work<00:02:37.840> but

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
the simplest way that die-cuts work but

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.050 
the simplest way that die-cuts work but
it<00:02:38.380> can<00:02:38.470> get<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.590> lot<00:02:38.830> more<00:02:39.040> fun<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.880> lot<00:02:40.030> more

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
it can get a lot more fun and a lot more

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:50.900 
it can get a lot more fun and a lot more
complex<00:02:40.720> after<00:02:40.930> that

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.490 

so<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.000> might<00:02:52.150> ask<00:02:52.360> yourself<00:02:52.540> what's<00:02:53.350> this

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
so you might ask yourself what's this

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.770 
so you might ask yourself what's this
dye<00:02:53.740> business<00:02:54.310> all<00:02:54.490> about<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:55.330> can<00:02:55.480> see<00:02:55.630> that

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
dye business all about you can see that

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.020 
dye business all about you can see that
we've<00:02:55.870> got<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.140> library<00:02:56.800> of<00:02:57.160> free<00:02:57.400> how

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
we've got this library of free how

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.170 
we've got this library of free how
fabricated<00:02:58.870> dyes<00:02:59.050> really<00:02:59.830> all<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.160> is<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.850> a

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
fabricated dyes really all it is is is a

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.290 
fabricated dyes really all it is is is a
series<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.900> wires<00:03:02.170> or<00:03:02.890> like<00:03:03.490> strips<00:03:03.940> of<00:03:04.150> metal

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
series of wires or like strips of metal

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.750 
series of wires or like strips of metal
that<00:03:04.990> will<00:03:05.200> cut<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.590> paper<00:03:05.740> actually<00:03:05.950> between

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
that will cut the paper actually between

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.970 
that will cut the paper actually between
these<00:03:07.000> little<00:03:07.270> rubber<00:03:07.420> nubs<00:03:07.870> it's<00:03:08.590> really

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
these little rubber nubs it's really

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.890 
these little rubber nubs it's really
actually<00:03:09.280> kind<00:03:09.490> of<00:03:09.580> sharp<00:03:09.850> this<00:03:10.450> will<00:03:10.630> be<00:03:10.750> the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
actually kind of sharp this will be the

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.140 
actually kind of sharp this will be the
shape<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.410> like<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:11.890> CD<00:03:12.400> case<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:12.910> kind<00:03:13.090> of

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
shape of like a CD case that kind of

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.750 
shape of like a CD case that kind of
folded<00:03:13.540> in<00:03:13.660> on<00:03:13.690> itself<00:03:14.070> but<00:03:15.070> we<00:03:15.190> keep<00:03:15.370> using<00:03:15.550> a

Department in the back that can if you
can<00:03:46.690> imagine<00:03:46.930> it<00:03:47.230> we<00:03:47.500> can<00:03:47.680> totally<00:03:48.130> build<00:03:48.310> it

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
can imagine it we can totally build it

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.360 
can imagine it we can totally build it
and<00:03:48.670> so<00:03:48.940> whether<00:03:49.090> we're<00:03:49.270> talking<00:03:49.390> about<00:03:49.630> the
