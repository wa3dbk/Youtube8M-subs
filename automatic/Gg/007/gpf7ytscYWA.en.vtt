00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:20.520
 Look there today, you're going to teach them how to do it. 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.460
 a milk box trinket box ok I 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.640
 I have here some boxes I've tac 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.520
 I cut it in my own indy dan 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.000
 It's so easy to be easier for me. 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:38.520
 so I'll do with 6 boxes of 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.210
 milk is either two in front two 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.059
 in the middle a little bit smaller 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.839
 I do not know if you can see it looks just gives 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:54.659
 problem difference alone right and two in 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:56.640
 Hey, chicken, look at this door, 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.109
 I'll be very useful, I'm very 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.359
 accumulated thing 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.809
 I need a long way to save 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.330
 It was then I'll show you how 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.390
 I chose the measure so you can too. 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.820
 choose yours, no problem 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.670
 but my difference here from a 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.150
 to the other is three fingers and 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.010
 So it's okay if you want to copy 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.440
 my measure is three in three 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.900
 fingers you go there and not cut 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.110
 You can also do with three 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.080
 boxes in this case one side plus one 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.160
 here or whatever, depending on your 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.290
 need 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.910
 here I am already cut off and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.740
 demonstrate with the next step to 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.740
 You're OK, so let's go. 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.790
 Good staff, the little boxes are already 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:53.610
 Looks like you can see 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:56.580
 me I used hot glue and with 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.010
 abrate catar because I thought that 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.910
 would make it much firmer as it really 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.530
 left then the two speak quite a beautiful 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.590
 let's say so 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.110
 so it looks ok, it's okay, now I 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.810
 I'll hit the tips of her is to 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.220
 one that is very similar to the other 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.560
 We'll cover with the event later. 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.910
 here they are 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.220
 first people 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.580
 hit equal told us she charges 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.820
 for total and then we will paste wool 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.770
 together it's okay so let's do it first 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.950
 step by step at a time 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.460
 so come on good people will teach 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.430
 you now is to cover to see the 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.090
 milk carton is this crown that 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.010
 I chose and I decided to do the 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.960
 for each level 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.640
 a different color here I already have 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.890
 ready the white neckel of the middle looks only 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.630
 here the smallest I have a yellow 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.430
 which is already done below and I 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.590
 I'll show you how the lame will do. 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.690
 which is one in the larger case ta 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.490
 The first thing we'll do is 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:18.300
 in the bag 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:24.440
 macca kicks white glue across the area 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:27.090
 her on as much as possible and we will 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.400
 put here on top of seeing her always 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.550
 leaving on the very edge of those amendments 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.530
 your side of all speakers 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:44.600
 leaving always a little here too 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.600
 so be able to chat in and tighten it 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.090
 We'll take advantage of it. 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.900
 deitadinha going on the side just looks 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:00.150
 I brought it with you to show you 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.130
 of the event via get look I only do 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.670
 here is a problem that I feel more 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:10.380
 Easy is only you want you can 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.450
 enjoy and spend is a brush too 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.250
 to spread even better 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.760
 but in my case I think it will not 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:22.230
 we need to come and pull it 's for 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:27.419
 hit the collar in case it stops at 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:31.380
 up power when straight and pulling 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.050
 the event does not have space left in the brevÃ© 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.440
 The 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.389
 hello well and good yields in the case 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.460
 and so we do with the rest 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:43.960
 Okay, come on then. 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.539
 Good people, look, soy is stuck, and the 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.520

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.349

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.520
 will not liner in to stay 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.590
 ugly okay 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.449
 what we will do all corner 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.669
 Have a nice day, shall we? 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.889
 Quinzinho to be able to cut and paste 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.930
 inside or in each vain people do not 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.639
 eg 15 to be able to get well 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.639
 Look, I'll just show you how it goes. 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:13.000
 you can take advantage of 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.669
 if this little thing here and O which upon 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.300
 to not be looking like this is going to 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:22.330
 stay like this and it will not get so ugly 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:27.000
 It's up to you, it's not just 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.000
 cut 25 that will not appear 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.760
 Look, the bottom looks pretty ugly, but 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:40.560
 No problem, why do we go? 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:43.450
 support him in a cardboard box in case 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.850
 a hardcover notebook I found 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.970
 old played outside and at home 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:53.890

 I 'd rather not get amended then. 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.960
 I cut inside, it's okay. 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.510
 because it will not show up since we 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.280
 will use to put great things 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.940

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.180

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.280
 then more will appear outside 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.250
 explained the result is now the people 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:23.050
 will join us 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:29.470

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.920
 Now we'll finish it. 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.260

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:40.900

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.870
 Later to make it much cooler, I 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.090
 I'm going to wear a red ribbon on 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.890
 Back to make it look pretty. 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.980
 so now I'm going to cut into the size of 

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.390
 cover and then just glue with white glue 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.960
 fine 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.640
