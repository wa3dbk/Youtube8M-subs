00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:56.999 
this time you're going to see it doesn't

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:59.359 
this time you're going to see it doesn't

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
look that great because there's one more

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.239 
look that great because there's one more
thing<00:01:59.549> we<00:01:59.700> have<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.969> do<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:01.740> looks<00:02:01.920> great<00:02:02.189> on

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249 
thing we have to do it looks great on

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:03.919 
thing we have to do it looks great on
the<00:02:02.429> first<00:02:02.670> run<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.030> then<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.389> see<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.780> this

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
the first run but then you see that this

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.929 
the first run but then you see that this
is<00:02:03.990> white<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.709> this<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.889> why<00:02:05.189> it's<00:02:05.639> supposed

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
is white and this is why it's supposed

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.900 
is white and this is why it's supposed
to<00:02:05.999> be<00:02:06.149> dark<00:02:06.359> right<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:08.160> what<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.550> going<00:02:08.789> on

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
to be dark right so what is going on

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.460 
to be dark right so what is going on
with<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:12.480> reason<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.170> looking

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
with that the reason that it is looking

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.890 
with that the reason that it is looking
like<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.920> not<00:02:14.670> completely<00:02:15.240> dark<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.600> because

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
like this not completely dark is because

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.449 
like this not completely dark is because
there's<00:02:16.050> one<00:02:16.230> more<00:02:16.350> thing<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.590> have<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.950> do<00:02:17.100> so

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
there's one more thing you have to do so

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.170

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
that everything is dark the way it's

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.270 
that everything is dark the way it's
supposed<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.650> be<00:02:40.829> there's<00:02:41.310> no<00:02:41.489> white<00:02:42.200> areas

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
supposed to be there's no white areas

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.069 
supposed to be there's no white areas
however<00:02:44.280> look<00:02:45.090> on<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.390> right<00:02:45.540> side<00:02:45.810> if<00:02:45.989> you

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
however look on the right side if you

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.080 
however look on the right side if you
see<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.379> modules<00:02:46.769> are<00:02:46.980> still<00:02:47.280> kind<00:02:47.849> of<00:02:47.940> light

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
see the modules are still kind of light

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.330 
see the modules are still kind of light
and<00:02:48.230> probably<00:02:49.230> that's<00:02:49.379> not<00:02:49.500> exactly<00:02:49.890> what<00:02:50.190> you

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
and probably that's not exactly what you

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.270 
and probably that's not exactly what you
want<00:02:50.549> if<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:51.060> have<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.299> dark<00:02:51.720> theme<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:53.010> what

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
want if you have a dark theme so what

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.830 
want if you have a dark theme so what
you<00:02:53.370> want<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.549> do<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.849> want<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.090> open<00:02:54.180> each<00:02:54.569> one

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
you want to do you want to open each one

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.140 
you want to do you want to open each one
of<00:02:54.959> these<00:02:55.079> modules<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.890> change<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.940> module

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
of these modules and change the module

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.559 
of these modules and change the module
suffix<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:58.170> something<00:02:59.129> that<00:02:59.159> is<00:02:59.609> dark<00:02:59.909> so

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
suffix to something that is dark so

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.699 
suffix to something that is dark so
let's<00:03:00.780> take<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.959> look<00:03:01.170> if<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.409> look<00:03:01.560> at

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
let's take a look if you look at

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:09.110 
let's take a look if you look at
Explorer<00:03:02.750> module<00:03:04.040> variations<00:03:07.819> you<00:03:08.819> can<00:03:08.849> see

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
Explorer module variations you can see

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.640 
Explorer module variations you can see
that<00:03:09.239> we<00:03:09.359> have<00:03:09.510> quite<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.840> few<00:03:09.930> we<00:03:10.230> have<00:03:10.379> in<00:03:10.470> fact

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
that we have quite a few we have in fact

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.899 
that we have quite a few we have in fact
four<00:03:11.069> really<00:03:11.760> dark<00:03:12.180> in<00:03:13.079> module<00:03:13.769> suffix<00:03:14.609> we

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
four really dark in module suffix we

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.319 
four really dark in module suffix we
have<00:03:15.379> three<00:03:16.379> four<00:03:16.950> seven<00:03:17.489> and<00:03:17.579> eight<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:18.299> can

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
have three four seven and eight you can

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.520 
have three four seven and eight you can
use<00:03:18.720> any<00:03:19.049> of<00:03:19.290> those<00:03:19.530> in<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.459> module<00:03:20.790> suffix

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
use any of those in the module suffix

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.890 
use any of those in the module suffix
field<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:23.430> module<00:03:23.819> and<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.569> will<00:03:24.750> look

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
field of the module and it will look

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.140 
field of the module and it will look
perfect<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.329> it<00:03:27.510> how<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.930> change<00:03:28.349> the

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
perfect so this is it how you change the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.400 
perfect so this is it how you change the
theme<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.419> socialize<00:03:31.410> thanks<00:03:31.949> for<00:03:32.069> watching
