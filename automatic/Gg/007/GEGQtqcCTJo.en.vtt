00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
that we don't like and let each other be

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.020 
that we don't like and let each other be
lazy<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.409> only<00:01:48.679> times<00:01:48.920> we're<00:01:49.310> lazy<00:01:49.610> is<00:01:49.880> it

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
lazy the only times we're lazy is it

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.059 
lazy the only times we're lazy is it
both<00:01:50.450> of<00:01:50.479> us<00:01:50.869> feel<00:01:51.109> like<00:01:51.140> being<00:01:51.530> lazy<00:01:51.740> which

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
both of us feel like being lazy which

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.160 
both of us feel like being lazy which
isn't<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.490> often<00:01:52.909> so<00:01:53.659> we<00:01:53.750> just<00:01:53.869> kind<00:01:54.109> of

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
isn't that often so we just kind of

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.809 
isn't that often so we just kind of
keeps<00:01:54.590> other<00:01:54.829> motivated<00:01:55.189> but<00:01:55.399> I<00:01:55.429> think<00:01:55.700> the

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
keeps other motivated but I think the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.969 
keeps other motivated but I think the
key<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.060> staying<00:01:56.450> motivated<00:01:56.840> or<00:01:57.319> ever<00:01:57.500> is<00:01:57.709> find

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
key to staying motivated or ever is find

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.370 
key to staying motivated or ever is find

mean I think it can taste good but
personally<00:02:29.299> you<00:02:29.420> shouldn't<00:02:29.720> need<00:02:29.840> something

our beliefs on people I feel like people

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.310 
our beliefs on people I feel like people
just<00:04:21.850> kind<00:04:22.060> of<00:04:22.090> like<00:04:22.150> gravitate<00:04:22.780> towards<00:04:23.200> us

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
just kind of like gravitate towards us

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.710 
just kind of like gravitate towards us
and<00:04:23.470> what<00:04:23.590> we<00:04:23.710> do<00:04:23.830> because<00:04:24.160> they<00:04:24.970> think<00:04:25.030> oh<00:04:25.540> my

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
and what we do because they think oh my

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.150 
and what we do because they think oh my
gosh<00:04:25.870> you<00:04:26.080> know<00:04:26.169> they<00:04:26.320> look<00:04:26.500> so<00:04:26.680> happy<00:04:26.980> so<00:04:27.130> I

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
gosh you know they look so happy so I

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.220 
gosh you know they look so happy so I
feel<00:04:27.370> like<00:04:27.460> if<00:04:27.580> you<00:04:27.730> lead<00:04:28.030> by<00:04:28.270> example<00:04:28.419> people

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
feel like if you lead by example people

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.440 
feel like if you lead by example people
who<00:04:29.290> want<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:29.620> fall<00:04:29.800> they<00:04:30.550> respond<00:04:31.120> better

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
who want to fall they respond better

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.050 
who want to fall they respond better
yeah<00:04:31.960> I<00:04:32.260> think<00:04:32.320> that<00:04:32.680> if<00:04:32.770> you<00:04:32.919> come<00:04:33.520> at<00:04:33.700> someone

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
yeah I think that if you come at someone

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.480 
yeah I think that if you come at someone
like<00:04:34.240> in<00:04:34.270> an<00:04:34.510> attacking<00:04:35.140> way<00:04:35.500> no<00:04:35.980> one<00:04:36.100> responds

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
like in an attacking way no one responds

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.070 
like in an attacking way no one responds

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
question asked a few times so I think

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.690 
question asked a few times so I think
the<00:05:01.900> key<00:05:02.110> to<00:05:02.169> natural<00:05:02.740> long<00:05:02.980> healthy<00:05:03.280> hair<00:05:03.520> is

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
the key to natural long healthy hair is

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.180 
the key to natural long healthy hair is
to<00:05:03.910> not<00:05:04.150> style<00:05:04.600> it<00:05:04.780> a<00:05:04.840> lot<00:05:05.080> because<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:05.950> heat

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
to not style it a lot because the heat

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.260 
to not style it a lot because the heat
is<00:05:06.490> damaging<00:05:07.120> we<00:05:07.270> didn't<00:05:07.480> style<00:05:07.720> it<00:05:07.840> today

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
is damaging we didn't style it today

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.940 
is damaging we didn't style it today
is<00:05:08.360> we<00:05:08.510> had<00:05:08.630> an<00:05:08.750> audition<00:05:09.050> but<00:05:09.440> we<00:05:09.590> generally

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
is we had an audition but we generally

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.890 
is we had an audition but we generally
try<00:05:10.460> to<00:05:10.520> stay<00:05:10.760> away<00:05:10.940> from<00:05:10.970> heat

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
try to stay away from heat

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.780 
try to stay away from heat
I<00:05:11.930> think<00:05:12.290> genetics<00:05:12.590> play<00:05:12.890> a<00:05:12.920> big<00:05:13.130> role<00:05:13.370> of<00:05:13.520> how

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790
