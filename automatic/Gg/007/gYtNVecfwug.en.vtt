00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
about 12 or 13 years ago but it was

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.450 
about 12 or 13 years ago but it was
really<00:00:30.480> only<00:00:30.810> when<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.109> left<00:00:31.410> my<00:00:31.650> big<00:00:31.920> corporate

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
really only when I left my big corporate

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.630 
really only when I left my big corporate
job<00:00:32.660> where<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> didn't<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.920> dress<00:00:35.219> to

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640

represent<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.329> company<00:00:36.960> anymore<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.219> was

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
represent that company anymore but I was

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.190 
represent that company anymore but I was
offered<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> opportunity<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.690> think<00:00:39.840> about

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
offered the opportunity to think about

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.360 
offered the opportunity to think about
Who<00:00:40.890> am<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.610> how<00:00:42.090> does<00:00:42.149> my<00:00:42.870> clothing

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
Who am I and how does my clothing

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.880 
Who am I and how does my clothing
express<00:00:44.370> something<00:00:44.899> about<00:00:45.899> Who<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.260> am<00:00:46.410> and

express something about Who I am and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.709 
express something about Who I am and
this<00:00:47.039> whole<00:00:47.280> idea<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.940> signature<00:00:48.329> style

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
this whole idea of a signature style

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.690 
this whole idea of a signature style
started<00:00:49.680> should<00:00:49.980> become<00:00:50.309> much<00:00:50.489> more

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
started should become much more

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.760 
started should become much more
interesting<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.539> me<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.500> was<00:00:52.620> also

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.010 
interesting to me and and I was also
given<00:00:53.219> some<00:00:53.370> advice<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.969> because<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.660> have

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.759 
and that that double look it's not
enough<00:03:30.970> it's<00:03:31.209> still<00:03:31.269> not<00:03:31.630> enough<00:03:31.959> and<00:03:32.290> even

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
enough it's still not enough and even

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.220 
enough it's still not enough and even
when<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.310> put<00:03:33.549> two<00:03:33.760> of<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.150> same<00:03:34.180> on<00:03:34.630> and<00:03:35.109> I

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
when I put two of the same on and I

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.069 
when I put two of the same on and I
double<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:35.739> again<00:03:36.209> it's<00:03:37.209> still<00:03:37.630> not<00:03:37.870> enough

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
double it again it's still not enough

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.440 
double it again it's still not enough
for<00:03:38.139> me<00:03:38.410> so<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.040> realized<00:03:39.459> I<00:03:39.760> actually<00:03:39.880> needed

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
for me so I realized I actually needed

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.449 
for me so I realized I actually needed
for<00:03:41.019> necklaces<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:41.889> then<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.130> got<00:03:42.250> some

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
for necklaces so then I got some

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.979 
for necklaces so then I got some
different<00:03:42.790> sorts<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:44.260> go<00:03:44.440> with<00:03:45.569> to<00:03:46.569> actually

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
different sorts it go with to actually

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.890 
different sorts it go with to actually
start<00:03:47.290> creating<00:03:47.440> enough<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:49.000> take<00:03:49.239> up<00:03:49.419> space

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
start creating enough to take up space

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.740 
start creating enough to take up space
that<00:03:50.319> suits<00:03:50.950> me<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.459> that<00:03:52.030> feels<00:03:52.060> large

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
that suits me and that feels large

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.659 
that suits me and that feels large
enough<00:03:53.109> so<00:03:53.500> that<00:03:53.530> they<00:03:53.889> become<00:03:54.250> a<00:03:54.310> distraction

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
enough so that they become a distraction

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.339 
enough so that they become a distraction
rather<00:03:55.090> than<00:03:55.209> my<00:03:55.299> breasts<00:03:55.780> becoming<00:03:56.200> the

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
rather than my breasts becoming the

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.319 
rather than my breasts becoming the
descriptions<00:03:56.829> because<00:03:57.160> I<00:03:57.579> used<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.060> find<00:03:58.239> the

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.830 
because I'm wearing in their class you
had<00:04:36.220> me<00:04:36.400> put<00:04:36.610> your<00:04:36.790> makeup<00:04:37.180> on<00:04:37.330> for<00:04:37.390> the<00:04:37.660> day

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
had me put your makeup on for the day

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.390 
had me put your makeup on for the day
but<00:04:38.380> because<00:04:38.770> you<00:04:38.950> had<00:04:39.070> your<00:04:39.100> signature

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
but because you had your signature

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.210 
but because you had your signature
necklace<00:04:39.970> on<00:04:40.150> you<00:04:40.570> look<00:04:40.810> dressed<00:04:41.650> for<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.070> day

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.310 
yes
so<00:04:43.270> I<00:04:43.300> think<00:04:43.510> it's<00:04:43.690> really<00:04:43.930> important<00:04:44.290> to

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
so I think it's really important to

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.480 
so I think it's really important to
start<00:04:44.590> figuring<00:04:44.800> out<00:04:44.950> what<00:04:45.130> are<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:45.280> things

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
start figuring out what are the things

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.700 
start figuring out what are the things
you<00:04:45.670> love<00:04:45.850> what<00:04:46.270> really<00:04:46.570> works<00:04:47.080> for<00:04:47.290> your<00:04:47.530> body

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
you love what really works for your body

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.310 
you love what really works for your body
your<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.730> know<00:04:48.820> your<00:04:49.030> skin<00:04:49.330> your<00:04:49.720> texture

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
your you know your skin your texture

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.870 
your you know your skin your texture
your<00:04:50.500> show<00:04:50.710> you<00:04:50.770> all<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.280> things<00:04:51.340> that<00:04:51.640> go

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
your show you all the things that go

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.330 
your show you all the things that go
into<00:04:51.910> making<00:04:52.630> you<00:04:53.140> know<00:04:53.260> you<00:04:53.590> work<00:04:53.950> you<00:04:54.190> need

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
into making you know you work you need

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.190 
into making you know you work you need
so<00:04:54.490> for<00:04:54.730> some<00:04:54.880> people<00:04:54.910> it's<00:04:55.240> a<00:04:55.330> color<00:04:55.570> yes<00:04:55.990> so

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
so for some people it's a color yes so

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.410 
so for some people it's a color yes so
I'd<00:04:56.320> say<00:04:56.500> be<00:04:56.680> very<00:04:57.010> careful<00:04:57.670> about<00:04:57.730> going<00:04:58.090> head

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
I'd say be very careful about going head

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.600 
I'd say be very careful about going head
