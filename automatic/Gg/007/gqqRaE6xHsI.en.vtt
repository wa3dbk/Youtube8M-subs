00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:09.020
 but look straight ahead is the question there 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:12.200
 is the oblique one that is already showing is 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.900
 very posed those healthy dead is that 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.120
 chiringays was that to me I tell you the 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.740
 I really had a long discussion with 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.620
 rifle and that the video is smooth to say 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.090
 He was actually healthier than her in 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.520
 instead of being addicted to the reel now 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.560
 addicted to having this body look at the 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.300
 legs by famous vigorexia the level 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.740
 of fat is very low it can eventually 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.719
 be vigorexia keep in mind that already 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.609
 use implant then it shows much more 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.870
 plump what is really for the 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:37.460
 body fat amount that really 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.649
 has if I did not have the implants the 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.629
 we would really see no way 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.129
 exactly and I am worried in fact about 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.960
 jim group also bikini fashion 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.239
 richard because they are all mixed 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.129
 they emerged as urban jokes and that 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.359
 the girls start to follow now from 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.039
 somehow because these models 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.600
 obviously they encourage anorexia by 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.129
 example I'm not saying it's worth 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.510
 anorexia but probably has several 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.100
 indications of an eating disorder 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.359
 important and the issue of excess 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.979
 exercise in this case already be with 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.220
 excess because somehow it's not a 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:07.820
 normal body of a woman 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.820
 as in stages 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.810
 obsessive and excessive is the impression 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.630
 within adolescence I believe as 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.760
 who becomes obsessed with this type of 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.860
 things and finally clear that that's why it's 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.820
 dangerous 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.470
 the problem on the right you know 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.080
 qualities are between 10 and 19 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.520
 years and since 2000 since 2008 in 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.710
 forward increased almost 100 percent 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.050
 the number of people with disorders 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.800
 of anorexia in these ages then what 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.600
 is what happens 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.040
 effectively this is associated with a 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.780
 Beauty model we are 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.520
 institutionalizing for example that of the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.920
 part you know that a boat and real 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.020
 it would be impossible to have the whole neck 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.550
 of a normal woman and would have the leather 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.590
 formal of the tender and the human being 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.360
 impossible now that roth vale body 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.660
 is not achieved with diet and exercise is 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.660
 nothing else 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.780
 anabolic but I also think that something 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.780
 more that photo 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.289
 but her own
