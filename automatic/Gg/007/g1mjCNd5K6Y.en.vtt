00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
this because this can't fit in 96

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.440 
this because this can't fit in 96
however<00:00:27.110> I<00:00:27.140> do<00:00:27.260> have<00:00:27.380> a<00:00:27.530> 96<00:00:28.130> stick<00:00:29.000> type<00:00:29.240> that

so with that said let's go ahead and see
how<00:00:53.780> harvesting<00:00:54.290> shoot

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.230 

all<00:01:05.019> right<00:01:05.199> so<00:01:05.640> feet-per-second<00:01:06.640> first<00:01:06.850> again

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
all right so feet-per-second first again

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.090 
all right so feet-per-second first again
this<00:01:07.450> is<00:01:07.600> only<00:01:07.840> using<00:01:08.439> an<00:01:08.590> eight<00:01:08.740> point<00:01:08.979> four

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
this is only using an eight point four

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.859 
this is only using an eight point four
volt<00:01:09.340> battery<00:01:09.640> and<00:01:09.909> point<00:01:10.360> two<00:01:10.630> grandbabies

volt battery and point two grandbabies

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.319 
volt battery and point two grandbabies
so<00:01:13.869> semi-automatic<00:01:14.820> heat<00:01:15.820> four<00:01:16.000> seconds

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
three six three three six nine so it's

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.350 
three six three three six nine so it's
safe<00:01:59.010> to<00:01:59.040> say<00:01:59.190> this<00:01:59.460> thing's<00:01:59.670> shooting<00:01:59.970> in<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
safe to say this thing's shooting in the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.740 
safe to say this thing's shooting in the
370<00:02:01.140> range<00:02:01.440> so<00:02:01.740> it'll<00:02:02.040> fluctuate<00:02:02.190> between<00:02:02.750> 370

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
370 range so it'll fluctuate between 370

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.480 
370 range so it'll fluctuate between 370
to<00:02:03.870> 380<00:02:04.110> feet<00:02:04.440> per<00:02:04.650> second<00:02:05.010> in<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.130> few<00:02:05.280> shots

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
to 380 feet per second in a few shots

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.000 
to 380 feet per second in a few shots
about<00:02:05.820> 365<00:02:06.300> so<00:02:06.930> 370<00:02:07.470> feet<00:02:07.590> per<00:02:07.680> second<00:02:07.980> which

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
about 365 so 370 feet per second which

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.070 
about 365 so 370 feet per second which
is<00:02:08.100> definitely<00:02:08.550> respectable<00:02:09.180> it's<00:02:09.840> about

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
is definitely respectable it's about

you<00:02:18.750> have<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.990> lower<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.380> spring<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.550> a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
you have to lower the the spring just a

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.880 
you have to lower the the spring just a
little<00:02:21.120> bit<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.360> make<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.570> you<00:02:21.690> 330<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:22.560> again

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
little bit to make it you 330 but again

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.930 
little bit to make it you 330 but again
this<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.160> gun<00:02:23.310> you're<00:02:23.430> gonna<00:02:23.520> want<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.820> be

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
this is a gun you're gonna want to be

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.160 
this is a gun you're gonna want to be
using<00:02:24.210> in<00:02:24.330> woodland<00:02:24.780> this<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.020> not

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
using in woodland this is not

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.290 
using in woodland this is not
necessarily<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.710> CQB<00:02:26.280> gun<00:02:26.460> however<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:27.180> you'd

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
necessarily a CQB gun however if you'd

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.360 
necessarily a CQB gun however if you'd
hold<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.600> stock<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.020> can<00:02:28.230> use<00:02:28.290> in<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.680> CQB<00:02:29.100> but

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
hold the stock you can use in a CQB but

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.010 
hold the stock you can use in a CQB but
again<00:02:29.760> you'll<00:02:30.180> have<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.390> lower<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.690> spring<00:02:30.870> if

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
again you'll have to lower the spring if

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.830 
again you'll have to lower the spring if
you<00:02:31.050> want<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.320> do<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:32.730> let's<00:02:33.450> go<00:02:33.570> full

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
you want to do that so let's go full

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.090 
you want to do that so let's go full
auto<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.470> rounds<00:02:34.860> per<00:02:35.010> minute<00:02:35.130> now<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:37.100> rpm

six<00:03:12.980> sixty<00:03:13.220> okay<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:13.550> maybe<00:03:13.880> it<00:03:14.090> is<00:03:14.240> just

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
six sixty okay so maybe it is just

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.340 
six sixty okay so maybe it is just
incredibly<00:03:16.360> what's<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.480> word<00:03:17.630> incredibly

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
incredibly what's the word incredibly

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.550 
incredibly what's the word incredibly
consistent<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.570> same<00:03:20.780> seems<00:03:21.080> we<00:03:21.230> shooting

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
consistent so the same seems we shooting

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.740 
consistent so the same seems we shooting
around<00:03:22.130> six<00:03:22.580> hundred<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:23.000> seventy<00:03:23.240> feet<00:03:23.600> per

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
around six hundred and seventy feet per

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.580 
around six hundred and seventy feet per
second<00:03:24.850> very<00:03:25.850> very<00:03:26.000> consistently<00:03:26.540> all<00:03:27.440> right

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
second very very consistently all right

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.900 
second very very consistently all right
now<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.890> was<00:03:28.010> only<00:03:28.280> with<00:03:28.430> an<00:03:28.550> eight<00:03:28.670> point

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
now that was only with an eight point

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.790 
now that was only with an eight point
four<00:03:29.330> volt<00:03:29.720> battery<00:03:30.080> now<00:03:30.290> we're<00:03:30.440> going<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.680> be

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
four volt battery now we're going to be

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.250 
four volt battery now we're going to be
putting<00:03:31.100> in<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.540> 9.6<00:03:32.540> volt<00:03:32.600> battery<00:03:33.020> and

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
putting in the 9.6 volt battery and

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.680 
putting in the 9.6 volt battery and
let's<00:03:33.830> see<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.160> rate<00:03:34.340> of<00:03:34.430> fire<00:03:34.550> now<00:03:34.730> now<00:03:35.420> again

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
let's see the rate of fire now now again

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.090 
let's see the rate of fire now now again
the<00:03:35.810> reason<00:03:35.840> I<00:03:36.170> am<00:03:36.290> doing<00:03:36.320> this<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:36.890> because

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
the reason I am doing this is because

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.220 
the reason I am doing this is because
you<00:03:37.550> can't<00:03:37.790> fit<00:03:38.000> a<00:03:38.030> 9.6<00:03:38.660> volt<00:03:38.720> stick<00:03:39.080> type

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
you can't fit a 9.6 volt stick type

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.230 
you can't fit a 9.6 volt stick type
however<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.620> can<00:03:39.860> put<00:03:40.160> fit<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.460> seven<00:03:40.880> point<00:03:40.970> or

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
however you can put fit a seven point or

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.510 
however you can put fit a seven point or
volt<00:03:41.480> lipo<00:03:41.900> battery<00:03:42.290> in<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:43.010> gun<00:03:43.190> which<00:03:43.370> will

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
volt lipo battery in this gun which will

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
volt lipo battery in this gun which will
give<00:03:43.670> you<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.820> same<00:03:43.970> performance<00:03:44.210> as<00:03:44.510> a

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
give you the same performance as a

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.030 
give you the same performance as a
ninety<00:03:44.870> six<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:45.560> I<00:03:45.800> would<00:03:45.920> actually

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
ninety six and I would actually

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.830 
ninety six and I would actually
recommend<00:03:46.310> going<00:03:46.820> ahead<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.300> doing<00:03:47.390> that

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
recommend going ahead and doing that

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.740 
recommend going ahead and doing that
however<00:03:48.290> my<00:03:48.920> seven<00:03:49.250> four<00:03:49.430> will<00:03:50.000> killed<00:03:50.390> itself

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
however my seven four will killed itself

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.350 
however my seven four will killed itself
so<00:03:51.050> I'm<00:03:51.410> going<00:03:51.770> to<00:03:51.890> have<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.250> use<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:52.880> nine<00:03:53.060> six

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
so I'm going to have to use the nine six

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.060 
so I'm going to have to use the nine six
stick<00:03:53.600> type<00:03:53.810> which<00:03:54.410> doesn't<00:03:54.710> fit<00:03:54.800> in<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:54.920> gun

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
stick type which doesn't fit in the gun

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.800 
stick type which doesn't fit in the gun
but<00:03:55.280> it<00:03:55.430> will<00:03:55.520> prove<00:03:55.940> its<00:03:56.120> purpose<00:03:56.510> for<00:03:56.720> this

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
but it will prove its purpose for this

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.470 
but it will prove its purpose for this
video<00:03:57.110> so<00:03:57.470> rounds<00:03:58.160> for<00:03:58.730> a<00:03:58.760> minute<00:03:58.970> full<00:03:59.240> auto

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
video so rounds for a minute full auto

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.310 
video so rounds for a minute full auto
9.6<00:04:00.230> volt<00:04:00.290> battery<00:04:00.740> I<00:04:04.510> can't<00:04:05.510> turn<00:04:05.780> off<00:04:05.840> just

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
9.6 volt battery I can't turn off just

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:15.470 
9.6 volt battery I can't turn off just
as<00:04:06.440> soon<00:04:06.650> as<00:04:06.740> I<00:04:06.830> want<00:04:06.980> to<00:04:07.010> shoot

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.010 

800<00:04:16.480> rounds<00:04:16.660> a<00:04:16.690> minute

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:31.980 

hey<00:04:23.040> 4890<00:04:25.980> hey<00:04:30.060> 5830<00:04:31.060> so<00:04:31.240> seems<00:04:31.540> to<00:04:31.600> be<00:04:31.690> around

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
hey 4890 hey 5830 so seems to be around

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.720 
hey 4890 hey 5830 so seems to be around
800<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:32.650> 900<00:04:32.800> rounds<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.400> minute<00:04:33.430> which<00:04:33.700> is

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
800 and 900 rounds a minute which is

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.000 
800 and 900 rounds a minute which is
actually<00:04:34.180> quite<00:04:34.330> a<00:04:34.450> bit<00:04:34.660> it's<00:04:35.500> just<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.680> little

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
actually quite a bit it's just a little

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.190 
actually quite a bit it's just a little
bit<00:04:36.100> above<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.430> usual<00:04:36.880> 4cy<00:04:37.600> maze<00:04:37.840> motors

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
bit above the usual 4cy maze motors

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.520 
bit above the usual 4cy maze motors
usually<00:04:38.710> see<00:04:38.890> why<00:04:39.010> a<00:04:39.040> maze<00:04:39.250> motors<00:04:39.610> only<00:04:40.030> shoot

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
usually see why a maze motors only shoot

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.800 
usually see why a maze motors only shoot
