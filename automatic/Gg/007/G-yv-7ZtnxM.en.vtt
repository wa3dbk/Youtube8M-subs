something that's going to retain the
even

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
even

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.690 
even
and<00:01:37.930> that's<00:01:38.110> gonna<00:01:38.230> be<00:01:38.320> mostly<00:01:39.040> your<00:01:39.220> man-made

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
and that's gonna be mostly your man-made

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.790 
and that's gonna be mostly your man-made
structures<00:01:40.300> but<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.320> can<00:01:41.470> have<00:01:41.620> rocks<00:01:41.920> riprap

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
structures but you can have rocks riprap

retain<00:01:52.960> heat<00:01:53.290> even<00:01:53.740> vegetation<00:01:54.430> mats<00:01:54.790> of

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
retain heat even vegetation mats of

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.350 
retain heat even vegetation mats of
vegetation<00:01:55.620> dark<00:01:56.620> color<00:01:56.920> it<00:01:57.760> helps<00:01:58.120> to<00:01:58.210> retain

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
vegetation dark color it helps to retain

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.840 
vegetation dark color it helps to retain
heat<00:01:58.870> so<00:01:59.200> fast<00:01:59.680> we're<00:01:59.890> gonna<00:01:59.979> go<00:02:00.430> to<00:02:00.490> that

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
heat so fast we're gonna go to that

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.960 
heat so fast we're gonna go to that
you're<00:02:01.660> gonna<00:02:01.920> absorb<00:02:02.920> that<00:02:03.250> warm<00:02:03.550> to<00:02:03.760> learner

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
you're gonna absorb that warm to learner
