00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
was that I was playing in a straight

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:46.979 
was that I was playing in a straight
position<00:00:39.460> so<00:00:40.460> I<00:00:40.490> was<00:00:40.940> using<00:00:41.120> ad<00:00:42.050> harmonica<00:00:43.870> and

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.760 

if<00:00:47.989> I<00:00:48.200> blow<00:00:48.440> on<00:00:48.470> the<00:00:48.650> bottom<00:00:48.890> hole<00:00:50.410> that's<00:00:51.410> a<00:00:51.559> D

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
if I blow on the bottom hole that's a D

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.510 
if I blow on the bottom hole that's a D
and<00:00:52.510> if<00:00:53.510> I've<00:00:53.660> got<00:00:53.840> a<00:00:53.870> cord<00:00:54.110> on<00:00:54.230> that<00:00:54.520> using

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
and if I've got a cord on that using

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.570 
and if I've got a cord on that using
that<00:00:55.760> it's<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:56.390> root<00:00:56.540> of<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.750> chord<00:00:57.400> that's<00:00:58.400> a

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
that it's the root of the chord that's a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.150 
that it's the root of the chord that's a
D<00:00:58.730> chord<00:00:58.970> you<00:00:59.570> can<00:00:59.720> hear<00:01:00.020> that<00:01:00.590> I<00:01:00.620> was<00:01:00.860> playing

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
D chord you can hear that I was playing

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.479 
D chord you can hear that I was playing
in<00:01:01.550> that<00:01:01.610> particular<00:01:02.300> key<00:01:03.250> blues<00:01:04.250> players

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
in that particular key blues players

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.170 
in that particular key blues players
don't<00:01:04.900> play<00:01:05.900> that<00:01:06.140> way<00:01:06.290> they<00:01:06.560> play<00:01:06.830> in

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
don't play that way they play in

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
don't play that way they play in
different<00:01:08.180> positions<00:01:08.810> there<00:01:09.020> are<00:01:09.110> a<00:01:09.140> number

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
different positions there are a number

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.140 
different positions there are a number
of<00:01:09.530> them<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.800> most<00:01:09.950> popular<00:01:10.430> of<00:01:10.520> which<00:01:10.550> is

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
of them the most popular of which is

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.870 
of them the most popular of which is
called<00:01:11.480> Cross<00:01:11.750> Keys<00:01:11.960> second<00:01:12.380> position<00:01:12.880> so

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
called Cross Keys second position so

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:26.719 
called Cross Keys second position so
this<00:01:14.000> here<00:01:14.270> are<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.450> rid<00:01:14.600> of<00:01:14.720> that<00:01:14.900> now

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.399 

so<00:01:27.729> why<00:01:27.850> does<00:01:27.999> the<00:01:28.090> second<00:01:28.450> clip<00:01:28.630> sound<00:01:29.020> so

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
so why does the second clip sound so

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.969 
so why does the second clip sound so
different<00:01:29.679> well<00:01:30.640> in<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.819> first<00:01:30.969> clip<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
different well in the first clip the

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.309 
different well in the first clip the
cord<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.520> sets<00:01:33.789> the<00:01:33.939> key<00:01:34.179> is<00:01:34.479> produced<00:01:35.109> by

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
cord that sets the key is produced by

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:40.620 
cord that sets the key is produced by
blood<00:01:35.679> on<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.280> bottom<00:01:36.429> few<00:01:36.700> holes<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
blood on the bottom few holes and the

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.039 
blood on the bottom few holes and the
key<00:01:41.340> set<00:01:42.340> by<00:01:42.520> that<00:01:42.549> cord<00:01:43.030> as<00:01:43.929> I<00:01:43.959> said<00:01:44.409> was<00:01:45.009> D

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
key set by that cord as I said was D

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.010 
key set by that cord as I said was D
that<00:01:47.049> note<00:01:47.289> there<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.700> second<00:01:49.060> clip<00:01:49.240> the

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
that note there and the second clip the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.319 
that note there and the second clip the
cord<00:01:50.259> that<00:01:50.469> sets<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:51.069> key<00:01:51.310> is<00:01:51.729> produced<00:01:52.149> by

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
cord that sets the key is produced by

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.569 
cord that sets the key is produced by
drawing<00:01:52.750> on<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:52.959> bottom<00:01:53.259> few<00:01:53.409> holes<00:01:53.619> and<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
drawing on the bottom few holes and the

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.630 
drawing on the bottom few holes and the
root<00:01:57.729> of<00:01:57.849> that<00:01:57.969> cord<00:01:58.329> and<00:01:58.689> therefore<00:01:59.429> the<00:02:00.429> key

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
root of that cord and therefore the key

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.300 
root of that cord and therefore the key
note<00:02:00.849> is<00:02:01.709> actually<00:02:02.709> a<00:02:04.679> and<00:02:05.679> that's<00:02:05.920> produced

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
note is actually a and that's produced

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.609 
note is actually a and that's produced
by<00:02:06.489> blowing<00:02:07.060> on<00:02:07.239> the<00:02:07.329> third<00:02:07.509> hole<00:02:07.719> or<00:02:08.019> drawing

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
by blowing on the third hole or drawing

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.869 
by blowing on the third hole or drawing
on<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:08.829> second<00:02:09.190> hole<00:02:11.519> so<00:02:12.519> there<00:02:12.640> are<00:02:12.730> two

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
on the second hole so there are two

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.789 
on the second hole so there are two
forms<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:14.819> key<00:02:15.819> note<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:16.799> second

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
forms of that key note in second

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.710 
forms of that key note in second
position<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:19.569> just<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:21.069> summarize<00:02:21.519> if<00:02:22.450> you're

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
position so just to summarize if you're

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.949 
position so just to summarize if you're
playing<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:23.379> straight<00:02:24.040> key<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.970> D<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.359> the

playing and straight key the D on the
instrument<00:02:26.530> there's<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.670> key<00:02:27.849> that<00:02:28.000> you're

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
instrument there's the key that you're

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.349 
instrument there's the key that you're
playing<00:02:28.390> in<00:02:28.599> but<00:02:29.530> for<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.310> D<00:02:30.579> harmonica<00:02:31.000> and

second position you're playing in the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.960 
second position you're playing in the
key<00:02:34.299> of<00:02:34.329> a<00:02:35.010> let's<00:02:36.010> look<00:02:36.160> at<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.310> situation<00:02:36.880> on

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
key of a let's look at the situation on

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.539 
key of a let's look at the situation on
the<00:02:37.000> piano<00:02:37.420> now<00:02:37.859> we<00:02:38.859> were<00:02:38.980> using<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.370> D

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
the piano now we were using a D

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.330 
the piano now we were using a D
harmonica<00:02:40.169> and<00:02:41.169> we<00:02:41.290> said<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.680> on<00:02:41.799> cross<00:02:42.040> key

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
harmonica and we said that on cross key

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.059 
harmonica and we said that on cross key
it<00:02:42.609> plays<00:02:42.970> an<00:02:45.569> a5<00:02:46.569> we<00:02:47.019> noticed<00:02:47.349> that<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.680> is<00:02:48.040> a

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
it plays an a5 we noticed that a is a

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.750 
it plays an a5 we noticed that a is a
fifth<00:02:48.489> above<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.870> D<00:02:50.049> and<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:51.099> is<00:02:51.160> true<00:02:51.549> for

fifth above the D and this is true for

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.000 
fifth above the D and this is true for
all<00:02:51.880> diatonic<00:02:52.510> harmonicas<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.590> key<00:02:53.739> on<00:02:53.889> the

plays an a let's have a look at some of
the<00:03:06.099> common<00:03:06.400> keys

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
the common keys

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.620 
the common keys
I<00:03:07.150> see<00:03:07.720> harmonica<00:03:08.669> will<00:03:09.669> play<00:03:09.849> in<00:03:10.030> G<00:03:11.280> G<00:03:12.280> is<00:03:12.669> or
