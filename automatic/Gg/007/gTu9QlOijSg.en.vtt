 hello everybody sochaux the focus group I came 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.910
 spend the weekend here in bÃºzios 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.590
 where I lived in the entire adolescence and 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.390
 I decided to make several recipes for you 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.490
 I'll start with a recipe that was 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.560
 request of milan who is the vocalist of my 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.300
 This band is the easiest and 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.230
 simple time to make salmon 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.510
 grilled 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.560
 here I have two salmon steaks 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.540
 clean without skin and without pimples 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.890
 I 'll only season with coarse salt 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.170
 ground on time 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.950
 but you can use your normal and 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.950
 Black pepper 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.780
 tap a little with your hand to stick 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:55.480
 seasonings and do the same thing as 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:55.480
 other side salt and pepper 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.399
 heat a skillet over high heat and 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.229
 put some olive oil like salmon 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.150
 Is without the skin I'm going to put on the 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.310
 the frying pan inside the belly 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.140
 who is the most beautiful and who is going to stay 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.200
 facing up when serving 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.700
 place the salt in the skillet and 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.170
 Quiet without touch when you realize 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.750
 which is already forming a cone 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.869
 carefully lift with a spatula and 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.530
 see if it's already golden if it's sturdy 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.530
 carefully 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:37.509
 grill on the other side until golden brown 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.090
 also making salmon like that 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.800
 will be slightly ill spent in the middle well 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:49.050
 juicy and the way I like it 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.050

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.869

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.869
