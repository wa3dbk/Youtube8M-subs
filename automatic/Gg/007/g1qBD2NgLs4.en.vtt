saturation<00:03:35.319> going<00:03:35.860> now<00:03:36.069> I'm<00:03:36.849> letting<00:03:37.060> my

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
saturation going now I'm letting my

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.830

scalp<00:03:37.780> absorb<00:03:38.379> all<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:40.150> idea<00:03:40.540> is<00:03:40.629> that

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
scalp absorb all that the idea is that

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.800 
scalp absorb all that the idea is that
the<00:03:41.260> cornstarch<00:03:41.970> will<00:03:42.970> absorb<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:44.069> oils<00:03:45.810> and

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
the cornstarch will absorb the oils and

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.960 
the cornstarch will absorb the oils and
it<00:03:47.079> will<00:03:47.260> decrease<00:03:47.680> goodbye<00:03:48.099> your<00:03:48.579> hair<00:03:48.819> and

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
it will decrease goodbye your hair and

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.599

witch<00:03:49.209> hazel<00:03:49.799> it's<00:03:50.799> an<00:03:50.950> awesome<00:03:51.159> awesome

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
witch hazel it's an awesome awesome

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.410 
witch hazel it's an awesome awesome
thing<00:03:52.239> it's<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.170> natural<00:03:53.530> astringent<00:03:53.859> I<00:03:54.670> use<00:03:55.269> it

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
thing it's a natural astringent I use it

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.050 
thing it's a natural astringent I use it
mostly<00:03:55.689> for<00:03:55.900> RS<00:03:56.230> diaper<00:03:56.560> stuff<00:03:56.980> but<00:03:57.310> for<00:03:57.879> this

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
mostly for RS diaper stuff but for this

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.589 
mostly for RS diaper stuff but for this
I<00:03:58.329> guess<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.049> works<00:03:59.230> too<00:03:59.440> so<00:04:00.280> most<00:04:01.090> of<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.420> oil

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
I guess it works too so most of the oil

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.270 
I guess it works too so most of the oil
really<00:04:01.870> is<00:04:02.079> concentrated<00:04:02.739> on<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:02.859> scalp

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
really is concentrated on the scalp

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.920 
really is concentrated on the scalp
anyway<00:04:03.639> so<00:04:03.790> I'm<00:04:04.000> not<00:04:04.180> worried<00:04:04.450> about<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.780> end

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
anyway so I'm not worried about the end

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.619 
anyway so I'm not worried about the end
so<00:04:05.230> much<00:04:05.489> next<00:04:06.489> I'm<00:04:06.819> going<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.030> blow-dry<00:04:07.329> my
