00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.170
 very good to all boys and girls 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.840
 welcome once again to the canal traigo 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.970
 a new video of gta 5 and if friends like 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.040
 you are watching the glitch returns again 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.900
 of the helicopter houses all 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.180
 we had thought that rockstar us what 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.960
 had patched us had it removed and 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.820
 well, it was not like that was not like that 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.280
 it is true that rockstar patch it or removed it 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.040
 that mission but good still they continue 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.769
 leaving others and I have chosen neighbors 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.019
 badly avenues worth is a mission that 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.370
 chosen is two players worth and 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.620
 good serves me more than anything 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.600
 explain you the method is still the 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.000
 same guys okay I have nothing more than 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.379
 show you in this video how good 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.170
 practically if someone has not seen it 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.090
 because if not, as a reminder 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.710
 no and if someone has not seen it then 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.840
 right now I explain to you how it works 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.690
 you just have to put in as before 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.820
 in one of the assault missions there are 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.550
 of two players and there are four worth 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.619
 a map that is fucking great that is where 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.420
 a few channels or something like that is for 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.280
 four players is probably worth some 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.660
 youtuber will have uploaded it I do not have 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.790
 idea but surely someone has 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.240
 uploaded because the truth is very good 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.009
 but good 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.380
 I 'm recording this at night and 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:24.280
 that I have not been for the day when the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.979
 day so good good serves me for 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.110
 explain you not already I tell you missions of two 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.630
 and four players depending on 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.880
 how many friends are you in the game and 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.549
 otherwise you can choose one or the other and 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.799
 the method is exactly the same 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.080
 the same guys as you see I'm in 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.880
 neighbors assaulted badly that the 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.030
 truth is not bad is not bad but 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.220
 has a bitch this map and it's the side 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.580
 in which I left, it's worth that side 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.990
 the bad side what we will do will be justito 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.679
 where have you seen in that location 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.539
 there will appear the helicopters worth 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.399
 that's where the 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.880
 helicopters and the fucking time you have 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.250
 is this assault mission is that good 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.649
 let's say practically a single 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.019
 player because I'm not too sure 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.569
 ok I'm not too sure that they come out 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.730
 two helicopters if you do it and 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.290
 you can put it in the comments 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.330
 I would really appreciate it so 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.770
 know and well how do you see we are already 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.270
 arriving in the hangar 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.460
 what we have to do is get down 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.060
 here it's worth we get off here with the car 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.980
 of ass and then we will listen to a 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.570
 helicopter as soon as we hear that 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.640
 helicopter we got off 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.050
 car and let's go for it let's go for the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.970
 uncle of the helicopter if you want him 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.920
 shoot and if you want to kill him or what 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.670
 what do you want to do to him and if not then like me 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.860
 a visit to such a simple notice or I 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.680
 get off my helicopter please 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.150
 I need to make the glitch thank you very much 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.970
 always give clear thanks for 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.100
 course good guys once 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.900
 let's have the helicopter, we'll do what 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.060
 same as in the previous method 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.010
 we will take the helicopter and we will go 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.680
 towards the briefcase that we have to catch 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.060
 that is the enemy that is this one here is 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.800
 the good side but good serves me 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.350
 a recommendation that I wanted to comment 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.030
 if you go out on this side right on the side 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.569
 which is now taking off in 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.519
 helicopter 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.650
 if for example you agree with 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.780
 Some friend you agree with 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.790
 someone to make this glitch i os 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.620
 I would recommend that whoever takes the 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.290
 experience what do they do 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.480
 click with the helicopter that is the one that comes out 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.489
 on that side is worth the one that comes out in this 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.670
 I do not recommend it for you so you go 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.230
 to see now as you see guys good 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.989
 apart from that it costs me a little bit 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.930
 helicopter what good pilot more or less 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.200
 ok but it's pretty fucked up like you see 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.230
 not because we have about 34 houses walls 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.829
 we have a lot of things and it is very very 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.389
 difficult to stabilize the vehicle is very 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.269
 difficult to get a helicopter to and 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.099
 to stabilize it, that's why I 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.379
 I recommend that the player who comes out 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.270
 right in this area in the area where I 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.250
 I have to steal the bag 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.650
 ie which have to do 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.440
 that it reads vale is much more easy since 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.230
 that you have much more space more space 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.610
 open to do it and others and the truth 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.830
 is that it is very easy after this 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.530
 We tried it again, andré and me 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.690
 I'm the one who was helping me and I 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.960
 It shows a lot, you can not tell 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:27.230
 very much besides that I was like 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.270
 2 or 3 minutes without the helicopter 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.300
 touch the floor 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.220
 there and I tell you guys it's very easy 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.500
 put the helicopter there stabilized or 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.930
 as in this other side that the truth already 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.880
 is going to be very very complicated as you go 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.760
 see here again I do it again but 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.530
 immediately you see that it hit me and I put the 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.970
 bag I have to pick it up again 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.190
 time so good that's my 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.990
 recommendation guys and if not then ya 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.300
 I say there is a mission that surely 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.890
 someone upload it if you do not want to see it here 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.750
 on my channel so you can look for it in 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.120
 Any other thing does not matter to me what 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.310
 matter is that you know there is a mission 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.050
 which is for four players minimum worth 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.390
 but it's the best because you have the 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.550
 helicopter next and the briefcases 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.810
 they are very close to each other you have 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.240
 space to maneuver 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.150
 the helicopter and other things so 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.919
 good guys take advantage of it 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.169
 I'll say it again I said it in the 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.660
 first video in the first one that 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.820
 I went up I knew they were going to patch it in 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.130
 hours I have not even arrived a day guys 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.020
 docs so you know how good it has been 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.120
 put the batteries with this cliché and it's 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.700
 normal because the truth seems like a 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.070
 absolute abuse does not dare I already said in the 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.710
 first video seems to me a total abuse 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.210
 this cliché so good not me 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.830
 would matter the truth that the patch will make 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.680
 because it's that these too many a is 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.440
 too much I have climbed almost 15 levels just 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.750
 with doing the gray to show you what and 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.669
 well I am not very supporter of these 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.400
 things you do not already know some will know that 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.690
 I like to earn the experience based 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.310
 of emissions the money is already another 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.900
 story but good guys I hope that you 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.910
 have liked to subscribe to the channel if not 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.550
 you are like and favorite guys to see 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.320
 if we can reach 40-50 likes and I 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.910
 I think we can, guys, so 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.450
 nothing a greeting and until the next 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.450
 regards
