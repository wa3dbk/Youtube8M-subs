00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:07.090
 people who are there good look at a 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.100
 explanation more there are people who come to 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.710
 visit my garden and gives you for anything 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.320
 because it 's zero zone growing in a 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.930
 bunch of herbs 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.120
 is carrying how beautiful it is in 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.130
 terrain is clean and clear 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.789
 after mistake nothing is further from reality 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.230
 let's see one thing is where I grow 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.400
 to see 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:35.300
 in the clean plants to their corridors and 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:39.800
 another thing is where I do not grow 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.510
 for example this piece the garden the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.110
 orchard but good this piece that is 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.240
 big new crop 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.420
 joaquim and he passed him back because only 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.260
 could happen to me happened to motorcycle pulses 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.179
 nothing 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.879
 that is practiced with this is practiced 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.060
 orchard you know what the 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.790
 nature that she alone 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.960
 makes your green fertilizer as of the following 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.850
 way there are plants worth in access is 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.490
 wild plants that are plants of 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.670
 season all the plants have a 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.860
 cycle just like our vegetables 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.850
 then these plants come out and they 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:23.790
 alone when it finishes its cycle dies 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.790
 they dry and end up getting on the ground 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.940
 there are people who think it's a quantity 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.310
 and very small nutrients to which 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.590
 we take the soil well maybe it is not what 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.380
 same thing that came from manure that is 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.259
 logical, but what we do get 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.970
 with green fertilizer is to improve our 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.770
 structure of the soil 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.399
 The more organic matter you have 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.399
 our soil 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:05.860
 sweet I have here my beans associated 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:09.819
 with my corn and next to me I have nothing 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.100
 culture on the other side yes there are potatoes 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.650
 around here there's nothing farming 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.170
 Well, you can see how it is up to 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.260
 grass 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.340
 and I want to prepare for this 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.400
 what 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.930
 to be able to plant within a month more 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.670
 or less then what I'm going to do is 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.560
 that like this herb even inside a 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.810
 month is not going to give time to die 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.269
 approach and mix what I'm going to 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.269
 to do is to arrive with a brushcutter 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.260
 and I let that curious 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.090
 here is a clear example look if I'm going 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:49.109
 to teach three equal plants of 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.519
 wild plants I do not know is this plant 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.299
 but it's not exactly what it has 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:57.739
 well if here I do not grow and true in the 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.739
 clear terrain looks 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.109
 here is a little plant treats them 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.139
 teach are the same of it 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:08.389
 family and the same variety if you are already 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:11.480
 planted plucked and deposited it in the 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:16.430
 soil fixed the organic foundation that I am 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.720
 throwing if the rigid one started later 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.950
 here we have another equal 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.950
 the rank now 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:31.280
 fix the small amount of matter 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.230
 organic to the ground if I still want it 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:41.230
 grow 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:41.230
 and then it becomes this 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.010
 it's about ten times bigger with what 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.860
 which with less work I'm contributing 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.120
 much more organic matter to the ground 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.830
 these plants has not ripped me 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.629
 never plucked the plants or that is 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.310
 weed as people say that 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.790
 I still do not know any herbs that 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.400
 be bad in any case now I what 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.560
 I do it's hello away so they dry themselves 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.120
 same or blind for what 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.310
 very simple if I start this plant 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.070
 that I am taking the roots that 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.709
 we know that roots have 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.630
 famous mycorrhizae there are 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.750
 keep them in our soil at all 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.790
 that's why it's better to close them and 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.040
 roots that remain on the ground already 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.800
 could by themselves and when we pass him 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.270
 the walking tractor is left behind as it is removed 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.430
 all 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.690
 but if we will maintain a good colony 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.690
 of mycorrhizae in our land 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.629
 good look how is this 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.160
 that you can not pass 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.280
 this very tall grass are very arrivals 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.530
 tall 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.630
 can have about between the meter and the 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.650
 one and a half meters now you will see how it is 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.650
 when the brushcutter passes
