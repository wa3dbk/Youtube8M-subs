be talking about still life drawing for

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.129 
be talking about still life drawing for
beginners<00:00:07.290> in<00:00:08.000> this<00:00:09.000> section<00:00:09.300> we're<00:00:09.840> looking

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
beginners in this section we're looking

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.290 
beginners in this section we're looking
at<00:00:10.290> how<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.590> get<00:00:10.920> dimension<00:00:11.580> in<00:00:11.790> your<00:00:12.000> drawing

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
at how to get dimension in your drawing

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.660 
at how to get dimension in your drawing
and<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:12.809> relies<00:00:13.559> on<00:00:13.910> shading<00:00:14.910> but<00:00:15.360> also

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
and that relies on shading but also

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.179 
and that relies on shading but also
volume<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:20.840> lot<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.990> times<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.619> order<00:00:23.070> to

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
volume so a lot of times in order to

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.590 
volume so a lot of times in order to
create<00:00:23.430> dimension<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.119> want<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.330> look<00:00:24.480> at

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
create dimension you want to look at

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.560 
create dimension you want to look at
what's<00:00:24.779> underneath<00:00:25.019> your<00:00:25.590> object<00:00:26.039> therefore

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
what's underneath your object therefore

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.589 
what's underneath your object therefore
there's<00:00:27.570> some<00:00:28.789> light<00:00:29.789> that's<00:00:30.090> creating<00:00:30.539> a

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
there's some light that's creating a

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.290 
there's some light that's creating a
shadow<00:00:30.900> underneath<00:00:31.289> each<00:00:31.560> object<00:00:31.830> which<00:00:32.219> is

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
shadow underneath each object which is

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.120 
shadow underneath each object which is
automatically<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.690> little<00:00:34.469> secret<00:00:34.920> way<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
automatically a little secret way to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.619 
automatically a little secret way to
bring<00:00:35.760> some<00:00:36.410> dimensionality<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.620> your<00:00:37.800> object

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
bring some dimensionality to your object

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.780 
bring some dimensionality to your object
if<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:40.440> give<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.649> some<00:00:40.920> darkness<00:00:41.309> underneath

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
if you give it some darkness underneath

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.729 
if you give it some darkness underneath
and<00:00:42.180> basically<00:00:43.170> i<00:00:43.290> am<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.739> scribbling<00:00:44.219> here

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
and basically i am just scribbling here

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.279 
and basically i am just scribbling here
that's<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:47.010> little<00:00:47.129> trick<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:48.000> create<00:00:49.640> some

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
that's a little trick to create some

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.360 
that's a little trick to create some
gravity's<00:00:52.289> your<00:00:52.590> object<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:54.680> give<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.800> a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
gravity's your object and give it a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.020 
gravity's your object and give it a
little<00:00:56.610> bit<00:00:56.820> more<00:00:57.030> volume<00:00:57.210> and<00:01:01.640> any<00:01:02.640> kind<00:01:02.910> of

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
little bit more volume and any kind of

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.980 
little bit more volume and any kind of
line<00:01:03.210> will<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.989> good<00:01:04.229> idea<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:05.220> go<00:01:05.990> in

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
line will do it's a good idea to go in

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.149 
line will do it's a good idea to go in
the<00:01:07.260> direction<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:09.260> how<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.320> think<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> form

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
the direction of how you think the form

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.880 
the direction of how you think the form
is<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> flat<00:01:12.210> surface<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.930> you

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
is but on a flat surface like this you

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.440 
is but on a flat surface like this you
can<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.280> do<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> straight<00:01:14.549> line<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
can just do a straight line in the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.080 
can just do a straight line in the
direction<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> table<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.880> lines

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
direction of this is a table the lines

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:31.109 
direction of this is a table the lines
are<00:01:18.240> going<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.450> be<00:01:18.570> going<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.960> way

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.630 

creating<00:01:32.119> dimension<00:01:32.390> doesn't<00:01:33.020> only<00:01:33.610> rely<00:01:34.610> on

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
creating dimension doesn't only rely on

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.529 
creating dimension doesn't only rely on
shadow<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:35.840> light<00:01:36.049> every<00:01:36.439> it<00:01:36.770> relies<00:01:37.220> on<00:01:37.539> how

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
shadow and light every it relies on how

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.850 
shadow and light every it relies on how
you<00:01:38.600> see<00:01:38.929> the<00:01:39.049> object<00:01:39.259> as<00:01:39.829> a<00:01:40.149> entire<00:01:41.149> form<00:01:41.860> this

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
you see the object as a entire form this

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.620 
you see the object as a entire form this
is<00:01:43.070> an<00:01:43.220> object<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:43.700> could<00:01:44.060> be<00:01:44.179> broken<00:01:44.600> down

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
is an object that could be broken down

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.700 
is an object that could be broken down
into<00:01:44.960> planes<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:47.450> have<00:01:47.539> a<00:01:47.630> plane<00:01:47.929> here<00:01:48.500> on

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
into planes you have a plane here on

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.160 
into planes you have a plane here on
this<00:01:49.189> on<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:49.789> spaghetti<00:01:50.210> squash<00:01:50.360> a<00:01:50.659> plane

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
this on the spaghetti squash a plane

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.480 
this on the spaghetti squash a plane
here<00:01:51.799> there<00:01:52.610> are<00:01:52.759> various<00:01:53.240> planes<00:01:53.539> on<00:01:53.810> here

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
here there are various planes on here

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.580 
here there are various planes on here
which<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:55.729> can<00:01:55.909> get<00:01:56.030> involved<00:01:56.299> with<00:01:56.720> drawing

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590
