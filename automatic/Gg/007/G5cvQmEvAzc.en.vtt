00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.750
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new one 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.420
 video today as promised last vi 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.330
 I'll show you how to make it work between 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.820
 marot on android 4.3 then belch 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.510
 I will go to 4.3 directly from the phone 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:29.290
 and sense of the PCI and as you know between but 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:32.619
 ruth would only work on the apps on the 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:36.130
 on android versions from 2.3.6 to 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.710
 version 4.2.2 today I will make it work 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.540
 on android 4.3 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.960
 before starting the video I wanted to tell you 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.610
 that this ruth is not a real one 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.100
 ruth because it is practically there 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:52.390
 run the apps that need to 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.440
 root while if you want for example 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.350
 install a rom 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.340
 that is, it does not recognize the root and therefore 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:05.260
 you can't do well first 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.850
 install super su from the play store e 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.729
 even if we don't have roothlus we go there 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.210
 himself because he practically does it 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.760
 unlock a hidden screen ad 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.710
 android then install super suv from 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.670
 here 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:31.060
 after which we download fra ma ruth from 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:32.470
 internet 1.9.1 apk downloaded was the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.650
 first result 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.200
 I 've already installed it unloaded that not 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.180
 it damages nothing so download 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:46.040
 quietly 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:49.400
 after you after we now have to go to sti 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.460
 on the phone phones that just super 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.230
 members unblock this screen e 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.510
 consistam is practically associated with 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.850
 sis dump and insert this code on the 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:06.440
 telephone then obtained asterisk 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.869
 hash sign 9900 here 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.150
 which is for the screen of sis dams e 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.250
 surely you don't know if you will have read 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.550
 on the internet that this system works 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.530
 to increase the bar the duration of the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.209
 battery will also work for that 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.250
 even if I'm not so sure 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.990
 but it also works for many other things and 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.020
 so we going down 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.080
 let's go to tc from tcp daum start lo 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.660
 we apply and insert the code of the 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.110
 our device for those who do n't 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.200
 knew the device code 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:43.070
 wait is on them 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.070
 other settings 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.209
 device info and we have the code 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:03:00.350
 model I have a known two then gtn 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:03:02.750
 7100 back on the screen and advances 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.760
 nam start we write the code of ours 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:14.390
 device then gtm 17 nov 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:16.190
 sorry if 100 and the code to unlock 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.019
 then operate the device 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.280
 he says it's not really making the 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.560
 root because as if it is unlocked 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.860
 device and the apps that need to 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.390
 routes and as if they recognize a router 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.000
 that there is only because it has been unlocked 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.450
 this code is super on that 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.320
 enter the code to unlock it 1995 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.269
 6 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.950
 now you click on ok I don't have it 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.890
 I click because I risk damaging 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.190
 the device because having the robbed 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:47.750
 so click ok then button 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.819
 home and go to frame out 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.569
 let's go up between mars and let's make it roth 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.360
 which practically takes away all the 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.620
 applique you the things you wait for 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.730
 takes away all the things that don't make us 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.940
 just unlock the screen super 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.640
 of android after that click on aragon 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.620
 and you too will fail 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.680
 will succeed failed to try one 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.060
 other exploited and it is right that if so 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:22.340
 after you come back on the phone 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:24.800
 screen still on tct tcp dame star ti 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.720
 write the key you see here then 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.570
 mine that you write yours that 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.660
 it will surely be different because it depends 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.630
 from the device and from how much battery 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.620
 you therefore have 92 percent not where it comes from 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.180
 this is and then depends on the times of 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.930
 how true you click anyway 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.539
 interested click ok practically ok 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:51.500
 the root is done then just go again 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:54.410
 suframa root and do super installation 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.800
 on the transition from a rock to do in the 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.140
 root is not really mandatory because 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.900
 if you do it even without it it works though 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.240
 I recommend to do the route anyway e 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.880
 to be sure that everything works 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.160
 well anyway then do installation 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.710
 super su click aragon 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.630
 and you have your cruz 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.669
 functional app which applications 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.320
 need this feature to me 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.169
 fails to try with others 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.569
 xplod because I already have the root 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:27.139
 therefore two faces cannot work 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:29.490
 well guys the video ends here 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.669
 if you liked it left a layman 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:36.919
 subscribe to the channel and nothing 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.919
