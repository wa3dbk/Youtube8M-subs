 blessed elect holy savior are really at 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.760
 center of the pyrenees 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.830
 between the tourmalet and luz ardiden it's 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.439
 a great place to come to 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.199

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.629
 mountains 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.809
 summer starts very early here for the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.910
 dice cycling as the tourmalet collar 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.739
 is open 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.180
 do not open the road for cyclists 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.070
 becomes magical there are bikes on the 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.840
 road every day all day 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.290
 even late at night people who go 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.480
 go down 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.970
 it's a bike atmosphere especially 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.800
 in the spring of june for month of 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.559
 July it's a place really 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.400
 magic for cyclists in the region 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.110
 and those who come from afar for 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.110
 to test ourselves on our roads 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.280
 the tour de France is extraordinary 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.170
 when he passes the tourmalet and does that 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.850
 to pass is already very very beautiful and 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.190
 quantify stop at luz ardiden where at 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.870
 tourmalet it's an atmosphere of madness 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.930
 with supporters coming from the country 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.370
 Basque from Spain of all France and 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.050
 we feel that there are dozens of 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.270
 thousands of people who come to see 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.040
 the experience of the cold and the pyrenees 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.040
 here for the Tour de France every year 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.040
 there was enough there is a race 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.930
 important just as it was the 100 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.730
 years of the tourmalet with the tourmalet in 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.470
 a sense in the other direction and an arrival 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.930
 in the tourmalet with the schleck brothers 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.180
 a year or two ago for 100 years and 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.490
 this year in 2015 next year 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.710
 its 40 years of opening the road to 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.300
 luz ardiden the road to luz ardiden with 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.130
 an opening 40 years ago, the station also 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.950
 and that would be fine if the turn of 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.190
 France came to make a step in 2015 to 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.190
 luz ardiden
