00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.600
 hello people and welcome to 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.270
 a small weapons test yesterday is him 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.410
 one the new manager for the appeared 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:14.330
 qbb 95 yes we'll give you the dates 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.519
 listed damage high precision 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.310
 medium ammunition 60 rounds distributed 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:21.980
 three magazine reach high fire rate 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.259
 almost full car and here we are 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.249
 that standards head because we have the weapons 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:31.429
 yes even without misfires is 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.840
 it a bit the bundestrend without 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.579
 to target 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.980
 as you already see the weapon 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.820
 creative board and if you do not 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.809
 On the other hand, the weapon only gives up 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.090
 strong up and slightly to the right 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.309
 that can be compensated for by balancing 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.320
 of course, a little restrict 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.370
 but here you see it already is for that 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.140
 pretty much 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.550
 except perhaps single shots the 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.199
 maybe out of the plane, yes, well it went 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.269
 a bit to play as I said 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.390
 without essays , they will be afterwards 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.379
 still test with the sentences 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.960
 you also see the weapon was pretty much 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:11.000
 quickly comparable to the one in the 36th 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.690
 this also later what well as 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.310
 I'm not exactly it 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.560
 the opponent pushes back all points 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.710
 and look who many if a bit 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.320
 can tidy up so at least a few 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.390
 opponents take away with our team yes 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.210
 can advance a bit 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.710
 I also see that our language package is 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.970
 Of course we have changed this too 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.479
 another video for those who have not yet 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.530
 knowledge 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:36.200
 We will be that file too 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.000
 upload timo has a video about it 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.100
 to do a video today where we 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.810
 just explain everything and also 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.920
 this file and all this text 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.180
 they can also change with them 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.680
 Imagine that they are the same now 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.520
 you can still use it with us 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.820
 then you do not have to change anything anymore 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.800
 good a little bit now soko bab 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.990
 It is made by a network of 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.280
 a company in china namely mohring co 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:12.650
 is her name and she is made for 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:17.000
 the play and is from since 1995's 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:20.750
 still produced now and she is 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.590
 a slight ng is based on the ku bz 95 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.130
 and now the standard weapon of pl 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.420
 so if there are many west between you 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.170
 army this is the liberation army 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:37.180
 from china so you have me like that 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.180
 Bundeswehr hold my china 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.959
 the coop eg who uses her heavy 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.610
 ammunition with a long reach and here 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.680
 as well as you can see has one 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:54.439
 drum magazine 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.819
 yes without ammunition weighs 95 kilograms what 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:03:00.319
 now is not exactly the most severely 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:04.969
 for a lmg now 84 cm long and the 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:07.340
 run the 60 centimeters long so so 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:09.139
 The weapons are already exactly like 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.150
 we already might now simply 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.560
 Let's see how I said I am 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.939
 I still have it without misfires and 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.670
 You see, this is not going to be that much 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:25.310
 york is used exactly and yes for ammunition 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.230
 ali was 58 millimeters and yes of course 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.400
 So if you do not turn on 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.459
 because of course she is very much 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.620
 inaccurate so sometimes you should 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.560
 sometimes you should stop always 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.500
 Of course , that does not matter 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.180
 keep fire but you have times 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.269
 short woman a few times just click on it 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.069
 because otherwise the weapon just the weapon 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:51.069
 just to forgive the balls and then 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.989
 Sometimes you get unhappy with it 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.370
 So I also find the weapon that is 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.569
 So a bit worse than 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.709
 my favorite manager for the ems 27 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.629
 So I still prefer the 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.090
 m27 because i find the sound somehow 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.609
 funny this metallic surfaces sound 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.829
 of course , this is the weapon 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.620
 I really find something to annoy because it 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:15.409
 just super accurate is even if you 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.630
 slowly go to net as the ems 27 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:23.450
 They still after relatively fast 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:28.190
 until faster than the mg 36 02 seconds 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:35.800
 So cut faster 51 seconds 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:35.800
 equals good and 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.580
 yes this is in the side have to be very chic 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.620
 time I think so now find that 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.330
 I am now better than that of James 27 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.520
 and I find it somehow a bit 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.259
 clearer the red dots there 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.830
 optically, that too 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.370
 a little bit nicer than it is not now 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.379
 really 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.479
 the game improves and only because is 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:03.440
 how it looks nice here the work 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:05.330
 is a nice open I find good 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.879
 and now we have the rockbar 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.740
 essays packs on it namely the broad 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:12.580
 the damage increases by 2 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.840
 then we have really nice 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.490
 Accuracy I have it 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.669
 Lead stock and the Christian bear 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.340
 meier chris 4 so in total plus 80 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.009
 accuracy and ammunition also by the 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.729
 max 24 metro magazine 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:31.460
 that is, 84-circuit in a magazin 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:35.120
 distributed on time magazine and then 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:41.139
 So we have 252 balls so far less 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:44.040
 as at the 27 and reach firing rate 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:46.380
 scope is everything the same 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.810
 So yes, yes, so I'm aware now 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.510
 not a last time on it done because 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:55.650
 I think that the weapon thereby 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.870
 bit more accurate and first up 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.420
 scope already with relatively open 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.660
 and nice to look at and you see 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.760
 already that is not very high weapon so 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.080
 without you are so relatively high 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.340
 and maybe a bit weird 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.200
 but with the savior time it sees 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.520
 terrible so it packs noticeably 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.870
 will you as a non-aligned it it 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.500
 that I do not care much for you anymore 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:22.220
 right side of you , that will be good 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.600
 Now here with the ex-managers 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.550
 field play4free comparison to online 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.820
 this can be a matter 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.880
 come out raider celebration 625 balls per 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.050
 minute 11 25 per second 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.950
 Once I said that before 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.430
 I could see again 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.530
 after charging time 5.1 seconds, the weapon a 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.530
 joint bottrop that means the weapons 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.600
 not the weapons the ammunition says too 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:49.050
 range that the balls also said 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.730
 human mind absolute range 21 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.210
 a little bit negative, it spoils a lot 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:56.960
 above can be easily compensated 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.960
 currently this is very accurate 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:04.440
 then harm what she is very many 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:06.479
 between 25 and 30 damage to the body 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:10.380
 So that's packed together 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:13.500
 meanwhile is along with and one 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:18.030
 range and upside down mostly between 52 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:19.590
 and 63 damage you know of course means 5 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.590
 on the body and kill my opponent 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:25.229
 and upside down 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.360
 if the opponent has played 110 lives 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:30.210
 even a bottle upside down or 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.009
 six shots on the body and one 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.370
 pretty much already at the end of our 

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:37.530
 small weapon tests you so still 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.229
 Cost point from 21 will be free 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:43.820
 switched costs and that the 199 fans 

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:47.160
 and little label 21 pages is the 1299th 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.930
 windows yes and york the weapon 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.680
 rather not if you no longer 21 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.900
 or higher 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.419
 as they still inseminate my beauty 

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.479
 play and pack as a little tip 

00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:58.949
 me that savior time or even 

00:07:56.479 --> 00:08:02.780
 blocks the real view to the right 

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:05.120
 and he looks pretty weird, though 

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:07.620
 and it was so teak you already lead 

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.699
 easily find it you liked there 

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.770
 nav depending on 

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:13.520
 and I get along and say jazz up 

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.520
 next time
