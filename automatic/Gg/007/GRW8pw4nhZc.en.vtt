00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
had so much on the other day so it's I

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.100 
had so much on the other day so it's I
would<00:01:47.280> say<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:47.640> still<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.180> medium<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.899> full

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
would say it's still a medium to full

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.719 
would say it's still a medium to full
coverage<00:01:49.140> because<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:50.009> build<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
coverage because you can build it up and

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.969 
coverage because you can build it up and
it<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.939> covering<00:01:51.390> most<00:01:51.630> things<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.799> can

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it is covering most things but you can

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.160 
it is covering most things but you can
see<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.310> shine<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:54.450> definitely<00:01:55.020> quite

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
see the shine it's definitely quite

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.730 
see the shine it's definitely quite
shiny<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:56.540> did<00:01:57.540> still<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.229> streakiness

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
shiny I did still have the streakiness

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.530 
shiny I did still have the streakiness
when<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.159> was<00:01:59.310> blending<00:01:59.790> with<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.030> brush<00:02:00.329> like

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
when I was blending with the brush like

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.600 
when I was blending with the brush like
the<00:02:00.689> little<00:02:00.899> brush<00:02:01.110> marks<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:02.100> still<00:02:02.310> easy

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
the little brush marks it's still easy

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.160 
the little brush marks it's still easy
to<00:02:02.820> blend<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.450> slides<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.079> glides

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
to blend like it slides and glides

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.039 
to blend like it slides and glides
really<00:02:04.680> well<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.640> hard<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.930> it

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
really well but it's hard to like it

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.779

like slimy and like gross feeling as

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.620 
like slimy and like gross feeling as
when<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.610> applied<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.210> other<00:02:21.330> day<00:02:21.480> because

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
when I applied it the other day because

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.600 
when I applied it the other day because
I<00:02:21.870> had<00:02:22.020> so<00:02:22.290> much<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.830> think<00:02:22.890> that's<00:02:23.190> why<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.460> was

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
I had so much I think that's why it was

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.300 
I had so much I think that's why it was
it's<00:02:24.570> definitely<00:02:24.960> still<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.710> you<00:02:26.160> know<00:02:26.190> a

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
it's definitely still like a you know a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.590 
it's definitely still like a you know a
slightly<00:02:28.100> oily<00:02:29.100> or<00:02:29.340> foundation<00:02:30.240> but<00:02:30.510> it

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
slightly oily or foundation but it

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.690 
slightly oily or foundation but it
doesn't<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.170> when<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.380> was<00:02:31.620> done<00:02:31.830> putting<00:02:32.490> it

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
doesn't like when I was done putting it

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.910 
doesn't like when I was done putting it
on<00:02:32.820> I<00:02:33.030> didn't<00:02:33.360> feel<00:02:33.570> like<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.050> whole<00:02:34.260> slime

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
on I didn't feel like that whole slime

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.700 
on I didn't feel like that whole slime
gross<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.090> could<00:02:36.390> feel<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:36.810> my<00:02:36.870> skin<00:02:36.990> anymore

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
gross I could feel it on my skin anymore

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.890 
gross I could feel it on my skin anymore
so<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:38.490> actually<00:02:38.700> quite<00:02:39.120> comfortable<00:02:39.480> to

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
so it's actually quite comfortable to

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.550 
so it's actually quite comfortable to
wear<00:02:40.170> but<00:02:40.830> when<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.100> touch<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.730> very

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
wear but when you touch it it's very

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.950 
wear but when you touch it it's very
like<00:02:43.560> oily<00:02:43.980> feeling<00:02:44.190> like<00:02:44.910> now<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.810> it's

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960
