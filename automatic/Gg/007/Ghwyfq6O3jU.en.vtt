00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
between a barbershop quartet and a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.940 
between a barbershop quartet and a
cappella<00:00:47.750> so<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.800> it's

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
cappella so it's just really like it's

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.650 
cappella so it's just really like it's
just<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> presence<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:50.969> chord<00:00:51.270> like

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
just the presence of this one chord like

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.689 
just the presence of this one chord like
the<00:00:51.780> dominant<00:00:52.199> seventh<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.520> try

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
the dominant seventh and so we just try

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.400 
the dominant seventh and so we just try
to<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:54.059> bring<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:54.989> normally<00:00:55.289> have

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
to like bring that so we normally have

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.770 
to like bring that so we normally have
four<00:00:55.649> people<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.070> stage<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:57.059> sometimes<00:00:57.539> if

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
four people on stage but sometimes if

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.180
