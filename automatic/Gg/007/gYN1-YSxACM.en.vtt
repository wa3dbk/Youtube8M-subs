00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.770 
okay so now we have the pan on medium
heat<00:03:03.060> we're<00:03:04.060> just<00:03:04.210> going<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.360> use<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.540> little

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
heat we're just going to use a little

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.260 
heat we're just going to use a little
bit<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:05.050> olive<00:03:05.260> oil<00:03:05.560> just<00:03:06.060> sprinkle<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.120> in

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
bit of olive oil just sprinkle it in

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.050 
bit of olive oil just sprinkle it in
there<00:03:07.420> not<00:03:07.660> too<00:03:07.900> much<00:03:08.170> just<00:03:08.850> basically<00:03:09.850> to

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
there not too much just basically to

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.180 
there not too much just basically to
cover<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.510> bottom<00:03:10.660> of<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.080> pan<00:03:11.320> okay

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
cover the bottom of the pan okay

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.480 
cover the bottom of the pan okay
so<00:03:12.340> now<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.670> fry<00:03:13.510> pan<00:03:13.540> is<00:03:13.930> nice<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:14.230> hot<00:03:14.560> we'll

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
so now the fry pan is nice and hot we'll

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.280 
so now the fry pan is nice and hot we'll
just<00:03:15.700> screw<00:03:16.060> in<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:17.190> large<00:03:18.600> spoonful<00:03:19.600> into<00:03:20.170> the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
just screw in a large spoonful into the

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.840 
just screw in a large spoonful into the
pan<00:03:21.209> hear<00:03:22.209> that<00:03:22.360> sizzle<00:03:23.340> sign<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:24.520> know<00:03:24.670> it's

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
pan hear that sizzle sign you know it's

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.940 
pan hear that sizzle sign you know it's
warm<00:03:25.150> enough<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:29.260> we're<00:03:29.410> just<00:03:29.440> going<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.770> do

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
warm enough so we're just going to do

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.330 
warm enough so we're just going to do
two<00:03:30.160> spoonfuls<00:03:30.550> at<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.030> time<00:03:31.980> because<00:03:32.980> we're

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
two spoonfuls at a time because we're

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.080 
two spoonfuls at a time because we're
using<00:03:33.520> a<00:03:33.700> fairly<00:03:33.970> small<00:03:34.540> fry<00:03:34.930> pan<00:03:36.090> obviously

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
using a fairly small fry pan obviously

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.449 
using a fairly small fry pan obviously
the<00:03:37.390> larger<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.780> fry<00:03:37.959> pan<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.680> more<00:03:38.950> you<00:03:39.310> can

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
the larger the fry pan the more you can

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.610 
the larger the fry pan the more you can
put<00:03:40.420> in<00:03:40.540> there<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:42.430> give<00:03:42.610> them<00:03:42.700> about<00:03:43.500> three<00:03:44.500> to

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
put in there so give them about three to

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.890 
put in there so give them about three to
five<00:03:44.800> minutes<00:03:45.190> on<00:03:45.340> each<00:03:45.550> side<00:03:45.720> or<00:03:46.720> until

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
five minutes on each side or until

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.120 
five minutes on each side or until
they're<00:03:47.340> nice<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.370> golden<00:03:48.730> brown<00:03:50.130> obviously

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
they're nice and golden brown obviously

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.280 
they're nice and golden brown obviously
if<00:03:51.250> you<00:03:51.340> go<00:03:51.459> to<00:03:51.520> move<00:03:51.820> them<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.360> they're<00:03:53.050> still

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
if you go to move them and they're still

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.380 
if you go to move them and they're still
a<00:03:53.350> little<00:03:53.590> bit<00:03:53.739> runny<00:03:54.010> leave<00:03:54.850> them<00:03:55.090> for<00:03:55.360> a

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
a little bit runny leave them for a

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.640 
a little bit runny leave them for a
little<00:03:55.540> bit<00:03:55.660> longer<00:03:55.959> okay<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:59.380> these<00:03:59.590> are

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650

golden-brown on the side so that 12

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:19.900 
golden-brown on the side so that 12
clips<00:04:09.409> on<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:09.799> side<00:04:10.189> that<00:04:12.760> one<00:04:13.760> too<00:04:18.100> now<00:04:19.100> the

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910
