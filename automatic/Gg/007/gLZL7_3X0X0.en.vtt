00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
40 CC bore about two millimeters I think

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.220 
40 CC bore about two millimeters I think
maybe<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.370> little<00:00:44.430> more<00:00:44.840> maybe<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.989> little<00:00:46.079> less

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
maybe a little more maybe a little less

kit<00:00:52.260> last<00:00:52.770> weekend<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.520> wrote<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> yz250<00:00:54.690> F<00:00:54.989> euro

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
kit last weekend I wrote a yz250 F euro

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.889 
kit last weekend I wrote a yz250 F euro
for<00:00:55.800> pretty<00:00:56.370> much<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.760> exact<00:00:57.090> same<00:00:57.210> bike<00:00:57.660> it

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
for pretty much the exact same bike it

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.279 
for pretty much the exact same bike it
was<00:00:58.020> geared<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.440> same<00:00:58.649> as<00:00:58.800> mine<00:00:59.010> 1513<00:01:00.289> pretty

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
was geared the same as mine 1513 pretty

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.779 
was geared the same as mine 1513 pretty
good<00:01:01.530> gearing<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.039> mean<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.280> think<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.640> might

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
good gearing I mean I think that might

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.399 
good gearing I mean I think that might
be<00:01:02.820> stock<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:04.220> wrote<00:01:05.220> it

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
be stock but I wrote it

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.620 
be stock but I wrote it
250<00:01:07.409> engine<00:01:07.799> had<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> pretty<00:01:08.400> fresh<00:01:08.760> rebuild<00:01:09.270> so

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
250 engine had a pretty fresh rebuild so

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.480 
250 engine had a pretty fresh rebuild so
it<00:01:10.260> was<00:01:10.439> still<00:01:10.650> strong<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.070> wasn't<00:01:11.280> lacking

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
it was still strong it wasn't lacking

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.230 
it was still strong it wasn't lacking
compression<00:01:12.090> at<00:01:12.210> all<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:13.760> let<00:01:14.760> me<00:01:14.880> tell<00:01:15.119> you

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
compression at all and let me tell you

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.060 
compression at all and let me tell you
it's<00:01:15.360> nothing<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.080> at<00:01:16.290> all<00:01:16.439> what<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
it's nothing like this at all what the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.280 
it's nothing like this at all what the
290<00:01:17.610> does<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.210> gives<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.509> lot<00:01:18.689> more<00:01:18.750> bottom

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
290 does is it gives a lot more bottom

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.179 
290 does is it gives a lot more bottom
man<00:01:19.470> more<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.130> 450<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:20.939> not<00:01:21.630> as<00:01:21.810> much<00:01:22.189> but

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
man more like a 450 not not as much but

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.039 
man more like a 450 not not as much but
more<00:01:23.759> than<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> 2<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.659> guess<00:01:24.869> you'd

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
more than a 2 it's like I guess you'd

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.410 
more than a 2 it's like I guess you'd
work<00:01:25.200> out<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.619> kind<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.100> relate<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.000> KTM

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
work out and kind of relate it to a KTM

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.219 
work out and kind of relate it to a KTM

Athena<00:01:32.820> does<00:01:33.119> not<00:01:33.299> give<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.720> bike<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.409> much

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
Athena does not give the bike that much

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.469 
Athena does not give the bike that much
top-end<00:01:34.920> maybe<00:01:35.340> only<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:35.729> 2<00:01:35.909> 3<00:01:35.939> miles<00:01:36.329> an

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
top-end maybe only like 2 3 miles an

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.219 
top-end maybe only like 2 3 miles an
hour<00:01:36.570> faster<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.799> each<00:01:37.979> gear<00:01:38.340> hmm<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.479> gives

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
hour faster in each gear hmm but gives

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.770 
hour faster in each gear hmm but gives
it<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.409> lot<00:01:40.500> more<00:01:40.560> bottom<00:01:41.070> end<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.659> that<00:01:42.659> is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
it a lot more bottom end and that is

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.260 
it a lot more bottom end and that is

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
that first time I got a little I had a

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.710 
that first time I got a little I had a

bush that a lot of people with hit and
it<00:03:55.050> didn't<00:03:55.230> really<00:03:55.320> count<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:55.920> use<00:03:56.550> your

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
it didn't really count so use your

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
I was a lot more accurate but I tried to

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.530 
I was a lot more accurate but I tried to
make<00:04:02.130> that<00:04:02.400> first<00:04:02.610> one<00:04:02.910> still<00:04:03.180> turn<00:04:03.360> into

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
every bike I don't know about the little

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.000 
every bike I don't know about the little
trail<00:04:13.860> bikes<00:04:14.130> but<00:04:14.630> they<00:04:15.630> make<00:04:15.840> big<00:04:16.140> kits<00:04:16.500> for

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.800 
trail bikes but they make big kits for
anything<00:04:17.790> I<00:04:17.880> think<00:04:18.090> they<00:04:18.330> make<00:04:18.480> a<00:04:18.510> size

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
anything I think they make a size

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.870 
anything I think they make a size
smaller<00:04:19.200> than<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.500> 290<00:04:20.010> actually<00:04:20.430> but<00:04:20.670> yeah

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
smaller than the 290 actually but yeah

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.430 
smaller than the 290 actually but yeah
they<00:04:21.030> make<00:04:21.420> any<00:04:21.600> 250f<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.470> 290<00:04:23.040> any<00:04:23.840> 450<00:04:24.840> F<00:04:24.960> 480

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
they make any 250f to 290 any 450 F 480

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.750 
they make any 250f to 290 any 450 F 480
and<00:04:25.800> 2<00:04:26.610> strokes<00:04:27.090> I<00:04:27.920> think<00:04:28.920> they<00:04:29.010> make<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.310> Y<00:04:29.490> Z

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
and 2 strokes I think they make the Y Z

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.050 
and 2 strokes I think they make the Y Z
144<00:04:30.480> same<00:04:30.840> with<00:04:30.990> any<00:04:31.140> other<00:04:31.200> bike<00:04:31.560> so<00:04:31.890> and<00:04:32.640> it

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
144 same with any other bike so and it

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.420 
144 same with any other bike so and it
is<00:04:33.210> for<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:33.930> bike<00:04:34.290> up<00:04:34.470> it's<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:35.010> same<00:04:35.220> for

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430
