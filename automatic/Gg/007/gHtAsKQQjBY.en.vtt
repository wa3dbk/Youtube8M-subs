00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
damage on the planet so pretty much our

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.770 
damage on the planet so pretty much our
lad<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.770> his<00:00:55.860> team<00:00:56.100> had<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.510> scub

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.270 
lad and his team had to do with the scub
coral<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.170> having<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.530> destroy<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:59.190> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
coral and having to destroy it and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.240 
coral and having to destroy it and
something<00:01:00.270> came<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.840> with<00:01:01.079> all<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:02.039> we

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
something came up with all that we

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.070 
something came up with all that we
learned<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.640> he<00:01:02.820> could<00:01:02.969> see<00:01:03.149> trap<00:01:03.420> doors<00:01:03.690> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
learned that he could see trap doors and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.990 
learned that he could see trap doors and
the<00:01:04.949> reason<00:01:05.189> one<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.400> can<00:01:05.519> see<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.850> course

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the reason one you can see it of course

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.490 
the reason one you can see it of course
is<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.330> know<00:01:06.420> he's<00:01:06.570> half<00:01:06.780> piranha<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.380> know

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
is you know he's half piranha you know

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.410 
is you know he's half piranha you know
his<00:01:07.710> eyes<00:01:07.950> are<00:01:08.340> not<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> regular<00:01:09.060> you've

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
his eyes are not like the regular you've

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.000 
his eyes are not like the regular you've
been<00:01:09.540> higher<00:01:09.720> guess<00:01:10.170> what's<00:01:10.409> crawling<00:01:10.650> eyes

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
been higher guess what's crawling eyes

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.100 
been higher guess what's crawling eyes
so<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> makes<00:01:12.030> sense<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.420> him<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.600> know<00:01:12.869> he'll

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
so it makes sense for him to know he'll

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.690 
so it makes sense for him to know he'll
be<00:01:13.140> able<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:13.710> those<00:01:13.830> trapper<00:01:14.130> waves<00:01:14.430> and

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
be able to see those trapper waves and

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.910 
be able to see those trapper waves and
this<00:01:14.850> goes<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.360> whole<00:01:15.570> discussion<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.710> where

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
this goes to a whole discussion to where

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.539 
this goes to a whole discussion to where
Hannah<00:01:17.960> tells<00:01:18.960> all<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:19.950> some<00:01:20.189> footage

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
Hannah tells all and so some footage

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.499 
Hannah tells all and so some footage
about<00:01:20.880> what<00:01:21.119> happened<00:01:21.540> 13<00:01:21.900> years<00:01:21.930> ago<00:01:22.229> when<00:01:22.650> oh

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
about what happened 13 years ago when oh

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.359 
about what happened 13 years ago when oh
the<00:01:24.509> scub<00:01:24.780> burst<00:01:25.020> came<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.650> pretty<00:01:25.920> much<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the scub burst came and pretty much the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.190 
the scub burst came and pretty much the
near<00:01:26.580> box<00:01:26.790> came<00:01:27.119> from<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> scub<00:01:27.689> burst<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
near box came from the scub burst and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.530 
near box came from the scub burst and
then<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.770> was<00:01:28.920> flying<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.579> then<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.820> went<00:01:30.000> like

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
then it was flying and then it went like

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.899 
then it was flying and then it went like
upside<00:01:31.470> down<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.220> record<00:01:32.520> was<00:01:32.610> dropped

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
upside down that in a record was dropped

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.390 
upside down that in a record was dropped
off<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.810> that's<00:01:34.020> why<00:01:34.229> how<00:01:34.619> she<00:01:34.680> fell<00:01:35.100> from<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
off so that's why how she fell from the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.730 
off so that's why how she fell from the
sky<00:01:35.720> pretty<00:01:36.720> much<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.259> always<00:01:37.470> just

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
sky pretty much and I always just

then they came up to this whole thing
where<00:01:43.140> there<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> scientist<00:01:44.369> was<00:01:44.610> noticed

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
where there was a scientist was noticed

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.940 
where there was a scientist was noticed
like<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.119> crackpot<00:01:45.390> scientist<00:01:46.229> who<00:01:46.680> had<00:01:46.920> a

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
like a crackpot scientist who had a

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.730 
like a crackpot scientist who had a
theory<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.780> near<00:01:48.990> boss<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.439> reckon

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
theory that the near boss and I reckon

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.249 
theory that the near boss and I reckon
came<00:01:49.950> from<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.640> whole<00:01:50.970> different<00:01:51.509> world<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
came from a whole different world and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.830 
came from a whole different world and
when<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.950> heard<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.390> course<00:01:54.479> we

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
when I heard that you know of course we

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.359 
when I heard that you know of course we
can<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.110> about<00:01:55.259> what<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:56.040> crazy

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
can think about what with crazy

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.639 
can think about what with crazy
scientists<00:01:57.000> at<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> personal<00:01:57.780> oh<00:01:57.960> they're

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
scientists at a personal oh they're

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.290 
scientists at a personal oh they're
coming

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
coming

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.000 
coming
nonsense<00:01:59.810> when<00:02:00.020> they<00:02:00.110> later<00:02:00.290> on<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.680> end<00:02:00.860> up

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
nonsense when they later on to end up

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.670 
nonsense when they later on to end up
being<00:02:01.190> writing<00:02:01.610> different<00:02:02.060> TV<00:02:02.390> shows<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:03.170> I'm

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
being writing different TV shows and I'm

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.550 
being writing different TV shows and I'm
like<00:02:04.010> okay<00:02:04.760> this<00:02:04.790> makes<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.360> lot<00:02:05.480> of<00:02:05.540> sense<00:02:05.930> and

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
like okay this makes a lot of sense and

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.870 
like okay this makes a lot of sense and
I<00:02:06.740> think<00:02:06.770> that<00:02:07.100> this<00:02:07.220> could<00:02:07.400> be<00:02:07.490> from<00:02:07.790> a

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
I think that this could be from a

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.219 
I think that this could be from a
different<00:02:08.060> world<00:02:08.330> or<00:02:08.630> possibly<00:02:08.930> from<00:02:09.080> a

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
different world or possibly from a

different world or possibly from a

to her world her universe but it makes a

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.130 
to her world her universe but it makes a

don't<00:03:27.260> really<00:03:27.380> add<00:03:27.650> up<00:03:27.680> why<00:03:28.040> they<00:03:28.190> haven't

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
don't really add up why they haven't

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.010 
don't really add up why they haven't
seen<00:03:28.640> certain<00:03:28.940> characters<00:03:29.450> or<00:03:29.660> heard<00:03:29.810> about

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
them it makes a lot of sense that this

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.250 
them it makes a lot of sense that this
could<00:03:31.820> be<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.000> different<00:03:32.570> you<00:03:32.690> know<00:03:32.810> universe
