00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
anything in there at all any so this one

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.000 
anything in there at all any so this one
I<00:00:33.420> can't<00:00:33.690> even<00:00:33.750> use<00:00:34.140> my<00:00:34.440> chickens<00:00:36.920> toward<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
I can't even use my chickens toward the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.950 
I can't even use my chickens toward the
bottom<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:39.469> so<00:00:41.210> that<00:00:42.210> was<00:00:42.420> part<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
bottom out of it so that was part of the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.510 
bottom out of it so that was part of the
the<00:00:43.320> reason<00:00:44.180> for<00:00:45.180> me<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.360> switch<00:00:45.809> over<00:00:45.989> to

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
the reason for me to switch over to

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.819 
the reason for me to switch over to
feeding<00:00:47.520> them<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.719> weeds<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.350> my

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
feeding them the weeds because my

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.010 
feeding them the weeds because my
chickens<00:00:50.190> were<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.629> need<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> lift<00:00:51.870> this

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
chickens were just need to lift this

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.479 
chickens were just need to lift this
thing<00:00:52.079> up<00:00:52.379> higher<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.949> chickens<00:00:53.250> can't

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
thing up higher so the chickens can't

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.670 
thing up higher so the chickens can't
get<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.170> but<00:00:55.170> uh<00:00:56.510> these<00:00:57.510> guys<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:58.260> was<00:00:58.410> kind

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
get to it but uh these guys it was kind

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.490 
get to it but uh these guys it was kind
of<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.800> slow<00:00:59.070> transition<00:00:59.640> just<00:01:00.320> give<00:01:01.320> them

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
of a slow transition just give them

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.170 
of a slow transition just give them
pellets<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.010> getting<00:01:02.219> them<00:01:02.340> grass<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.969> weeds

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
pellets and getting them grass and weeds

pellets and getting them grass and weeds
and<00:01:03.539> stuff<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.409> slowly<00:01:04.909> giving

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
and stuff like that and slowly giving

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.510 
and stuff like that and slowly giving
them<00:01:06.060> more<00:01:06.210> more<00:01:06.540> than<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.619> weeds<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.310> grass

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
them more more than the weeds and grass

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.590 
them more more than the weeds and grass
and<00:01:10.760> they're<00:01:11.760> actually<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.210> little<00:01:12.299> bit<00:01:12.479> more

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and they're actually a little bit more

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.730 
and they're actually a little bit more
active<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.590> they're<00:01:14.250> not<00:01:14.430> eating

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
active now that they're not eating

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.960 
active now that they're not eating
pellets<00:01:17.600> they<00:01:18.600> seem<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:18.960> more<00:01:19.170> energy

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
pellets they seem to have more energy

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.010 
pellets they seem to have more energy
hop<00:01:20.970> around<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.420> cage<00:01:21.630> more<00:01:23.420> more<00:01:24.420> likely<00:01:24.689> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
hop around the cage more more likely to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.770 
hop around the cage more more likely to
try<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> escape<00:01:26.030> now<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.270> they're<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.630> the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.270 
good-sized I just think okay think that
when<00:02:49.360> you're<00:02:49.800> they're<00:02:50.800> probably<00:02:51.010> not<00:02:51.190> going

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
when you're they're probably not going

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.300 
when you're they're probably not going
to<00:02:51.400> put<00:02:51.489> on<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.670> weight<00:02:52.290> for<00:02:53.290> butchering<00:02:54.160> the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
to put on the weight for butchering the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:02.130 
to put on the weight for butchering the
rabbits<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:59.910> definitely<00:03:00.910> you<00:03:01.840> know<00:03:01.959> we're

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
rabbits so definitely you know we're

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.750 
rabbits so definitely you know we're
going<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.410> give<00:03:02.860> them<00:03:03.010> something<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.519> tire

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
going to give them something the tire

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.309 
going to give them something the tire
calorie<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:05.319> put<00:03:05.860> on<00:03:05.950> some<00:03:06.160> more<00:03:06.280> weight<00:03:06.459> I

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
calorie to put on some more weight I

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.960 
calorie to put on some more weight I
know<00:03:08.319> in<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.160> past<00:03:09.190> I've<00:03:09.579> been<00:03:09.610> talking<00:03:09.910> about

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
know in the past I've been talking about

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.740 
know in the past I've been talking about
doing<00:03:10.120> sprouts<00:03:10.739> sprouts<00:03:11.739> I<00:03:12.160> really<00:03:12.880> like<00:03:13.120> but

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
doing sprouts sprouts I really like but

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.250 
doing sprouts sprouts I really like but
it's<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.110> lot<00:03:14.230> of<00:03:14.260> work<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:15.209> had<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.269> problem<00:03:16.810> of

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
it's a lot of work I had a problem of

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.890 
it's a lot of work I had a problem of
just<00:03:17.709> not<00:03:17.920> having<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.280> time<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.900> wash

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
just not having the time to wash

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.819 
just not having the time to wash
everything<00:03:20.290> out<00:03:21.030> all<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.239> time<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.810> think<00:03:23.530> I'd

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
everything out all the time I think I'd

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.710 
everything out all the time I think I'd
probably<00:03:24.070> do<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.400> more<00:03:24.640> during<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:24.970> winter<00:03:25.269> if

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
probably do it more during the winter if

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.580 
probably do it more during the winter if
I<00:03:25.810> had<00:03:25.959> a<00:03:25.989> nice<00:03:26.230> spot<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.560> do<00:03:26.799> it<00:03:28.320> that<00:03:29.320> way<00:03:29.440> they

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
I had a nice spot to do it that way they

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:37.410 
I had a nice spot to do it that way they
can<00:03:29.769> get<00:03:29.920> some<00:03:30.160> fresh<00:03:30.820> greens<00:03:31.150> then<00:03:34.410> bit<00:03:36.420> we

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
can get some fresh greens then bit we

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.560 
can get some fresh greens then bit we
got<00:03:37.570> all<00:03:37.840> kinds<00:03:38.260> of<00:03:38.290> areas<00:03:38.530> out<00:03:38.859> here<00:03:39.280> where<00:03:39.570> we

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
got all kinds of areas out here where we

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.479 
got all kinds of areas out here where we
just<00:03:40.780> don't<00:03:40.930> go<00:03:41.049> with<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.320> mower<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:42.070> that

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
just don't go with the mower and so that

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.660 
just don't go with the mower and so that
allows<00:03:43.380> me<00:03:44.380> plenty<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:44.829> places<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.400> go<00:03:45.640> and

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
allows me plenty of places to go and

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.380 
allows me plenty of places to go and
