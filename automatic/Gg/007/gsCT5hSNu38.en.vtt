be a poem slider let's talk about that

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.950 
be a poem slider let's talk about that
technology<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> little<00:00:32.820> bit<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.450> really

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
technology a little bit it's really

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.650 
technology a little bit it's really
quite<00:00:34.230> simple<00:00:34.700> when<00:00:35.700> most<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.090> us<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> fall

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
quite simple when most of us have a fall

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.939 
quite simple when most of us have a fall
instinctively<00:00:37.320> you're<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.680> put<00:00:37.800> your

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
instinctively you're going to put your

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.189 
instinctively you're going to put your
hands<00:00:38.160> out<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.399> brace<00:00:38.789> the<00:00:39.030> impact<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.930> just

hands out to brace the impact it's just

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:41.750 
hands out to brace the impact it's just
something<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.530> happens<00:00:40.949> automatically<00:00:41.519> a

standard glove with a leather palm could

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.669 
standard glove with a leather palm could
grab<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.539> pavement<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.469> leather

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:46.679 
grab the pavement because the leather

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.160 
grab the pavement because the leather
has<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> different<00:00:47.940> coefficient<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.660> friction

has a different coefficient of friction

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.529 
has a different coefficient of friction
then<00:00:49.769> the<00:00:49.949> plastic<00:00:50.160> plastic<00:00:50.940> slides<00:00:51.239> easy

then the plastic plastic slides easy

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.660 
then the plastic plastic slides easy
leather<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.739> rather<00:00:52.949> grippy

if it grabs what can happen can transfer

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
if it grabs what can happen can transfer
some<00:00:57.210> energy<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> your<00:00:57.690> wrist<00:00:57.960> elbow<00:00:58.499> or
