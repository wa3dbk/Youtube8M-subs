00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.270
 and since we are at Christmas, we believe in this program that is important 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.029
 also talk about the subject has been asked until some 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.809
 metcalfe how many energy accelerates in Colombia or because we have elements like 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.179
 Christmas tree from snowmen and so on 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.799
 It was precisely the question we asked Juan Carlos Llanos and 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:25.519
 more from the valley of sibundoy tina maze student our university and I have 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.919
 told to their traditions, they think about this celebration 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.400
 but there is also a lack of knowledge about the offer and 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.930
 each Christmas 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.740
 efe as I see it suddenly of what I was born more because that time 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.000
 for a time of reflection but there are other elements such as 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.050
 it's not Santa Claus 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.200
 different iconography elements that we do not really know where 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.960
 comes 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.540
 that is for us 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.880
 let's say that Christmas is to continue eating a little more commercially 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.250
 how will you sell 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.510
 so they took a direct flight also from union and must meet 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.570
 with the family 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.260
 the town hall and the indigenous community shirt ballet nature in 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.210
 putumayo 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.910
 is 28 years old and four days ago the city asier audiovisual communication 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.260
 the novelty for me is first of all a moment of reflection moment of waiting 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.350
 where an appraisal to everything that has happened to him in the year 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.530
 it's also like that moment where one then begins to reflect 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.940
 about how he has behaved with other poor people as a citizen too 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.710
 ii Christmas is above all that 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.020
 for its extension 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.860
 muÃ±oz 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.270
 asciz 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.660
 everyone 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.570
 the same thing has happened since more of them we are 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.110
 well, Christmas has to be said that it is something 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.110
 that came with evangelization, colonization and the Catholic religion 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:12.769
 previously 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.219
 this time can suddenly be likened 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:18.269
 much to the time expected from the harvests 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.329
 that is, no 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.759
 in previous times 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.769
 the crops ended at a certain time 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.699
 And that's when another year began another harvest season I was ashamed 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:33.359
 it had a lot to do with the lunar cycle 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.759
 that is to say that suddenly Christmas as 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:38.699
 we knew her 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:42.769
 the lunar calendar the time the consciences and honor the dead 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.509
 accompanied behind unique thousand quintals the spreadsheets and Korean 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.909
 they have nothing to do with our project 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.999
 churches in Latin America to receive this information flow and it is 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.849
 indigenous communities adapt it tandil 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.090
 now has begun to vote differently in different ways also all that 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.040
 legacy that has brought us then the West 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.230
 ii somehow it has been adopted because for example we 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.010
 we also celebrate the ninth we celebrate percent on 24 sometimes we make food 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.100
 but we do it with traditional foods when we make the manger 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.270
 we also do it with the elements from beyond that of the region is 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.500
 say we look for our elements like those of nature and 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.070
 We decorate or dress San Jose we dress the Virgin Mary as a child 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.420
 Jesus according to our particular way also of being of us 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.079
 here for the same rhythm of the city 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.099
 It's a bit difficult how to express those feelings of those emotions 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.169
 we only limit ourselves suddenly to the events that are programmed as the 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.329
 illuminated and all the questions but already 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:52.569
 in the celebration as such as reflection let's say that we were a 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.429
 little in that but the moment we move safely 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:04:00.729
 there is now that meeting with the family is to wait for the new year that 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:05.169
 evaluation that reflection is made around what has happened this time 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.999
 and to start again on this new album a new birth then 

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.700
 he never consumed and returns to prison days of his community 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.570
 eat Sahara and sing Christmas carols in their native language as part of the 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.720
 Attention to Christmas is difficult however difference in the PSOE after a 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.100
 deep reflection by this time they keep their community and hopes that 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.270
 although the arts and continue at least this tradition of meeting and 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.850
 recreation are maintained
