00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.649

 Parliament jokes so do the white city 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.210
 as Sophia Rotaru sang in her song 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.700
 really lost its beauty 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.469
 but whose fault is this obvious to all 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.200
 one of the directs did mayor 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.850

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.420
 makes all the roads look what were 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.440
 under the Soviet regime which roads were 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.450
 nowhere else

 on subbotniks cleaned everywhere 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.329
 the city master is to blame for this act and 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.120
 the residents themselves are also to blame and the mayor of the city 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:31.040
 he who is businesslike must be businesslike 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.630
 inspect all your possessions 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.420
 so that it becomes even more small 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.860
 services if he is not so good everything should 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.410
 there must be some kind of acceptability 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.849
