tomorrow and then you have you go down
and<00:00:10.710> it<00:00:10.800> turns<00:00:11.070> into<00:00:11.219> popliteal<00:00:12.150> vein<00:00:13.820> 77<00:00:14.820> is

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
and it turns into popliteal vein 77 is

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.230 
and it turns into popliteal vein 77 is
popliteal<00:00:15.780> by<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.049> behind<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.070> knee<00:00:18.350> overed

popliteal by the behind the knee overed

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.880 
popliteal by the behind the knee overed
you<00:00:21.240> go<00:00:21.449> down<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:22.699> 76<00:00:24.140> which<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.350> lateral

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
you go down to 76 which is lateral

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.950 
you go down to 76 which is lateral
perineal<00:00:26.789> vein<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:28.550> then<00:00:29.550> I'm<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.480> perineal

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
perineal vein and then I'm the perineal

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.410 
perineal vein and then I'm the perineal
for<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> new<00:00:31.619> yes<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.520> then<00:00:33.360> which<00:00:33.780> one<00:00:33.809> rule<00:00:34.230> 76

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
for a new yes and then which one rule 76

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.770 
for a new yes and then which one rule 76
76<00:00:36.420> okay<00:00:36.870> yes<00:00:37.190> 76<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.340> gonna<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.670> perineal<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
76 okay yes 76 is gonna be perineal and

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:50.360 
76 okay yes 76 is gonna be perineal and
then<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:45.000> then<00:00:45.450> 79<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:47.719> anterior<00:00:48.719> tibialis<00:00:49.370> or

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
then and then 79 is anterior tibialis or

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.740 
then and then 79 is anterior tibialis or
enter<00:00:50.820> tibial<00:00:51.449> mein<00:00:51.719> Sohn<00:00:52.730> 79<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.570> one

enter tibial mein Sohn 79 it's the one

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.869 
enter tibial mein Sohn 79 it's the one
in<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> front<00:00:55.170> from<00:00:55.680> yes<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.850> your

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
in the front from yes so you have your

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.200 
in the front from yes so you have your
anterior<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.199> then<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.730> posterior

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
anterior and then you have the posterior

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.590 
anterior and then you have the posterior
tibial<00:01:00.719> which<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:03.290> posterior<00:01:04.290> lateral<00:01:05.600> see

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
tibial which is a posterior lateral see

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.469 
tibial which is a posterior lateral see
how<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:06.960> anterior<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:08.610> then<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
how this is anterior and then the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.200 
how this is anterior and then the
posterior<00:01:09.960> tibial<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.680> posterior<00:01:11.670> lateral

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
posterior tibial is posterior lateral

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:22.609 
posterior tibial is posterior lateral
and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:13.500> 78<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:15.140> labeled<00:01:16.140> as<00:01:16.350> oh<00:01:21.619> these

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
and then 78 is labeled as oh these

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.149 
and then 78 is labeled as oh these
things<00:01:22.680> oops<00:01:23.900> this<00:01:24.900> one<00:01:25.400> wrong<00:01:26.450> scratch<00:01:27.450> that

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
things oops this one wrong scratch that

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.789 
things oops this one wrong scratch that
Saudi<00:01:29.159> stimulus<00:01:29.729> okay<00:01:30.509> yeah<00:01:31.320> that's<00:01:31.530> right

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
Saudi stimulus okay yeah that's right

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.149 
Saudi stimulus okay yeah that's right
well<00:01:32.369> duh<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:33.990> anterior<00:01:34.590> tibial

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
well duh if this is the anterior tibial

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.260 
well duh if this is the anterior tibial
vein<00:01:36.530> this<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.400> perineal<00:01:38.880> game

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
vein this one is the perineal game

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.740 
vein this one is the perineal game
because<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.259> pair<00:01:40.500> nails<00:01:40.740> are<00:01:41.040> lateral<00:01:41.750> so

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
because the pair nails are lateral so

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.330 
because the pair nails are lateral so
perineal<00:01:43.350> vein<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.950> then<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.890> 170<00:01:46.890> would

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
perineal vein and then so this 170 would

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.030 
perineal vein and then so this 170 would
be<00:01:47.490> posterior<00:01:48.360> tibial<00:01:48.780> Fame<00:01:49.110> which<00:01:49.890> is

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
be posterior tibial Fame which is

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.810 
be posterior tibial Fame which is
posterior<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.909> anterior<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.810> me<00:01:51.960> huh<00:01:52.140> and

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
posterior to the anterior to me huh and

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.450 
posterior to the anterior to me huh and
medial<00:01:54.470> medial<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.119> perineal<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:58.460> then

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
medial medial to the perineal and then

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.310 
medial medial to the perineal and then
you<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.360> down<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.869> plant<00:02:01.229> our<00:02:01.939> veins<00:02:03.320> which

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
you go down to the plant our veins which

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.119 
you go down to the plant our veins which
is<00:02:04.350> 82<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.990> digital<00:02:07.259> veins<00:02:07.740> which<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.280> 80

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
is 82 to the digital veins which is 80

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.860 
is 82 to the digital veins which is 80
okay<00:02:11.300> yeah<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:12.989> digital<00:02:13.800> veins<00:02:14.010> planter

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
okay yeah so digital veins planter

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.040 
okay yeah so digital veins planter
arches<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:17.040> go<00:02:17.250> up<00:02:17.520> into<00:02:17.879> your<00:02:18.660> anterior

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
arches you go up into your anterior

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.860 
arches you go up into your anterior
tibial<00:02:19.590> vein<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.190> your<00:02:20.849> posterior<00:02:21.360> tibial

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
tibial vein and your posterior tibial

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.180 
tibial vein and your posterior tibial
vein<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.470> your<00:02:23.300> perineal<00:02:24.300> vein<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:25.709> goes<00:02:25.920> up

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
vein and your perineal vein it goes up

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.729 
vein and your perineal vein it goes up
to<00:02:26.790> your<00:02:27.200> popliteal<00:02:28.200> vein<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:30.349> then<00:02:31.349> this<00:02:31.530> is

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
to your popliteal vein and then this is

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.520 
to your popliteal vein and then this is
your<00:02:31.769> femoral<00:02:32.370> vein<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:33.410> then<00:02:34.410> back<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:35.459> 73<00:02:36.150> is

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
your femoral vein and then back to 73 is

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.199 
your femoral vein and then back to 73 is
the<00:02:37.530> deep<00:02:38.010> femoral<00:02:38.489> so<00:02:38.910> femoral<00:02:39.390> deep<00:02:40.230> femoral

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
the deep femoral so femoral deep femoral

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.910 
the deep femoral so femoral deep femoral
society<00:02:42.209> total<00:02:42.480> making<00:02:42.660> female<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:43.890> is

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
society total making female so this is

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.430 
society total making female so this is
the<00:02:44.099> femoral<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:44.910> from<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.330> popliteal<00:02:45.930> it

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
the femoral so from the popliteal it

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.910 
the femoral so from the popliteal it
turns<00:02:47.010> into<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.610> femoral<00:02:47.879> and<00:02:48.599> then<00:02:49.379> branches

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
turns into the femoral and then branches

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.809 
turns into the femoral and then branches
down<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.580> goes<00:02:50.790> deep<00:02:51.180> too<00:02:51.629> deep<00:02:52.400> femoral<00:02:53.400> and

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
down and goes deep too deep femoral and

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.530 
down and goes deep too deep femoral and
then<00:02:54.540> running<00:02:55.080> alongside<00:02:55.790> medially<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.360> the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
then running alongside medially to the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.030 
then running alongside medially to the
femoral<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.440> great<00:02:58.650> saphenous<00:03:00.769> 70<00:03:01.769> and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
femoral is the great saphenous 70 and

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.509 
femoral is the great saphenous 70 and
then<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.970> go<00:03:03.150> up<00:03:03.920> nothing<00:03:04.920> great<00:03:05.129> self<00:03:05.400> a

femoral and they go into the external
iliac<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.930> then<00:03:28.860> internal<00:03:29.580> iliac<00:03:29.879> is<00:03:30.180> behind

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
iliac and then internal iliac is behind

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.030 
iliac and then internal iliac is behind
it<00:03:30.810> here<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.819> then<00:03:32.819> from<00:03:33.269> there<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.870> do<00:03:34.799> your

it here and then from there you do your

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.940 
it here and then from there you do your
they<00:03:35.610> run<00:03:35.849> into<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.690> common<00:03:37.110> iliac<00:03:37.379> as<00:03:37.830> you

they run into the common iliac as you

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.699 
they run into the common iliac as you
can<00:03:38.069> see<00:03:38.310> it's<00:03:38.489> common<00:03:39.030> here<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:40.500> thick<00:03:40.680> part
