beautiful now let him stretch all the
way<00:01:38.970> down<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:40.259> once<00:01:40.500> again<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:40.829> see<00:01:41.009> how

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
way down but once again we see how

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.639 
way down but once again we see how
important<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.030> let<00:01:42.390> these<00:01:42.630> horses<00:01:43.079> just

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
important is to let these horses just

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.139 
important is to let these horses just
because<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> high<00:01:44.610> neck<00:01:44.670> set

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
because they have a high neck set

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.609 
because they have a high neck set
doesn't<00:01:45.450> mean<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:45.659> keep<00:01:45.899> them<00:01:46.140> there<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.470> have

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
doesn't mean we keep them there we have

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.139 
doesn't mean we keep them there we have
to<00:01:46.740> let<00:01:46.920> them<00:01:47.070> stretch<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.850> their<00:01:48.000> backs

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
to let them stretch so that their backs

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.389 
to let them stretch so that their backs
can<00:01:48.540> develop<00:01:48.990> then<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.770> bring<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> head<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
the middle of the neck where we need

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.200 
the middle of the neck where we need
them<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.830> lengthen<00:02:50.400> out<00:02:50.550> from<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.850> base<00:02:51.030> of
