00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Pure Land

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.500
Lyrics by Huafang, music by LI Jie, performed by SUN Nan

00:00:09.916 --> 00:00:16.150
Legend says there is a pure land.

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:21.904
Ancient ethnic groups are living there.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.847
Everyone there is good at singing and dancing. 

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:33.746
People there never feel lonely.

00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:39.694
Legend says there is a snow-topped mountain.

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:44.705
White clouds are drifting on the mountain-top.

00:00:45.876 --> 00:00:50.883
A dream comes and goes.

00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:56.922
One should understand its message gradually.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:29.258
Legend says there is a pure land.

00:01:29.493 --> 00:01:34.923
People there are living in sunshine.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.866
My heart is not drifting any more.

00:01:41.146 --> 00:01:46.948
It wants to return to the cottage in my dreams.

00:02:10.723 --> 00:02:15.825
The pure land in legends.

00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:22.054
The only one destination for us.

00:02:22.378 --> 00:02:27.713
The happiness ever blurred in mind

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:33.614
Becoming clearer and clearer.
