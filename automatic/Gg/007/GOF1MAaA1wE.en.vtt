at<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> very<00:00:51.420> end<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.320> kind<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:52.800> switched

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
at the very end it kind of just switched

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.490 
at the very end it kind of just switched
over<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.430> trying<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> win<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.360> at<00:00:55.079> any<00:00:55.260> point

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
this is playing into my hands I might be

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.819 
this is playing into my hands I might be
able<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.859> pull<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.219> off<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.640> win<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.940> um<00:01:00.300> no

honestly<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.070> was<00:01:02.190> never<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.609> a

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
honestly that was never really a

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.880 
honestly that was never really a
conscious<00:01:03.180> thought<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.510> my<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.960> my<00:01:04.019> brain<00:01:04.650> it

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
conscious thought in my in my brain it

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.609 
conscious thought in my in my brain it
was<00:01:05.060> like<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.180> was<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.540> focused<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.140> making

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
was like I was so focused on just making

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.780 
was like I was so focused on just making
the<00:01:07.710> team<00:01:07.890> being<00:01:08.159> top<00:01:08.430> three<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:10.890> that's<00:01:11.490> all

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the team being top three that that's all

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.850 
the team being top three that that's all
I<00:01:11.820> was<00:01:12.299> really<00:01:12.900> thinking<00:01:13.080> about<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.650> then

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
I was really thinking about and then

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.160 
I was really thinking about and then
there's<00:01:14.700> only<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.180> point<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.540> every<00:01:15.930> race

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
there's only the point in every race

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.429 
there's only the point in every race
where<00:01:16.770> no<00:01:17.520> matter<00:01:17.729> what<00:01:18.689> she's<00:01:18.930> been<00:01:19.110> thinking

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
where no matter what she's been thinking

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.440 
where no matter what she's been thinking
about<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:19.799> you're<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:20.369> for<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> PR<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.270> you're

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
about if you're going for a PR if you're

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.609 
about if you're going for a PR if you're
going<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:21.990> anything<00:01:22.439> else<00:01:22.740> top<00:01:23.310> three<00:01:24.619> if

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
going for anything else top three if

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.410 
going for anything else top three if
there's<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.100> chance<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.729> win<00:01:26.880> something<00:01:27.119> just

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
there's a chance to win something just

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.350 
there's a chance to win something just
switches<00:01:27.900> over<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:30.090> for<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
switches over and you just go for the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
meters when they went around me

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.350 
meters when they went around me
something<00:01:37.470> flipped<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.369> was<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:39.119> train

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
something flipped and it was just train

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
win so what was that first initial

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.940 
win so what was that first initial
feeling<00:01:42.840> after<00:01:43.110> crossing<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.560> finish<00:01:43.920> line

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
on the team and so it made it a lot

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.130

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.320 
harder when I didn't make the team it
was<00:02:50.380> cuz<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:51.040> thought<00:02:51.310> hadn't<00:02:51.940> crossed<00:02:51.970> my
