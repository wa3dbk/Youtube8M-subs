based<00:00:24.180> off<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.539> video<00:00:24.660> game<00:00:25.019> don't<00:00:25.529> starve<00:00:25.800> so

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
based off the video game don't starve so

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.370 
based off the video game don't starve so
I<00:00:26.519> haven't<00:00:26.910> played<00:00:27.210> then<00:00:27.539> starved<00:00:27.869> myself<00:00:28.019> but

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
I haven't played then starved myself but

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.810 
I haven't played then starved myself but
I<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.590> seen<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> few<00:00:28.890> YouTube<00:00:29.099> videos<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.580> it

and<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.060> does<00:00:30.269> look<00:00:30.510> pretty<00:00:30.539> cool<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> should

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.229 
item first before I go into too much
detail<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.399> only<00:00:44.640> item<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.090> can

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
detail so the only item that you can

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.180 
detail so the only item that you can
make<00:00:45.390> here<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.780> called<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> eye<00:00:46.260> bone<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.039> this

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
make here is called the eye bone so this

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.819 
make here is called the eye bone so this
is<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.550> summoning<00:00:47.969> device<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.870> Chester<00:00:49.379> now

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
is the summoning device for Chester now

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.410 
is the summoning device for Chester now
Chester<00:00:50.190> isn't<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> hostile<00:00:50.940> mob<00:00:51.120> or<00:00:51.270> anything

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
Chester isn't a hostile mob or anything

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.000 
Chester isn't a hostile mob or anything
like<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.660> he<00:00:51.989> works<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.649> he's<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
like that he works for you he's a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.979 
like that he works for you he's a
passive<00:00:53.430> mob<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.059> think<00:00:54.270> about<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.600> as<00:00:54.690> kind<00:00:54.750> of

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
passive mob so think about it as kind of

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.049 
passive mob so think about it as kind of
like<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.170> useful<00:00:55.800> walking<00:00:56.430> storage<00:00:56.850> because

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
like a useful walking storage because

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.880 
like a useful walking storage because
that's<00:00:57.180> essentially<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
that's essentially what it is so the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.470 
that's essentially what it is so the
crafting<00:00:59.219> recipe<00:00:59.520> very<00:00:59.879> straightforward

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
crafting recipe very straightforward

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.420 
crafting recipe very straightforward

just one eye of ender and one bone and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.799 
just one eye of ender and one bone and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
like you see you see this sort of nice

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.050 
like you see you see this sort of nice
fairly<00:02:25.410> colorful<00:02:26.040> wood<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.610> actually<00:02:26.880> gets

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
fairly colorful wood it actually gets

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.280 
fairly colorful wood it actually gets
upgraded<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.600> something<00:02:27.870> which<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> little

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
upgraded to something which is a little

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.900 
upgraded to something which is a little
bit<00:02:28.590> more<00:02:28.680> similar<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.280> spruce<00:02:29.520> wood<00:02:29.700> and

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
bit more similar to the spruce wood and

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.400 
bit more similar to the spruce wood and
I<00:02:30.360> do<00:02:30.420> believe<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.750> when<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:31.020> gets<00:02:31.200> upgraded

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
I do believe that when it gets upgraded

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.990 
I do believe that when it gets upgraded
it<00:02:31.800> does<00:02:31.950> have<00:02:32.160> some<00:02:32.310> more<00:02:32.430> item<00:02:32.730> slots

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
it does have some more item slots

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.350 
it does have some more item slots
however<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:34.380> recipe<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.430> secret<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.270> the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
however this recipe is a secret so the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.060 
however this recipe is a secret so the
mod<00:02:36.510> maker<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.930> not<00:02:37.200> telling<00:02:37.530> anyone<00:02:37.710> how<00:02:38.010> to

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
mod maker is not telling anyone how to

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.590 
mod maker is not telling anyone how to
do<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.610> which<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.970> little<00:02:39.270> bit<00:02:39.420> bizarre

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600

thing<00:03:17.220> about<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.550> is<00:03:17.640> if<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.820> actually<00:03:18.030> use

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
thing about it is if you actually use

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.120 
thing about it is if you actually use
the<00:03:18.390> iPhone<00:03:18.750> again<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.650> doesn't<00:03:19.890> let<00:03:20.070> you

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
the iPhone again it doesn't let you

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.560 
the iPhone again it doesn't let you
summon<00:03:20.340> another<00:03:20.550> Chester<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.270> says<00:03:21.420> this

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
summon another Chester so it says this

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.150 
summon another Chester so it says this
bone<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:21.930> already<00:03:22.200> summon<00:03:22.500> Chester<00:03:22.890> but<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
bone is already summon Chester but the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.560 
bone is already summon Chester but the
cool<00:03:23.280> thing<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.490> you<00:03:23.610> can<00:03:23.730> actually<00:03:24.060> have<00:03:24.390> as

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
cool thing is you can actually have as

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.240 
cool thing is you can actually have as
many<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.840> these<00:03:24.990> as<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.230> really<00:03:25.620> want<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.040> kind

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
many of these as you really want to kind

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.040 
many of these as you really want to kind
of<00:03:26.310> sort<00:03:26.490> follow<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:26.880> around<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.930> upgrade

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
of sort follow you around so the upgrade

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.170 
of sort follow you around so the upgrade
isn't<00:03:28.530> essential<00:03:28.860> if<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.550> can't<00:03:29.820> figure<00:03:30.030> it

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
isn't essential if you can't figure it

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.640 
isn't essential if you can't figure it
out<00:03:30.300> so<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:30.600> just<00:03:30.720> have<00:03:31.050> to<00:03:31.140> craft<00:03:31.320> yourself

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
out so you just have to craft yourself

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.080 
out so you just have to craft yourself
another<00:03:31.830> eye<00:03:32.010> bone<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.370> get<00:03:32.520> burned<00:03:32.880> then<00:03:33.000> you

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
another eye bone you get burned then you

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.550 
another eye bone you get burned then you
go<00:03:33.210> boom<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.870> then<00:03:34.020> you've<00:03:34.200> got<00:03:34.350> three<00:03:34.530> of

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
go boom and then you've got three of

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.850 
go boom and then you've got three of
them

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
them

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.510 
them

backpack slots are kind of cool it is a
little<00:03:45.630> bit<00:03:45.750> cooler<00:03:45.960> than<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.230> backpack<00:03:46.560> mod

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
little bit cooler than the backpack mod

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.410 
little bit cooler than the backpack mod
as<00:03:46.860> well<00:03:47.040> for<00:03:47.190> extra<00:03:47.400> storage<00:03:47.580> because<00:03:48.210> I<00:03:48.270> mean

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
as well for extra storage because I mean

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.540 
as well for extra storage because I mean
look<00:03:48.570> at<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.780> it's<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.230> awesome<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:50.010> also

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
look at it it's so awesome and also

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.710 
look at it it's so awesome and also
another<00:03:50.760> cool<00:03:50.910> thing<00:03:51.090> about<00:03:51.180> them<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.510> they<00:03:51.630> do

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
another cool thing about them is they do

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.080 
another cool thing about them is they do
actually<00:03:51.990> have<00:03:52.080> 30<00:03:52.410> health<00:03:53.250> points<00:03:53.610> however

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
actually have 30 health points however

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.820 
actually have 30 health points however
they<00:03:54.240> cannot<00:03:54.510> be<00:03:54.660> damaged<00:03:55.020> by<00:03:55.230> natural

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
they cannot be damaged by natural

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.470 
they cannot be damaged by natural
elements<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.490> stuff<00:03:56.700> so<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.060> will<00:03:57.180> stay

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
elements and stuff so it will stay

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.970 
elements and stuff so it will stay
perfectly<00:03:57.900> alive<00:03:58.140> in<00:03:58.290> lava<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.740> if<00:03:58.800> you<00:03:58.890> do

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
perfectly alive in lava so if you do

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.170 
perfectly alive in lava so if you do
pack<00:03:59.220> your<00:03:59.400> diamonds<00:03:59.670> into<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.060> or<00:04:00.150> something

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
pack your diamonds into it or something

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.940 
pack your diamonds into it or something
if<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:01.020> does<00:04:01.140> fall<00:04:01.320> in<00:04:01.410> love<00:04:01.620> which<00:04:01.830> it

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
if it does fall in love which it

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.740 
if it does fall in love which it
probably<00:04:02.160> is<00:04:02.370> going<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.640> it's<00:04:03.180> not<00:04:03.420> gonna<00:04:03.540> get

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
probably is going to it's not gonna get

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.060 
probably is going to it's not gonna get
damaged<00:04:04.050> by<00:04:04.200> them<00:04:04.380> which<00:04:04.500> is<00:04:04.650> pretty<00:04:04.860> nifty

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
damaged by them which is pretty nifty

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.810 
damaged by them which is pretty nifty

finish them off if you really want to I
don't<00:04:18.750> know<00:04:18.840> why<00:04:18.960> you<00:04:19.020> don't<00:04:19.320> see<00:04:19.500> but<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:19.710> can

do<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.250> they<00:04:20.460> will<00:04:20.580> drop<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:20.940> items<00:04:21.299> which

do and they will drop the items which
are<00:04:21.900> inside<00:04:22.380> them<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:22.590> that's<00:04:22.860> pretty<00:04:23.040> cool<00:04:23.310> um

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
would really like to see in it so the

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.110 
would really like to see in it so the
first<00:04:39.130> thing<00:04:39.280> I'd<00:04:39.370> like<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.550> see<00:04:39.760> is<00:04:39.880> a<00:04:39.910> way<00:04:40.060> to

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
first thing I'd like to see is a way to

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.120 
first thing I'd like to see is a way to
kind<00:04:40.360> of<00:04:40.510> park<00:04:40.780> him<00:04:40.990> so<00:04:41.440> he<00:04:41.590> won't<00:04:41.740> follow<00:04:41.980> you

around<00:04:42.220> I<00:04:42.670> don't<00:04:43.270> know<00:04:43.480> if<00:04:43.570> there's<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:43.780> way<00:04:43.900> to

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
around I don't know if there's a way to

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.690 
around I don't know if there's a way to
do<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.260> but<00:04:44.380> I<00:04:44.410> don't<00:04:44.650> think<00:04:44.860> so<00:04:45.190> so<00:04:45.550> maybe

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
do that but I don't think so so maybe

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.040 
do that but I don't think so so maybe
right-clicking<00:04:46.210> shift<00:04:46.510> right-clicking<00:04:46.900> with

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
right-clicking shift right-clicking with

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.660 
right-clicking shift right-clicking with
the<00:04:47.140> eye<00:04:47.170> down<00:04:47.290> and<00:04:47.710> it<00:04:47.770> could<00:04:47.890> sort<00:04:48.130> of<00:04:48.190> stop<00:04:48.430> a

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
the eye down and it could sort of stop a

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.100 
the eye down and it could sort of stop a
bit<00:04:48.910> like<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.060> wolf<00:04:49.360> would<00:04:49.540> be<00:04:49.660> kind<00:04:49.870> of<00:04:49.900> useful

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
bit like a wolf would be kind of useful

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.420 
bit like a wolf would be kind of useful
because<00:04:50.440> otherwise<00:04:50.650> he<00:04:50.860> is<00:04:50.890> following<00:04:51.280> you

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
because otherwise he is following you

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.920 
because otherwise he is following you
around<00:04:51.490> indefinitely<00:04:51.850> although<00:04:52.690> he<00:04:52.780> doesn't

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
around indefinitely although he doesn't

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.020 
around indefinitely although he doesn't
really<00:04:53.110> make<00:04:53.290> too<00:04:53.320> much<00:04:53.560> of<00:04:53.620> a<00:04:53.770> fuss<00:04:53.980> which<00:04:54.880> is

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
really make too much of a fuss which is

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.520 
really make too much of a fuss which is
kind<00:04:55.210> of<00:04:55.240> cool<00:04:55.390> and<00:04:55.630> then<00:04:55.900> secondly<00:04:56.290> I'd

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
kind of cool and then secondly I'd

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.500 
kind of cool and then secondly I'd
really<00:04:56.830> like<00:04:56.980> to<00:04:57.130> see<00:04:57.280> some<00:04:57.550> kind<00:04:57.760> of<00:04:57.940> AI<00:04:58.120> where

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
really like to see some kind of AI where

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.510 
really like to see some kind of AI where
