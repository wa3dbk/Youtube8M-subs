00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
it's a very thin keyboard as well it's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.060 
it's a very thin keyboard as well it's
not<00:00:57.120> really<00:00:57.449> an<00:00:57.539> ergonomic<00:00:58.260> keyboard<00:00:58.710> that

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
not really an ergonomic keyboard that

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.410 
not really an ergonomic keyboard that
you<00:00:59.190> might<00:00:59.370> see<00:00:59.579> where<00:00:59.760> they<00:00:59.879> kind<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.180> bend

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
you might see where they kind of bend

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.299 
you might see where they kind of bend
the<00:01:00.510> keyboard<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.140> twist<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.160> more

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the keyboard and twist it so it's more

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.820 
the keyboard and twist it so it's more
natural<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.690> lot<00:01:04.110> about<00:01:04.290> design

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
natural but this is a lot about design

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.500 
natural but this is a lot about design
as<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.430> matter<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.729> fact<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.390> imagine

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
as a matter of fact if you can imagine

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.469 
as a matter of fact if you can imagine
this<00:01:07.610> keyboard<00:01:08.610> here<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.119> dark<00:01:09.390> room

made such a nice keyboard they put this

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.010 
made such a nice keyboard they put this
cable<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.790> would<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.689> liked<00:01:42.930> to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
cable on it and I would have liked to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.200 
cable on it and I would have liked to
seen<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.530> Wireless<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.549> again<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.119> know

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
seen that be Wireless but again you know

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.510 
seen that be Wireless but again you know
to<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> power<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.590> illumination

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
to get the power to do the illumination

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.460 
to get the power to do the illumination
you<00:01:47.909> probably<00:01:48.149> need<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:49.229> so

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
you probably need to have that there so

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.499 
you probably need to have that there so
