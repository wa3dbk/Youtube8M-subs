but<00:04:05.180> you<00:04:05.329> put<00:04:05.510> this<00:04:05.659> thing<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:06.079> minus-10<00:04:06.650> you

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
but you put this thing to minus-10 you

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.520 
but you put this thing to minus-10 you
crank<00:04:07.640> this<00:04:07.760> thing<00:04:07.819> up<00:04:08.120> to<00:04:08.390> minus<00:04:08.750> or<00:04:08.930> plus<00:04:09.230> 6

crank this thing up to minus or plus 6

crank this thing up to minus or plus 6
dB<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.189> it's<00:04:10.400> you<00:04:10.670> know<00:04:10.700> it's<00:04:11.120> annoyingly<00:04:11.599> bad

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.670 
so in the real world we always kind of
like<00:04:16.940> bring<00:04:17.419> it<00:04:17.539> down<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.900> minus<00:04:18.259> 12<00:04:18.500> DB

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.039 
like bring it down to minus 12 DB

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
so why would that happen I don't know

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.640 
so why would that happen I don't know
it's<00:05:20.389> good<00:05:20.570> question<00:05:20.960> something<00:05:21.349> going<00:05:21.470> on

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
it's good question something going on

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.760 
it's good question something going on
inside<00:05:21.919> this<00:05:22.070> camera<00:05:22.310> now<00:05:23.150> if<00:05:23.599> I<00:05:23.900> put<00:05:24.169> plug<00:05:24.560> in

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
inside this camera now if I put plug in

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.640 
inside this camera now if I put plug in
the<00:05:25.639> both<00:05:25.970> of<00:05:26.000> those<00:05:26.270> mics<00:05:26.539> plus<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.440> video

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
the both of those mics plus the video

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.490 
the both of those mics plus the video
mic<00:05:27.860> Pro<00:05:27.889> I<00:05:28.580> get<00:05:29.389> the<00:05:29.479> problem<00:05:29.810> I<00:05:29.990> can<00:05:30.229> hear<00:05:30.409> it

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
mic Pro I get the problem I can hear it

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.570 
mic Pro I get the problem I can hear it
but<00:05:30.620> only<00:05:30.800> in<00:05:31.190> that<00:05:31.460> channel<00:05:31.729> okay<00:05:32.360> so<00:05:33.580> that's

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
but only in that channel okay so that's

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.219 
but only in that channel okay so that's
what<00:05:34.760> I<00:05:34.789> found<00:05:35.120> it's<00:05:35.720> a<00:05:35.810> little<00:05:36.050> frustrating

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
what I found it's a little frustrating

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.879 
what I found it's a little frustrating
it's<00:05:37.190> it's<00:05:38.050> there's<00:05:39.050> a<00:05:39.110> little<00:05:39.650> bit<00:05:39.740> of<00:05:39.830> a

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
it's it's there's a little bit of a

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.370 
it's it's there's a little bit of a
workaround<00:05:40.220> here<00:05:40.669> if<00:05:41.389> you<00:05:41.599> like<00:05:41.870> again<00:05:42.139> if<00:05:42.289> you

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
workaround here if you like again if you

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.230 
workaround here if you like again if you
if<00:05:42.620> you<00:05:42.740> just<00:05:43.039> keep<00:05:43.400> your<00:05:43.460> camera<00:05:43.970> set<00:05:44.210> to

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
if you just keep your camera set to

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.439 
if you just keep your camera set to
minus<00:05:44.720> 12<00:05:44.930> dB<00:05:45.409> okay<00:05:46.099> and<00:05:46.370> you<00:05:46.490> adjust<00:05:46.940> the

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449 
minus 12 dB okay and you adjust the

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.020 
minus 12 dB okay and you adjust the
video<00:05:47.570> mic<00:05:47.900> Pro<00:05:47.930> again<00:05:48.680> to<00:05:49.010> zero<00:05:49.460> dB

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
video mic Pro again to zero dB

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.640 
video mic Pro again to zero dB
you<00:05:50.360> know<00:05:50.479> it's<00:05:50.659> not<00:05:50.810> going<00:05:50.960> to<00:05:51.050> be<00:05:51.110> as<00:05:51.229> punchy

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
you know it's not going to be as punchy

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.760 
you know it's not going to be as punchy
you<00:05:52.070> know<00:05:52.159> is<00:05:52.370> it<00:05:52.490> would<00:05:52.639> be<00:05:52.789> at<00:05:53.120> minus<00:05:53.510> 10<00:05:53.770> but

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
you know is it would be at minus 10 but

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.890 
you know is it would be at minus 10 but
it's<00:05:55.520> clean<00:05:55.820> okay

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
it's clean okay

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.930 
it's clean okay
an<00:05:57.229> experimental<00:05:57.800> it<00:05:58.009> you<00:05:58.220> can<00:05:58.490> get<00:05:58.550> a<00:05:58.610> couple

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
an experimental it you can get a couple

it's<00:06:02.449> a<00:06:02.599> workaround<00:06:02.960> okay<00:06:03.349> I<00:06:03.380> don't<00:06:03.650> have<00:06:03.919> a

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
it's a workaround okay I don't have a

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:05.830 
it's a workaround okay I don't have a
full<00:06:04.310> solution<00:06:04.580> the<00:06:04.849> only<00:06:05.060> solution<00:06:05.570> I<00:06:05.659> can

full solution the only solution I can

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.920 
full solution the only solution I can
tell<00:06:06.050> you<00:06:06.199> that<00:06:06.440> works<00:06:06.800> is<00:06:07.159> using<00:06:07.970> you<00:06:08.810> know

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
tell you that works is using you know

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.800 
tell you that works is using you know
this<00:06:09.169> mic<00:06:09.380> the<00:06:09.710> the<00:06:09.979> røde<00:06:10.190> lavalier<00:06:10.219> or<00:06:11.000> your

maybe your wireless system like like the

mm or even like electro sonic or
something<00:06:18.110> I<00:06:18.140> haven't<00:06:18.260> tried<00:06:18.560> that<00:06:18.590> yet<00:06:18.830> that

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
something I haven't tried that yet that

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.600 
something I haven't tried that yet that
might<00:06:19.820> be<00:06:20.120> a<00:06:20.150> solution<00:06:20.710> but<00:06:21.710> until<00:06:22.010> Panasonic

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
might be a solution but until Panasonic

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.670 
might be a solution but until Panasonic
can<00:06:22.730> figure<00:06:22.940> it<00:06:23.120> out<00:06:23.270> that's<00:06:24.020> what<00:06:24.290> we<00:06:24.380> have<00:06:24.530> to

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
can figure it out that's what we have to

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.370 
can figure it out that's what we have to
do<00:06:24.830> so<00:06:25.340> what<00:06:25.640> I'm<00:06:25.730> asking<00:06:26.210> is<00:06:26.360> if<00:06:26.660> you<00:06:26.780> guys<00:06:26.990> can

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
do so what I'm asking is if you guys can

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.400 
do so what I'm asking is if you guys can
contribute<00:06:28.370> to<00:06:28.580> this<00:06:28.820> and<00:06:29.180> let<00:06:29.600> me<00:06:29.690> know<00:06:29.870> what

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.410 
contribute to this and let me know what

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.820 
contribute to this and let me know what
mics<00:06:30.830> you've<00:06:31.430> tried<00:06:31.820> that<00:06:31.880> work<00:06:32.420> okay<00:06:33.260> that

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
mics you've tried that work okay that

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.110 
mics you've tried that work okay that
would<00:06:34.040> be<00:06:34.130> really<00:06:34.370> helpful<00:06:34.520> and<00:06:34.760> then<00:06:34.880> we<00:06:34.970> may

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
would be really helpful and then we may

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.970 
would be really helpful and then we may
we<00:06:35.210> can<00:06:35.330> get<00:06:35.420> a<00:06:35.450> little<00:06:35.630> database<00:06:36.440> going<00:06:36.710> or

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
we can get a little database going or

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.690 
we can get a little database going or
something<00:06:37.280> like<00:06:37.400> that

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
something like that
