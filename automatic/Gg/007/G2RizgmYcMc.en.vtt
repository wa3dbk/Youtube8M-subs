00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
I think also that he even though he's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.340 
I think also that he even though he's
dead<00:01:35.220> right<00:01:35.400> now<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.909> think<00:01:36.540> he<00:01:36.750> was<00:01:36.900> one<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
dead right now I think he was one of the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.310 
dead right now I think he was one of the
guys<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.790> mean<00:01:39.390> he<00:01:39.509> was<00:01:39.689> planning<00:01:40.110> ahead

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
guys that I mean he was planning ahead

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.039 
guys that I mean he was planning ahead
so<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> think<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.369> already<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:42.119> when<00:01:42.659> he<00:01:42.780> died

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
so I think you already have when he died

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.530 
so I think you already have when he died
he<00:01:43.079> knew<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.159> Howard<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> next<00:01:45.060> generation

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
he knew the Howard the next generation

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.719 
he knew the Howard the next generation
iphone<00:01:45.840> would<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:47.100> don't<00:01:47.340> think<00:01:47.640> that

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
iphone would be and I don't think that

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.520 
iphone would be and I don't think that
he<00:01:48.060> was<00:01:48.360> planning<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.020> would<00:01:49.170> have<00:01:49.320> four

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
he was planning that it would have four

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.499 
he was planning that it would have four
point<00:01:49.710> six<00:01:49.829> inch<00:01:50.070> display<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.119> still<00:01:51.360> do

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
point six inch display so I still do

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.880 
point six inch display so I still do
believe<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.750> they're<00:01:51.990> gonna<00:01:52.110> use<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.619> same

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
believe that they're gonna use the same

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.249 
believe that they're gonna use the same
kind<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.220> 3.5<00:01:53.939> inch<00:01:54.119> display<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:55.079> what

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
kind of 3.5 inch display but what
