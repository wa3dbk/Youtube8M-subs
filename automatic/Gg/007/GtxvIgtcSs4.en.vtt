okay<00:02:00.510> this<00:02:01.230> is<00:02:01.320> one<00:02:01.470> of<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.620> easiest<00:02:01.860> ways<00:02:02.130> to

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
okay this is one of the easiest ways to

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.840 
okay this is one of the easiest ways to
hang<00:02:02.550> it

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
hang it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.910 
hang it
you<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.420> hang<00:02:03.600> each<00:02:03.990> hook<00:02:04.170> individually<00:02:04.800> if

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
you can hang each hook individually if

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.950 
you can hang each hook individually if
you'd<00:02:05.040> like<00:02:05.220> but<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.300> is<00:02:06.360> pretty<00:02:06.630> simple

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.050
