out<00:00:46.760> but<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:48.090> definitely<00:00:48.329> something<00:00:48.660> that's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
out but it's definitely something that's

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
voice soft phone app you probably don't

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.279 
voice soft phone app you probably don't
want<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.930> want<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.110> build

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
want to do that if you want to build

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.939

but yeah that frankly that's out of my
bailiwick<00:01:02.789> that's<00:01:03.329> out<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.570> what<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.019> would

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
bailiwick that's out of what I would

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.780 
bailiwick that's out of what I would
normally<00:01:04.500> do<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.369> don't<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.670> think

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
normally do and I don't really think

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.480 
normally do and I don't really think
it's<00:01:06.299> necessary<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.860> soft<00:01:08.159> phone's

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
it's necessary for you the soft phone's

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.520 
it's necessary for you the soft phone's
the<00:01:08.760> hard<00:01:09.000> phones<00:01:09.299> or<00:01:09.570> servers<00:01:09.960> all<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.439> this

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the hard phones or servers all of this

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.039 
the hard phones or servers all of this
stuff<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.040> already<00:01:11.340> available<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.600> is

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
much easier and much more cost effective

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.420 
much easier and much more cost effective
to<00:01:15.150> simply<00:01:15.180> go<00:01:15.659> out<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.080> buy<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.409> product<00:01:16.979> so

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
to simply go out and buy the product so

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.980 
to simply go out and buy the product so
you're<00:01:17.549> gonna<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.540> decided

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.510 
you're gonna be going if you decided
that<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.350> wanted<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.740> deploy<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> VoIP<00:01:20.490> voice

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
that you wanted to deploy a VoIP voice

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.719 
that you wanted to deploy a VoIP voice
over<00:01:21.030> IP<00:01:21.299> within<00:01:21.750> your<00:01:22.080> environment

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
over IP within your environment

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.649 
over IP within your environment
relatively<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.909> simple<00:01:24.330> thing<00:01:24.360> for

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
relatively it's a simple thing for

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.940 
relatively it's a simple thing for
infrastructure<00:01:25.140> basically<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.830> your

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
infrastructure basically you have your

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.929 
infrastructure basically you have your
VoIP<00:01:26.400> server<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> voice<00:01:27.570> over<00:01:27.869> IP<00:01:28.020> server<00:01:28.530> a

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
VoIP server to a voice over IP server a

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.280 
VoIP server to a voice over IP server a
lot<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.060> people<00:01:30.299> use<00:01:30.689> something<00:01:31.259> called

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
lot of people use something called

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.120 
lot of people use something called
asterisk<00:01:32.130> or<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.820> derivative<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:34.110> asterisk<00:01:34.860> so

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
asterisk or a derivative of asterisk so

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.260 
asterisk or a derivative of asterisk so
let's<00:01:35.250> go<00:01:35.369> over<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> computer<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.060> a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
let's go over to the computer for a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.770 
let's go over to the computer for a
second<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.860> go<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:37.979> asterisk<00:01:38.850> dot<00:01:39.479> org

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
second so if you go to asterisk dot org

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.719 
second so if you go to asterisk dot org
you<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.409> take<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> look<00:01:40.770> at<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.400> basically

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you can take a look at this so basically

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.300 
you can take a look at this so basically
asterisk<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.570> an<00:01:42.810> open<00:01:43.290> for<00:01:43.590> open-source

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
asterisk is an open for open-source

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.569 
asterisk is an open for open-source
voice<00:01:44.939> over<00:01:45.240> IP<00:01:45.530> telephone<00:01:46.530> system<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.460> has

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
voice over IP telephone system that has

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.580 
voice over IP telephone system that has
been<00:01:47.700> around<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:48.119> quite<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.329> while<00:01:48.600> now<00:01:48.630> it's

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
been around for quite a while now it's

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.300 
been around for quite a while now it's

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
would say is you need to figure go and

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.319 
would say is you need to figure go and
you<00:02:04.710> need<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.950> learn<00:02:05.070> asterisk<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.180> go

phones to work again you have to figure

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.409 
phones to work again you have to figure
out<00:05:57.889> the<00:05:58.009> call<00:05:58.280> routing<00:05:58.819> you<00:05:58.909> have<00:05:59.030> to<00:05:59.150> figure

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
out the call routing you have to figure

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.390 
out the call routing you have to figure
out<00:05:59.599> the<00:06:00.139> subscribers<00:06:00.949> you<00:06:01.039> have<00:06:01.069> to<00:06:01.219> figure

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
Auto attendance you have to figure out

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.399 
Auto attendance you have to figure out
all<00:06:06.380> of<00:06:06.500> these<00:06:06.680> things<00:06:07.009> and<00:06:07.819> I<00:06:08.120> mean<00:06:09.050> it<00:06:09.229> just

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:09.409 
all of these things and I mean it just

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.740 
all of these things and I mean it just
it<00:06:09.650> just<00:06:09.680> takes<00:06:10.039> a<00:06:10.130> lot<00:06:10.280> of<00:06:10.310> searching<00:06:11.120> Google

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
it just takes a lot of searching Google

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.540 
it just takes a lot of searching Google
and<00:06:12.020> figuring<00:06:12.469> things<00:06:12.620> out<00:06:12.860> and<00:06:13.190> plugging

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
and figuring things out and plugging

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.820 
and figuring things out and plugging
away<00:06:13.719> so<00:06:14.719> you<00:06:14.810> can<00:06:14.930> definitely<00:06:15.289> do<00:06:15.380> it<00:06:15.530> you<00:06:15.710> can

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
away so you can definitely do it you can

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.070 
away so you can definitely do it you can
definitely<00:06:16.190> do<00:06:16.310> it<00:06:16.340> but<00:06:16.759> this<00:06:17.120> is<00:06:17.300> a<00:06:17.330> project<00:06:17.630> I

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
definitely do it but this is a project I

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.559 
definitely do it but this is a project I
would<00:06:18.139> say<00:06:18.500> if<00:06:19.219> you<00:06:19.460> if<00:06:19.669> you're<00:06:20.120> relatively

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:20.569 
would say if you if you're relatively

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:21.850 
would say if you if you're relatively
new<00:06:20.780> to<00:06:21.169> all<00:06:21.319> this<00:06:21.349> stuff

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
new to all this stuff

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.620 
new to all this stuff
I<00:06:22.069> would<00:06:22.340> tell<00:06:22.550> your<00:06:22.699> boss<00:06:22.909> you<00:06:23.330> should<00:06:23.539> be

I would tell your boss you should be
able<00:06:23.690> to<00:06:23.780> get<00:06:23.900> something<00:06:24.139> up<00:06:24.259> and<00:06:24.380> running<00:06:24.440> in

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
able to get something up and running in

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.339 
able to get something up and running in
about<00:06:24.830> two<00:06:25.190> months<00:06:25.810> because<00:06:26.810> once<00:06:27.110> it's<00:06:27.259> up

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
about two months because once it's up

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:28.510 
about two months because once it's up
and<00:06:27.440> running<00:06:27.530> it's<00:06:27.889> pretty<00:06:28.099> solid

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
and running it's pretty solid

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.969 
and running it's pretty solid
because<00:06:28.669> it<00:06:28.849> asterisk<00:06:29.360> is<00:06:29.599> Linux<00:06:29.930> based<00:06:30.229> so

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:30.979 
because it asterisk is Linux based so

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:32.770 
because it asterisk is Linux based so
it's<00:06:31.159> like<00:06:31.310> once<00:06:31.639> you<00:06:31.819> have<00:06:31.849> it<00:06:32.120> running<00:06:32.419> and

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
it's like once you have it running and

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.600 
it's like once you have it running and
once<00:06:33.169> you<00:06:33.319> have<00:06:33.440> it<00:06:33.560> configured<00:06:33.889> it's<00:06:34.340> kind<00:06:34.520> of

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
once you have it configured it's kind of

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.719 
once you have it configured it's kind of
fun<00:06:34.759> you<00:06:35.120> can<00:06:35.900> just<00:06:36.020> forget<00:06:36.110> about<00:06:36.320> it<00:06:36.729> but

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:37.729 
fun you can just forget about it but

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:39.159 
fun you can just forget about it but
getting<00:06:37.969> it<00:06:38.180> up<00:06:38.270> and<00:06:38.389> running<00:06:38.599> and<00:06:38.750> configure

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
getting it up and running and configure

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:39.930 
getting it up and running and configure
it<00:06:39.229> can<00:06:39.349> be<00:06:39.440> a<00:06:39.469> real<00:06:39.589> pain

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
it can be a real pain

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.150 
it can be a real pain
but<00:06:40.150> so<00:06:40.780> Paul<00:06:41.050> that<00:06:41.200> makes<00:06:41.380> sense<00:06:41.620> but<00:06:41.950> yeah

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
but so Paul that makes sense but yeah

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.890 
but so Paul that makes sense but yeah
you<00:06:42.760> can<00:06:42.880> definitely<00:06:42.970> do<00:06:43.300> it<00:06:43.330> do<00:06:43.540> it<00:06:43.570> take<00:06:43.870> a

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
you can definitely do it do it take a

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.900 
you can definitely do it do it take a
look<00:06:44.080> at<00:06:44.170> asterisk<00:06:44.680> take<00:06:45.220> a<00:06:45.280> look<00:06:45.430> at<00:06:45.520> counter

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910 
look at asterisk take a look at counter

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.770 
look at asterisk take a look at counter
path<00:06:46.120> and<00:06:46.480> then<00:06:47.020> just<00:06:47.260> set<00:06:47.440> aside<00:06:47.560> a<00:06:48.040> long<00:06:48.780> time

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 
path and then just set aside a long time

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:55.230 
path and then just set aside a long time
out<00:06:50.680> of<00:06:50.950> time<00:06:51.130> again<00:06:51.550> 2<00:06:51.970> months<00:06:52.300> 2<00:06:53.200> months
