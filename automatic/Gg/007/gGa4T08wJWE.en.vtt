picked pomegranates and this is a really

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.730 
picked pomegranates and this is a really
nice<00:02:02.399> sweet<00:02:02.820> scent<00:02:03.119> as<00:02:03.299> well<00:02:03.570> i<00:02:03.810> haven't<00:02:04.560> used

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
nice sweet scent as well i haven't used

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.160 
nice sweet scent as well i haven't used
it<00:02:04.979> yet<00:02:05.009> but<00:02:05.430> from<00:02:05.700> what<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.880> can<00:02:06.000> smell<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.509> does

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
it yet but from what I can smell it does

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.770 
it yet but from what I can smell it does
not<00:02:07.320> smell<00:02:07.619> artificial<00:02:08.459> at<00:02:08.640> all<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.720> figured

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
not smell artificial at all so I figured

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.980 
not smell artificial at all so I figured
that<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.440> was<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.709> really<00:02:10.979> nice<00:02:11.220> one

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
that this was a really nice one

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.560 
that this was a really nice one
then<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.560> ended<00:02:13.920> up<00:02:14.010> getting<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.850> dancing

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
then I ended up getting to dancing

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.620 
then I ended up getting to dancing
waters<00:02:16.550> which<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.700> just<00:02:17.820> like<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> really<00:02:18.360> nice

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
waters which is just like a really nice

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.830 
waters which is just like a really nice
fresh<00:02:19.080> scent<00:02:19.410> pretty<00:02:19.680> much<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.310> then<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.180> got<00:02:21.600> a

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
fresh scent pretty much and then I got a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.800 
fresh scent pretty much and then I got a
fresh<00:02:22.500> market<00:02:22.950> Apple<00:02:23.400> which<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.300> love<00:02:24.600> that

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
fresh market Apple which I love that

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.370 
fresh market Apple which I love that
scent<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.380> then<00:02:25.980> fresh<00:02:26.580> picked<00:02:27.120> apples<00:02:27.420> now

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
scent and then fresh picked apples now

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.140 
scent and then fresh picked apples now
to<00:02:28.440> be<00:02:28.740> honest<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.280> think<00:02:29.340> they're<00:02:29.670> pretty<00:02:29.850> much

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
to be honest I think they're pretty much

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.210 
to be honest I think they're pretty much
the<00:02:30.390> same<00:02:30.570> thing<00:02:30.960> but<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:31.350> wanted<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.890> get<00:02:32.010> one

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
the same thing but I wanted to get one

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.640 
the same thing but I wanted to get one
of<00:02:32.400> each<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:32.970> could<00:02:33.330> compare<00:02:33.870> them<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.140> see

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
of each so I could compare them and see

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.340 
of each so I could compare them and see
if<00:02:34.680> there<00:02:35.130> really<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.580> difference<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.420> then

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
if there really is a difference and then

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.350 
if there really is a difference and then
I<00:02:37.380> ended<00:02:37.470> up<00:02:37.800> getting<00:02:38.010> one<00:02:38.460> in<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.880> fresh

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
I ended up getting one in the fresh

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.200 
I ended up getting one in the fresh
picked<00:02:39.780> apricots<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:41.280> like<00:02:41.460> I<00:02:41.580> said<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:42.060> only

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
picked apricots so like I said the only

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.900 
picked apricots so like I said the only
reason<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.750> got<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:43.320> many<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:44.190> pocket<00:02:44.700> backs

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
reason I got so many of the pocket backs

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.730 
reason I got so many of the pocket backs
was<00:02:45.210> because<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.540> wanted<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:46.140> reach<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.530> ten

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
was because I wanted to reach the ten

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.540 
was because I wanted to reach the ten
dollars<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.370> use<00:02:47.520> my<00:02:47.730> ten<00:02:48.060> dollar<00:02:48.270> off<00:02:48.540> coupon

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
dollars to use my ten dollar off coupon

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.470 
dollars to use my ten dollar off coupon
otherwise<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.610> probably<00:02:50.790> wouldn't<00:02:51.360> have

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
otherwise I probably wouldn't have

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.780 
otherwise I probably wouldn't have
bought<00:02:51.690> as<00:02:51.960> many<00:02:52.200> but<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:52.860> use<00:02:53.160> pocket<00:02:53.610> backs

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
bought as many but I use pocket backs

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.370 
bought as many but I use pocket backs
all<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.270> time<00:02:54.480> when<00:02:54.840> I'm<00:02:54.960> out<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.140> about
