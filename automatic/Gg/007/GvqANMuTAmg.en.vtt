00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.150
 writing disguise 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.720
 For this we need a 6 mm metal tube 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.080

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.340
 I opted for variant 2 if we 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.310
 Non- packaging we find following 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.210

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.509

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.720
 Of course that will be on the second page 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.720
