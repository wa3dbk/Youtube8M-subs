00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
stream of red to tap in his eyes and get

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.850 
stream of red to tap in his eyes and get
them<00:05:04.550> go<00:05:04.730> on<00:05:04.880> there<00:05:05.120> and<00:05:05.390> then<00:05:06.230> if<00:05:06.470> we<00:05:06.560> run<00:05:06.740> out

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
them go on there and then if we run out

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.250 
them go on there and then if we run out
of<00:05:06.890> Pikmin<00:05:07.310> just<00:05:07.970> call<00:05:08.240> them<00:05:08.480> and<00:05:08.750> just<00:05:09.110> as

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
of Pikmin just call them and just as

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.720 
of Pikmin just call them and just as
long<00:05:09.500> as<00:05:09.590> you<00:05:09.680> have<00:05:09.860> people<00:05:10.130> and<00:05:10.370> constantly

throwing at him he won't eat any of your

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.310 
throwing at him he won't eat any of your
Pikmin<00:05:13.190> just<00:05:14.120> keep<00:05:14.270> a<00:05:14.360> steady<00:05:14.390> stream<00:05:14.930> going

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
Pikmin just keep a steady stream going

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.860 
Pikmin just keep a steady stream going
and<00:05:15.710> attack<00:05:16.340> an<00:05:16.490> attack<00:05:16.580> attack<00:05:17.090> now<00:05:17.600> he's

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
and attack an attack attack now he's

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
and attack an attack attack now he's
dead<00:05:18.110> now<00:05:18.170> we're<00:05:18.620> ready<00:05:19.120> for<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.240> end<00:05:20.420> game<00:05:20.890> we

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
dead now we're ready for the end game we

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.600 
dead now we're ready for the end game we
have<00:05:22.130> two<00:05:22.340> minutes<00:05:22.580> to<00:05:22.790> kill<00:05:23.030> this<00:05:23.180> big<00:05:23.420> thing

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
have two minutes to kill this big thing

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.050 
have two minutes to kill this big thing
hopefully<00:05:26.260> this<00:05:27.260> goes<00:05:27.470> well<00:05:27.740> he's<00:05:28.610> kind<00:05:29.000> of

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
hopefully this goes well he's kind of

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.550 
hopefully this goes well he's kind of
tricky<00:05:29.390> because<00:05:29.510> he<00:05:29.690> kind<00:05:29.840> of<00:05:29.930> swaps<00:05:30.200> areas

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
tricky because he kind of swaps areas

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.990 
tricky because he kind of swaps areas
will<00:05:30.710> help<00:05:30.830> charge<00:05:31.160> up<00:05:31.370> our<00:05:31.550> Pikmin<00:05:31.880> by

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
will help charge up our Pikmin by

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.940 
will help charge up our Pikmin by
pressing<00:05:32.450> up<00:05:32.660> and<00:05:32.900> give<00:05:33.410> him<00:05:33.530> that<00:05:33.650> spicy

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
pressing up and give him that spicy

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.300 
pressing up and give him that spicy
formula<00:05:34.430> now<00:05:35.030> I<00:05:35.470> will<00:05:36.470> go<00:05:36.650> for<00:05:36.950> the<00:05:37.010> attack

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
formula now I will go for the attack

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.310 
formula now I will go for the attack
here<00:05:37.550> this<00:05:38.510> is<00:05:38.660> probably<00:05:38.840> the<00:05:38.960> worst<00:05:39.020> way<00:05:39.290> to

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
here this is probably the worst way to

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.890 
here this is probably the worst way to
do<00:05:39.470> it<00:05:39.590> I<00:05:39.800> was<00:05:40.580> going<00:05:40.760> for<00:05:40.820> the<00:05:41.030> center<00:05:41.540> trying

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
do it I was going for the center trying

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.840 
do it I was going for the center trying
to<00:05:41.960> chuck<00:05:42.200> him<00:05:42.350> on<00:05:42.440> their<00:05:42.620> best<00:05:43.520> way<00:05:43.790> to

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
to chuck him on their best way to

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.490 
to chuck him on their best way to
attacking<00:05:44.270> is<00:05:44.570> actually<00:05:44.900> go<00:05:45.020> for<00:05:45.170> his<00:05:45.290> legs

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
attacking is actually go for his legs

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.440 
attacking is actually go for his legs
just<00:05:45.740> let<00:05:45.920> the<00:05:46.040> Pikmin<00:05:46.490> climb<00:05:46.790> off<00:05:46.970> his<00:05:47.120> feet

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
just let the Pikmin climb off his feet

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.410 
just let the Pikmin climb off his feet
do<00:05:48.320> not<00:05:48.530> charge<00:05:48.920> him<00:05:49.370> because<00:05:49.850> if<00:05:49.970> you<00:05:50.090> charge

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
do not charge him because if you charge

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.480 
do not charge him because if you charge
him<00:05:50.720> you<00:05:50.960> will<00:05:51.080> get<00:05:51.200> stepped<00:05:51.530> on<00:05:51.680> and<00:05:51.920> lose<00:05:52.460> a

him you will get stepped on and lose a

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.460 
him you will get stepped on and lose a
lot<00:05:52.730> of<00:05:52.760> Pikmin<00:05:53.150> which<00:05:53.270> would<00:05:53.390> be<00:05:53.480> a<00:05:53.510> shame<00:05:53.750> now

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
lot of Pikmin which would be a shame now

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.070 
lot of Pikmin which would be a shame now
we<00:05:54.650> want<00:05:54.830> to<00:05:54.890> do<00:05:54.950> is<00:05:55.070> keep<00:05:55.360> chucking<00:05:56.360> Pikmin<00:05:56.930> at

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.990 
his feet they'll climb up to his Center
an<00:05:59.680> attack<00:06:00.680> is<00:06:00.830> center<00:06:01.160> you'll<00:06:01.610> shake<00:06:01.820> them

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
an attack is center you'll shake them

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.510

problem this is where timing kind of

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.440 
problem this is where timing kind of
sucks<00:06:07.220> because<00:06:07.580> he<00:06:07.790> climbs<00:06:08.030> across<00:06:08.330> these

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
sucks because he climbs across these

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.480 
sucks because he climbs across these
areas<00:06:08.870> that<00:06:08.990> you<00:06:09.080> can't<00:06:09.290> get<00:06:09.470> in<00:06:09.650> so<00:06:10.280> you<00:06:10.340> kind
