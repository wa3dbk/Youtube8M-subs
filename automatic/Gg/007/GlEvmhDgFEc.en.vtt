00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:20.539
 when it comes to thinking, you have so many different types yes 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.499
 of course so it is a cd to make the linker but stop mine 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.829
 son and you have to do it and cheered mice with surprise 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.619
 many places like it and then also a windows with 80,000 knocks and yet one 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.570
 whole list especially on the exact officers but also on and then you have 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.740
 of course also the transformer category 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.570
 but it now looks like demy should be the manufacturer you finally watch 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.650
 has found a balance and they have found it in the employers' forests 6 0 2 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.340
 the g6 or 2 is a game in house that runs on two by recording batteries 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.860
 This unlike the first release the G7 took turns with it 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.200
 number two can connect my ass to your pc to charge so that's here so 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.760
 not necessary and that was my first concern because if I find one somewhere 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.380
 grave hate gifts mice then that the batteries can go 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.970
 and that your mouse is going to do chord so that you lose in game on 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.479
 the website for the ek is the fierce advertise with that you have as many as 250 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.240
 neighbor can share undisturbed with insect batteries know exactly 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.770
 of course not how long he lasted but I can tell you 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.030
 that I only replace the first two batteries after one and a half to two months 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.550
 and have to test a happy life well in advance to indicate when 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.320
 low battery at 20 percent already gives you a warning at 10 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.700
 percent gives a warning and 5 percent does not show up there 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.910
 from joop a parking space in batteries 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.660
 on the horti tech six six-seater that in addition to the standard left and right 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.500
 mouse button and a garden shed again some programmable none 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.970
 tests these are tests where you can determine what they do through the farmer 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.760
 erp software at the top are the g10 and the g11 keys and even if you can 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.710
 determine what this test to do as standard, she said in programmed 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.210
 are pp who to determine or how quickly jan baars across the screen a mystery 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.380
 if you move with me I find this function always handy but on the g6 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.919
 up to two I find it even more convenient 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.959
 what you can see with lights how high or too low the pvda actually is 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:18.109
 then there is also a button in the middle of a tube the g6 of two heads us 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:22.370
 body specific shed you have the durability lab mode and you have it 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.799
 performance mode and what exactly is the difference 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.589
 i have no clue the only thing i know is that the baby is a little bit here 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:31.669
 was changed 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:35.299
 for the rest I am nothing at all and that in such a good nothing 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.959
 for the rest, this mouse does not have very many extra places, just a few extra 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.349
 macro keys to make your experience a little simpler 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.620
 what i really set up this mouse is the design as the functions are 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.439
 not too many places on it is just a nice balance between silver and 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.239
 black and a few cool wines 6 on the left side of the where is another piece 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.469
 think plastic that looks pretty useless at first glance 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:04.999
 you yes because de facto this animal but it is eric handy because if you use the mouse 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:09.180
 used you can let your garden rest on it not only does this relax for 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.620
 during the game grandma this also gives you quick access to you 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.920
 macro keys and the lighter mouse in your hand just fine m that's exactly what you 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:23.270
 want from STDs i can just enjoy playing a package what type of game i play 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.329
 whether I am a high speed playing field for spurters your world to those who play the game 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.510
 the mouse always works properly and I never suffer from cramping or something because of that 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.560
 zeitgeist 6 0 2 true cities windows is me a punishment new maes it is 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.609
 a sleek design, it feels great in your hand and there are a number 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.989
 extra keys so that you can enjoy it, I can give the baby that again 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.329
 and also from a wireless I am one first I had something against it 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.510
 wireless may through then touch your battery obama today but i think just goes 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.829
 nice and long or you have a broken mouse or are you just looking 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.400
 to the Dutch not too many antics but still some extra options 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.519
 the g6 0 2 for 80 euros is definitely worth it
