00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
my post and said he'd like to see a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.120 
my post and said he'd like to see a
version<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.880> with<00:00:18.260> unlimited<00:00:19.260> ghosts<00:00:19.980> and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
version of it with unlimited ghosts and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.099 
version of it with unlimited ghosts and
the<00:00:20.550> humans<00:00:20.820> having<00:00:21.029> plasma<00:00:21.359> pistols<00:00:21.720> thought

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
the humans having plasma pistols thought

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.349 
the humans having plasma pistols thought
it<00:00:22.230> could<00:00:22.439> make<00:00:22.529> some<00:00:22.710> really<00:00:22.830> cool<00:00:23.010> gameplay

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
it could make some really cool gameplay

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.730 
it could make some really cool gameplay
so<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.390> worked<00:00:24.869> with<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.199> little<00:00:25.350> bit<00:00:25.439> I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
so I worked with it a little bit I

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.349 
so I worked with it a little bit I
changed<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.460> there<00:00:26.609> are<00:00:26.699> more<00:00:26.849> teleporters

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
changed it so there are more teleporters

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.990 
changed it so there are more teleporters
for<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.990> ghosts<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.529> things<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.279> do

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
for the ghosts and things like that I do

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.910 
for the ghosts and things like that I do
have<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.480> set<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:31.019> unlimited<00:00:31.529> vehicles

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
have it set to have unlimited vehicles

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.430 
have it set to have unlimited vehicles
and<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.189> humans<00:00:32.520> actually<00:00:32.850> spawn<00:00:33.090> with

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
and the humans actually spawn with

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.900 
and the humans actually spawn with
plasma<00:00:34.440> pistol<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.040> grenade<00:00:35.309> launcher<00:00:35.670> but

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
plasma pistol and a grenade launcher but

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.790 
plasma pistol and a grenade launcher but
they<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.600> limited<00:00:36.960> ammo<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.530> can't

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
they have limited ammo so that can't

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.110 
they have limited ammo so that can't
just<00:00:37.980> spam<00:00:38.219> at<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.430> entrance<00:00:38.760> all<00:00:38.910> day

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
just spam at the entrance all day

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.119 
just spam at the entrance all day
because<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.200> would<00:00:40.290> kind<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.710> take<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.980> fun

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
because that would kind of take the fun

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.549 
because that would kind of take the fun
out<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:42.239> custom<00:00:42.450> power-ups<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.230> now

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
out of it the custom power-ups are now

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.380 
out of it the custom power-ups are now
on<00:00:43.800> all<00:00:44.010> four<00:00:44.309> corners<00:00:44.340> there<00:00:44.910> are<00:00:45.000> no<00:00:45.120> grenade

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
on all four corners there are no grenade

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.900 
on all four corners there are no grenade
launchers<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:46.280> you<00:00:47.280> already<00:00:47.460> start<00:00:47.789> with

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
launchers because you already start with

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.150 
launchers because you already start with
one<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.270> then<00:00:48.390> up<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.140> middle<00:00:49.440> still<00:00:49.860> you

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
one and then up in the middle still you

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.590 
one and then up in the middle still you
can<00:00:50.309> jump<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:50.610> there<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.090> rocket

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
can jump up there and get that rocket

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600 
can jump up there and get that rocket
launcher<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.440> really<00:00:52.770> it's<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:53.039> quite<00:00:53.430> as

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
launcher but really it's not quite as

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.040 
launcher but really it's not quite as
effective<00:00:53.820> as<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> plasma<00:00:54.539> pistol<00:00:54.870> or<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
effective as a plasma pistol or a

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.840 
effective as a plasma pistol or a
grenade<00:00:55.350> launcher<00:00:55.680> because<00:00:56.010> they<00:00:56.219> don't<00:00:56.399> fall

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
grenade launcher because they don't fall

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.380 
grenade launcher because they don't fall
through<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.539> shield<00:00:58.050> doors<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:59.390> another

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
through the shield doors and another

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.939 
through the shield doors and another
thing<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.719> talk<00:01:00.870> about<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.140> recently<00:01:01.800> if

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
thing to talk about is recently if

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.770 
thing to talk about is recently if

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
you're watching this through old MPs

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.080 
you're watching this through old MPs

whole point of this game is it's
infection<00:02:16.849> and<00:02:17.060> it's<00:02:17.870> actually<00:02:18.170> starting<00:02:18.530> out

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
infection and it's actually starting out

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.500 
infection and it's actually starting out
with<00:02:18.799> three<00:02:19.040> zombies<00:02:19.220> instead<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:19.939> one<00:02:20.299> like

they gotta jump around stay alive and

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.190 
they gotta jump around stay alive and
the<00:02:28.760> ghosts<00:02:29.030> can<00:02:29.540> drive<00:02:29.750> around<00:02:29.900> on<00:02:30.079> the

here and another thing you might have
noticed<00:02:34.940> about<00:02:35.329> this<00:02:35.480> map<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:36.230> crates

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
noticed about this map is the crates

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.280 
noticed about this map is the crates
that<00:02:37.549> are<00:02:37.700> placed<00:02:38.150> on<00:02:38.269> antennas<00:02:38.840> here<00:02:39.079> in

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
that are placed on antennas here in

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.830 
that are placed on antennas here in
between<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.920> four<00:02:40.099> by<00:02:40.190> fours<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:41.690> can

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
between the four by fours you can

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.420 
between the four by fours you can
actually<00:02:41.959> jump<00:02:42.260> onto<00:02:42.500> those<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.980> if<00:02:43.099> you<00:02:43.189> jump

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
actually jump onto those and if you jump

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.860 
actually jump onto those and if you jump
and<00:02:43.579> crouch<00:02:43.939> and<00:02:44.150> just<00:02:44.359> kind<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.540> sit<00:02:44.750> there

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
and crouch and just kind of sit there

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.330 
and crouch and just kind of sit there
for<00:02:45.019> a<00:02:45.079> second<00:02:45.409> that<00:02:45.530> goes<00:02:45.680> will<00:02:45.950> actually<00:02:46.220> be

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
for a second that goes will actually be

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.710 
for a second that goes will actually be
able<00:02:46.489> to<00:02:46.549> drive<00:02:46.670> right<00:02:47.060> over<00:02:47.120> top<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.480> you

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
able to drive right over top of you

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.690 
able to drive right over top of you
which<00:02:48.560> is<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.680> little<00:02:48.829> bit<00:02:49.010> weird<00:02:49.190> we've<00:02:49.400> had<00:02:49.579> it

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
which is a little bit weird we've had it

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.069 
which is a little bit weird we've had it
happen<00:02:49.819> to<00:02:49.970> where<00:02:50.120> if<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.299> stand<00:02:50.540> on<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.750> crate

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
happen to where if you stand on a crate

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.809 
happen to where if you stand on a crate
and<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.769> jump<00:02:52.040> while<00:02:52.129> I<00:02:52.190> ghost<00:02:52.459> is<00:02:52.579> right<00:02:52.730> over

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
and you jump while I ghost is right over

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.399 
and you jump while I ghost is right over
top<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.329> because<00:02:53.750> it's<00:02:53.900> on<00:02:53.989> two<00:02:54.200> hundred

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
top of you because it's on two hundred

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.379 
top of you because it's on two hundred
percent<00:02:54.680> jump<00:02:55.010> it'll<00:02:55.849> actually<00:02:55.970> be<00:02:56.150> able<00:02:56.269> to

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
percent jump it'll actually be able to

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.240 
percent jump it'll actually be able to
flip<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.780> ghost<00:02:57.019> and<00:02:57.290> if<00:02:57.590> you're<00:02:57.709> lucky<00:02:57.829> you<00:02:58.069> can

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
flip a ghost and if you're lucky you can
