00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
repurchasing this although i really will

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.670

enjoy<00:01:32.880> sampling<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.810> until<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.259> gone<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
enjoy sampling this until it's gone the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.969 
enjoy sampling this until it's gone the
next<00:01:35.040> thing<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.460> was<00:01:35.939> kind<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.479> what<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.799> is

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
next thing I was kind of like what it is

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.880 
next thing I was kind of like what it is

can see on the handle here um not

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.249 
can see on the handle here um not
thrilled<00:01:44.280> with<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.970> gonna<00:01:45.149> lie<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:46.110> is

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
thrilled with this not gonna lie this is

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.929 
thrilled with this not gonna lie this is
a<00:01:46.290> free<00:01:46.590> item<00:01:46.890> though<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.310> thankfully<00:01:47.820> that

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
a free item though so thankfully that

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.120 
a free item though so thankfully that
doesn't<00:01:48.299> plan<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.200> other<00:01:49.350> items<00:01:49.740> from<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
doesn't plan to the other items from the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.420 
doesn't plan to the other items from the
box<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:51.049> whatever<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.259> really<00:01:52.590> don't<00:01:52.770> care<00:01:52.920> it

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
box so whatever I really don't care it

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.030 
box so whatever I really don't care it
feels<00:01:53.640> really<00:01:54.090> really<00:01:54.659> flimsy<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.799> blush

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
feels really really flimsy it's a blush

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.499 
feels really really flimsy it's a blush
brush<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.700> guess<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.030> not<00:01:57.149> supposed<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> be

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
brush so I guess it's not supposed to be

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.880 
brush so I guess it's not supposed to be
the<00:01:57.630> stiffest<00:01:57.960> thing<00:01:58.140> ever<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.560> made<00:01:58.710> out<00:01:58.740> of

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the stiffest thing ever it's made out of

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.069 
the stiffest thing ever it's made out of
goats<00:01:59.130> hair<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.909> really<00:02:00.329> rough<00:02:00.840> I

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
goats hair and it is really rough I

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.109 
goats hair and it is really rough I
don't<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.680> probably<00:02:02.159> won't<00:02:02.310> use<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.549> okay

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
don't like it probably won't use it okay

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.389 
don't like it probably won't use it okay
so<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.450> next<00:02:03.479> thing<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.229> Zion<00:02:05.219> nail

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399

hair<00:02:36.090> mask<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.750> guess<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.439> is<00:02:37.620> what<00:02:37.769> the

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:37.889 
hair mask I guess this is what the

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.709 
hair mask I guess this is what the
packaging<00:02:38.099> looks<00:02:38.400> like<00:02:38.760> never<00:02:39.120> heard<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.569> this

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719

company brand or anything before

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.699 
company brand or anything before
