00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 I greet everyone in the background artlife with you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.450
 again schneiderman and video data to 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.300
 unusual and sure that you have them already 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.519
 noticed this shore is a two-river from 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.009
 stealing video and from trolling of course 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.500
 leg joke in principle seems to me should 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.710
 work and so what I want 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.859
 to draw in this video I want you 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.300
 talk about it and here about this here 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:31.949
 my child's advice to express the bones and he 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:36.540
 there and and smashed was i 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.250
 ashamed still as death simple i'm ready 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.910
 fall through the earth with this 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.300
 myself and actually I undertook to repair it 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.170
 so let's say I have already repaired but these here 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.670
 all the cracks she clay 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.690
 it's all visible now you need it 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.550
 restore 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.329
 and in this video I will show how 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.910
 this can be done with the help of dear 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.649
 Acrylic I'm sorry, I just have more 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.719

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.119
 I'm unfortunately not at the moment 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.090
 even my favorite gypsum which in 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.140
 principle could have been a little bit there to 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.700
 I will grind up 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.490
 use my acrylic which i 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.020
 quite recently increased nails 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.759

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.080
 just faint lying around I'll 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.720
 show how to work with these 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.400

 fully grown and developed itself use in 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.030
