00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.930
 i 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.950
 very good to all without these guys 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.930
 welcome an attack on the writers 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.060
 instincts we are in a park called 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.460
 parkour tremendously football and so 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.110
 as much as in the name of sugar then 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.730
 I have been forced to play it but not 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.020
 I know more guys I hope you like it I think 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.029
 which is a parkour cortito map and 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.730
 Well, from time to time, you want to record a 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.590
 map of departure that does not exceed a little 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.000
 limits I do not have to say that I was 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.910
 testing a map that has come to me from 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.949
 true the face of the leather kart is a 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.269
 map also in pixar implant but that 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.040
 has several flaws in the subject of 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.390
 parkour and already sent messages to 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.640
 boy so that he corrects me good I have 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.370
 have to say that I do not know in what way 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.140
 people make a few pyxel arts that are very 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.150
 very very good giants is that they are 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.250
 immense and structures in how you can 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.659
 do impressive jumps but good if 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.670
 any photo all this that see the case 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.809
 but in chubby that is recording it and I 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.040
 I have been a bit disappointed with 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.570
 I wanted to teach it because the truth is that 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.489
 pixar too but well well let's 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.839
 focus on this cute mental point 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.890
 trick let's read the little books very 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.720
 in now the closing door the 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.220
 extension or the time is welcome in one 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.979
 to my new map I hope you like it 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.350
 let's see it lucas vila in and lucas channels 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.820
 james quigley I do and I do one does 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.500
 possible the end of the theme video 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.560
 I worked a week on this map so 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:25.320
 enjoy 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.320
 with more brightness 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.100
 a block and have cut 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.820
 everything and what happens is that they are 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.380
 seeing the brightness does not add brightness to 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.180
 minimal because I think that people 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.200
 no longer see any of our band both 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.789
 It changes a lot, it's not like that 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.560
 raise the brightness a little 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.940
 extended therefore for you to see and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:07.409
 to comply a little with the rules and 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:07.409
 this guy that on the map to play 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.940
 or because just this is what they try 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.290
 the little trick is that it's going 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.300
 pulling out the head with the roof to 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.670
 jump faster than a model almost 24 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.260
 to complete and he should be 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.640
 recording in naruto but I'm a little 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.410
 scared by booket but with the other day 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.700
 serious more important because it is this 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.680
 century of the park looks that in fact 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.910
 impossible jumping but they are just a 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.620
 chest with I have seen the obligation of 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.260
 pay the thing is that I had it serious and 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.019
 as you well know the combat 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.340
 normal to the so-called subjective purchase that 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.380
 today it does not accept any type of copyright 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.480
 but of course it is not the same with combat 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.850
 for under water ok let's try with a 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.860
 combat thus random not that for example 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.620
 follow the story that history adds 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.569
 better a soundtrack and so on and the thing 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.250
 it can be complicated a bit but good 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.330
 let's wait and I'm going to subtract the win 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.280
 recover because now I have many 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.080
 want to continue playing naruto if 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.840
 you want how much I was moved in the 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.370
 chapter of diversity no longer as 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.080
 well you know the naruto theme lasted 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.420
 as of 20 a 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.220
 25 minutes 30 stay too long 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.820
 or therefore even the parties but 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.780
 there are things that go bad start match 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.670
 roller coaster 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.740
 dies dedicates hears crimes pro but by 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.710
 what do minecraft animals bring me? 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.910
 Very bad environment 6 and good too 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.100
 I have to tell you right away 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.430
 will build I will record also that 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.480
 comes to be waka iceland se series we are 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.430
 making extreme survival between 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.120
 islands and we have to discover what 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.120
 is happening 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.450
 it gives me a lot of impression in fact it's 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.580
 a person that I have liars I've 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.990
 Once I've experienced a vertigo 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.940
 very little scary because it's because 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.520
 they also scare me and it happened badly I'm 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.780
 of trauma is going to be a channel 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.240
 dedicated to parkour and we are going 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.220
 jumps between different things because I 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.600
 I dedicate to having a bad time 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.790
 basically I just twisted the 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.030
 hand as you hear that coolest falcon 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.440
 also after done epic epic then yes 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.030
 someday I can start sharing the 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.370
 maps either through a web page 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.180
 by proxy they will be your own 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.180
 we will be able to 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:30.910
 around here they put you like inside 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.110
 recurrent of life because maybe I have 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.810
 a lot of calculations within that 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.090
 I want to play very very epic I think that 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.830
 those during those issues why most 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.260
 they leave me impressed by the subject they are 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.340
 giants this case what should be the 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.110
 peak will be normal what have a 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.460
 participant so that only and still not 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.770
 I will indeed no gift which so 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.120
 but he is a husband because he was trying 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.260
 record what has already been done but it is 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.030
 impossible because because a map is 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.240
 giant 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.830
 and I also get lost or is not followed by a 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.240
 pattern does not have any kind of character 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.440
 politician over here so we can 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.780
 thank the theme of a small tour 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.970
 here and now you see there a little 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.430
 plus the main tour is totally at 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.530
 oil with you enter different one 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.580
 option leg to another and you finish both 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.020
 in short they have been able to record 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.020
 where different steps 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.819
 subscribers 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.909
 Water 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:49.659
 but because you are the smallest the tree 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.449
 of images that we see and leaving 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:01.870
 post I like this presentation is 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:01.870
 much the channel an exit of people 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.030
 ah
