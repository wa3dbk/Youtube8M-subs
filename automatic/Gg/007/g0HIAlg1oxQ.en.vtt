00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
got the other bike that we wanted to be

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.729 
got the other bike that we wanted to be
able<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.180> highlight<00:03:24.450> because<00:03:24.900> it's<00:03:25.230> important

able to highlight because it's important
to<00:03:25.950> us<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:27.090> pink<00:03:27.840> 2<00:03:28.440> point<00:03:28.799> 0<00:03:29.570> breast

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
to us is the pink 2 point 0 breast

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.509 
to us is the pink 2 point 0 breast
cancer<00:03:30.900> bike<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.980> reason<00:03:32.340> this<00:03:32.459> is

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
cancer bike and the reason this is

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.130 
cancer bike and the reason this is
important<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.269> that<00:03:33.330> we've<00:03:33.600> had<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.780> number<00:03:33.989> of

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
important is that we've had a number of

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.350 
important is that we've had a number of
people<00:03:34.380> in<00:03:34.680> our<00:03:34.799> organization<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.820> have<00:03:35.970> had

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
people in our organization that have had

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.030 
people in our organization that have had
family<00:03:36.840> members<00:03:36.870> or<00:03:37.350> whatever<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:37.739> have

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
family members or whatever that have

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.880 
family members or whatever that have
been<00:03:38.190> involved<00:03:38.489> in<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:39.590> debilitating<00:03:40.590> disease

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
been involved in a debilitating disease

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.430 
been involved in a debilitating disease
and<00:03:41.220> realized<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:41.850> part<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.810> process<00:03:43.049> of

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
and realized that part of the process of

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.699 
and realized that part of the process of
getting<00:03:43.590> better<00:03:44.040> requires<00:03:44.720> exercise<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:46.590> the

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
getting better requires exercise but the

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.770 
getting better requires exercise but the
problem<00:03:46.920> with<00:03:47.280> exercise<00:03:47.850> after<00:03:48.150> chemo<00:03:48.750> and

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
problem with exercise after chemo and

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.560 
problem with exercise after chemo and
radiation<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.890> you're<00:03:50.730> just<00:03:50.970> so<00:03:51.180> drawn

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
radiation is you're just so drawn

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.810 
radiation is you're just so drawn
through<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.170> process<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:53.160> we<00:03:53.370> think<00:03:53.670> that

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
through the process so we think that

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.910 
through the process so we think that
this<00:03:54.060> electric<00:03:54.600> bike<00:03:54.780> is<00:03:54.989> an<00:03:55.140> important<00:03:55.650> tool

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
this electric bike is an important tool

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.860 
this electric bike is an important tool
that<00:03:56.190> allows<00:03:56.430> people<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.940> get<00:03:57.150> out<00:03:57.209> they<00:03:57.810> can

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
that allows people to get out they can

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.960 
that allows people to get out they can
start<00:03:58.260> literally<00:03:58.890> by<00:03:59.010> pedaling<00:03:59.610> just<00:03:59.850> a

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
start literally by pedaling just a

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.240 
start literally by pedaling just a
quarter<00:04:00.360> of<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.660> block<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.290> then<00:04:01.680> using<00:04:02.130> the

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
quarter of the block and then using the

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.580 
quarter of the block and then using the
power<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.700> get<00:04:02.820> around<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.420> every<00:04:04.140> day<00:04:04.170> that

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
power to get around and every day that

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.800 
power to get around and every day that
can<00:04:04.739> potentially<00:04:04.890> get<00:04:05.519> stronger<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.239> pedal

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
can potentially get stronger and pedal

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.620 
can potentially get stronger and pedal
more<00:04:07.079> and<00:04:07.320> use<00:04:07.739> electric<00:04:08.280> less<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:09.269> final

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
more and use electric less the final

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.840 
more and use electric less the final
benefit<00:04:10.019> is<00:04:10.200> by<00:04:10.410> making<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:10.980> bike<00:04:11.220> for<00:04:11.579> every

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
benefit is by making this bike for every
