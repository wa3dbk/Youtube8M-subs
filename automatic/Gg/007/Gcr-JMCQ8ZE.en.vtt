independently these single mechanics

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.660 
independently these single mechanics
right<00:01:27.540> here<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:28.020> show<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.130> game<00:01:29.369> will

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
right here can show that the game will

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.120 
right here can show that the game will
get<00:01:29.850> pretty<00:01:30.210> intense<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:31.020> thing<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.829> gets

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
get pretty intense the thing is it gets

get pretty intense the thing is it gets
pretty<00:01:32.490> intense<00:01:32.720> really<00:01:33.720> quickly<00:01:36.650> take<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
pretty intense really quickly take a

insanely difficult game but they thought

they could make it a little easier for
the<00:02:53.160> player<00:02:53.370> by<00:02:53.580> putting<00:02:53.880> in<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.120> danger<00:02:54.720> meter

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
the player by putting in a danger meter

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.630 
the player by putting in a danger meter
that's<00:02:55.260> in<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.440> middle<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.770> screen<00:02:56.070> it

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
that's in the middle of a screen it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.040 
that's in the middle of a screen it
blinks<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.300> top<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.750> bottom

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
blinks on the top of the bottom

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.140 
blinks on the top of the bottom
depending<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.470> where<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.800> action<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.550> the

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
depending on where the action is the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.240 
depending on where the action is the
thing<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.720> damn<00:03:00.930> meters<00:03:01.590> blinking<00:03:02.100> all

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
thing is the damn meters blinking all

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.650 
thing is the damn meters blinking all
the<00:03:02.400> time<00:03:02.610> because<00:03:02.850> there's<00:03:03.210> so<00:03:03.330> much<00:03:03.450> going

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
the time because there's so much going

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.540 
the time because there's so much going
on<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.770> think<00:03:05.010> it's<00:03:05.100> just<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.280> cruel<00:03:05.490> joke

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
on so I think it's just a cruel joke

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.420 
on so I think it's just a cruel joke
that<00:03:06.030> they<00:03:06.120> bring<00:03:06.890> that's<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.070> thing<00:03:08.280> though

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
that they bring that's the thing though

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.160 
that they bring that's the thing though
I<00:03:08.640> may<00:03:08.940> sound<00:03:09.210> like<00:03:09.300> I'm<00:03:09.480> complaining<00:03:09.900> about

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
I may sound like I'm complaining about

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.140 
I may sound like I'm complaining about
the<00:03:10.560> game<00:03:10.770> being<00:03:10.950> card<00:03:11.310> but<00:03:11.670> that's<00:03:11.940> exactly

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
the game being card but that's exactly

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.200 
the game being card but that's exactly

and<00:03:32.220> even<00:03:32.580> then<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:32.910> don't<00:03:33.090> get<00:03:33.210> to<00:03:33.270> take<00:03:33.450> all

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
and even then you don't get to take all

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.570 
and even then you don't get to take all
of<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.870> in<00:03:34.020> and<00:03:34.200> then<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.800> boss<00:03:34.980> battles<00:03:35.400> come

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
of it in and then the boss battles come

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.820 
of it in and then the boss battles come
in<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:35.850> they're<00:03:35.970> even<00:03:36.000> more<00:03:36.270> intense<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.200> it's

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
in and they're even more intense so it's

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.280 
in and they're even more intense so it's
a<00:03:37.980> really<00:03:38.220> tough<00:03:38.580> game<00:03:38.880> but<00:03:39.120> it's<00:03:39.390> good<00:03:39.720> the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
a really tough game but it's good the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.960 
a really tough game but it's good the
controls<00:03:40.710> are<00:03:40.890> spot-on<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.640> that's<00:03:41.790> exactly

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
controls are spot-on and that's exactly

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.510 
controls are spot-on and that's exactly
what<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.570> need<00:03:42.750> here<00:03:42.990> when<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:43.980> comes<00:03:44.220> to

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
what you need here when it comes to

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.000 
what you need here when it comes to
graphics<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:45.600> things<00:03:46.020> are<00:03:46.230> pretty<00:03:46.470> good<00:03:46.770> it's

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
graphics of things are pretty good it's

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.740 
graphics of things are pretty good it's
got<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.280> stylized<00:03:47.790> look<00:03:48.030> but<00:03:48.240> the<00:03:48.390> actual

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
got a stylized look but the actual

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.500 
got a stylized look but the actual
artwork<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.560> pretty<00:03:49.950> bad<00:03:50.190> in<00:03:50.490> my<00:03:50.610> opinion<00:03:50.970> it

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
artwork is pretty bad in my opinion it

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.060 
artwork is pretty bad in my opinion it
looks<00:03:51.780> like<00:03:51.960> something<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.470> would<00:03:52.620> draw<00:03:52.920> in

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
looks like something you would draw in

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.620 
looks like something you would draw in
middle<00:03:53.340> school<00:03:53.640> or<00:03:53.670> something<00:03:54.210> along<00:03:54.300> those

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
middle school or something along those

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.780 
middle school or something along those
lines<00:03:54.750> it's<00:03:55.650> not<00:03:55.860> enough<00:03:56.160> against<00:03:56.490> the<00:03:56.610> game

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
lines it's not enough against the game

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.360 
lines it's not enough against the game
playing<00:03:57.060> you're<00:03:57.240> just<00:03:57.660> a<00:03:57.810> personal<00:03:58.290> gripe<00:03:58.560> as

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
playing you're just a personal gripe as

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.160

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
far as soundtrack goes the music is

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.140 
far as soundtrack goes the music is
really<00:04:01.290> good<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.680> actually<00:04:01.830> fits<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.700> the

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
really good and actually fits the the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.210 
really good and actually fits the the
moods<00:04:03.360> of<00:04:03.510> levels<00:04:03.870> really<00:04:04.230> well<00:04:04.410> sound

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
moods of levels really well sound

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.760 
moods of levels really well sound
effects<00:04:05.520> are<00:04:05.850> pretty<00:04:06.300> standard<00:04:06.720> sci-fi<00:04:07.410> stuff

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
effects are pretty standard sci-fi stuff

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.430 
effects are pretty standard sci-fi stuff
there's<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.490> couple<00:04:08.670> really<00:04:08.970> cheesy<00:04:09.720> digitized

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
there's a couple really cheesy digitized

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.410 
there's a couple really cheesy digitized
sound<00:04:11.100> effects<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:11.550> gun<00:04:11.760> shooting<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.270> stuff

sound effects of gun shooting and stuff
like<00:04:12.570> that<00:04:12.630> but<00:04:12.810> once<00:04:13.440> again<00:04:13.590> nothing<00:04:14.070> that

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
like that but once again nothing that

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.150 
like that but once again nothing that
will<00:04:14.280> detract<00:04:14.580> from<00:04:14.820> the<00:04:14.940> gameplay<00:04:15.450> so

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
will detract from the gameplay so

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160 
will detract from the gameplay so
overall<00:04:17.160> I<00:04:17.489> really<00:04:17.910> enjoyed<00:04:18.600> this<00:04:18.750> game<00:04:18.960> and

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
I'm hoping that they make a sequel and I

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.640 
I'm hoping that they make a sequel and I
hope<00:04:21.150> they<00:04:21.180> don't<00:04:21.480> dumb<00:04:21.720> down<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.080> difficulty

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650
