00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.319
 an internal bagging of these bag 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.000
 you see sometimes very tragic things because 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.890
 mismanaged money is like a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.080
 weapon placed in the hands of a child 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.350
 what happens with a lot of people is that 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.670
 knows how to manage wealth then the 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.910
 lifestyle goes up here 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.140
 and if something unexpected happens the event and 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.410
 they have to go back down here 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.270
 If you are poor because poor situation 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.650
 you are used to being poor 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:38.030
 If you are rich and you become poor 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:41.570
 serious but if you are poor it makes you 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.180
 cynical and becomes poor again serious 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.990
 still because the emotional shock is 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.990
 huge 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.930
 It is unbearable and so Happen 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.090
 suicides in stock exchange issues and issues 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.430
 of business 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.230
 I was not that I thought that I was 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.450
 it passed as society not me what not 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.190
 I wanted to go back to the neighborhood because in the 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.050
 background a person when they take that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.760
 decision so strong I say I do not 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.040
 I want to come back not from my parents I 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.380
 I remember a client who came to have a 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.150
 portfolio of 15 million dollars jon 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.860
 in the crisis of 2008 when bankrupt 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.620
 lehman brothers is what he lost everything 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.630
 he did not lose everything and electrocuted to 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.080
 live at the parents' house 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.050
 he was 50 years old living with the 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.430
 In-laws at age 60 and above all 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.360
 after having a standard of living 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.550
 amazing 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.820
 and I remember that he once 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.330
 I call 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.200
 to each of us who were his friends 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.240
 and those of us who attended the business of 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.860
 we handled the portfolio he called us and he 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.720
 He called me one by one until I 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.460
 called me and vaniel is that I'm 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.170
 collecting money for my school 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.860
 children and asia 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.740
 and how can this happen why it happened 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.200
 that 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.689
 notice that this happens to someone with 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.210
 money without the right mindset but 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.610
 it also happens to someone without money 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.440
 joins the right mindset think that 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.560
 all part of the mind should not 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.840
 develop entrepreneurial skills and 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.239
 develop entrepreneurial skills and 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.790
 skills to become rich part of 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.260
 nonsense like this is why they say 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.870
 to a truly rich how much 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.910
 saves and saves 99% because 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.220
 Look, your income goes up but 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.590
 your ability to spend is not much 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.709
 although it does not enter faster than 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.959
 it comes out most of the time it comes out more 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.819
 fast of what goes in what is what 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.180
 called the mab in the sea ​​and parkinson 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.209
 your income if your expenses are much more 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.940
 fast what your income goes up for that 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.650
 never enough if there is a rise never 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.110
 it is enough if there is an increase of 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.709
 never enough salary if you suffer the wrong 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.140
 of Parkinson's costs the speed with 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.030
 what you spend is much greater than 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.060
 speed with which you enter 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.550
 you have to focus here and 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.790
 develop the discipline to do 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.209
 this 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.890
 they asked to Aristotle onassis that 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.609
 in the decade of the 60 was the man more 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.609
 rich of the world 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.299
 they asked him he started I think that 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.930
 selling stick spoons on the street 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:25.750
 in greece to lower the name richer 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.569
 of the world and then he said 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.220
 they ask good what is your 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.950
 lucky charm what do you do for 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.620
 have confidence and he said when 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.129
 I sold spoons and I was poor what 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.500
 was I was saving everything I could 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.540
 It made a wad of bills like that and 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.420
 I put everything in my pocket 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.780
 day I felt a lump 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.970
 and that bulge for me was trust 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.280
 and they ask and you keep doing it 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.750
 and then I keep doing it and 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.650
 then the usual one is not the money 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.540
 generates trust is to say money is not 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.810
 it's trust because money is not you 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.720
 you money is simply a vehicle 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.150
 for you to achieve things I prefer to study the 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.280
 money the money what happens is that 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:16.430
 when you have a mattress on the 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.430
 what fall that generates confidence 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.660
 If you get kicked out and have and have hundred 

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:25.330
 thousand euros in the bank that generates you 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.670
 trust because you say good in more or 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.880
 except I endure a few months 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:34.930
 because that generates certain confidence 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.090
 certainty that was what he meant 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.400
 Aristotle Onassis special feel that 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.720
 here when I was in negotiations 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.070
 when they are negotiating to buy another 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.050
 company or was negotiating something 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.770
 important I felt it's fast I 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.170
 I felt strong with confidence that I had the 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.800
 muscle and the skills to carry 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.030
 that out 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.970
 and that in general this 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.430
 when it rains on the bus and I already 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.710
 I was making good money and I 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.450
 inside me because where did you tell me 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.430
 you would let you buy a car and be 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.820
 estate excellence but what other ideas 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.660
 I in cyanjur still there quietly still 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:17.060
 there still quiet but I do not know 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.210
 I was trying to give myself some candies 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.680
 like certain mental rewards and I 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.530
 when I was sitting on the bus 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.410
 and of course how I took it from my house 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.630
 and my neighborhood was poor textually that 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.940
 the bus went up were poor people 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.330
 that's why the bus and is winning wing 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.550
 money and I said incredible me in a month 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.180
 won more than all these people in a year 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.990
 meeting 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.710
 cast 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.020
 I arrived as superman bag 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.200
 I was not not living that reality 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.940
 but I already had 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:58.190
 trust in the bank now 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.700
 every time urgently here is not the 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.760
 money is because that already generates you look 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.320
 what 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:11.520
 the mentality the mentality of a 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.530
 person with scarcity mentality is not 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.870
 the same as the mentality of a 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.570
 person with the abundance mentality 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:22.140
 brain the mind of a person who 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:24.990
 earn a thousand euros a month is not the same nor 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.430
 even biologically that the brain 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.980
 of a person who earns a million 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.050
 dollars because that person to win 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.480
 million dollars does some things 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.240
 different from the things that a 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.030
 person who earns a thousand euros what he does 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.780
 is different thinks differently ago 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:45.000
 different feels different our 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.780
 mentality generates a few grooves in the 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.520
 brain that changes your mind because 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.010
 start doing things a million 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.590
 dollars he makes them and repeats them and the 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:58.230
 repeats and repeats it and that creates 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:01.200
 the brain a few neural connections 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:04.440
 different from the ones you develop 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.060
 when you do the same thing every day I 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.249
 sometimes I asked some people 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.580
 what are you working for? 

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:15.729
 and they tell me to live 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.680
 it's not that that's why he paid debts and with that 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:21.960
 alive 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.960
 while I tell him and for that you live 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.930
 a life without meaning 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:31.050
 a life without meaning 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:33.720
 notice that most suicides 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.500
 occur in people who have a life 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.870
 meaningless 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.630
 a life in which they do not know to 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.490
 where are they going 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.350
 a life in which they do not know to 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:46.840
 what did they come to this world 

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:49.740
 a life that unfolds in a 

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.780
 work they hate 

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:55.030
 making a job for someone who 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:57.400
 they are for 80 years 

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:59.650
 a life without meaning 

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.200
 why do you work to pay debts without 

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.070
 sense 

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.070
 not a life without meaning
