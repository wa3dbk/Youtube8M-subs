the<00:01:07.619> face<00:01:07.829> and<00:01:08.579> nicely<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.780> know<00:01:10.280> jump<00:01:11.280> saw

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
the face and nicely you know jump saw

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.789 
the face and nicely you know jump saw
you<00:01:11.700> know<00:01:11.789> with<00:01:11.939> high<00:01:12.180> allows<00:01:12.450> softly<00:01:13.409> lon<00:01:13.619> it

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
you know with high allows softly lon it

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.609 
you know with high allows softly lon it
on<00:01:14.399> the<00:01:14.640> green<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.149> it's<00:01:15.930> actually<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.229> pretty

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
on the green so it's actually a pretty

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
couple times and I don't have an issue

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.669 
couple times and I don't have an issue
will<00:01:21.000> speak<00:01:21.329> because<00:01:21.450> now<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.140> golf<00:01:22.469> balls

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
will speak because now I know golf balls

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:24.830 
will speak because now I know golf balls
to<00:01:22.920> an<00:01:23.009> extent<00:01:23.280> all<00:01:23.460> player<00:01:23.789> dependent<00:01:24.359> but

what swing speed range should probably

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:29.450 
what swing speed range should probably
gravitate<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.679> this<00:01:28.799> ball<00:01:29.009> more<00:01:29.219> than<00:01:29.250> the

gravitate to this ball more than the
other<00:01:29.609> one<00:01:29.789> I'd<00:01:30.240> say<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.570> know<00:01:30.750> 90<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.770> great

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
other one I'd say you know 90 is a great

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.209 
other one I'd say you know 90 is a great
but<00:01:32.460> even<00:01:32.850> below<00:01:33.149> 80<00:01:33.539> or<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.289> know<00:01:34.409> semi<00:01:34.859> area

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
but even below 80 or you know semi area

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.459 
but even below 80 or you know semi area
this<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.939> great<00:01:36.149> golf<00:01:36.390> ball<00:01:36.630> because<00:01:37.109> of<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
this is a great golf ball because of the

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.160 
this is a great golf ball because of the
compression<00:01:37.859> and<00:01:38.759> lesbian<00:01:39.479> distance<00:01:39.899> cover

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
compression and lesbian distance cover

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.020 
compression and lesbian distance cover
and<00:01:40.460> raising<00:01:41.460> speed<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.359> i'd<00:01:42.780> say<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.200> 80<00:01:43.499> 85

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
and raising speed so i'd say like 80 85

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.059 
and raising speed so i'd say like 80 85
