00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.290
 call of duty 4 i have chain by 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.469
 joining the army 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.719
 realize how many times time 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.420
 yes the one and only den bosch is here 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.220
 again and as you have heard 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.140
 i'm going every new commentary your it 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.750
 start with a kind of cia call or duty 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.250
 quotes and today I have a gameplay on 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.560
 the mat plazza 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.320
 pastors and I have a gun here now 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.510
 had clear with my n57 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.520
 I have the bedding twice and once 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.690
 the perk 2 and then treat it again 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.610
 perk 3 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.320
 and I think a c4 not Occur 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.750
 certainly because the gameplay comes out with each 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.770
 new former pistols i have the five 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.660
 seven taken 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.239
 the five seven each why first 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.960
 every jan lagendijk has you i must 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.820
 say 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.680
 but if you are a little bit and triggerfinger 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.739
 I quickly got one 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.109
 clicks then a wrap would die 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.840
 we also had the 5c from 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.940
 chosen is yes to yes with that 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.240
 to connect the trigger finger 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.369
 the auction drove with that weapon, but it was 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.320
 say if secondary is the highest of 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.640
 all secondaries yes outside of the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.049
 automatic 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.000
 so if you have a bit of a second finger 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.540
 and you just know how to thereby 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.640
 play 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.530
 so yes I said it pastors and 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.390
 in places in the second half I get 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.729
 the are also leather and I was very happy that 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.979
 I finally got it because I 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.570
 wish she is something special to you 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.189
 say entertain so I stay with 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.530
 you we are going to have a gun no clear 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.299
 because the knife now posts clothes 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.820
 channel was very successful 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.680
 yes then there certainly had to come I think 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.869
 I also say yes again recently 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.490
 tried other special things 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.899
 like the crossbow 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.899
 and what I have happened is the counter 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.060
 seek knife thermally often succeeded there 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.909
 I also stopped in last 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.310
 then the boss also s but something each out 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.530
 the angry salt say for the bullets 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.969
 me scavenger see geeratz in you on in in 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.180
 it's very hard to kill someone 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.110
 then on a good street 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.659
 to get to 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.159
 So baby swirling in the cache but stabbed 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.979
 where I might still do is 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.009
 for example the tag 45 that is one too 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.830
 a hanke mine 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.920
 in a very high damage I will certainly 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.709
 for you to try or or the 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.140
 called out there hand gun 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.879
 executioner damage it so clear 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.010
 all still try to show one 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:27.489
 comment where you want to see me 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.260
 as a weapon and that I have to use 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.909
 to get a nuclear 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.440
 so that was a long intro but i can 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.370
 now to the real thing 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.409
 topic 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.780
 I have holes left 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.739
 comparative gaming around belgium all 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.150
 stars 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.590
 and you all know he a few 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.230
 weeks ago it was 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.760
 games tournament we have fun with this 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.590
 participated 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.590
 played against other customers and 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.019
 ultimately as the winner that 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.150
 was very nice to do what I 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.609
 noted is that we like 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.590
 comparative gaming just came up 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.599
 to each other 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.389
 we know what the others are about 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.459
 what i want to say is carla 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.109
 scarlet are very important in one 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.519
 comparative game 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.889
 because it that i said yes i can do it 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.720
 compare to a video river if you like 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.790
 Callouts indicates to your team that you know something 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.980
 they immediately know where they are and can 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.709
 she eventually also got him 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.040
 switch on tanja map north sea normal 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.440
 never 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.290
 By this I mean actually knowing 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.870
 what you are going to do and also yes you 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.699
 must know in which folder you what and where 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.319
 gotta give dad 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:35.620
 yes a specific example example 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.060
 from english in which folder you 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.160
 which tree only applies 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.079
 this is the bomb every time 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.819
 plants go somewhere 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.069
 will still see it 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.230
 and optionally the diffuser 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.879
 when to hold but then say the 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.040
 back routes 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.180
 also speaks metmeti I want for example 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.000
 in hardpoint 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.489
 Anchor the spanish for the spawn 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.379
 gosh yeah men and type ls people out of it 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.449
 one came meaning to just listen 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:04.150
 play along a lot that came 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.780
 get to know them what they do and what weapon they use 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.870
 use 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.120
 talk to each other and an annual fair 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.459
 great chance to spend a minute there nice as 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.129
 race winner come true that each 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.030
 then the following year after the tournament of 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.280
 we have a king's 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.530
 with like him if there would be some kind of 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.670
 conversation hole among the all team and 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.460
 other members 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.460
 this conversation was about pure 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.380
 competitive level actually yes 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.540
 else matters' on the map or on 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.580
 to bring the map something we are going to 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.450
 we decided to then possibly with 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.020
 the team 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.300
 show here you turned it into every pan 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.340
 possibly switch to an xbox 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.130
 720 for next year 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.960
 because we all know x-box organizes 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.770
 many tournaments 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.750
 3 cm lg ideal for all those big tournaments 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.100
 which means that a lot of money is involved 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.890
 is 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.740
 you can also become known and possibly 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.360
 searching behind sponsors will say 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.800
 or they notice yours 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.690
 so actually you had the future of it 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.910
 I think comparative gaming anyway 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.500
 on the xbox side 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.320
 because that is all your longer than today 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.660
 known where do I hold a yes then we must 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.720
 all probably buy an xbox 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.820
 also a new controller because with ps3 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.800
 voice disease music sexy very natural 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.660
 because when i see you to all 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.180
 have comparative games of course 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.520
 all have their own tailor-made 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.010
 check with any adjustments 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.100
 like i greece crete for example 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.680
 ps3 stamp cartoon character step like you 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.710
 can shoot faster and so on so yes 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.120
 I think this is a big step 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.820
 will be for us because never have 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.039
 really really played competitive on xbox 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.900
 so your should learn the console 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.640
 know and so on 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.220
 but all in all i am really looking forward to it 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.130
 really hot to be around Belgium as well 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.750
 to really sit on the cart then 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.000
 your it leaves style i'm talking about 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.610
 crucial the game play generally there 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.530
 I already told so may further game 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.240
 place of mine 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.010
 I get angry at my main channel 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.220
 special game place or 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:14.000
 beautiful colors or settings and so on 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.979
 my jello is forest cycling and yes i do 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.460
 youtube is very happy in the promotes 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.330
 reports 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.039
 so the people had to 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.379
 are interested to have a look 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:23.250
 to take it to me it will be the link of 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:25.710
 my channel 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.629
 city ​​in the discription so when you sing 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.229
 church you could take in possibly 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:30.000
 a like 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.139
 i would say my dart super 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.270
 gamers 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.030
 so this was the commentary for today 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:43.590
 and see you next time 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:46.530
 very happy with it 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.270
 we who she skaters that I 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.770
 sometimes 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.770
 one'sa of the language
