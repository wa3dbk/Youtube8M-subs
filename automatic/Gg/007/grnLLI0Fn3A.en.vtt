00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
money can be used for and also with my

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.670 
money can be used for and also with my
oldest<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:31.140> college<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:32.400> incurring

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
oldest in college that is incurring

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.120 
oldest in college that is incurring
surprise<00:02:36.020> expenses<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:37.260> pop<00:02:37.470> up<00:02:37.740> here<00:02:38.070> and

surprise expenses that pop up here and
there<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:38.820> so<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.690> guess<00:02:39.900> I'm<00:02:40.080> just<00:02:40.230> kind<00:02:40.410> of

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
there and so I guess I'm just kind of

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.670 
there and so I guess I'm just kind of
reevaluating<00:02:42.450> what<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.660> want<00:02:42.930> my<00:02:43.110> nursery<00:02:43.470> and
