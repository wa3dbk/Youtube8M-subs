ops control words it's a lot like that
controller<00:00:59.120> but<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:00.239> rubberized<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
controller but they rubberized the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.340 
controller but they rubberized the
thumbsticks<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.359> which<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.719> probably<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
thumbsticks here which is probably the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.740 
thumbsticks here which is probably the
best<00:01:04.559> thing<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.830> they<00:01:04.920> could<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.750> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
best thing that they could do the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.630 
best thing that they could do the
buttons<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.500> or<00:01:07.650> flat<00:01:07.920> top<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.430> are

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
buttons on here or flat top is that are

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.780 
buttons on here or flat top is that are
rounded<00:01:09.110> does<00:01:10.110> very<00:01:10.380> well<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:11.369> far<00:01:11.549> as<00:01:11.670> that

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
rounded does very well as far as that

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.120 
rounded does very well as far as that
goes<00:01:13.100> I<00:01:15.170> keep<00:01:16.170> jumping<00:01:16.470> into<00:01:16.590> parties<00:01:16.979> here

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
