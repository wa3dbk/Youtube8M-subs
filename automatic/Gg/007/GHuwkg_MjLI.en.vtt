00:00:03.137 --> 00:00:05.697
Good morning in Djenne.

00:00:07.627 --> 00:00:10.156
Yesterday I walked around this town.
Here is good place, so I like here.

00:00:11.397 --> 00:00:15.143
But today I leave and go to next town.

00:00:32.376 --> 00:00:35.085
Yesterday the big African market 
was held in here.

00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:42.954
This is Monday Market in Djenne.
Every one who live around here 
come to Djenne.

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:03.976
Many many people...

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:17.044
I want go out from Djenne.
But there are some hurdles 
to go out from Djenne.

00:01:23.056 --> 00:01:24.579
Hurdles No.1

00:01:26.588 --> 00:01:30.991
Back street like a mazea labyrint.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.548
I can get over Hurdles No.1!

00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:10.730
Hurdles No.2

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.292
Crossing the river by boat.

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:23.715
The day before yesterday,
it was difficult to 
take me and my bicycle on board.

00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:31.266
I had to pay extra money to help...

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.923
I hope it is easy to take on board...

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.400
To take on board is no problem.

00:03:44.454 --> 00:03:47.823
How about stepping onto land...?

00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:11.214
Oh!? it is easy to step onto land today!

00:04:15.243 --> 00:04:17.702
I can get over Hurdles No.2!

00:04:21.714 --> 00:04:25.091
Why did the boat get to the shore
the day before yesterday!
