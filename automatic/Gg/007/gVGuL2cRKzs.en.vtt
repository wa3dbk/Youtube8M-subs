his his TVs he has always been his best

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.460 
his his TVs he has always been his best
matchup<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.340> my<00:01:50.490> opinion<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.899> looked<00:01:52.079> at

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.800 
matchup in my opinion I have looked at
stowe<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:52.920> his<00:01:53.280> TV<00:01:54.030> has<00:01:54.240> always<00:01:54.509> been<00:01:54.630> very

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810

what<00:02:46.790> I'm<00:02:46.880> thinking<00:02:47.350> it's<00:02:48.350> a<00:02:48.610> safe<00:02:49.610> build<00:02:50.060> on

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
what I'm thinking it's a safe build on

what I'm thinking it's a safe build on
this<00:02:50.600> map<00:02:50.900> especially<00:02:51.790> he<00:02:52.790> hasn't<00:02:53.500> scouted

this map especially he hasn't scouted

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.520 
this map especially he hasn't scouted
though<00:02:54.800> so<00:02:55.400> he<00:02:55.550> doesn't<00:02:55.880> know<00:02:56.080> that<00:02:57.080> what<00:02:57.410> we

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
though so he doesn't know that what we

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.980 
though so he doesn't know that what we
do<00:02:57.680> which<00:02:57.890> is<00:02:57.920> that<00:02:58.190> hoja<00:02:59.120> has<00:02:59.209> gone<00:02:59.390> for<00:02:59.690> a

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
do which is that hoja has gone for a

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.110

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
and then getting his pool later so

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.620 
and then getting his pool later so
doesn't<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:04.880> worry<00:03:05.000> about<00:03:05.090> any<00:03:05.330> early
