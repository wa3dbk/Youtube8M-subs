00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
cutting length and but techno is also

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.359 
cutting length and but techno is also
much<00:01:05.339> more<00:01:05.549> pricier<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.510> about<00:01:07.040> $150<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
much more pricier this is about $150 and

much more pricier this is about $150 and
this<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.670> about<00:01:08.939> $100<00:01:09.510> knife<00:01:10.189> okay<00:01:11.189> some

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
this is about $100 knife okay some

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.440 
this is about $100 knife okay some
details<00:01:11.939> over<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.720> leaf<00:01:13.049> storm<00:01:13.790> you<00:01:14.790> says<00:01:15.060> I

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
details over the leaf storm you says I

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.679 
details over the leaf storm you says I
think<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.380> sparticles<00:01:17.100> first

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
think this is for sparticles first

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.789 
think this is for sparticles first
translucent<00:01:18.689> g10<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:22.290> design<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.740> very

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
translucent g10 and the design is very

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.090 
translucent g10 and the design is very
nice<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:24.180> has<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> great<00:01:24.810> handle<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.590> handle<00:01:25.770> is

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
nice it has a great handle the handle is

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.319 
nice it has a great handle the handle is
a<00:01:26.130> little<00:01:26.549> bit<00:01:26.909> larger<00:01:27.810> than<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.970> Technos<00:01:29.970> as

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
a little bit larger than the Technos as

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.289 
a little bit larger than the Technos as
you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.570> see<00:01:30.720> here<00:01:31.909> it's<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.000> little<00:01:33.150> bit

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
you can see here it's a little bit

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.510 
you can see here it's a little bit
larger<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.350> actually<00:01:34.560> have<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> better

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
larger so so you actually have a better

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.859 
larger so so you actually have a better
grip<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:38.070> blade<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.490> shorter<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.750> be

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
grip the blade is shorter but to be

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.850 
grip the blade is shorter but to be
honest<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.520> most<00:01:41.520> EDC<00:01:42.509> tasks<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.500> cutting

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
honest for most EDC tasks like cutting

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.850 
honest for most EDC tasks like cutting
boxes<00:01:45.140> it's<00:01:46.140> more<00:01:46.640> more<00:01:47.640> than<00:01:47.820> enough<00:01:48.860> okay

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
boxes it's more more than enough okay

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.380 
boxes it's more more than enough okay
and<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.729> has<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> very<00:01:51.149> nice<00:01:53.119> lanyard<00:01:54.119> hole

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and it has a very nice lanyard hole

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.039 
and it has a very nice lanyard hole
design<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:55.439> go<00:01:55.619> through<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.189> scale<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
design you go through the scale and the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.499 
design you go through the scale and the
scale<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.409> also<00:01:58.890> one<00:01:59.250> piece<00:01:59.520> scales<00:02:00.119> kind<00:02:00.420> of

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
scale is also one piece scales kind of

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.109 
scale is also one piece scales kind of
like<00:02:01.280> Striders<00:02:02.479> so<00:02:03.479> that's<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.780> very<00:02:04.020> strong

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
like Striders so that's a very strong

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.059 
like Striders so that's a very strong
scale<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:07.740> frame<00:02:08.009> lock<00:02:08.509> its<00:02:09.509> titanium<00:02:10.039> it's<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
scale the frame lock its titanium it's a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.080 
scale the frame lock its titanium it's a
little<00:02:11.340> bit<00:02:11.459> thin<00:02:11.790> but

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
little bit thin but

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.740 
little bit thin but
it's<00:02:13.420> more<00:02:13.750> than<00:02:13.900> enough<00:02:14.230> for<00:02:14.650> this<00:02:14.830> knife<00:02:15.069> and

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
it's more than enough for this knife and

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.880 
it's more than enough for this knife and
these<00:02:16.750> standard<00:02:18.750> particle<00:02:19.750> clip<00:02:20.020> compared<00:02:20.739> to

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
these standard particle clip compared to

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.500 
these standard particle clip compared to
the<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.550> really<00:02:22.180> like<00:02:22.300> this<00:02:23.459> clip<00:02:24.459> style<00:02:24.849> style

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
the I really like this clip style style

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.750 
the I really like this clip style style
clip<00:02:27.450> okay

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
clip okay

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.729 
clip okay
the<00:02:30.760> tango<00:02:31.120> has<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.569> back<00:02:31.930> spacer<00:02:32.230> which<00:02:32.590> I

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
the tango has the back spacer which I

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.820 
the tango has the back spacer which I
like<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.010> lot<00:02:33.130> also<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:34.750> provides<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.470> lot<00:02:35.680> of

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
like a lot also it provides a lot of

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.190 
like a lot also it provides a lot of
traction<00:02:37.170> no<00:02:38.170> traction<00:02:38.590> here<00:02:38.890> but<00:02:39.660> again<00:02:40.660> you

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
traction no traction here but again you

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.780 
traction no traction here but again you
don't<00:02:41.380> really<00:02:41.500> need<00:02:41.769> a<00:02:41.980> lot<00:02:42.130> of<00:02:42.250> traction<00:02:42.550> on

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
don't really need a lot of traction on

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.400 
don't really need a lot of traction on
these<00:02:42.940> are<00:02:43.150> small<00:02:43.420> knives<00:02:44.850> both<00:02:45.850> actually<00:02:46.720> the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
these are small knives both actually the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.400 
these are small knives both actually the
lift<00:02:47.860> stones<00:02:48.069> jump<00:02:48.730> in<00:02:48.940> it's<00:02:49.239> sharper<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.230> it's

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
lift stones jump in it's sharper so it's

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.220 
lift stones jump in it's sharper so it's
more<00:02:50.590> useful<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:52.090> Technos<00:02:52.450> jimping<00:02:52.959> is<00:02:53.080> a

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
more useful the Technos jimping is a

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.120 
more useful the Technos jimping is a
little<00:02:53.530> bit<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.739> slippery<00:02:55.500> step<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.680> did<00:02:56.860> it

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
little bit a slippery step I did it

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.610 
little bit a slippery step I did it
slippery<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:58.420> blade<00:02:58.630> shape<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:59.049> both<00:02:59.290> are

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
slippery the blade shape of both are

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
very similar with techno has a little

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.000 
very similar with techno has a little
bit<00:03:05.380> more<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:05.799> a<00:03:05.950> belly<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:10.420> opening<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.290> both

but I think well it's not I think the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.920 
but I think well it's not I think the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
you to open it you need a little bit

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.819 
you to open it you need a little bit
more<00:03:46.980> grip<00:03:47.980> okay<00:03:48.730> but<00:03:49.260> with<00:03:50.260> nail<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.680> can

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
more grip okay but with nail you can

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.120

strength-wise<00:03:54.310> I<00:03:55.019> think<00:03:56.019> thing<00:03:56.650> no<00:03:56.829> it's<00:03:57.130> a

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
strength-wise I think thing no it's a

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.610 
strength-wise I think thing no it's a
little<00:03:57.609> bit<00:03:57.730> stronger<00:03:58.060> as<00:03:58.269> you<00:03:58.359> can<00:03:58.510> see<00:03:58.690> it

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
little bit stronger as you can see it

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.750 
little bit stronger as you can see it
has<00:03:59.769> a<00:03:59.850> both<00:04:00.850> titanium<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:02.100> thicker<00:04:03.100> frame

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.930 
has a both titanium and thicker frame
lock<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:05.400> Tecna<00:04:06.400> also<00:04:06.700> has<00:04:06.910> a<00:04:06.940> much<00:04:07.900> thicker

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
lock and Tecna also has a much thicker

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.479 
lock and Tecna also has a much thicker
blade<00:04:10.109> although<00:04:11.109> the<00:04:11.410> tip<00:04:11.650> as<00:04:11.799> can<00:04:12.040> see<00:04:12.250> both

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
blade although the tip as can see both

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.890 
blade although the tip as can see both
are<00:04:12.730> about<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.090> same<00:04:13.299> but<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:15.130> blast<00:04:15.400> of

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
are about the same but the blast of

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.460 
are about the same but the blast of
techno<00:04:16.900> has<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:17.769> thicker<00:04:18.639> blade<00:04:19.359> stock<00:04:20.700> okay<00:04:21.700> so

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
techno has a thicker blade stock okay so

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.810
