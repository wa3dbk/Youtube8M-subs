show you how you can group the object
and<00:00:05.819> then<00:00:06.000> make<00:00:06.899> it<00:00:07.049> one<00:00:07.350> single<00:00:07.830> object<00:00:07.950> out

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
and then make it one single object out

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.879 
and then make it one single object out
of<00:00:08.340> many<00:00:09.030> pieces<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.080> we<00:00:10.290> can<00:00:10.679> make

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
of many pieces and that we can make

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.789 
of many pieces and that we can make
easier<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.639> move<00:00:11.849> animate<00:00:12.269> or<00:00:12.840> export<00:00:13.469> does

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
easier to move animate or export does

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.570 
easier to move animate or export does
obj<00:00:14.429> file<00:00:14.870> anyways<00:00:15.870> let's<00:00:16.619> get<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.980> object<00:00:17.400> in

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
obj file anyways let's get the object in

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.420 
obj file anyways let's get the object in
this<00:00:17.789> case<00:00:18.020> we'll<00:00:19.020> go<00:00:19.050> Windows<00:00:19.590> contact

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
this case we'll go Windows contact
