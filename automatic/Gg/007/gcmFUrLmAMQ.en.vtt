hello this is no with joyous garden and

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.540 
hello this is no with joyous garden and
today<00:00:07.379> I'm<00:00:07.589> going<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.799> show<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:07.980> how<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.280> prune

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
today I'm going to show you how to prune

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.360 
today I'm going to show you how to prune
a<00:00:08.610> schefflera<00:00:09.059> Arbor<00:00:09.660> Kola<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.830> most<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.250> you

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
a schefflera Arbor Kola so most of you

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.160 
a schefflera Arbor Kola so most of you
have<00:00:11.519> probably<00:00:11.550> seen<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.269> as<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.389> house<00:00:12.630> plant<00:00:12.840> I

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
have probably seen it as a house plant I

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.039 
have probably seen it as a house plant I
used<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.559> work<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.040> interior<00:00:14.759> field<00:00:15.660> and

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
used to work in the interior field and

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.599 
used to work in the interior field and
we<00:00:16.170> used<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.470> put<00:00:16.650> them<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:16.890> offices<00:00:17.430> and

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
we used to put them in offices and

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.390 
we used to put them in offices and
buildings<00:00:17.850> but<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.630> one<00:00:18.960> as<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.920> can<00:00:20.130> see

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
buildings but this one as you can see

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.240 
buildings but this one as you can see
which<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.760> probably<00:00:21.420> about<00:00:21.689> 15<00:00:22.289> feet<00:00:22.560> or<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:22.949> is

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
which is probably about 15 feet or so is

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.150 
which is probably about 15 feet or so is
growing<00:00:24.210> outdoors<00:00:24.390> these<00:00:25.350> are<00:00:25.500> very<00:00:25.769> easy<00:00:26.039> to

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
growing outdoors these are very easy to

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.370 
growing outdoors these are very easy to
prune<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.240> sure<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.539> take<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.810> all<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
prune just be sure to take it all the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.200 
prune just be sure to take it all the
way<00:00:28.740> back<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.340> where<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.609> comes<00:00:29.849> out<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
way back to where it comes out of the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.330 
way back to where it comes out of the
main<00:00:30.390> stem<00:00:30.720> other<00:00:31.349> ways<00:00:31.800> you're<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> get

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
main stem other ways you're going to get

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.389 
main stem other ways you're going to get
a<00:00:32.369> lot<00:00:32.610> more<00:00:32.640> branching<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.559> indoors

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
a lot more branching on it and indoors

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.190 
a lot more branching on it and indoors
it's<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> same<00:00:35.969> way<00:00:36.180> indoors<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.110> to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
it's the same way indoors it's going to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.319 
it's the same way indoors it's going to
grow<00:00:37.350> slower<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.489> not<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> need<00:00:39.149> as

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
grow slower so it's not going to need as

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.630 
grow slower so it's not going to need as
much<00:00:39.510> pruning<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.230> may<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:41.040> get<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> little

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
much pruning it may just get a little

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.240 
much pruning it may just get a little
bit<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> leggy<00:00:42.420> side<00:00:42.800> because<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:44.100> not

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
bit on the leggy side because it's not

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.880 
bit on the leggy side because it's not
getting<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.820> light<00:00:45.030> at<00:00:45.210> once<00:00:45.480> or<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.379> air<00:00:46.590> is

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
getting the light at once or the air is

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.299 
getting the light at once or the air is
dry<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.719> there<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.260> give<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.860> good<00:00:50.070> hard

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
dry so there you can give it a good hard

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.340 
dry so there you can give it a good hard
prune<00:00:50.700> all<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.270> way<00:00:51.420> back<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.110> will

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
prune all the way back and that will

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.439 
prune all the way back and that will
rejuvenate<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> branch<00:00:54.329> that

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
rejuvenate it and this is a branch that

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.270 
rejuvenate it and this is a branch that
crosses<00:00:54.989> over<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.469> I'm<00:00:55.680> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.070> take

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
crosses over so I'm going to just take

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.549 
crosses over so I'm going to just take
this<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:56.610> right<00:00:56.850> out<00:01:00.500> like<00:01:01.500> here<00:01:03.470> going<00:01:04.470> to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
this one right out like here going to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.539 
this one right out like here going to
open<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.159> up<00:01:05.689> even<00:01:06.689> more<00:01:06.720> shoe<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.250> might

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
open it up even more shoe and I might

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.789 
open it up even more shoe and I might
take<00:01:08.850> out<00:01:09.090> I'm<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.409> because<00:01:10.710> this

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
take out I'm not going to because this

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.980 
take out I'm not going to because this
is<00:01:10.979> actually<00:01:11.130> my<00:01:11.490> neighbor's<00:01:11.880> plant<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.869> I'm

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
is actually my neighbor's plant but I'm

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.359 
is actually my neighbor's plant but I'm
going<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> tell<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.590> would<00:01:13.770> probably<00:01:13.979> take

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
going to tell you I would probably take

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.810 
going to tell you I would probably take
out<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:15.119> one<00:01:15.650> right<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:17.189> too<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.490> cause

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
out this one right here too just cause

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.870 
out this one right here too just cause
it's<00:01:18.060> crossing<00:01:18.360> over<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.170> bit<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.189> there's

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
it's crossing over a bit and there's

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.719 
it's crossing over a bit and there's
some<00:01:21.119> small<00:01:21.450> growth<00:01:21.810> coming<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.530> here<00:01:23.460> I'm

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
some small growth coming up in here I'm

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.149 
some small growth coming up in here I'm
going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> take<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.630> out<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.920> have

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
going to take that out but if you have

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.490 
going to take that out but if you have
it<00:01:26.310> as<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> house<00:01:26.790> plant<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.509> yours<00:01:27.990> has<00:01:28.140> gotten

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
it as a house plant and yours has gotten

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.950 
it as a house plant and yours has gotten
on<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.920> leggy<00:01:29.159> side<00:01:29.549> which<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.000> probably<00:01:30.360> has

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
on the leggy side which it probably has

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.600 
on the leggy side which it probably has
you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:32.070> actually<00:01:32.579> take<00:01:33.299> these<00:01:33.509> back<00:01:33.920> all<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
you can actually take these back all the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.120 
you can actually take these back all the
way<00:01:35.759> down<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.950> what's<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.100> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
way down to here and what's going to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.740 
way down to here and what's going to
happen<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:40.189> there<00:01:41.189> will<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.460> node<00:01:41.820> here

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
happen is that there will be a node here

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.859 
happen is that there will be a node here
so<00:01:43.020> say<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.409> do<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> cut<00:01:43.829> right<00:01:44.100> here<00:01:44.520> I

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
so say if you do the cut right here I

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.120 
so say if you do the cut right here I
would<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.200> as<00:01:46.320> an<00:01:46.470> angle<00:01:46.860> because<00:01:47.040> I

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
would do it as an angle because I

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.090 
would do it as an angle because I
usually<00:01:47.369> Pruden<00:01:47.729> an<00:01:47.820> angle<00:01:48.210> then<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.079> new<00:01:49.320> but

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
usually Pruden an angle then the new but

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.830 
usually Pruden an angle then the new but
the<00:01:50.280> new<00:01:50.490> growth<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.090> going<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.329> come<00:01:51.540> out<00:01:51.689> of

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
the new growth is going to come out of

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.450 
the new growth is going to come out of
here<00:01:52.140> they<00:01:52.950> are<00:01:53.189> very<00:01:53.780> easy<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.020> prune<00:01:55.500> this

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
here they are very easy to prune this

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.389 
here they are very easy to prune this
one<00:01:56.790> if<00:01:57.119> they<00:01:57.689> wanted<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.229> keep<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.619> lower<00:01:58.860> they

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
one if they wanted to keep it lower they

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.910 
one if they wanted to keep it lower they
could<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> total<00:02:00.450> tip<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.560> takes

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
could do a total tip on it it takes

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.639 
could do a total tip on it it takes
pruning<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:02.640> well<00:02:02.880> these<00:02:03.450> are<00:02:03.659> used<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.079> bonsai

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
pruning so well these are used in bonsai

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.700 
pruning so well these are used in bonsai
any<00:02:05.040> plant<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> bonsai<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.500> take

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
any plant that is a bonsai can take

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.740 
any plant that is a bonsai can take
pruning<00:02:08.190> because<00:02:08.789> I've<00:02:09.000> seen<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.420> plant

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
pruning because I've seen this plant

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.550 
pruning because I've seen this plant
this<00:02:10.679> tall<00:02:11.039> with<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> trunk<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:12.000> big

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
this tall with a trunk this big

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.400 
this tall with a trunk this big
in<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.950> pot<00:02:13.190> this<00:02:13.580> deep<00:02:13.940> so<00:02:14.720> if<00:02:14.959> you<00:02:15.110> know<00:02:15.350> you

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
in a pot this deep so if you know you

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.860 
in a pot this deep so if you know you
see<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.190> way<00:02:16.459> it<00:02:17.000> can<00:02:17.209> take<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.450> good<00:02:17.660> hard

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
see it that way it can take a good hard

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.230
