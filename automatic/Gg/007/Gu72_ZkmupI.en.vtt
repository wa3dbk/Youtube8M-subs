00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:11.459
 hi with you or ofighenia i work in 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.520
 help my mac today we will replace 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:19.109
 cooler on the computer 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.529
 macbook pro retina 15 inches beginning of 2013 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.560
 of the year 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.189
 cooler behaves like that means it's spinning 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.470
 works everything cools but after 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.970
 there work hours starts to make a lot of noise 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.900
 handed over in this case requires replacement 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.030
 cooler because they are collapsible here for 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:46.770
 replacements we need a pint screwdriver 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:51.480
 Torx t5 forehead and screwdriver tweezers and maybe 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.290
 need plastic fright so well 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.290
 let's get started 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.350
 lies the computer I turned it off with a button 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.750
 naturally already completely system 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.400
 off so here are these two screws we have 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:17.950
 different so i spun off first 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:21.820
 queue here and remember where they were they 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.190
 slightly shorter than the other 8 screws in 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.690
 Generally, if suddenly , somewhere, something 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.259
 confuse you can figure out what they are 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.259
 shorter 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.100
 twist 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:53.289
 so now here's a cap on 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.979
 magnets but it just goes up 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:59.860
 invested in the side 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.860
 before all work is required 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.520
 disconnect the battery here we have it 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:11.420
 turns off if you have nails they have 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:16.730
 I think you can eat here 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.709
 like this, piping is important here first thing 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.750
 disconnect the battery before starting all 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.610
 of works 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:32.480
 so that means that this cooler makes noise here 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:38.650
 what we need to do we need to glue here 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:47.810
 take this screwdriver 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:50.870
 fifth unscrew 3 tape which 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.200
 fixes him remember be sure 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.650
 the location of these screws because they 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.160
 all three screws are different absolutely possible 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:05.150
 take a plastic spud of the mountains over here 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:11.859
 we need to latch it at 90 degrees 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:14.859
 lift after that you can take tweezers and 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.859
 pull out 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:26.090
 respectively a cable from the connector and 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:30.519
 get the fan here is back installation 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.519
 nothing complicated no just take 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.159
 fan i will show right on the same 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.329
 to not 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:44.420
 don't go don't look fan take 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:47.000
 First of all we insert the connector plume into 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:56.450
 insert the connector with your finger straight 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:00.849
 snap the latch then a little 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.849
 we put the screws on without twisting 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:22.430
 convinced that he was standing exactly pressed him 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:24.750
 and twisted this thing here in general 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.260
 stuck on the glue for some reason it is very 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:35.130
 weak can basically if you have 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:42.660
 if not so it's me doubled tape 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:46.680
 took can be planted can be planted on 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:54.320
 double tape can be back in principle 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:54.320
 do not plant here I recommend you all the same 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:06.730
 find a small piece of double scotch 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:09.580
 the thickness of this tape is 0 1 millimeter 0 1 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:13.440
 millimeter this is thin double scotch here 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.440
 here so here her striped this 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.400
 to glue 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.660
 that's responsible for a third of this gum 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.250
 I will not seal it now because 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:40.560
 I still have a bullet she always put here 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.630
 it means further when you glue here and 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.330
 gum 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:48.180
 insert the battery connector 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:52.220
 here you can take a plastic spud of mountains and 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.220
 A little bit there to replace the wires 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:09.090
 we crush we snap it 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:11.790
 cover exhibited exactly take 10 again 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.740
 screws tighten immediately and I need 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:17.330
 spin 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:23.790
 screwed the screws on the lid 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:27.030
 then you can twist like this 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.940
 fan replacement process on macbook 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.560
 pro retina 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.270
 nothing complicated you can do 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.710
 home conditions only need 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:41.510
 have screwdriver turks pentalobe screwdriver 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:47.660
 cake 1 cooler, respectively, must have 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:50.640
 here with you was Evgeny Belyaev 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:53.630
