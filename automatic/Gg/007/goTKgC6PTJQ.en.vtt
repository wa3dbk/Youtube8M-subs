once you've got the one you want you can
actually<00:01:06.329> tweak<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.110> because<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:08.219> that<00:01:08.460> is

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
actually tweak it because all that is

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.910 
actually tweak it because all that is
really<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.270> stuff<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> side<00:01:10.200> bars<00:01:10.530> and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
really just stuff on the side bars and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.129 
really just stuff on the side bars and
once<00:01:11.219> you've<00:01:11.430> done<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:12.509> select<00:01:12.929> the

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:13.139 
once you've done that you select the

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:15.379 
once you've done that you select the
photos<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.950> want<00:01:14.219> your<00:01:14.459> preset<00:01:14.999> to<00:01:15.240> be

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:15.389 
photos that you want your preset to be

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:18.469 
photos that you want your preset to be
applied<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.170> or<00:01:16.770> your<00:01:17.219> modified<00:01:17.729> preset<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
applied to or your modified preset and

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.930 
applied to or your modified preset and
you<00:01:18.630> hit<00:01:18.780> sync

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
you hit sync

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.960 
you hit sync
and<00:01:21.940> you'll<00:01:22.570> get<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.860> box<00:01:24.340> with<00:01:24.640> a<00:01:24.700> whole

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
and you'll get a a box with a whole

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.540 
and you'll get a a box with a whole
bunch<00:01:25.000> of<00:01:25.420> options<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:26.260> so<00:01:27.070> let's<00:01:27.340> say<00:01:27.520> you

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
bunch of options and so let's say you

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.140 
bunch of options and so let's say you
just<00:01:27.700> want<00:01:28.240> to<00:01:28.360> sink<00:01:29.220> certain<00:01:30.220> color<00:01:30.520> settings

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
just want to sink certain color settings

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.870 
just want to sink certain color settings
then<00:01:31.960> you<00:01:32.170> can<00:01:32.380> do<00:01:32.590> that<00:01:32.800> or<00:01:33.100> if<00:01:33.220> you<00:01:33.340> just<00:01:33.369> want

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
then you can do that or if you just want

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.850 
then you can do that or if you just want
to<00:01:34.080> sink<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:36.220> exposure<00:01:36.840> plus<00:01:37.840> 2<00:01:38.170> because<00:01:38.619> all

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
to sink the exposure plus 2 because all

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.030 
to sink the exposure plus 2 because all
your<00:01:39.070> photos<00:01:39.340> were<00:01:40.229> under<00:01:41.229> exposed<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:41.920> you

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
your photos were under exposed and you

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.469 
your photos were under exposed and you
want<00:01:42.220> to<00:01:42.310> add<00:01:42.430> a<00:01:42.460> little<00:01:42.729> bit<00:01:42.940> more<00:01:43.119> light<00:01:43.450> to

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
want to add a little bit more light to

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.810 
want to add a little bit more light to
them<00:01:43.900> and<00:01:44.170> so<00:01:44.800> there's<00:01:44.979> all<00:01:45.190> sorts<00:01:45.580> of<00:01:45.610> things

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
them and so there's all sorts of things

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:55.590 
them and so there's all sorts of things
that<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.119> can<00:01:46.300> do<00:01:49.560> there's<00:01:50.560> also<00:01:51.600> ways<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:54.600> if

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
that you can do there's also ways to if

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.020 
that you can do there's also ways to if
you<00:01:55.930> choose<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.380> lens<00:01:56.830> that<00:01:57.220> you<00:01:57.399> shot<00:01:57.729> with

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
you choose the lens that you shot with

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.749 
you choose the lens that you shot with
if<00:01:58.360> there's<00:01:58.899> any<00:01:59.080> distortion<00:01:59.890> from<00:02:00.160> that<00:02:00.369> lens

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
if there's any distortion from that lens

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.940 
if there's any distortion from that lens
you<00:02:01.720> can<00:02:01.899> actually<00:02:02.080> get<00:02:02.470> rid<00:02:02.710> of<00:02:02.800> the

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
you can actually get rid of the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.490 
you can actually get rid of the
distortion<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.820> then<00:02:03.940> apply<00:02:04.750> that<00:02:05.080> through<00:02:05.440> a

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
distortion and then apply that through a

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.969 
distortion and then apply that through a
preset<00:02:06.190> on<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:07.630> can<00:02:07.810> create<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.140> profile<00:02:08.770> and

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
preset on you can create a profile and

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.010 
preset on you can create a profile and
it's<00:02:09.130> called<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.640> lens<00:02:10.000> correction<00:02:10.690> which<00:02:10.840> is

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
it's called a lens correction which is

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.720 
it's called a lens correction which is
at<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.560> bottom<00:02:11.739> of<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:14.160> little<00:02:15.160> sidebar<00:02:15.670> on

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
at the bottom of the little sidebar on

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.750 
at the bottom of the little sidebar on
the<00:02:15.970> right<00:02:16.090> hand<00:02:16.540> side<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:18.370> that's<00:02:18.550> really

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
the right hand side and so that's really

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.490 
the right hand side and so that's really
useful<00:02:19.090> if<00:02:19.450> you've<00:02:19.570> got<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> lens<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.290> has<00:02:20.350> a

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
useful if you've got a lens that has a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.970 
useful if you've got a lens that has a
lot<00:02:20.739> of<00:02:20.800> distortion<00:02:22.440> fortunately<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.470> lens<00:02:23.800> I

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
lot of distortion fortunately the lens I

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.090 
lot of distortion fortunately the lens I
used<00:02:24.190> was<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.370> 70<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:25.000> 200<00:02:25.720> which<00:02:26.500> doesn't<00:02:26.950> have

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
used was a 70 to 200 which doesn't have

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.940 
used was a 70 to 200 which doesn't have
a<00:02:27.130> lot<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.430> distortion<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:29.470> now<00:02:29.680> I'm<00:02:29.799> just

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
a lot of distortion and so now I'm just

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.830 
a lot of distortion and so now I'm just
going<00:02:30.070> through<00:02:30.519> some<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.790> my<00:02:30.940> other<00:02:31.209> photos

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
going through some of my other photos

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.380 
going through some of my other photos
and<00:02:32.140> just<00:02:32.980> tweaking<00:02:33.370> them<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.730> little<00:02:34.060> bit

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
and just tweaking them a little bit

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.560 
and just tweaking them a little bit
because<00:02:35.280> since<00:02:36.280> you've<00:02:36.489> applied<00:02:36.760> this<00:02:37.060> preset

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
because since you've applied this preset

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.479 
because since you've applied this preset
all<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:37.959> preset<00:02:38.350> is<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:38.739> just<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.070> bunch<00:02:39.310> of

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
all this preset is is just a bunch of

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.900 
all this preset is is just a bunch of
little<00:02:40.170> bars<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.590> were<00:02:41.709> dragged<00:02:42.130> one<00:02:42.459> way<00:02:42.700> or

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
little bars that were dragged one way or

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.970 
little bars that were dragged one way or
another<00:02:42.940> it's<00:02:43.420> like<00:02:44.160> +<00:02:45.160> 53<00:02:45.760> vibrance<00:02:46.660> minus<00:02:47.440> 29

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
another it's like + 53 vibrance minus 29

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.699 
another it's like + 53 vibrance minus 29
saturation<00:02:48.940> minus<00:02:49.390> 5<00:02:49.630> temperature<00:02:50.290> all<00:02:50.500> these

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
saturation minus 5 temperature all these

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.100 
saturation minus 5 temperature all these
settings<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:51.970> once<00:02:52.209> you've<00:02:52.420> got<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.660> you

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
settings and so once you've got that you

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.789 
settings and so once you've got that you
just<00:02:53.290> go<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.829> file<00:02:54.190> hit<00:02:54.549> export<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:56.620> can

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
just go to file hit export and you can

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.140 
just go to file hit export and you can
go<00:02:56.980> through<00:02:57.010> there's<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.489> whole<00:02:57.730> bunch<00:02:58.000> of

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
go through there's a whole bunch of

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.319 
go through there's a whole bunch of
settings<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.750> can<00:02:58.810> export<00:02:59.350> it<00:02:59.530> to<00:03:00.090> sites<00:03:01.090> like

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
settings you can export it to sites like

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.580 
settings you can export it to sites like
Flickr<00:03:01.720> or<00:03:02.110> Facebook<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.360> then<00:03:04.360> just<00:03:05.320> hit<00:03:05.440> the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
Flickr or Facebook and then just hit the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.509 
Flickr or Facebook and then just hit the

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
export button and let it export and so

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.470 
export button and let it export and so
that's<00:03:09.730> my<00:03:09.910> tutorial<00:03:10.480> thanks<00:03:10.840> for<00:03:11.019> watching
