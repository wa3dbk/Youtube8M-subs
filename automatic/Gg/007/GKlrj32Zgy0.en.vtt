00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
anyone would when trying to connect to a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.280 
anyone would when trying to connect to a
fresh<00:01:19.680> new<00:01:20.009> server<00:01:20.369> now<00:01:21.119> basically<00:01:21.600> I'm

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
fresh new server now basically I'm

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.859 
fresh new server now basically I'm
assuming<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.950> they<00:01:23.070> fix<00:01:23.509> something<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.750> they

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
assuming that they fix something so they

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.350 
assuming that they fix something so they
can't<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.290> d<00:01:25.500> das<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:25.950> easily<00:01:26.130> anymore<00:01:26.610> from

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
can't get d das as easily anymore from

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.840 
can't get d das as easily anymore from
say<00:01:27.659> lizard<00:01:27.930> squad<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.680> if<00:01:29.100> they<00:01:29.280> didn't<00:01:29.700> I

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
say lizard squad and if they didn't I

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.830 
say lizard squad and if they didn't I
would<00:01:30.030> think<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.390> would<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.630> really

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
would think that that would be really

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.499 
would think that that would be really
stupid<00:01:31.200> considering<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.150> know<00:01:33.270> they

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
stupid considering that you know they

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.990 
stupid considering that you know they
had<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.079> server's<00:01:34.409> down<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:34.829> by<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> day<00:01:35.280> but

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
had the server's down for by a day but

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.770 
had the server's down for by a day but
recently<00:01:36.720> which<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.320> uh<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.950> would<00:01:38.220> say<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:39.000> few

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
recently which is uh I would say a few

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.719 
recently which is uh I would say a few
hours<00:01:40.110> ago<00:01:40.259> maybe<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.740> actually<00:01:41.130> don't<00:01:41.520> know

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
hours ago maybe I actually don't know

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.600 
hours ago maybe I actually don't know
but<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:42.750> while<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.770> playstation<00:01:44.310> servers

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
