have to worry about everything wet
you're<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> worry<00:01:49.710> about<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:51.240> getting

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
you're not to worry about it getting

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.270 
you're not to worry about it getting
broken<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.290> don't<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.680> worry<00:01:52.979> about<00:01:53.009> it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
broken you don't have to worry about it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.399 
broken you don't have to worry about it
becoming<00:01:53.610> non-functional<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:55.140> we're<00:01:55.290> going

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
becoming non-functional but we're going

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.209 
becoming non-functional but we're going
to<00:01:55.470> show<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.680> here<00:01:55.860> when<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.070> give<00:01:56.189> a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
closely you want to see how long this

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.310 
closely you want to see how long this
takes<00:02:04.020> now<00:02:04.290> okay<00:02:04.590> as<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.299> see<00:02:06.479> it's

the longer you hold it there the more

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.310 
the longer you hold it there the more
it's<00:02:33.150> going<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.360> burn<00:02:33.600> I'm<00:02:33.870> gonna<00:02:34.020> hold<00:02:34.140> here<00:02:34.260> a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.710 
blowing now you should be able to see
the<00:02:45.540> plane

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.570 

I'm<00:02:51.320> gonna<00:02:51.470> hold<00:02:51.590> just<00:02:51.800> a<00:02:51.920> little<00:02:52.220> longer<00:02:52.490> the

wind is blowing it out or not but
there's<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.720> plane<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:05.780> wallah<00:03:06.560> there's

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
there's the plane and wallah there's

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.970 
there's the plane and wallah there's
your<00:03:07.130> fire

keep it there a little bit longer

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.470 
keep it there a little bit longer
brushing<00:03:11.210> so<00:03:11.360> they<00:03:11.480> can<00:03:11.630> see<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.840> burning<00:03:12.080> like
