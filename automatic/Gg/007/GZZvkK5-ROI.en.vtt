 remasters of why is not so 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.050
 good to have so many remasters but that 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.870
 kind of expensive remastering deserves the 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.980
 Congratulations, because look what I'm going to read 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.950

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.710
 in a pit on the xbox wire that stops 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.290
 sorry for the disastrous launch of 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.570
 mastitis river when all collection 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.520
 the players tried to play online had 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.960
 bigger 30 there they could not fix it 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.750
 the online industry all repeating all the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.630
 players who have played the collection nor 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.180
 played some game of marketing realm 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.590
 collection between its launch was 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.539
 November 11 through 19 12 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.640
 everyone that occurred between this 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:17.680
 period you will not get for free 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:20.050
 nothing free and the 3 odst as a dlc 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.480
 serious face free 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.310
 Let me hit you here, my brother. 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.260
 is to applaud a business of this 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.540
 there the people who did something more or less 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.180
 in this style as the killer dismiss 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.130
 urich nec you will be able to choose one 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.920
 I played there some little thing brought a video 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.010
 Talking about that too, but seriously 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.110
 A company that does this well. 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.959
 The error of a flat-at-home suite is already 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.360
 something is already a bunch that is very worthwhile 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.930
 it's already a package that's worth it 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.920
 you buy because even by the absurd 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.989
 $ 200 a game here are four games 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.350
 incredibly good without giving a 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.090
 fucking extra thing and now everything 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.000
 world that played the realm of marketing 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.510
 collection between its launch and 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.450
 December 19 will receive from 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.300
 Grace plus the kingdom for a lot 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.700
 interesting that they did not announce 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.640
 that people who buy a 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.010
 December 25 type clock on 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.200
 even at Christmas, and she did not say whether those 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.799
 people will be able to play the kingdom 3 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.530
 odst but most likely she will 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.140
 end up coming back as one of them and 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.480
 Then you have to pay the normal game. 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.510
 but so far everyone who played kingdom 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.670
 March has become a fan and will win 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.670
 Grace will be winning, it has to be 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.459
 grace the deal then the serious guy is 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.829
 very good deal these is great to see 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.890
 companies that really care about 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:53.769
 consumers with gamers who support 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.730
 to the developer and such a guy this is 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.920
 very good 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.570
 it was also announced that the reality map 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.630
 The whole day, that's what it's all about. 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.299
 description is a network of kingdom 2 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.670

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.510
 released for free to all 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.470

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.010
 Face I 'm just news, fuck, if you like 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.540
 or if you do not even report it on 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.830
 ended up playing 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.890
 the game you will get revealed 3 odst 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.140
 It was a very good guy anyway. 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.020
 tripartite is making a move to the 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.530
 campaign that I relied on from dst and it will 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.380

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.810
 that will be our fall autumn is already the 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.620
 island in a moment starts fall 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.530
 here in brazil then probably 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.530

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.270
 end of our autumn and it came as a 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.280
 free dlc 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.770
 seriously, there's not much else to talk about 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.800
 just climbing is fucking 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.900
 and my congratulations and serious and does not have much 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.720
 but my opinion is because 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.970
 the news in itself speaks everything is something 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.700
 very nice to see the producers 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.970
