enough in there anyway there's a
mounting<00:03:37.660> bolt<00:03:37.840> way<00:03:38.019> down<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.380> down<00:03:38.530> on<00:03:38.590> the

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
mounting bolt way down and down on the

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.470 
mounting bolt way down and down on the
bottom<00:03:38.829> down<00:03:39.040> there<00:03:39.100> then<00:03:39.910> I<00:03:40.030> think<00:03:40.180> is<00:03:40.299> under

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
bottom down there then I think is under

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.770 
bottom down there then I think is under
will<00:03:40.630> right<00:03:40.840> now<00:03:40.889> and<00:03:42.000> my<00:03:43.000> level<00:03:43.359> is<00:03:43.450> when<00:03:43.690> they

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
will right now and my level is when they

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.420 
will right now and my level is when they
have<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:43.959> when<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:44.590> rolls<00:03:44.739> up<00:03:44.859> halfway<00:03:45.070> up<00:03:45.340> the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
have to when it rolls up halfway up the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.800 
have to when it rolls up halfway up the
plug<00:03:45.639> see<00:03:46.000> it<00:03:46.060> just<00:03:46.239> was<00:03:46.359> like<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.510> bolt<00:03:46.750> right

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
plug see it just was like a bolt right

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.560 
plug see it just was like a bolt right
here<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.200> bolt<00:03:47.739> in<00:03:47.889> 50<00:03:48.639> rolls<00:03:48.760> at<00:03:49.000> halfway<00:03:49.359> it's

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
here a bolt in 50 rolls at halfway it's

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.240 
here a bolt in 50 rolls at halfway it's
at<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.750> right<00:03:49.900> spot<00:03:50.169> right<00:03:50.470> now<00:03:50.950> it<00:03:51.010> gets

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
at the right spot right now it gets

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.590 
at the right spot right now it gets
about<00:03:51.400> on<00:03:51.549> top<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.910> bull<00:03:52.060> good<00:03:52.269> when<00:03:52.419> you<00:03:52.480> see

especially<00:04:43.440> but<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.560> curve<00:04:44.770> foot<00:04:45.010> here

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.279 

this<00:04:50.949> plug<00:04:51.220> bars<00:04:51.460> are<00:04:51.639> in<00:04:51.699> the<00:04:51.789> way<00:04:52.229> there's<00:04:53.229> a

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
this plug bars are in the way there's a

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.770 
this plug bars are in the way there's a
reason<00:04:53.560> why<00:04:53.650> I<00:04:53.680> left<00:04:53.800> us<00:04:53.979> out<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.550> way<00:04:54.780> then

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
reason why I left us out of the way then

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.290 
reason why I left us out of the way then
they'd<00:04:55.930> be<00:04:56.050> on<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:56.379> way<00:04:56.500> over<00:04:56.770> here<00:04:57.180> now<00:04:58.180> I<00:04:58.210> can

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
they'd be on the way over here now I can

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.089 
they'd be on the way over here now I can
take<00:04:58.569> this<00:04:58.720> really<00:04:59.110> really<00:04:59.470> tight<00:04:59.710> so<00:05:00.039> you

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
take this really really tight so you

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.619 
take this really really tight so you
can't<00:05:00.370> get<00:05:00.520> it<00:05:00.610> back<00:05:00.729> harder<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.300> can<00:05:01.449> stop

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:01.629 
can't get it back harder I can stop

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:08.159 
can't get it back harder I can stop
right<00:05:01.840> there

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:14.309 

is<00:05:08.680> that<00:05:08.800> enough<00:05:08.949> to<00:05:09.039> work<00:05:09.159> for<00:05:09.340> you<00:05:09.400> yeah<00:05:13.319> if

is that enough to work for you yeah if

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.779 
is that enough to work for you yeah if
you<00:05:14.470> have<00:05:14.560> an<00:05:14.650> old-style<00:05:14.949> screwdriver<00:05:15.610> lay

you have an old-style screwdriver lay

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.760 
you have an old-style screwdriver lay
the<00:05:15.849> main<00:05:16.030> back<00:05:16.240> in<00:05:16.389> the<00:05:16.449> 20s<00:05:16.870> they<00:05:17.440> actually

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
the main back in the 20s they actually

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.100 
the main back in the 20s they actually
fit<00:05:17.919> in<00:05:18.009> there<00:05:18.129> pretty<00:05:18.250> good<00:05:18.930> cause<00:05:19.930> it's

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
fit in there pretty good cause it's

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.820 
fit in there pretty good cause it's
probably<00:05:20.229> the<00:05:20.469> stuff<00:05:20.680> it<00:05:20.830> made<00:05:20.979> for<00:05:21.389> yeah<00:05:22.830> okay

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
probably the stuff it made for yeah okay
