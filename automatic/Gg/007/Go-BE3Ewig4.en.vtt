hairspray to hold all those curls so I'm

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.319 
hairspray to hold all those curls so I'm
just<00:00:40.980> taking<00:00:41.280> my<00:00:41.309> bun<00:00:41.730> out<00:00:41.760> from<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> night

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329

just taking my bun out from the night
before<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:43.260> make<00:00:43.469> sure<00:00:43.620> your<00:00:43.739> hair<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.100> dry

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
before just make sure your hair is dry

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.850 
before just make sure your hair is dry
second<00:00:45.000> day<00:00:45.090> hair<00:00:45.239> will<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.750> well<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.770> I'm

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
second day hair will do as well so I'm

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.950 
second day hair will do as well so I'm
putting<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.280> some<00:00:47.309> heat<00:00:47.610> protectant

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
putting in some heat protectant

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:58.900 
putting in some heat protectant
throughout<00:00:48.960> my<00:00:49.170> end<00:00:49.379> especially<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:50.280> my<00:00:50.460> hair

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.670 

so<00:00:59.910> I'm<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.239> tie<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.510> my<00:01:00.690> hair<00:01:00.989> leaving<00:01:01.500> a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
so I'm going to tie it my hair leaving a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.889 
so I'm going to tie it my hair leaving a
section<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.820> longest<00:01:03.210> layer<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.510> my<00:01:03.660> hair

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
section of the longest layer of my hair

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.830 
section of the longest layer of my hair
so<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.259> easier<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.589> curl<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.880> I'm<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
so it's easier to curl and I'm going to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.780 
so it's easier to curl and I'm going to
spritz<00:01:10.290> some<00:01:10.619> hairspray<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.759> little

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
spritz some hairspray in just a little

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.609 
spritz some hairspray in just a little
bit<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> curls<00:01:13.049> hold<00:01:13.259> better

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.740 

and<00:01:19.619> then<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.820> wear<00:01:20.940> a<00:01:21.000> glove<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.570> you're

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
and then you can wear a glove if you're

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.279 
and then you can wear a glove if you're
afraid<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.170> might<00:01:22.200> burn<00:01:22.500> yourself<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:24.869> taking

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
afraid you might burn yourself so taking

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.809 
afraid you might burn yourself so taking
the<00:01:25.440> wand<00:01:25.710> I'm<00:01:26.039> going<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.250> point<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.729> downwards

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
the wand I'm going to point it downwards

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.370 
the wand I'm going to point it downwards
and<00:01:29.819> take<00:01:30.149> a<00:01:30.420> piece<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.690> hair<00:01:30.899> right<00:01:31.080> next<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
and take a piece of hair right next to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.330 
and take a piece of hair right next to
my<00:01:31.500> face<00:01:31.800> and<00:01:32.630> wrap<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.840> outwards<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:35.130> wand

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
my face and wrap it outwards on the wand

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.190 
my face and wrap it outwards on the wand
and<00:01:35.640> what<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.909> love<00:01:36.149> about<00:01:36.330> this<00:01:36.509> wand<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.020> that

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and what I love about this wand is that

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.350 
and what I love about this wand is that
it<00:01:37.289> heats<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.679> super<00:01:38.159> fast<00:01:38.190> and<00:01:38.789> the<00:01:39.000> negative

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
it heats up super fast and the negative

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.330 
it heats up super fast and the negative
ions<00:01:39.780> make<00:01:40.050> it<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.319> that<00:01:40.470> way<00:01:40.560> my<00:01:40.590> curls<00:01:41.100> curl

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
ions make it so that way my curls curl

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.880 
ions make it so that way my curls curl
faster<00:01:41.940> so<00:01:42.149> there's<00:01:42.330> less<00:01:42.509> damage<00:01:42.960> done<00:01:43.170> leave

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
faster so there's less damage done leave

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.740 
faster so there's less damage done leave
it<00:01:44.009> there<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.429> a<00:01:44.460> few<00:01:44.490> seconds<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.569> way

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
it there for a few seconds so that way

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.380 
it there for a few seconds so that way
it'll<00:01:46.409> hold<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.190> when<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.700> let<00:01:47.850> go<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.060> should

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
it'll hold and when you let go it should

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.710 
it'll hold and when you let go it should
look<00:01:48.539> like<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:50.149> so<00:01:51.149> I'm<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.360> going<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.569> do

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
look like this so I'm just going to do

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.260 
look like this so I'm just going to do
the<00:01:51.840> rest<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.170> my<00:01:52.350> hair<00:01:52.619> not<00:01:53.429> holding<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.090> too

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the rest of my hair not holding it too

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300 
the rest of my hair not holding it too
long<00:01:54.539> since<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.140> my<00:01:55.289> longest<00:01:55.799> layer<00:01:56.069> of

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
long since this is my longest layer of

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.949 
long since this is my longest layer of
hair<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.789> I<00:01:56.880> would<00:01:57.060> rather<00:01:57.240> keep<00:01:57.569> it<00:01:57.720> long

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
hair and I would rather keep it long

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:10.100 
hair and I would rather keep it long
than<00:01:58.200> making<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.530> super<00:01:58.770> short

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.020 

after<00:02:11.110> I've<00:02:11.230> curled<00:02:11.560> all<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.340> hair<00:02:12.610> in<00:02:12.880> this

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
after I've curled all the hair in this

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.780 
after I've curled all the hair in this
section<00:02:13.270> it'll<00:02:14.140> look<00:02:14.260> like<00:02:14.470> this<00:02:14.740> so<00:02:15.490> I'm

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
section it'll look like this so I'm

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.520 
section it'll look like this so I'm
going<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:15.970> put<00:02:16.240> that<00:02:16.420> on<00:02:16.630> my<00:02:16.660> back<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.290> then

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
going to put that on my back and then

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:27.510 
going to put that on my back and then
take<00:02:18.370> out<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.580> bun<00:02:18.970> on<00:02:19.270> my<00:02:19.480> head<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:26.520> with

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
take out the bun on my head and with

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.520 
take out the bun on my head and with
this<00:02:27.730> I'm<00:02:28.000> going<00:02:28.239> to<00:02:28.360> actually<00:02:28.720> suction<00:02:29.410> it

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
this I'm going to actually suction it

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.650 
this I'm going to actually suction it
off<00:02:29.650> again<00:02:30.130> because<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:30.550> have<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.970> lot<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:31.330> hair

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
off again because I have a lot of hair

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.540 
off again because I have a lot of hair
you<00:02:31.840> can<00:02:31.989> do<00:02:32.140> this<00:02:32.319> if<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.590> want<00:02:32.620> but<00:02:33.400> it's

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
you can do this if you want but it's

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:41.850 
you can do this if you want but it's
optional

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150
