00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.189
 saïfi you're coming so today 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.840
 I have a video for you and that makes 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.179
 really long time I'm not doing a 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.670
 first impression and the view of 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.500
 remarkable so I saw that it was a 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.720
 new mascara wine montmagny so 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.609
 I jumped on djéser it is sure that 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.980
 I see the movie and then just before 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:28.310
 we start the video we mean 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:31.949
 to louis aliot told the oip 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.660
 no no today we took a shower 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.140
 lebesson bailly where he wants for the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.190
 first time a proof that smell good 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.879
 pia amy st it's very long hours m 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.860
 with in the rainwater was like 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:50.250
 ironically kasma we were there like he is 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.010
 so good in his word game bath 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.140
 because when is that video so 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.809
 that these 2 the real track is like a 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.859
 second 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.449
 it's like a second game there 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.250
 in the mess mango in the collection 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.199
 but this manga so it's still in the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.750
 Innu volume collection then this is the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.979
 but this manga rock says it's for 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.040
 intense mecha eyelashes volume Miesch 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.119
 explosive and very beautiful point satisfied 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.890
 a big iridescent 360 and that's it 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.729
 it's new it's in the black hue 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.049
 I decided to take it because 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.700
 you did it you saw it red had not 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.159
 all videos on but according to goal 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.960
 their ibiliz the original then I had it 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.689
 really do not like because missiles 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.640
 as in the beginning everything was fine but 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.579
 but it's their grave and it looks like 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.799
 either the formula was too heavy or the 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.420
 brush accepts past like marc leroux 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.610
 I do not know but my series ended 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.079
 by can fall then I like this camp 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.630
 that it really makes a lot of volume 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.220
 so the reason for anything 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.880
 but intrigued that I wanted to give a 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.860
 second chance 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.170
 this rose labrosse because I like 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.689
 really a lot more brushes if he 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.700
 account that brushes with bristles 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.010
 synthetic finds it brushing 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.140
 synthetic premium like a mother 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.060
 home tracking is what it's them 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.520
 separate better so that's why 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.650
 I wanted to try it in Arias said that 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.810
 the look and it's for lashes from the top 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.160
 and from the bottom to the iridescent volume for a 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.530
 allure rock the brush and 360 bros iridescent 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.630
 saturate the roots of up to 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.050
 volume and he is alone in tip 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.080
 ultra texture formula '' without creating a 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.800
 look interested it was intensely 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.720
 percussive and use it at the sharp end 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.610
 of the applicator while holding the bush 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:46.660
 vertically for all key points 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:48.280
 how to organize my skate is what 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.660
 you have like a hidden camera on the other hand 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.440
 we would sing movie a video that holds 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.380
 still in my video 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.360
 so if it's really written 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.190
 earnings they say to take the brush 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.840
 vertically vertically it's like 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.770
 that they push up that it 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.840
 do like spades 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.760
 so we'll see it really works then 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.890
 the daily packaging marca that it is 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.440
 practically the same the meeting 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.600
 original here it's pink then if it's 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.280
 him the rent leg Saturday just 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.300
 voluminous then six to ten lengths 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.100
 rock it looks funny opare the same 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.220
 but it looks very much like a brush 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.530
 of grandiose dating you know that 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.380
 I really liked 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.380
 except that I did how like focus 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.100
 genius seemingly tempted not to 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.480
 the electric is today the discomfort 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.340
 big so that 's what it looks like 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.620
 rolling but except that there is how 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.739
 filling in point since I like it 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.620
 that the voluminous nice mangolo here there 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.209
 had like a kind of break for 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.680
 may he be like the excellent girl 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.540
 it can not be so flexible 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.160
 that only what me personally 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.410
 I like because I just found 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.660
 that it was too soft that it took 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.000
 first screens so offered a 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.000
 first layer oh my god this is coming 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:18.000
 so that's a good first layer 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.370
 you can see the difference but 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.410
 it's not extraordinary I've seen 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.370
 mascaro more intense than that from the 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.560
 first application 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.560
 we will see with a second layer 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.110
 so that's the second layer we can 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.960
 still see a better difference 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.270
 the but just tell you that I 'm wrong 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.949
 not my brush in the product I do 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.900
 just do a second layer with the 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.419
 product that already the because I find 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.080
 that the texture is really that wet 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.819
 foot really went on to explain it's 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.039
 for this game could apply because 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:10.360
 if you see that already sticks so it 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.360
 do not want to put more products 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.740
 so that's with three layers like 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.450
 you can see you back home three 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.430
 coaches three times that I thought 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:32.230
 So labrosse and jean-charles other eye 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.230
 then I would like with that 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.030
 I'm trying to do what they said 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.949
 to do with the labrousse vertically 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:53.930
 but honestly it's great 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:55.639
 thing that gives no bites so 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.330
 necessary result that it makes priest 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:00.949
 at the layers I find perso also p but 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.870
 personally hot that it's not his share 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.319
 enough this one you and your missiles 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:10.819
 are still a little parcel skin 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:12.830
 extremely not extremely but when 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:14.599
 even I could say for someone who 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.039
 really like to let it's paris it's 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.900
 paris i think you will love this 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:18.919
 but I think it's causing the texture 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.330
 I think more because of the sudden 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.280
 drop the texture is so weird 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.800
 it's like really wet but 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.330
 same time and pepy you'll see the 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.919
 first time you will put a 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.630
 layer the ca apply it so much 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.849
 product you do like oh my god 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.229
 because that's what think as 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.300
 you heard it or if I did not 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.610
 removed from the video the first chat 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.409
 is kind in Morocco because it 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.270
 apply it looks like a lot of bike that 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:43.699
 after all started working 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.669
 with but I do not know I can 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:48.440
 really liked the texture I do not know if 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:50.599
 it's not great but it's not the 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.729
 best mascaro at the jo is beefy but 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:54.590
 for personally for me cabbage 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:58.099
 that according to better than the but this lack 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:00.289
 of originality it's I see I see 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:02.539
 lavaur during the day I see 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:04.370
 test it for the next week and then 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:07.340
 she takes in the show the description 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.009
 place what I finally think if my 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.690
 opinion change but for the moment I 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:14.270
 you would say it's not great I like it 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.620
 uccle original but it's not the mayor 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.990
 mascaro jack stoch 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.580
 so if it's salif sy this spa that you go 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:23.889
 enjoy remember to subscribe to 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.889
 my luck and I see the next demo
