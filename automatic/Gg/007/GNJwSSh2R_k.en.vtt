00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.649
 Hello guys 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.690
 we are here again 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.490
 in the world reading program 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.590
 to work on the humanities and their technologies 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.850
 our meeting today 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 we'll take an approach on the humanist period 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.320
 the humanist period begins in the 15th century 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.350
 and goes until the 18th century 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.800
 despite having its preparation from the 14th century onwards with growth 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200
 renaissance 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.920
 in the 15th century 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.170
 the increase begins to change your mindset 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.270
 influenced by the thought of the bourgeoisie 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.550
 the historical context begins to change 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.939
 giving rise to the period 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.050
 which is historically called 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.190
 the cultural renaissance ' 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.010
 or simply air 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.740
 renaissance 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.090
 to the renaissance that began in the Italian cities 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.049
 Genoa 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.130
 venice florence 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.790
 she does not 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.720
 and Bahrain 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.880
 will then spread throughout Europe 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.159
 initially 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.159
 we say that the renaissance is divided into three parts 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.190
 the whole time 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.720
 or 4 71 5 hit 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.380
 Nine hundred we have the transition 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.299
 between medieval culture 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.060
 and Renaissance culture 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.020
 no 4 santo we got there because when I get a genius because I swim 20 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.370
 and another 5s from the 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.900
 the decline but is a decline in italy 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.490
 because from then on the rebirth will spread 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.049
 to other countries in Europe, especially the low 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.200
 England 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.249
 the France 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:10.199
 hispania efe portugal 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.839
 together with the renaissance in the humanist period we also have a 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:18.239
 change in religious mentality 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.420
 and with the adi 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.049
 from the German states 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.879
 the Lutheran form 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:29.209
 the Lutheran reform began in 1517 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.549
 when today, Luther King 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.419
 launched the 95 theses 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:36.119
 of vitality 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:38.070
 in the city of viterbo sp 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.150
 Luther criticism of papal infallibility indulgences 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.590
 the ceremonies population of pedro 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.709
 and with a series of practices of the Catholic Church kia against the precepts 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.359
 preached by the church itself 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:54.459
 Luther 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.150
 I defended salvation by faith 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.079
 I'm not alone 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.059
 shortly thereafter appears the figure of Calvin 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.500
 the French of tapir that is ingested is open 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.200
 launched the institution of the Christian religion 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:11.900
 creating 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.519
 the magnificent Calvinist movement 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.449
 important detail 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:22.079
 Calvinism has a different name in several parts of Europe 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.350
 in France 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.449
 they are called there were deaths 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.009
 Reelection in Puritan England 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:34.259
 in the Presbyterian exposition much attention in this 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:39.079
 many times vestibular and beyond no time the minister 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:44.360
 comes only a name the defender marquez you must identify 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.589
 French calvi vision or the famous revolution by italy 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:51.979
 what happened in england soon 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:54.079
 English Calvinists are 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.079
 puritans but within England itself 

00:03:57.789 --> 00:04:00.969
 we also had a reformist movement 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:02.630
 led by the king 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.989
 henrique 8th 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.420
 Henry trying to escape the papal influence 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.399
 created a mechanism 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:15.479
 in the year 1500 and 34 Anglicanism 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.219
 was the only one of the three that state religion 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.280
 is the religion that was used to strengthen 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.279
 the power 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:31.429
 important detail the reformist movement it will grow in Europe and 

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:37.569
 will cause the Catholic church to react to the movement 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.999
 and will create counter-reform 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:42.100
 that is 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.160
 the Catholic reaction 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.490
 to the advance of Protestantism 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.490
 the main counter-reform event was 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:53.139
 the convocation of the council 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.360
 decree 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.189
 at the convocation of the council of trent the pope paulo third 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:02.919
 tried to moralize the Catholic church but see well 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.159
 we have doralice important points 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:07.889
 black board 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.889
 the reorganization of the Inquisition 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:14.719
 the acop fiscalization of the company of jesus 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.439
 you must make the historical link is his 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:20.110
 general history 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.530
 history of brazil is newspaper by jesuits 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.020
 they start acting in Brazil 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.389
 and also start acting in the zoned plot 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.580
 then advice from black is decisive for 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.819
 The cut is what I found and conversion of the Indians 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:37.009
 in Brazil 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.159
 ecologically in the colonial amazon ' 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:41.589
 I'm wrong 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:43.409
 together 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:48.079
 to rebirth and reform we have the centralization of power 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.550
 in the hands of the king 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.129
 this centralization 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:56.039
 it was also articulated by the bourgeoisie 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.960
 who was no longer interested beyond 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.199
 allow a large collection of taxes within the fiefs, then the bourgeoisie 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.350
 ally to the king and starts to centralize the power 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.509
 in the hands of the sovereign 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:13.809
 the main European national states were 

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:15.080
 another gal 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.060
 estefÃ¢nia england efe 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.039
 France 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.529
 do not risk being that within absolutism 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:25.379
 we also have mercantilism 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:28.169
 economic policy 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.320
 which will guarantee the state the largest collection of 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.490
 goal that this was the intention of absolutism 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.110
 it grows more and more in the state 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.259
 for wedge aggrandizement 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:45.439
 of the bourgeoisie and the figure of the king 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:47.699
 I hope you have enjoyed 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.370
 I have learned a little more about 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.740
 the humanist period until our next meeting 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:54.699
 bye, thanks
