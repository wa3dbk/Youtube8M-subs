but it's headed much more to the gun
debate<00:02:44.550> that's<00:02:44.940> going<00:02:45.030> on<00:02:45.360> right<00:02:45.420> now<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.170> a

debate that's going on right now and a
lot<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.640> people<00:02:47.850> have<00:02:47.940> asked<00:02:48.150> me<00:02:48.210> what<00:02:48.450> my

lot of people have asked me what my
position<00:02:49.200> on<00:02:49.380> guns<00:02:49.710> exactly<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.640> because<00:02:51.390> you

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
position on guns exactly is because you

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.150 
position on guns exactly is because you
know<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.930> old<00:02:52.080> expression<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.710> commies<00:02:53.130> are

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
know the old expression the commies are

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.130 
know the old expression the commies are
coming<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.580> take<00:02:53.730> our<00:02:53.790> guns<00:02:54.030> away<00:02:54.240> which

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
coming to take our guns away which

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.110 
coming to take our guns away which
doesn't<00:02:56.040> really<00:02:56.130> make<00:02:56.400> much<00:02:56.460> sense<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.030> in

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
doesn't really make much sense and in

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.090 
doesn't really make much sense and in
fact<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.450> lot<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.900> claims<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.530> communists

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
fact a lot of the claims that communists

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.530 
fact a lot of the claims that communists

fraudulent<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.350> make<00:03:02.070> no<00:03:02.220> sense<00:03:02.520> but<00:03:03.060> that's

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
fraudulent and make no sense but that's

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.150 
fraudulent and make no sense but that's
another<00:03:03.930> video<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:04.650> actually<00:03:04.830> already

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
another video that I actually already

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
did my position is I take the radical

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.420 
did my position is I take the radical
one<00:03:11.640> that's<00:03:11.850> not<00:03:12.030> conservative<00:03:12.810> or<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.830> it's

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
one that's not conservative or that it's

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.760 
one that's not conservative or that it's
liberal<00:03:14.850> it's<00:03:15.300> either<00:03:15.630> one<00:03:15.930> although<00:03:16.320> I<00:03:16.560> would

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
liberal it's either one although I would

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.060 
liberal it's either one although I would
say<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.220> respect<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:17.850> conservative<00:03:18.330> one

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
say that I respect the conservative one

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.770 
say that I respect the conservative one
far<00:03:20.070> more<00:03:20.100> than<00:03:20.460> I<00:03:20.760> would<00:03:21.060> ever<00:03:21.090> respect<00:03:21.690> a

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
far more than I would ever respect a

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.660 
far more than I would ever respect a
liberal<00:03:22.050> one<00:03:22.200> because<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.040> liberal<00:03:23.310> position

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
liberal one because the liberal position

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.470 
liberal one because the liberal position
on<00:03:23.760> gun<00:03:23.910> control<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.480> basically<00:03:25.790> one<00:03:26.790> gigantic

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
on gun control is basically one gigantic

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.830 
on gun control is basically one gigantic
non<00:03:27.900> sequitur<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:29.130> just<00:03:29.580> it<00:03:29.850> just<00:03:29.910> doesn't

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
make sense I mean there are there are

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.030 
make sense I mean there are there are
there<00:03:36.720> statistics<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.380> prove<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.620> taking

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
there statistics to prove that taking

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.380 
there statistics to prove that taking
people's<00:03:38.310> guns<00:03:38.490> away<00:03:38.640> does<00:03:38.940> not<00:03:39.090> actually

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
people's guns away does not actually

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.470 
people's guns away does not actually
lower<00:03:40.050> crime<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.680> there's<00:03:41.490> statistics

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
lower crime and there's statistics

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.830 
lower crime and there's statistics
supporting<00:03:42.960> otherwise<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.950> stuff<00:03:44.670> like<00:03:44.760> that

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
supporting otherwise and stuff like that

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.120 
supporting otherwise and stuff like that
the<00:03:45.840> fact<00:03:46.080> is<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.380> majority<00:03:46.740> of<00:03:46.770> crimes<00:03:46.920> are

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
the fact is the majority of crimes are

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.280 
the fact is the majority of crimes are
committed<00:03:47.250> with<00:03:47.460> the<00:03:47.580> illegal<00:03:48.120> guns<00:03:48.290> so

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
committed with the illegal guns so

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.840 
committed with the illegal guns so
taking<00:03:49.800> legal<00:03:50.010> ones<00:03:50.310> off<00:03:50.460> the<00:03:50.580> street<00:03:50.760> would

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
taking legal ones off the street would

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.270 
taking legal ones off the street would
actually<00:03:51.290> would<00:03:52.290> not<00:03:52.470> help<00:03:52.800> it<00:03:53.010> would<00:03:53.130> not

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
actually would not help it would not

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.880 
actually would not help it would not
actually<00:03:53.550> reduce<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.120> risk<00:03:54.380> here<00:03:55.380> in<00:03:55.470> canada

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
actually reduce that risk here in canada

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.150 
actually reduce that risk here in canada
we<00:03:55.920> do<00:03:56.400> have<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:56.970> particularly<00:03:57.630> low<00:03:58.020> gun<00:03:58.740> crime

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
we do have a particularly low gun crime

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.960 
we do have a particularly low gun crime
rate<00:03:59.720> however<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:01.140> vast<00:04:01.380> majority

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.650 
overwhelming majority of the guns that
are<00:04:04.290> actually<00:04:04.590> used<00:04:05.340> in<00:04:05.490> crimes<00:04:05.850> are<00:04:06.210> actually

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
are actually used in crimes are actually

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.140 
are actually used in crimes are actually
illegal<00:04:07.050> guns<00:04:07.350> which<00:04:07.950> shows<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.400> actual<00:04:08.940> gun

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
illegal guns which shows that actual gun

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.990 
illegal guns which shows that actual gun
control<00:04:09.630> doesn't<00:04:10.410> stop<00:04:10.980> them<00:04:11.460> from<00:04:11.490> actually

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
control doesn't stop them from actually

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.870 
control doesn't stop them from actually
doing<00:04:12.240> it<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.810> mean<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:14.220> guns<00:04:14.430> are<00:04:14.550> still<00:04:14.760> going

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
doing it I mean the guns are still going

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.610 
doing it I mean the guns are still going
to<00:04:14.940> get<00:04:15.030> out<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.300> criminals<00:04:15.690> and<00:04:15.840> that's<00:04:16.410> just

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
to get out to criminals and that's just

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.560 
to get out to criminals and that's just
a<00:04:16.680> basic<00:04:16.950> fact<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.520> actually<00:04:17.970> capitalism

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
a basic fact of actually capitalism

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.070 
a basic fact of actually capitalism
itself<00:04:18.630> there<00:04:19.410> is<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.620> market<00:04:20.100> for<00:04:20.370> guns<00:04:20.640> and

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
itself there is a market for guns and

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.810 
itself there is a market for guns and
that<00:04:22.080> market<00:04:22.530> will<00:04:22.680> probably<00:04:23.280> always<00:04:23.490> be

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
that market will probably always be

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.930 
that market will probably always be
there<00:04:24.300> if<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:25.350> mainstream<00:04:25.590> economy

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
there if the mainstream economy

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.360 
there if the mainstream economy
is<00:04:27.030> not<00:04:27.360> fulfilling<00:04:28.020> that<00:04:28.530> want<00:04:29.070> that's

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
is not fulfilling that want that's

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.670 
is not fulfilling that want that's
coming<00:04:29.850> from<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.480> economic<00:04:31.080> actors<00:04:31.470> that<00:04:31.620> are

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
coming from the economic actors that are

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.920 
coming from the economic actors that are
the<00:04:31.920> regular<00:04:32.220> people<00:04:32.520> then<00:04:33.000> obviously<00:04:33.240> some

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
the regular people then obviously some

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.020 
the regular people then obviously some
force<00:04:34.320> some<00:04:36.620> unofficial<00:04:37.620> I<00:04:38.400> call<00:04:38.850> an

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
force some unofficial I call an

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.790 
force some unofficial I call an
unofficial<00:04:39.510> capless<00:04:39.990> is<00:04:40.140> not<00:04:40.260> necessarily

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
unofficial capless is not necessarily

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.380 
unofficial capless is not necessarily
condoned<00:04:41.220> by<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.430> state<00:04:41.730> but<00:04:42.030> it<00:04:42.210> obviously

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
condoned by the state but it obviously

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.140 
condoned by the state but it obviously
is<00:04:42.960> capitalism<00:04:43.500> that<00:04:44.040> is<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.460> illegal<00:04:44.850> arms

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
is capitalism that is the illegal arms

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.800 
is capitalism that is the illegal arms
trade<00:04:45.420> so<00:04:46.520> but<00:04:47.520> obviously<00:04:48.240> banning<00:04:48.600> them<00:04:48.660> it

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
trade so but obviously banning them it

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.050 
trade so but obviously banning them it
doesn't<00:04:48.990> really<00:04:49.350> just<00:04:49.680> it<00:04:50.070> just<00:04:50.460> it<00:04:50.670> doesn't

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
doesn't really just it just it doesn't

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.530 
doesn't really just it just it doesn't
work<00:04:51.300> banning<00:04:52.140> guns<00:04:52.290> is<00:04:52.590> just<00:04:52.800> like<00:04:53.240> it<00:04:54.240> takes

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
work banning guns is just like it takes

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.210 
work banning guns is just like it takes
only<00:04:54.720> two<00:04:54.870> guns<00:04:55.140> out<00:04:55.350> of<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.440> hands<00:04:55.680> of<00:04:55.860> legal

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
only two guns out of the hands of legal

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.440 
only two guns out of the hands of legal
gun<00:04:56.400> owners<00:04:56.700> so<00:04:57.180> it's<00:04:57.330> completely

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
gun owners so it's completely

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
ineffective that far it's so far just to

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.310 
ineffective that far it's so far just to
make<00:05:01.470> it<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:01.890> cut<00:05:02.220> it<00:05:02.310> down<00:05:02.340> make<00:05:02.580> short<00:05:02.850> I
