village<00:00:18.660> now<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.350> whole<00:00:19.650> idea<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.310> map

village now the whole idea of this map
was<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.390> actually<00:00:21.539> create<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.260> sort<00:00:22.769> of

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
was to actually create a sort of

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.590 
was to actually create a sort of
realistic<00:00:23.250> sort<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.789> area<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.300> could<00:00:24.480> be

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
realistic sort of area that could be

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.960 
realistic sort of area that could be
used<00:00:24.840> as<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> roll<00:00:25.920> place<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> whole<00:00:26.550> Island

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
used as like a roll place a whole Island

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.580 
used as like a roll place a whole Island
where<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.240> could<00:00:27.390> set<00:00:27.539> up<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.689> big<00:00:27.900> server<00:00:28.230> and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
where you could set up a big server and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.320 
where you could set up a big server and
have<00:00:28.890> multiple<00:00:29.490> different<00:00:29.640> tests<00:00:30.240> at

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
have multiple different tests at

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.580 
have multiple different tests at
different<00:00:30.359> things<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.990> jobs<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.439> different

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
will be like the perfect sort of

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.340 
will be like the perfect sort of
roleplay<00:01:12.180> scenario<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.780> will<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> main

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
roleplay scenario this will be the main

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.840 
roleplay scenario this will be the main
sort<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.619> trade<00:01:13.920> hub<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.369> well<00:01:14.430> as<00:01:14.700> where

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
sort of trade hub as well as where

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.330 
sort of trade hub as well as where
people<00:01:15.240> spawn<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.320> start<00:01:16.619> out<00:01:16.890> I've

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
people spawn and it's to start out I've

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.620 
people spawn and it's to start out I've
started<00:01:17.640> adding<00:01:17.909> some<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> buildings<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
started adding some of the buildings and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.789 
started adding some of the buildings and
the<00:01:18.720> first<00:01:18.900> building<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.380> course<00:01:19.590> we're<00:01:19.680> going

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the first building of course we're going

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.160 
the first building of course we're going
to<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> look<00:01:20.130> at<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.570> bar<00:01:21.810> this

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to have a look at is the in the bar this

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.359 
to have a look at is the in the bar this
is<00:01:22.320> probably<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> most<00:01:22.860> important

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
is probably one of the most important

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.859 
is probably one of the most important
buildings<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.939> can't<00:01:24.180> really<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.600> any

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
buildings if you can't really have any

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.899 
buildings if you can't really have any
sort<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.170> village<00:01:25.409> without<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.710> bar<00:01:26.009> area<00:01:26.490> so

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
sort of village without a bar area so

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.190 
sort of village without a bar area so
I've<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.030> added<00:01:27.210> some<00:01:27.479> lights<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:28.049> to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
I've just added some lights in here to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.990 
I've just added some lights in here to

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
that happens this area is going to be a

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.950 
that happens this area is going to be a
little<00:04:59.219> bit<00:04:59.430> bland<00:04:59.759> and<00:05:00.060> I<00:05:00.270> am<00:05:00.389> the<00:05:00.539> leadership

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
little bit bland and I am the leadership

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.059 
little bit bland and I am the leadership
on<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.169> workshop<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:01.830> I'm<00:05:01.919> going<00:05:02.039> to

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:02.069 
on the workshop and I'm going to

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.230 
on the workshop and I'm going to
continue<00:05:02.250> adding<00:05:02.699> to<00:05:02.969> it

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
continue adding to it

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.879 
continue adding to it
we've<00:05:03.389> got<00:05:03.539> castles<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.110> build<00:05:04.319> over<00:05:04.529> there<00:05:04.710> I

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
we've got castles to build over there I

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:05.689 
we've got castles to build over there I
think<00:05:05.009> we're<00:05:05.250> going<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.400> go<00:05:05.520> with<00:05:05.669> two

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
think we're going to go with two

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.119 
think we're going to go with two
factions<00:05:06.330> on<00:05:06.539> this<00:05:06.659> roleplay<00:05:07.080> sort<00:05:07.319> of<00:05:07.409> map<00:05:07.620> so

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.129 
factions on this roleplay sort of map so

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:09.529 
factions on this roleplay sort of map so
we'll<00:05:08.250> have<00:05:08.310> two<00:05:08.550> castles<00:05:08.759> are<00:05:09.029> either<00:05:09.180> side

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
we'll have two castles are either side

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.149 
we'll have two castles are either side
of<00:05:09.779> the<00:05:10.080> village<00:05:10.289> one<00:05:10.680> over<00:05:10.889> there<00:05:10.979> in<00:05:11.099> the

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
of the village one over there in the

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:12.529 
of the village one over there in the
distance<00:05:11.460> and<00:05:11.699> I<00:05:11.759> think<00:05:11.909> we've<00:05:12.000> got<00:05:12.120> a<00:05:12.150> second

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
distance and I think we've got a second

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.260 
distance and I think we've got a second
village<00:05:12.750> to<00:05:13.289> add<00:05:13.439> around<00:05:14.039> this<00:05:14.669> sort<00:05:15.000> peak

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
village to add around this sort peak

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.820 
village to add around this sort peak
area<00:05:15.779> here<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.139> probably<00:05:16.409> on<00:05:16.469> the<00:05:16.560> other<00:05:16.620> side

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
area here and probably on the other side

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.559 
area here and probably on the other side
of<00:05:16.949> that<00:05:17.039> forest<00:05:17.400> so<00:05:17.819> it<00:05:17.909> makes<00:05:18.090> travelling

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
of that forest so it makes travelling

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:20.089 
of that forest so it makes travelling
between<00:05:18.689> them<00:05:19.050> a<00:05:19.110> little<00:05:19.349> bit<00:05:19.469> more<00:05:19.500> dangerous

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
between them a little bit more dangerous

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:21.890 
between them a little bit more dangerous
and<00:05:20.310> exciting<00:05:20.610> anyway<00:05:21.449> I'd<00:05:21.569> like<00:05:21.659> to<00:05:21.779> thank

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
and exciting anyway I'd like to thank

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.319 
and exciting anyway I'd like to thank
