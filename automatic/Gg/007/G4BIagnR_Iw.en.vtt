biggest<00:00:08.520> difference<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.360> think<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.900> I

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
biggest difference and I think and I

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.169 
biggest difference and I think and I
have<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> vast<00:00:10.620> array<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.250> products<00:00:11.820> and

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
have a vast array of products and

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:14.339 
brushes and all of that thing

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.140 
brushes and all of that thing
particularly<00:00:14.730> brushes<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:16.609> quite<00:00:17.609> simply

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
particularly brushes and quite simply

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.450 
particularly brushes and quite simply
since<00:00:18.689> I<00:00:18.840> have<00:00:19.050> these<00:00:19.260> about<00:00:19.590> three<00:00:19.650> years<00:00:20.310> ago

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
since I have these about three years ago

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.300 
since I have these about three years ago
they've<00:00:21.330> become<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:22.140> best<00:00:22.410> investment<00:00:23.160> I

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310

met you tours on how to make them

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.599 
met you tours on how to make them
yourself<00:00:27.470> which<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.619> absolutely<00:00:29.130> possible

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
yourself which is absolutely possible

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.700

they're<00:00:29.760> not<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.150> most<00:00:30.359> expensive<00:00:31.019> things<00:00:31.529> in

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
they're not the most expensive things in

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.890 
they're not the most expensive things in
the<00:00:31.800> world<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> reason<00:00:32.970> I<00:00:33.060> like<00:00:33.300> them<00:00:33.600> and

Mac two one seven look if you can see
how<00:01:00.590> it<00:01:01.590> looks<00:01:01.770> brand-new

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
how it looks brand-new

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.180 
how it looks brand-new
it<00:01:02.610> looks<00:01:02.910> tapered<00:01:03.630> still<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.379> not<00:01:04.739> flared

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
it looks tapered still it's not flared

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.390 
it looks tapered still it's not flared
out<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.930> look<00:01:06.930> after<00:01:07.140> all<00:01:07.380> my<00:01:07.650> brushes<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.190> wash

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
out I look after all my brushes I wash

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.360 
out I look after all my brushes I wash
them<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.300> time<00:01:09.510> i<00:01:09.780> disinfect<00:01:10.410> them<00:01:10.710> all

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
them all the time i disinfect them all

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.730 
them all the time i disinfect them all
of<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> reason<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:12.750> still<00:01:13.110> retain

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
of that but the reason they still retain

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.770 
of that but the reason they still retain
that<00:01:14.040> shape<00:01:14.430> because<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.940> brushes<00:01:15.180> they

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
that shape because the brushes they

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.950 
that shape because the brushes they
splay<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:16.650> time<00:01:17.130> goes<00:01:17.370> on<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.820> because<00:01:18.690> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
splay as time goes on is because of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.340 
splay as time goes on is because of
brush<00:01:19.560> guards<00:01:20.010> these<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.240> wash<00:01:21.660> my<00:01:21.900> brushes<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
brush guards these I wash my brushes and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.320 
brush guards these I wash my brushes and
then<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.920> place<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.550> brush<00:01:24.180> guard<00:01:26.090> over<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
then I place a brush guard over the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.260 
then I place a brush guard over the
brush<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.050> it<00:01:28.950> holds<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.580> in<00:01:29.760> this<00:01:29.909> tight

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
brush and it holds it in this tight

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.420 
brush and it holds it in this tight
position<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:31.380> when<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.680> take<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:31.950> off<00:01:32.190> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
position that when you take it off it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.090 
position that when you take it off it
retains<00:01:33.210> its<00:01:33.480> shape<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.470> retains<00:01:34.860> its

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
retains its shape and it retains its

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.310 
retains its shape and it retains its
shape<00:01:35.270> continuously<00:01:36.270> they<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.900> larger

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
shape continuously they have larger

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.350 
shape continuously they have larger
sizes<00:01:37.560> smaller<00:01:38.190> sizes<00:01:38.550> for<00:01:38.909> blusher

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
sizes smaller sizes for blusher

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.560 
sizes smaller sizes for blusher
eyeshadow<00:01:40.290> eyeliner<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.340> hands-down<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
eyeshadow eyeliner it is hands-down the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.590 
eyeshadow eyeliner it is hands-down the
best<00:01:42.870> investment<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.680> ever<00:01:44.010> made<00:01:44.159> because<00:01:45.090> all

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
best investment I ever made because all

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.680 
best investment I ever made because all
my<00:01:45.900> brushes<00:01:46.170> are<00:01:46.590> tapered<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.450> exactly<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
my brushes are tapered and exactly the

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.930 
my brushes are tapered and exactly the
same<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.290> right<00:01:49.800> size<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.130> they<00:01:50.460> should<00:01:50.729> be

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
same and right size that they should be

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.790 
same and right size that they should be
when<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.450> first<00:01:51.570> got<00:01:52.080> them<00:01:52.260> because<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.590> use

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
when I first got them because we use

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.140 
when I first got them because we use
them<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.159> then<00:01:53.250> they<00:01:53.400> start<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.790> splay<00:01:54.120> out

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
them and then they start to splay out

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.410 
them and then they start to splay out
and<00:01:54.510> become<00:01:54.720> bigger<00:01:54.990> brushes<00:01:55.350> well<00:01:56.280> for<00:01:57.240> me

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and become bigger brushes well for me

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.300 
and become bigger brushes well for me
they<00:01:57.720> are<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:57.930> best<00:01:58.320> brushes<00:01:58.650> that<00:01:59.010> I've<00:01:59.100> ever

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
they are the best brushes that I've ever

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.289 
they are the best brushes that I've ever
used<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.760> think<00:01:59.790> they<00:02:00.090> are<00:02:00.150> absolutely

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
used I think they are absolutely

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.789 
used I think they are absolutely
fantastic<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.740> that's<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.520> reason<00:02:02.880> why<00:02:03.240> um

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
fantastic and that's the reason why um
