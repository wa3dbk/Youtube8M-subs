00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello welcome to a new video 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.470
 technophile in this case let's make a 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.290
 comparison on the sets six rt and 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.000
 microsoft surface pro on the left 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.189
 you have the artist rt and to the right 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.110
 we have the arts pro both tablets 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.360
 have been transferred by Microsoft to 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.340
 technophile so that we will analyze them in 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.080
 our website and how you can see the aspect 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.810
 outside that both tablets have is 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.590
 really very much like both the width 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.269
 as the length of both tablets are 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.160
 exactly the same and the only thing that 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:37.800
 change is the thickness that in the case of the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.780
 salt face pro is quite thicker than 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.850
 the arts' rt why then because it's 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.270
 artist pro is a tablet that is based 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.309
 in a processor with rm architecture or 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.399
 be a processor like the one they carry 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.190
 Android tablets for example maybe that 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.870
 are thus prepared to be mobile and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.390
 consume little energy while in the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.710
 sar face case but the components 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.840
 carrying components are within 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.160
 typical that we find in a PC or in a 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.160
 portable not a processor 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.979
 and this makes the tablet have to be 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.100
 rather thicker to be able to accommodate 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.840
 these components and also also the 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.420
 fans and ducts 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.579
 ventilation so it does not get hot 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.829
 too good but let's go now we 're going to 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.920
 unlock both tablets and we can see 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.899
 here the windows 8 start screen 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.030
 really both screens are 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.399
 practically identical in the case of 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.259
 those face rt to the left good then 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.179
 we are running windows rt and in the 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.750
 Sunfish case but right we are 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:42.740
 running windows 8 pure but as 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:46.159
 you can see the tile interface that 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.189
 brought windows 8 is exactly the same in 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.570
 windows 7 that in windows 8 if we 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.880
 we move on both tablets we move 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.950
 really very quickly and with 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.049
 a lot of softness there is practically no 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.689
 there is no difference between being 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.220
 using one or the other and the only if 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.229
 you have read the analysis that we did the 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.820
 technophile of the harpies rte one of the 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.619
 things we saw is that they took a 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.690
 little in opening applications about 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.400
 all the first time we're going to check 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.650
 what is the difference between time 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.660
 it takes to open an application in 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.640
 Being fischer dt and in the sar face pro 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.709
 let's take an application any 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.720
 for example that of time and we are going to 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.720
 open it on both tablets at once 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.980
 as you can see in salt freeze but it has 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.350
 practically open 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.930
 instantaneous while the alps rt 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.450
 it's still loading now it's been 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.680
 charged for a lot more time in the 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.390
 case of the hard face of zarzis pro 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.970
 now well if we go back to the menu 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.580
 and we try to open it again now 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.760
 same as you will be able to appreciate the 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.290
 differences are nil because in the san 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.480
 luis rc it is true that the first time 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.400
 it takes a long time to open each application 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.590
 but then those applications that are 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.140
 in memory and they open practically from 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.490
 instantaneously let's go to another 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.330
 application that we had in memory 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.710
 For example, the travel application 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.900
 who is here 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:17.480
 in action travel 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.480
 let's click on both at the same time 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.410
 in the case of salt fish but it has 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.570
 practically open 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.660
 instantaneous in the case of fisher's salt 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.890
 have a few more seconds 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.270
 so then it really shows in 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.250
 the sar fish but has a lot more 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.560
 power that is the tea freezer and for 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.990
 that the applications run a lot 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.720
 faster otherwise in both 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.180
 we found the traditional desk of 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.890
 windows as you can see in the case of 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.570
 sar fisher dt you already know that it is not worth 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.110
 practically for nothing more than to 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.670
 execute office internet explorer and 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.670
 to be able to access the administrator 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.990
 files in the case of using face but 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.330
 However, what we have is a 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.860
 traditional windows desk where 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.390
 we can run applications in 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.220
 windows and anything of the same 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.010
 way we wanted on a computer 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.690
 traditional as a curiosity on the tablet 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.990
 surface for what he has given us to 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.690
 microsoft has loaded windows 8.1 pro 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.190
 preview version with what then 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.769
 there are really some things that are a 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.140
 little different from what comes in 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.639
 windows 8 when one buys the sar fish 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.200
 pro directly 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.990
 in a store or on the microsoft website 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.540
 I've said this really there's no no 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.750
 many differences between both tablets to 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.850
 aesthetic level as I have commented the 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.070
 differences are inside and in the 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.660
 inside when executing the 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.130
 applications that in the case of sar fish 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.070
 pro then you can run any 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.720
 application that is in the windows store 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.060
 or hockey directly we download from 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.190
 internet or that we install then 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.840
 from a usb key for example while 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.150
 that the surface rt have to be 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.460
 applications that come all of them 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.920
 from the shop store windows have 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.580
 to windows we can open it also in 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.580
 both cases 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.860
 they are very similar in the case of those 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:08.620
 tea parties because they take longer 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.490
 but as you can see the appearance is 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.289
 very similar although really the games 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.479
 that we have in a good other or the 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.810
 applications are are quite 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.669
 Different both tablets are compatible 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.070
 with these keyboards the one on the left is 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.639
 the 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.620
 h 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.409
 cover and the one on the right is the type 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.930
 cover in which the keys as you can 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:34.629
 see is in relief are physical keys 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.849
 while in the case of the touch 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:38.740
 cover by the keys because they are a 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.560
 membrane that simply by touching it 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.840
 it is already pressed and otherwise 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:49.600
 good as I said before in the case 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:52.390
 of the sar face pro is much thicker 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.210
 we can see them 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:58.270
 yes for the return 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.850
 I do not know how it will look in the camera but 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.200
 really one of them is much more 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.760
 thick than other 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.180
 very well, this is what I wanted 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.770
 comment and thank you very much for seeing us if 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.430
 you want more information about anyone 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.430
 of the two tablets you have it in 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.430
