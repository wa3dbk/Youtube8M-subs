now if you if you're using a boat in the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.550 
now if you if you're using a boat in the
lake<00:00:23.760> or<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> river<00:00:24.199> you're<00:00:25.199> going<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.380> get<00:00:25.529> a

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
lake or a river you're going to get a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.400 
lake or a river you're going to get a
lot<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.859> algae<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.310> stuff<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.789> there<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:28.050> it's

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
lot of algae and stuff on there and it's

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.750 
lot of algae and stuff on there and it's
going<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.560> be<00:00:28.650> hard<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.920> get<00:00:29.010> off<00:00:29.070> even<00:00:29.580> if<00:00:29.670> you

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
going to be hard to get off even if you

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.110 
going to be hard to get off even if you
clean<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.800> you<00:00:31.800> should<00:00:32.250> always<00:00:32.399> try<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.820> clean

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
clean it you should always try to clean

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.750 
clean it you should always try to clean
it<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.390> same<00:00:33.660> day<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.770> return<00:00:35.100> if<00:00:35.309> not<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
it the same day you return if not the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.310 
it the same day you return if not the
day<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.239> after<00:00:36.450> because<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> longer<00:00:37.170> it

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
day or so after because the longer it

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.040 
day or so after because the longer it
sits<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.000> order<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.180> stuff<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.750> get<00:00:39.870> off

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
sits the order that stuff is to get off

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.250 
sits the order that stuff is to get off
now<00:00:40.550> there's<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.610> lot<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.940> techniques<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:43.079> you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
now there's a lot of techniques and you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260 
now there's a lot of techniques and you
know<00:00:43.379> most<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.710> time<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> boat<00:00:44.219> hole<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.969> white

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
know most of time a boat hole is white

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.750 
know most of time a boat hole is white
so<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.660> really<00:00:45.809> going<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.020> show<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.760> that

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
so it's really going to show that that

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.029 
so it's really going to show that that
algae<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.239> whatnot<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:49.500> thing<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.890> can

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
algae and whatnot but one thing you can

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.340 
algae and whatnot but one thing you can
do<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.510> stay<00:00:51.719> away<00:00:51.840> from<00:00:51.989> harsh

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
do and I like to stay away from harsh

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.040 
do and I like to stay away from harsh
chemicals<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.010> know<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.520> get<00:00:53.699> up<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.870> can

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
chemicals I know you can get up you can

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.760 
chemicals I know you can get up you can
get<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.969> forget<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.590> chemicals<00:00:58.590> in

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
get this and I forget the chemicals in

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.639 
get this and I forget the chemicals in
it<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.160> very<00:01:00.199> potentially<00:01:01.199> dangerous

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
it but it's very potentially dangerous

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.470 
it but it's very potentially dangerous
it's<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.340> good<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> environment<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.390> I

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
it's not good for the environment so I

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.940 
it's not good for the environment so I
stay<00:01:03.719> away<00:01:03.899> from<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.549> but<00:01:06.500> what<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.530> did<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> used

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
stay away from it but what I did I used

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.550 
stay away from it but what I did I used
Ryerson's<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.600> dry<00:01:09.810> clothes<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.409> put

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
Ryerson's if you dry clothes you put

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.500 
Ryerson's if you dry clothes you put
those<00:01:10.680> dryer<00:01:10.950> sheets<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.430> there<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:12.390> can

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
those dryer sheets in there you can

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.899 
those dryer sheets in there you can
actually<00:01:12.720> reuse<00:01:13.170> those<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.130> rub<00:01:14.700> them

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
actually reuse those and rub them

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.999 
actually reuse those and rub them
against<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.390> boat<00:01:15.659> hole<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.350> it'll<00:01:16.830> take

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
against your boat hole and it'll take

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.469 
against your boat hole and it'll take
that<00:01:17.189> algae<00:01:17.520> off<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.850> know<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.030> sounds<00:01:18.270> silly

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
that algae off and know it sounds silly

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.960 
that algae off and know it sounds silly
but<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.840> works<00:01:19.189> another<00:01:20.189> thing<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.790> do

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
but it works another thing you can do

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.910 
but it works another thing you can do
and<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.270> works<00:01:21.509> really<00:01:21.630> well<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.290> by<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
and this works really well and by the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.469 
and this works really well and by the
way<00:01:23.130> I'm<00:01:23.250> posting<00:01:23.640> links<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.119> these<00:01:24.270> items
