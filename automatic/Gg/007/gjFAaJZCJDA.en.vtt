2013<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> real<00:01:16.020> deal<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.470> real<00:01:16.500> deal

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
2013 this is the real deal the real deal

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.210 
2013 this is the real deal the real deal
and<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> front<00:01:18.960> two-thirds<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:19.920> is

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and so the front two-thirds of that is

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.399 
and so the front two-thirds of that is
an<00:01:20.369> optic<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> telescope<00:01:21.810> that

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
an optic so it's the telescope that

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.810 
an optic so it's the telescope that
looks<00:01:22.619> down<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.070> ground<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.700> actually

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
looks down at the ground so it actually

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.780 
looks down at the ground so it actually
flies<00:01:24.360> with<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.110> point<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.520> going

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
flies with that point so it's it's going

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.230 
flies with that point so it's it's going
