run<00:00:50.789> them<00:00:50.910> full<00:00:51.090> screen<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:52.800> surface<00:00:53.520> pro<00:00:53.699> is

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
run them full screen so surface pro is

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.369 
run them full screen so surface pro is
coming<00:00:54.120> yeah<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.660> lot<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.870> people<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:55.199> going<00:00:55.289> to

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
coming yeah a lot of people are going to

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.869 
coming yeah a lot of people are going to
buy<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:56.219> not<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> lot<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
buy it it's not going to have a lot of

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.119 
buy it it's not going to have a lot of
apps<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.020> idea<00:00:58.109> here<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.649> BlueStacks

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
apps so the idea here is that BlueStacks

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.819 
apps so the idea here is that BlueStacks
allows<00:00:59.520> you<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.449> get<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.719> know<00:01:00.829> 750,000
