were<00:00:15.450> taught<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:15.780> school<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:17.190> seasons

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
were taught in school that the seasons

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.609 
were taught in school that the seasons
are<00:00:18.150> caused<00:00:18.449> by<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.619> earth<00:00:20.359> on<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.750> a

are caused by the earth on it on a
tilted<00:00:23.220> axis<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:25.279> part<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> year<00:00:26.640> were

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
tilted axis and part of the year were

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.279 
tilted axis and part of the year were
closer<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.420> Sun<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.750> part<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> year

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
closer to the Sun and part of the year

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.679 
closer to the Sun and part of the year
or<00:00:28.410> farther<00:00:28.619> away<00:00:28.769> from<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.010> Sun<00:00:29.179> well<00:00:30.179> yeah

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
or farther away from the Sun well yeah

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.500 
or farther away from the Sun well yeah
but<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.560> scanned<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.520> picture<00:00:32.910> from<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.210> book

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
but I scanned this picture from a book

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.799 
but I scanned this picture from a book
to<00:00:33.690> show<00:00:34.579> how<00:00:35.660> geocentric<00:00:36.660> seasons<00:00:37.559> are<00:00:38.809> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
to show how geocentric seasons are the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.990 
to show how geocentric seasons are the
Sun<00:00:40.020> moves<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.670> helix<00:00:41.670> shape<00:00:42.379> so<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:44.000> moves

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
Sun moves in a helix shape so it moves

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.090 
Sun moves in a helix shape so it moves
up<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.600> down<00:00:45.690> throughout<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.500> year<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.010> it

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
up and down throughout the year and it

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.790 
up and down throughout the year and it
gets<00:00:47.219> closer<00:00:47.640> or<00:00:48.000> farther<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.570> earth<00:00:48.870> and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
gets closer or farther to the earth and

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.310 
gets closer or farther to the earth and
that's<00:00:50.010> what<00:00:50.160> causes<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.670> seasons<00:00:54.050> read<00:00:55.050> the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.990 
one of the complaints of critics of
geocentrism<00:03:00.230> is<00:03:00.650> that<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.130> stars<00:03:01.430> are<00:03:01.730> too

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
geocentrism is that the stars are too

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.220 
geocentrism is that the stars are too
big<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.510> they're<00:03:02.630> too<00:03:02.840> far<00:03:03.170> away<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:05.230> to

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
big and they're too far away to to to

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.900 
big and they're too far away to to to
revolve<00:03:06.950> around<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.519> earth<00:03:07.819> every<00:03:08.180> day<00:03:09.910> but

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
revolve around the earth every day but

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.490 
revolve around the earth every day but
star<00:03:11.720> speeds<00:03:12.200> are<00:03:12.620> not<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:13.750> problem<00:03:14.750> for<00:03:15.049> the

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
star speeds are not a problem for the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.890 
star speeds are not a problem for the
geocentric<00:03:16.100> model<00:03:16.340> when<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.180> thickness<00:03:17.690> of

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
the universe is seen to be what it

the universe is seen to be what it
really<00:03:20.660> is<00:03:21.160> less<00:03:22.160> than<00:03:22.430> half<00:03:22.489> a<00:03:23.090> light<00:03:23.450> day

thick half a light day is approximately

eight<00:03:29.329> billion<00:03:29.780> miles<00:03:31.900> some<00:03:32.900> people<00:03:33.200> say<00:03:33.440> what

eight billion miles some people say what

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.430 
eight billion miles some people say what
the<00:03:34.850> universe<00:03:35.269> couldn't<00:03:35.630> possibly<00:03:36.019> be<00:03:36.260> that

the universe couldn't possibly be that
small<00:03:36.859> I<00:03:37.130> don't<00:03:37.910> think<00:03:38.030> eight<00:03:38.840> billion<00:03:39.380> miles

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890

is<00:03:40.370> small<00:03:44.500> but<00:03:46.150> they<00:03:47.150> like<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.810> tell<00:03:48.049> us<00:03:48.079> that

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
is small but they like to tell us that

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.810 
is small but they like to tell us that
the<00:03:48.709> universe<00:03:49.130> is<00:03:49.400> even<00:03:50.359> bigger<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:52.340> idea<00:03:52.670> is
