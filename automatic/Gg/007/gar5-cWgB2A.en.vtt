00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
come a long way one of the pictures

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.560 
come a long way one of the pictures

a long way they're ten times stronger

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.039 
a long way they're ten times stronger
the<00:00:59.070> only<00:00:59.339> reason<00:00:59.670> why<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.909> had<00:01:00.329> some<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.869> them

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
the only reason why I had some of them

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.289 
the only reason why I had some of them
break<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.649> was<00:01:01.769> because<00:01:02.159> this<00:01:02.519> last<00:01:02.729> week<00:01:03.089> I've

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
break it was because this last week I've

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.810 
break it was because this last week I've
been<00:01:03.479> dealing<00:01:03.659> with<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> storm<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.610> wasn't

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
been dealing with the storm and I wasn't

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.219 
been dealing with the storm and I wasn't
able<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:07.940> keep<00:01:08.940> keep<00:01:09.630> up<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:09.899> my<00:01:10.020> regular

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
able to keep keep up with my regular

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.830 
able to keep keep up with my regular
routine<00:01:10.860> as<00:01:11.190> normal<00:01:11.789> so<00:01:12.060> that's<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> only

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
routine as normal so that's the only

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.929 
routine as normal so that's the only
reason<00:01:13.049> minded<00:01:13.560> broke<00:01:13.830> before<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.729> didn't

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
reason minded broke before that I didn't

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.820 
reason minded broke before that I didn't
have<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.899> only<00:01:16.140> thing<00:01:16.289> that<00:01:16.409> happened<00:01:16.679> was

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
have the only thing that happened was

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.340 
have the only thing that happened was
one<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.310> them<00:01:17.460> chipped<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.149> corner<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:19.229> it

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
one of them chipped on the corner but it

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.139 
one of them chipped on the corner but it
was<00:01:19.440> really<00:01:19.800> really<00:01:19.979> small<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:21.000> really

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
was really really small so it really

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:27.320 
was really really small so it really
wasn't<00:01:21.300> a<00:01:21.420> big<00:01:21.569> deal<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:25.190> only<00:01:26.190> because<00:01:26.550> I<00:01:26.909> was

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
wasn't a big deal and only because I was

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.730 
wasn't a big deal and only because I was
moving<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.690> really<00:01:27.960> heavy<00:01:28.140> box<00:01:28.440> in<00:01:28.619> my<00:01:28.649> hand

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
but it had got it got bent the other day

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.190 
but it had got it got bent the other day
and<00:01:55.739> it<00:01:56.310> made<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> top<00:01:56.670> layer<00:01:57.209> come<00:01:57.660> up<00:01:57.869> and

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and it made the top layer come up and

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.499 
and it made the top layer come up and
then<00:01:58.830> eventually<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.700> went<00:01:59.819> up<00:02:00.000> breaking<00:02:00.239> onto

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
then eventually it went up breaking onto

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:12.710 
then eventually it went up breaking onto
the<00:02:00.720> side<00:02:04.759> but<00:02:07.700> other<00:02:08.700> than<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.720> mean<00:02:11.720> my

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
the side but other than that I mean my

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.030 
the side but other than that I mean my
nails<00:02:13.019> are<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.260> lot<00:02:13.410> stronger<00:02:13.650> they<00:02:13.890> can

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
nails are a lot stronger they can

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.869 
nails are a lot stronger they can
withstand<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.640> lot<00:02:14.849> more<00:02:15.150> now<00:02:16.670> like<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.819> think

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
withstand a lot more now like I think

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:23.089 
withstand a lot more now like I think
earlier<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.480> hit<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:20.750> hit<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.810> cab<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.560> hit<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.920> end

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
earlier I hit I hit a cab I hit the end

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.440 
earlier I hit I hit a cab I hit the end
of<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.280> filing<00:02:23.550> cabinet<00:02:23.849> and<00:02:24.090> that's<00:02:24.300> why<00:02:24.390> this

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
of a filing cabinet and that's why this

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.449 
of a filing cabinet and that's why this
one<00:02:24.780> started<00:02:25.140> breaking<00:02:25.590> more<00:02:25.800> because<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.370> was

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
one started breaking more because it was

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.940 
one started breaking more because it was
already<00:02:26.790> broken<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.420> weak<00:02:27.659> now<00:02:28.500> one<00:02:28.709> little

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.040 
already broken and weak now one little
spot<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.670> when<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.209> smashed<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.780> on<00:02:30.900> that

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
spot and when I smashed it on that

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.619 
spot and when I smashed it on that
filing<00:02:31.349> cabinet<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.159> just<00:02:32.430> was<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.940> say<00:02:33.420> learn

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
filing cabinet it just was I say learn

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.440 
filing cabinet it just was I say learn
why<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:33.900> broke<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.500> can<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:36.060> way<00:02:36.390> you

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
why it broke so you can and that way you

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
can tell that it really is I mean they

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.990 
can tell that it really is I mean they

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
don't really know how else to say it the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.040 
don't really know how else to say it the
consistency<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:49.170> almost<00:02:50.040> gel<00:02:50.760> like

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
consistency of this is almost gel like

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.000 
consistency of this is almost gel like
I<00:02:53.080> apply<00:02:53.860> one<00:02:54.220> coat<00:02:54.520> underneath<00:02:55.180> every<00:02:56.010> every

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
I apply one coat underneath every every

I apply one coat underneath every every
mannequin<00:02:57.550> that<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.760> do<00:02:57.910> every<00:02:58.240> nail<00:02:58.510> art<00:02:58.690> that

mannequin that I do every nail art that

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.580 
mannequin that I do every nail art that
I<00:02:58.960> do<00:02:59.040> and<00:03:00.040> I've<00:03:00.430> heard<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.880> people<00:03:01.150> using<00:03:01.690> this

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
I do and I've heard of people using this

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.190 
I do and I've heard of people using this
as<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:02.890> top<00:03:03.310> coat<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.760> don't<00:03:04.060> use<00:03:04.390> that<00:03:04.420> top<00:03:04.930> coat

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
as a top coat I don't use that top coat

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.300 
as a top coat I don't use that top coat
because<00:03:05.920> right<00:03:06.850> now<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.090> have<00:03:07.620> other<00:03:08.620> uses<00:03:09.070> for

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
because right now I have other uses for

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.620 
because right now I have other uses for
it<00:03:09.930> but<00:03:10.930> I<00:03:11.320> think<00:03:11.530> maybe<00:03:11.980> in<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.250> future<00:03:12.630> when

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
it but I think maybe in the future when

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.980 
it but I think maybe in the future when
I<00:03:13.660> switched<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:15.550> strengthener<00:03:16.540> instead<00:03:16.870> of

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
I switched to a strengthener instead of

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.520 
I switched to a strengthener instead of
a<00:03:17.140> hardener<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:18.430> I'm<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:19.110> communist<00:03:20.110> has<00:03:20.290> top

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
a hardener that I'm a communist has top

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.740 
a hardener that I'm a communist has top
coat<00:03:20.740> because<00:03:20.800> I<00:03:20.920> heard<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.420> because<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.690> the

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
coat because I heard it because of the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.190 
coat because I heard it because of the
consistency<00:03:23.260> being<00:03:23.590> like<00:03:23.830> a<00:03:23.860> gel<00:03:24.310> top<00:03:24.610> coat<00:03:25.200> or

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
consistency being like a gel top coat or

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.000 
consistency being like a gel top coat or
like<00:03:26.380> a<00:03:26.500> gel<00:03:27.180> formula<00:03:28.180> kind<00:03:28.780> of<00:03:28.990> that<00:03:29.830> it's

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
like a gel formula kind of that it's

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.160 
like a gel formula kind of that it's
really<00:03:30.250> good<00:03:30.400> for<00:03:30.520> a<00:03:30.580> top<00:03:30.760> coat<00:03:31.090> I'm<00:03:31.540> good<00:03:31.990> for

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
really good for a top coat I'm good for

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.410 
really good for a top coat I'm good for
smoothing<00:03:32.590> out<00:03:32.680> bumps<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:33.640> keep<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.150> in<00:03:34.209> mind

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420

do<00:04:15.610> it<00:04:15.940> I<00:04:16.060> think<00:04:16.269> I<00:04:16.330> said<00:04:16.510> you<00:04:16.600> can<00:04:16.750> do<00:04:16.870> one<00:04:17.080> to

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
do it I think I said you can do one to

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.199 
do it I think I said you can do one to
two<00:04:17.410> only<00:04:17.739> do<00:04:18.010> once<00:04:18.280> as<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.549> change<00:04:18.790> my<00:04:18.910> nails<00:04:19.120> so

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
two only do once as I change my nails so

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.470 
two only do once as I change my nails so
often<00:04:19.890> that<00:04:20.890> I<00:04:20.950> use<00:04:21.250> one<00:04:23.940> also<00:04:24.940> using<00:04:25.419> the

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
often that I use one also using the

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.080 
often that I use one also using the
other<00:04:25.570> top<00:04:25.900> coat<00:04:26.200> i<00:04:26.440> new<00:04:26.640> helps<00:04:27.640> with<00:04:27.940> the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
other top coat i new helps with the

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.350 
other top coat i new helps with the
strength<00:04:28.480> keeping<00:04:29.320> them<00:04:29.470> strong<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:31.120> that's

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
strength keeping them strong so that's

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.960 
strength keeping them strong so that's
nothing<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:33.490> keep<00:04:33.669> in<00:04:33.880> mind<00:04:35.400> so<00:04:36.400> that's<00:04:36.729> all<00:04:36.880> I
