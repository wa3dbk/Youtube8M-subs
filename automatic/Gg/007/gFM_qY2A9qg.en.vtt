I've never used before totally pleased
with<00:01:29.040> that

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.139 

hardly<00:01:37.770> any<00:01:37.890> recall<00:01:39.109> strange<00:01:40.109> trigger<00:01:41.149> keep

hardly any recall strange trigger keep

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.029 
hardly any recall strange trigger keep
in<00:01:42.299> mind<00:01:42.329> we've<00:01:42.689> got<00:01:42.929> the<00:01:43.380> action<00:01:43.740> taking

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
in mind we've got the action taking

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.160 
in mind we've got the action taking
place<00:01:44.070> up<00:01:44.429> here<00:01:44.460> or<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.570> trigger<00:01:45.840> action

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
place up here or the trigger action

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.160 
place up here or the trigger action
taking<00:01:46.409> place<00:01:46.439> up<00:01:46.770> here<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:48.079> action<00:01:49.079> of

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
taking place up here and the action of

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.950 
taking place up here and the action of
the<00:01:49.259> bullet<00:01:49.700> being<00:01:50.700> fired<00:01:50.789> way<00:01:51.329> back<00:01:51.539> here<00:01:51.810> so

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the bullet being fired way back here so

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.929 
the bullet being fired way back here so
there's<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.200> linkage<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.799> between<00:01:53.130> there<00:01:53.369> it's

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
there's a linkage in between there it's

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.490 
there's a linkage in between there it's
definitely<00:01:54.179> a<00:01:54.450> different<00:01:54.869> type<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.170> trigger

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
definitely a different type of trigger

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.740 
definitely a different type of trigger
