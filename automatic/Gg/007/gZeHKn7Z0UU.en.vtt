00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.290
 let's say i greet you all in this 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.420
 I'll show you the video how to download 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.080

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.640
 computer 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.080
 I have a tablet samsung galaxy tab 7 0 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.789
 if I'm not mistaken in general here and so 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.039
 looks but i think it's fair for 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.170
 most samsung tablets in 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.699
 particular systems that works with 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.740
 using android operating system 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.770
 android and so it all the same we do not 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.860
 iphone is much easier here more than anything 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.430
 democratically means we accordingly 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.649
 choose the market application go to 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.760
 market and download we need the app 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.129
 for torrents 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.340
 here we run a search in the market and 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.320
 we choose the most leading ones 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.320
 first views that is not according to 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.270
 attendance by the number of torrents in 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.270
 All new products is rutracker this is no 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.100
 no ads i don't know any of them 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.750
 then so generally actually here 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.670
 dinner was substituted that is people often 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.320
 looking for the role of the tracker here we chose 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.720
 It is proposed to choose rutracker 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.600
 downloader rutracker client rutracker 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.189
 downloader yes no then game systems trigger 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.990
 Ossetians, that is, of course this is 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.360
 plan android system generally cool 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.850
 thing in the sense that for us for Russians 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.610
 people for Russia we are not used to pay 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.470
 that's why we like to 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.600
 all the same pirate stuff, respectively 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.670

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.380
 This application and to smoke it I have already 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.909
 downloaded that is here a tick such 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.439
 it is worth it to me already downloaded 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.290
 rutracker downloader 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.270
 software well and let's 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.100

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.600
 in fact now I will show you this 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.689
 the program itself we have proposed 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.680
 can and open delete downloads 500,000 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.689
 more than 500 thousand July 3, she released 2012 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.579

 understood what to use enough 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.630
 such a little crooked program but 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.460
 but 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.340
 get into will not be very simple and 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.060
 logically it means we choose here 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.130
 accordingly, we entered the program 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.690
 given we need we need something

 this from rutrekera but here I already 2 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.610
 shared therefore as if 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.140

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.459
 no mice machinarium this I already in 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.380
 downloads will not be very convenient 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.690
 for example some last 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.090
 well, let's say we type 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:06.000
 words time time 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:09.519

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.380
 all search means go quickly 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.690

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.010
 West let's class cashier julio well 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.170
 let's say this we skim by example 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:28.209
 here we go into this file 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:32.680
 this film means here and now we need 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:35.799
 very important means very important only 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.829

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.920
 so so and here's the search probably search here 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.260
 this one is a broken sword 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.060
 I just forgot a little, so 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.609

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.069
 now I will show you all the goodness with a crossword puzzle 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.810
 have chosen and admitted but now I am no longer 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.170
 I will especially admit this 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.389
 we choose everything now we even 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.260
 there was a warning that 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.819

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.549
 we need 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.079
 click on how to download torrent then 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.810
 there is the very bottom 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.579
 and at the very bottom of the screen is a long one 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.459
 line red download torrent i.e. 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.960

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.090
 this button we don't need to play it 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.520
 only computer users choose 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.110
 and accordingly began to pack 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.910
 torrent jump using this 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.759
 apps we need to click this one 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.830

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.820
 screen means so wrong state 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.229
 where is our torrent 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.020
 it looks like this torrent yes let's say 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:54.009
 but in my opinion this is he protecting here we are 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:57.190
 select it and click start all 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:59.590
 the launch has gone that is the jump has gone here 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.770
 we have written it already took the file itself 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.490
 what is called up to its size speed 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.979
 horse racing 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.889
 how much is left 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.169
 see and so on and so forth that is all 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.330
 In principle, everything in the computer is 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.770
 as if here we see that is all 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.820
 just convenient enough, that is, we 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.460
 We can go up now! 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.470
 call the home key sat down jump with us 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.080
 continues what can we see 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.000
 here we run and let 's say this button 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.710
 she shows how to look 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.599
 running application that's about 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.190
 running application here we have 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.340
 continue the jump that is very convenient 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.740
 everything is just logical and all horse racing but 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.990
 saved then you will need to go 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.789
 my file but from the application even if not 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.310

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:49.360
 the file system can we look for 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.419
 application started and looking for my files 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.550
 somewhere here we have my files

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.120
 the windows operating system we entered and 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.740
 then we will be here somewhere here 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.400
 will i just don't remember there which way 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.750
