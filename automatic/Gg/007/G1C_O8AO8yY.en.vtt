cueball<00:00:06.960> deflection<00:00:07.560> as<00:00:07.740> you<00:00:08.670> already<00:00:08.820> know

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
cueball deflection as you already know

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.330 
cueball deflection as you already know
using<00:00:09.929> English<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.440> an<00:00:10.559> important<00:00:11.010> part<00:00:11.250> of

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
using English is an important part of

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.070 
using English is an important part of
the<00:00:11.429> pool<00:00:11.670> game<00:00:11.910> because<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.420> allows<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.960> to

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
the pool game because it allows you to

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.039 
the pool game because it allows you to
position<00:00:13.590> yourself<00:00:13.980> for<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.639> next<00:00:14.880> shot<00:00:15.089> also

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
position yourself for the next shot also

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.830 
position yourself for the next shot also
true<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.770> using<00:00:17.190> English<00:00:17.840> complicates

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
true is that using English complicates

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.410 
true is that using English complicates
even<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> simplest<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.250> shots<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:21.180> vast

even the simplest of shots the vast

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.450 
even the simplest of shots the vast
majority<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:22.020> shots<00:00:22.350> are<00:00:22.619> missed<00:00:23.010> when

English<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.000> used<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:25.050> reason<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.529> simple

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
English is used the reason is simple

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.820 
English is used the reason is simple
when<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.730> use<00:00:26.939> English<00:00:27.260> the<00:00:28.260> cue<00:00:28.529> ball

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
when you use English the cue ball

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.890 
when you use English the cue ball
doesn't<00:00:29.189> always<00:00:29.580> go<00:00:29.970> where<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.300> aim<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
doesn't always go where you aim it and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.229 
doesn't always go where you aim it and
that's<00:00:31.769> cue<00:00:32.130> ball<00:00:32.309> deflection<00:00:32.880> for<00:00:33.090> you

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
that's cue ball deflection for you

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.200 
that's cue ball deflection for you
sometimes<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.290> called<00:00:34.469> squirt<00:00:34.980> now<00:00:35.790> here<00:00:36.180> I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
sometimes it's called squirt now here I

am set up at center English aiming
directly<00:00:38.250> at<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> one<00:00:38.910> ball<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.300> I'm<00:00:39.750> going

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
directly at the one ball and I'm going

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.440 
directly at the one ball and I'm going
to<00:00:40.020> shift<00:00:40.500> my<00:00:40.649> cue<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.579> full<00:00:41.910> tips<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
to shift my cue to full tips to the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.250 
to shift my cue to full tips to the
right<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.399> I<00:00:44.399> am<00:00:44.579> using<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.239> high<00:00:45.539> deflection

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
right and I am using a high deflection

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.010 
right and I am using a high deflection
shaft<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.430> am<00:00:47.700> aiming<00:00:47.940> directly<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
shaft but I am aiming directly at the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.560 
shaft but I am aiming directly at the
one<00:00:49.170> ball<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.649> now<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.700> shoot<00:00:53.270> notice<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
one ball and now as I shoot notice the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.220 
one ball and now as I shoot notice the
extreme<00:00:55.350> deflection<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> left<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:57.230> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
extreme deflection to the left of the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.770 
extreme deflection to the left of the
one<00:00:58.410> ball<00:00:58.649> because<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> was<00:00:59.969> hitting<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> right

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
one ball because I was hitting the right

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.500 
one ball because I was hitting the right
side<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.949> cue<00:01:02.129> ball<00:01:02.160> let's<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.359> on

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
side of the cue ball let's do that on

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.690 
side of the cue ball let's do that on
the<00:01:03.600> opposite<00:01:03.960> side<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.409> as<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> shift<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the opposite side and as I shift to the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.520 
the opposite side and as I shift to the
left<00:01:05.729> two<00:01:06.210> tips<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.630> English<00:01:06.960> aiming<00:01:07.380> directly

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
left two tips of English aiming directly

at the one ball again the deflection of

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.270 
at the one ball again the deflection of
the<00:01:12.659> cue<00:01:12.869> ball<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> extreme<00:01:14.040> right

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the cue ball is to the extreme right

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.320 
the cue ball is to the extreme right

side of the one ball you'll notice in

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.760 
side of the one ball you'll notice in
slow<00:01:18.689> speed<00:01:19.189> how<00:01:20.189> much<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.939> cue<00:01:21.240> ball<00:01:21.479> is

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
slow speed how much the cue ball is

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.370 
slow speed how much the cue ball is
missing<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.130> object<00:01:23.729> ball<00:01:23.909> by<00:01:24.210> both<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.259> the
