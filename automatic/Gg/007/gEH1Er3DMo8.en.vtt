00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
think it's a good foundation for next

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.590 
think it's a good foundation for next
for<00:00:19.050> next<00:00:19.080> fall<00:00:20.240> first<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.359> was<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.539> little

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
for next fall first it was a little

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.720 
for next fall first it was a little
sloppy<00:00:23.779> um<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.380> know<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.529> think<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.640> know

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
sloppy um you know I think you know

sloppy um you know I think you know
there's<00:00:26.910> some<00:00:27.090> good<00:00:27.210> things<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.510> take<00:00:27.630> out<00:00:27.810> of

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930

it you know I think you know besides
some<00:00:29.910> turnovers<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.599> thought<00:00:30.960> both<00:00:31.199> offices

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
some turnovers I thought both offices

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.110 
some turnovers I thought both offices
were<00:00:31.890> able<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> move<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.340> ball<00:00:32.399> more<00:00:32.850> or<00:00:32.940> less

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
were able to move the ball more or less

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.049 
were able to move the ball more or less
and<00:00:33.420> I'm<00:00:34.250> like<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.340> said<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.579> think<00:00:35.790> there's<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
and I'm like I said I think there's a

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.100 
and I'm like I said I think there's a
lot<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.210> young<00:00:36.360> guys<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.570> played<00:00:36.809> well<00:00:36.989> today

I mean Devon Allen came up huge today um
but<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.090> think<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.989> know<00:00:43.079> as<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.620> progress<00:00:43.770> you

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
but I think you know as we progress you

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.650 
but I think you know as we progress you
know<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.610> want<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.879> always<00:00:44.969> get<00:00:45.149> better<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
know we want to always get better and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.720 
know we want to always get better and
it's<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.530> kind<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.829> standard<00:00:47.190> now<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:47.399> got<00:00:47.640> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
it's as kind of a standard now we got to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:58.069 
it's as kind of a standard now we got to
get<00:00:47.820> improving<00:00:55.129> um<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.219> think<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.910> spring<00:00:57.300> one

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
get improving um I think this spring one

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.160 
get improving um I think this spring one
of<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.649> focal<00:00:59.010> point<00:00:59.039> for<00:00:59.609> me<00:00:59.910> was

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
of the one of the focal point for me was

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.080 
of the one of the focal point for me was
full<00:01:01.170> work<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.680> think<00:01:01.949> coach<00:01:02.250> ross<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.910> only

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
full work and I think coach ross is only

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.420 
full work and I think coach ross is only
really<00:01:03.270> good<00:01:03.449> job<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.690> me<00:01:03.960> um<00:01:04.920> you're<00:01:05.309> not

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
really good job with me um you're not

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.800 
really good job with me um you're not
saying<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.909> my<00:01:06.030> foot<00:01:06.180> works<00:01:06.360> perfect<00:01:06.720> now

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
saying that my foot works perfect now

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.000 
saying that my foot works perfect now
but<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.110> something<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.860> continue

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
but it's something that I can continue

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.359 
but it's something that I can continue
to<00:01:08.220> work<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.810> you<00:01:09.810> know<00:01:09.930> i<00:01:10.229> saw<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.159> whole

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
process with coach Fox I think the one

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.499 
process with coach Fox I think the one
big<00:01:13.260> takeaway<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.250> me<00:01:14.490> was<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.030> kind<00:01:15.479> of

Damon um you know it was kind of a
broken<00:02:34.310> play<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.670> he's<00:02:34.850> able<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.150> make<00:02:36.110> the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
broken play and he's able to make the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.280 
broken play and he's able to make the
most<00:02:36.380> out<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.780> know<00:02:38.810> Devin<00:02:39.140> really

most out of it and you know Devin really
kind<00:02:39.530> of<00:02:39.590> took<00:02:39.680> care<00:02:39.860> of<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:39.980> rest<00:02:46.120> yes<00:02:47.120> for

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
to win the job on one throwing when they

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.670 
to win the job on one throwing when they
when<00:02:52.580> they<00:02:52.670> really<00:02:52.880> didn't<00:02:53.060> need<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.210> um<00:02:53.990> but<00:02:54.590> I

other team um but you know like that
kids<00:05:05.030> had<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.360> great<00:05:05.510> spring<00:05:05.810> um<00:05:06.169> you<00:05:06.950> know<00:05:07.070> he

kids had a great spring um you know he
liked<00:05:08.120> a<00:05:08.300> lot<00:05:08.510> of<00:05:08.540> the<00:05:08.660> other<00:05:08.810> quarterbacks
