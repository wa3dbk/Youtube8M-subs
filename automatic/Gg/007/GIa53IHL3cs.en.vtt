hey<00:00:02.490> this<00:00:02.669> is<00:00:02.760> Nate<00:00:02.939> storey<00:00:03.000> with<00:00:03.449> bright

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hey this is Nate storey with bright

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.480 
hey this is Nate storey with bright
Agrotech<00:00:03.720> and<00:00:04.230> today<00:00:04.410> we're<00:00:05.040> gonna<00:00:05.100> talk

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
Agrotech and today we're gonna talk

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:14.690 
Agrotech and today we're gonna talk
about<00:00:05.520> boron<00:00:06.270> as<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.540> plant<00:00:06.930> nutrient

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.330 

so<00:00:15.270> we<00:00:15.780> got<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> few<00:00:16.260> requests<00:00:16.770> as<00:00:16.890> part<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.250> our

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
so we got a few requests as part of our

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.250 
so we got a few requests as part of our
micronutrient<00:00:18.150> series<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.660> really<00:00:18.990> start

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
micronutrient series to really start

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.790 
micronutrient series to really start
talking<00:00:19.500> about<00:00:19.950> some<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.790> these<00:00:21.000> lesser-known

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
talking about some of these lesser-known

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.960 
talking about some of these lesser-known
micronutrients<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:22.950> we<00:00:23.580> got<00:00:23.730> specific

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
micronutrients and we got specific

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.359 
micronutrients and we got specific
requests<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.869> talk<00:00:25.020> about<00:00:25.200> boron<00:00:25.770> which<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
requests to talk about boron which is a

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.310 
requests to talk about boron which is a
little<00:00:26.700> bit<00:00:26.820> odd<00:00:26.970> because<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:27.510> not<00:00:27.750> commonly

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
little bit odd because it's not commonly

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.710 
little bit odd because it's not commonly
deficient<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.640> boron<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.450> of<00:00:30.570> these

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
deficient so boron is one of these

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.780 
deficient so boron is one of these
elements<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.470> usually<00:00:31.890> fairly<00:00:32.160> plentiful

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
elements it's usually fairly plentiful

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.360 
elements it's usually fairly plentiful
in<00:00:32.970> aquaponic<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.690> hydroponic<00:00:34.290> systems<00:00:34.710> but

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
in aquaponic and hydroponic systems but

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.170 
in aquaponic and hydroponic systems but
it<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:36.120> deficient<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:37.070> occasion<00:00:38.070> boron<00:00:38.970> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
it can be deficient on occasion boron is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.299 
it can be deficient on occasion boron is
used<00:00:39.420> for<00:00:39.690> plant<00:00:39.989> wall<00:00:40.260> cell<00:00:41.100> wall

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
used for plant wall cell wall

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.150 
used for plant wall cell wall
development<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.269> for<00:00:43.110> basically<00:00:43.470> helping

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
development so for basically helping

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.880 
development so for basically helping
those<00:00:44.370> plant<00:00:45.000> cell<00:00:45.269> walls<00:00:45.540> strengthen<00:00:46.500> up<00:00:46.650> it

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
those plant cell walls strengthen up it

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.829 
those plant cell walls strengthen up it
functions<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.909> help<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.479> the<00:00:48.659> production

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
functions to help with the production

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.799 
functions to help with the production
and<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.710> regulation<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.489> some<00:00:50.790> plant<00:00:51.540> growth

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and the regulation of some plant growth

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.380 
and the regulation of some plant growth
hormones<00:00:52.260> okay<00:00:52.820> specifically<00:00:53.820> plant<00:00:54.150> growth

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
hormones okay specifically plant growth

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.149 
hormones okay specifically plant growth
hormones<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.049> regulate<00:00:55.320> root<00:00:55.680> growth

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
hormones that regulate root growth

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.240 
hormones that regulate root growth
so<00:00:56.670> anytime<00:00:57.390> nay's<00:00:58.320> story<00:00:58.620> starts<00:00:58.949> talking

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
so anytime nay's story starts talking

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.770 
so anytime nay's story starts talking
about<00:00:59.339> root<00:00:59.640> growth<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.089> know<00:01:00.299> he's<00:01:00.510> going<00:01:00.720> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
about root growth you know he's going to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.500 
about root growth you know he's going to
start<00:01:01.019> talking<00:01:01.470> about<00:01:01.559> potassium<00:01:02.370> uptake<00:01:02.510> so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
start talking about potassium uptake so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.260 
start talking about potassium uptake so
this<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.350> one<00:01:04.650> area<00:01:04.920> where<00:01:05.100> boron<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.820> really

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
this is one area where boron is really

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.270 
this is one area where boron is really
important<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.619> plants<00:01:08.070> you're

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
important if you have plants you're

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.410 
important if you have plants you're
trying<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.610> bulk<00:01:08.790> them<00:01:08.970> up<00:01:09.119> if<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.330> have

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
trying to bulk them up if you have

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.090 
trying to bulk them up if you have
plants<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.170> you're<00:01:10.260> trying<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.740> really

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
plants and you're trying to get really

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.250 
plants and you're trying to get really
good<00:01:11.250> root<00:01:11.490> development<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.659> really<00:01:12.990> want<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
good root development you really want to

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.380 
good root development you really want to
be<00:01:13.350> thinking<00:01:13.560> about<00:01:13.860> how<00:01:14.670> much<00:01:14.850> boron<00:01:15.240> you

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
be thinking about how much boron you

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.069 
be thinking about how much boron you
have<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.750> your<00:01:15.840> system<00:01:16.220> because<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.460> has<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:18.079> big

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
have in your system because it has a big

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.440 
have in your system because it has a big
impact<00:01:19.469> on<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.130> ability<00:01:20.399> of<00:01:20.640> plants<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.240> take

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
impact on the ability of plants to take

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.749 
impact on the ability of plants to take
up<00:01:21.950> potassium<00:01:22.950> really<00:01:23.219> efficiency

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
up potassium really efficiency

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.090 
up potassium really efficiency
efficiently<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:24.990> that's<00:01:25.649> really<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
efficiently so that's that's really the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.990 
efficiently so that's that's really the
main<00:01:26.369> thing<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.969> boron<00:01:27.659> does<00:01:28.460> for<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.700> and

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
main thing that boron does for you and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.599 
main thing that boron does for you and
for<00:01:30.600> your<00:01:30.810> plants<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:32.100> won't<00:01:32.310> necessarily

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
for your plants you won't necessarily

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.919 
for your plants you won't necessarily
have<00:01:33.359> to<00:01:33.570> supplement<00:01:33.810> boron<00:01:34.700> very<00:01:35.700> often<00:01:36.299> but

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
have to supplement boron very often but

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.630 
have to supplement boron very often but
if<00:01:37.200> you're<00:01:37.530> kind<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.100> phase<00:01:38.369> where

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
if you're kind of in that phase where

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.370 
if you're kind of in that phase where
you're<00:01:38.759> trying<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.149> get<00:01:39.750> some<00:01:39.960> good<00:01:39.990> ric

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
you're trying to get some good ric

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.080 
you're trying to get some good ric
growth<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:41.159> not<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> bad<00:01:41.670> thing<00:01:41.939> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
growth it's not a bad thing to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.510 
growth it's not a bad thing to
supplement<00:01:42.630> boron<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.200> occasion<00:01:43.859> now<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
supplement boron on occasion now the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.779 
supplement boron on occasion now the
only<00:01:44.789> true<00:01:45.749> and<00:01:46.079> best<00:01:46.770> way<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.070> do<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.640> to

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
only true and best way to do this is to

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.730 
only true and best way to do this is to
send<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.119> water<00:01:48.299> sample<00:01:48.570> into<00:01:48.929> a<00:01:48.960> lab<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.710> them

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
send a water sample into a lab have them

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.770 
send a water sample into a lab have them
test<00:01:50.249> it<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.850> them<00:01:51.090> tell<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.420> how<00:01:51.600> much

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
test it have them tell you how much

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.779 
test it have them tell you how much
boron<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.380> there<00:01:52.619> or<00:01:52.799> have<00:01:52.979> them<00:01:53.189> do<00:01:53.340> tissue

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
boron is there or have them do tissue

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.819 
boron is there or have them do tissue
analysis<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.689> tell<00:01:54.929> you<00:01:55.049> how<00:01:55.200> much<00:01:55.350> boron<00:01:55.740> you

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
analysis and tell you how much boron you

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.389 
analysis and tell you how much boron you
have<00:01:56.039> in<00:01:56.310> your<00:01:56.880> plants<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.319> that's<00:01:59.009> not

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
have in your plants but if that's not

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.099 
have in your plants but if that's not
available<00:01:59.729> or<00:02:00.420> if<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.569> don't<00:02:00.749> want<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.990> go

that far I usually say do a pinch or two
for<00:02:05.130> fairly<00:02:05.460> large<00:02:05.670> systems<00:02:06.179> once<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.689> quarter

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
to once a year somewhere in that

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.140 
to once a year somewhere in that

boron and that's that's how we

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.520 
boron and that's that's how we
supplement<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.500> again<00:02:59.430> just<00:02:59.670> to<00:03:00.060> recap<00:03:00.599> you
