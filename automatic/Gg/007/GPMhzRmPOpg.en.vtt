half a year
there's<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.150> helicopter<00:02:14.629> into<00:02:14.750> training<00:02:15.019> three

four<00:02:15.500> times<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.860> week<00:02:15.980> which<00:02:16.129> I<00:02:16.220> actually<00:02:16.280> think

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
four times a week which I actually think

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.180 
four times a week which I actually think
is<00:02:16.670> quite<00:02:16.760> dangerous<00:02:17.060> precedent<00:02:18.019> as<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.799> as<00:02:18.920> it

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
is quite dangerous precedent as it as it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.600 
is quite dangerous precedent as it as it
is

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
is

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.089 
is
I<00:02:19.640> just<00:02:20.030> think<00:02:20.209> city<00:02:20.629> need<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.590> possibly<00:02:22.010> need

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
I just think city need and possibly need

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.860 
I just think city need and possibly need
an<00:02:22.190> extra<00:02:22.430> strike<00:02:22.670> or<00:02:22.879> some<00:02:23.150> creativity<00:02:23.510> from

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
an extra strike or some creativity from

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.479 
an extra strike or some creativity from
somewhere<00:02:24.260> because<00:02:24.650> for<00:02:25.159> the<00:02:25.220> money<00:02:25.370> they

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
somewhere because for the money they

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.949 
somewhere because for the money they
spent<00:02:25.760> last<00:02:25.909> seen<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.239> think<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.510> was<00:02:26.629> too<00:02:26.780> close

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
spent last seen I think it was too close

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.479 
spent last seen I think it was too close
to<00:02:27.019> cool<00:02:27.319> that<00:02:27.470> if<00:02:27.620> cute<00:02:27.830> cards<00:02:28.099> that<00:02:28.340> had<00:02:28.459> a

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
to cool that if cute cards that had a

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.470 
to cool that if cute cards that had a
little<00:02:28.700> men<00:02:28.819> on<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.030> pitch<00:02:29.180> they<00:02:29.360> could

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
little men on the pitch they could

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.119 
little men on the pitch they could
easily<00:02:29.569> lost<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.019> game<00:02:30.200> on<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.769> last<00:02:30.950> day

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
easily lost that game on the last day

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.460 
easily lost that game on the last day
all<00:02:31.519> if<00:02:31.730> some<00:02:32.000> box<00:02:32.239> for<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:35.750> same<00:02:35.930> reason<00:02:36.319> so

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
all if some box for the same reason so

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.830 
all if some box for the same reason so
at<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.709> same<00:02:36.860> reason<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.430> know<00:02:37.659> city<00:02:38.659> I<00:02:38.750> think

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
at the same reason you know city I think

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.210 
at the same reason you know city I think
it<00:02:39.049> is<00:02:39.140> too<00:02:39.260> close<00:02:39.409> to<00:02:39.500> call<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:40.040> nicer

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
it is too close to call you nicer

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.350 
it is too close to call you nicer
obviously<00:02:40.549> thinking<00:02:40.790> well<00:02:40.909> we<00:02:41.000> only<00:02:41.090> losses

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
obviously thinking well we only losses

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.039 
obviously thinking well we only losses
on<00:02:41.480> goal<00:02:41.659> difference

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
on goal difference

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.180 
on goal difference
let's<00:02:42.379> bring<00:02:42.500> in<00:02:42.620> someone<00:02:42.829> who<00:02:42.950> can<00:02:43.069> maybe

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
let's bring in someone who can maybe

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.280 
let's bring in someone who can maybe
gets<00:02:43.430> 25<00:02:43.819> extra<00:02:44.180> goals<00:02:44.450> because<00:02:44.810> they<00:02:44.900> look<00:02:45.200> a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
gets 25 extra goals because they look a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.720 
gets 25 extra goals because they look a
bit<00:02:45.319> stale<00:02:45.680> in<00:02:45.829> some<00:02:45.980> games<00:02:46.160> on<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.609> only
