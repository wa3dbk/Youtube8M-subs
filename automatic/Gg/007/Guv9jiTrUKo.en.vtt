00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.560
 good afternoon in this review we 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.180
 continue the topic on a wobbler boxer and in 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.439
 this time let's talk about wobbler 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:32.379
 boxer x with 45 f from chinese 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.420
 kosadaka manufacturer by tradition for 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:42.640
 begin designate the main characteristics 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:46.360
 wobbler length 45 mm weight 8 and 75 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:51.489
 grams depth of wobbler fluctuates 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:54.729
 from 20 to 60 centimeters and crank crank 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.100
 the wobbler of this model is floating 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:01:01.420
 color wobbler presented on video 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.320
 Ji lure basically catch pike and 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.920
 perch 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.070
 pike perch drove but also on a wobbler 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.860
 comes across and trout which catches well 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.409
 this bait on paid ponds 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.760
 if we talk about size and weight 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.860
 predatory fish that really catch on 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.720
 wobbler here can be successful 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.630
 catching like a sporting size predator but 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.560
 also trophy for example 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.390
 angler spinning can quite 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.410
 count on catching chub or ide 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.300
 weighing up to 1 kilogram is also 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.820
 evidence of fishing with lures zander 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.130
 weighing up to one and a half pounds pike 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.920
 comes across from a wobbler from perfectly 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.590
 small grams in 300 weight and up 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.260
 trophy size about one and a half two 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.630
 kilograms if viewed in 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.600
 as a perch trophy here the catch 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.890
 weight will be more modest than perch when fishing 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.400
 on a wobbler will not exceed 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.950
 and 300 400 grams and of course based on 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.960
 this lure really is quite 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.670
 universal spinning bait 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.710
 because he is able to catch himself 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.130
 diverse predator and in a wide variety 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.130
 conditions 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.620
 since the wobbler has such important 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.210
 parameters like its decent weight and 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.120
 original convex 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.380
 and at the same time an elongated body shape 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.420
 to cast a wobbler 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.780
 it seems possible to satisfied 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.520
 long distance essentially with spinning 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.620
 you throw a wobbler flying bullet 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.590
 and falls very precisely in the intended place 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.660
 in the pond and it speaks of his very 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.570
 excellent in flight performance and 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.250
 The characteristics of a wobbler are quite good. 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.860
 behaves in the process with ping wai 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.800
 wiring when fishing in places and reservoirs 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.540
 there is no flow but also with 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.510
 Medium and fast fishing 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.020
 during wobbler keeps very well on 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.960
 stream 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.420
 and collapses on its side at the same time 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.270
 wobbler behaves quickly and wins back 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.880
 about a diverse predator imposing 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.520
 his interesting game desire to attack 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.440
 given bait inside wobbler 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.740
 there are so-called noise 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.690
 balls of them a few pieces and they have 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.370
 small size 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.650
 the balls are not fixed inside the wobbler and 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:22.580
 when shaking move freely in 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:24.440
 hull bait also balls these in 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.600
 the process of posting wobbler publish 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.730
 pretty loud noise which is very 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.220
 well additionally attracts the most 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.350
 different predator to the same himself 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.020
 spinningist hears quite clearly 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.900
 noise background issued by wobbler in 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.820
 moments of spin hawai wiring except 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.500
 small balls inside the wobbler also 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.780
 there are large metal balls 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.600
 responsible for casting lures 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.500
 In addition, there are two wobblers 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.930
 triple hooks these hooks are made 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.260
 quite original and has several 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.730
 bent inward the shape of the sting 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.990
 such a lid design contributes 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.060
 more grip of passion 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.880
 which is very important with spinning fishing 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.150
 while the hooks are very durable and very 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.959
 sharp most suitable postings 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.070
 for fishing on a wobbler this model will 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.560
 uniform spinning wiring on 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.340
 different speeds and wiring called 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.340
 stop and go 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.820
 this
