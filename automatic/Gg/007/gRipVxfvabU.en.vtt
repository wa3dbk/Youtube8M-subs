coil within the mask itself take care to
wind<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.530> tube<00:01:07.800> in<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:09.120> fashion<00:01:09.690> so<00:01:10.080> that

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
wind the tube in a fashion so that

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.700 
wind the tube in a fashion so that
you're<00:01:10.410> not<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.740> against<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.060> coil<00:01:14.210> as<00:01:15.710> you

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
you're not going against the coil as you

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.580 
you're not going against the coil as you
can<00:01:16.890> see<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:18.390> tubing<00:01:18.900> has<00:01:19.050> a<00:01:19.080> natural

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
can see the tubing has a natural

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.810 
can see the tubing has a natural
characteristic<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:21.540> coil<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.430> as<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.550> take

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
characteristic to coil and as you take

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.250 
characteristic to coil and as you take
that<00:01:24.440> wind<00:01:25.440> it<00:01:25.619> within<00:01:25.800> the<00:01:26.160> mask<00:01:26.430> itself<00:01:27.260> this

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
that wind it within the mask itself this

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.570 
that wind it within the mask itself this
will<00:01:28.530> allow<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.220> much<00:01:29.520> tighter<00:01:30.080> packing<00:01:31.580> when

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
will allow a much tighter packing when

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:44.600 
will allow a much tighter packing when
