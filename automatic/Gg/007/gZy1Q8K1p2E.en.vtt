pattern it's going to UM dovie's um it's

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.830 
pattern it's going to UM dovie's um it's
going<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.049> throw<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> whole<00:01:22.439> thing<00:01:22.500> off<00:01:23.840> all

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
going to throw the whole thing off all

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.230 
going to throw the whole thing off all
right<00:01:24.960> let's<00:01:25.170> check<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.409> out

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.180 

all<00:01:33.240> right<00:01:34.670> on<00:01:35.670> replay<00:01:37.040> doesn't<00:01:38.040> look<00:01:38.130> like

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
all right on replay doesn't look like

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.830 
all right on replay doesn't look like
there's<00:01:38.520> nothing<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:39.120> special<00:01:39.420> about<00:01:39.600> it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
there's nothing really special about it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.170 
there's nothing really special about it
so<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.830> normal<00:01:41.100> person<00:01:41.580> is<00:01:41.700> probably<00:01:42.030> if

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
so the normal person is probably if

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.520 
so the normal person is probably if
they're<00:01:42.360> playing<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.750> offense<00:01:43.200> they're<00:01:43.380> not

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
they're playing on offense they're not

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.950 
they're playing on offense they're not
going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.740> think<00:01:44.040> anything<00:01:44.370> of<00:01:44.760> that<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.300> then

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
going to think anything of that and then

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.250 
going to think anything of that and then

something open it doesn't matter what it
is<00:02:36.320> this<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> little<00:02:37.620> bit<00:02:37.860> advanced<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:38.930> um

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
is this is a little bit advanced but um

is this is a little bit advanced but um
you<00:02:40.110> got<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.380> be<00:02:40.470> advanced<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.040> them<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.910> learn

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
this type of stuff so let's check out 12

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.990 
this type of stuff so let's check out 12
there's<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.810> 51<00:02:52.320> it's<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:53.370> know<00:02:53.489> it's<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.760> 5<00:02:53.970> on

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
there's a 51 it's a you know it's a 5 on

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.479 
there's a 51 it's a you know it's a 5 on
six<00:02:54.480> blitz<00:03:00.440> but<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.530> gets<00:03:01.650> pressure<00:03:02.010> right<00:03:02.310> up

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
six blitz but it gets pressure right up

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.150 
six blitz but it gets pressure right up
the<00:03:02.610> middle<00:03:03.260> you're<00:03:04.260> using<00:03:04.530> controlling<00:03:05.100> a

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
the middle you're using controlling a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.009 
the middle you're using controlling a
man<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.940> course<00:03:06.209> they<00:03:06.360> can<00:03:06.510> always<00:03:06.660> do

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
man of course they can always do

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.490 
man of course they can always do
something<00:03:07.050> real<00:03:07.650> quick<00:03:07.830> over<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.280> middle<00:03:08.670> but

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.870 

that's<00:03:13.500> when<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:13.860> can<00:03:13.980> also<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.400> can<00:03:14.700> also

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
that's when you can also you can also

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.180 
that's when you can also you can also
switch<00:03:15.239> this<00:03:15.390> blitz<00:03:15.690> around<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:16.320> so<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:17.010> many

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
switch this blitz around so so so many

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.220 
switch this blitz around so so so many
different<00:03:17.400> ways<00:03:17.550> that<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:18.239> just<00:03:18.510> it's

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
different ways that it's just it's

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.400 
different ways that it's just it's
almost<00:03:19.500> impossible<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:20.370> figure<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:22.080> figure

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
almost impossible to figure it to figure

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.720 
almost impossible to figure it to figure
out<00:03:22.500> what<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.709> person's<00:03:23.070> going<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.280> do<00:03:23.459> with

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
out what a person's going to do with

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.250 
out what a person's going to do with
that<00:03:23.910> they<00:03:24.300> do<00:03:24.510> something<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:24.989> have<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.230> be

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
that they do something that have to be

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.970 
that they do something that have to be
quick<00:03:25.530> with<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:27.530> but<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.620> have<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.830> bring

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
quick with it but I have to bring

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.040 
quick with it but I have to bring
maximum<00:03:29.340> protection<00:03:29.610> something<00:03:30.570> like<00:03:30.690> that

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.500 

however<00:03:34.050> there<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.320> go
