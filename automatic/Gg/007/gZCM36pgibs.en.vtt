00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
not so much lighting as it is a lack of

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.819 
not so much lighting as it is a lack of
life<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:24.270> let's<00:00:24.450> go<00:00:24.599> ahead<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.840> set<00:00:25.140> up<00:00:25.349> this

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:25.829 
life so let's go ahead and set up this

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.679 
life so let's go ahead and set up this
is<00:00:26.009> the<00:00:26.099> easy<00:00:26.279> part<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:27.149> do<00:00:27.270> not<00:00:27.419> want

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
is the easy part we do not want

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.420 
is the easy part we do not want
background<00:00:27.930> except<00:00:28.649> for<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.919> solid<00:00:29.130> black

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
color next we want to go into our

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.550 
color next we want to go into our
lighting<00:00:35.630> and<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:36.870> want<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> change<00:00:37.290> our

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
lighting and we want to change our

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.510 
lighting and we want to change our
ambient<00:00:37.890> lighting<00:00:38.330> to<00:00:39.330> black<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.410> you'll<00:00:41.370> see

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
ambient lighting to black and you'll see

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.360 
ambient lighting to black and you'll see
just<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.790> slight<00:00:42.000> decrease<00:00:42.920> now<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.010> want<00:00:44.280> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
just a slight decrease now we want to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.890 
just a slight decrease now we want to
turn<00:00:44.520> off<00:00:44.730> our<00:00:44.940> lights<00:00:45.150> all<00:00:45.390> together<00:00:45.600> now

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
turn off our lights all together now

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.940 
turn off our lights all together now
you're<00:00:48.900> noticing<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.380> the<00:00:49.530> silhouette

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
you're noticing that the silhouette

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.229 
you're noticing that the silhouette
effect<00:00:50.280> their<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.760> saw<00:00:50.940> what<00:00:51.120> happened

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
effect their but you saw what happened

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.900 
effect their but you saw what happened
as<00:00:51.570> soon<00:00:51.750> as<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.440> got<00:00:52.560> out<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.920> grid<00:00:53.160> or<00:00:53.640> if

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
as soon as I got out of the grid or if

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.700 
as soon as I got out of the grid or if
we<00:00:54.030> turn<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.360> grid<00:00:54.570> off<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:55.380> little<00:00:55.680> that

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
we turn the grid off is little that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.550 
we turn the grid off is little that
disappears<00:00:56.899> now<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.079> are<00:00:58.110> several<00:00:58.320> ways

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
disappears now there are several ways

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.170 
disappears now there are several ways
that<00:00:58.950> that<00:00:59.130> we<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.579> solve<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.910> little

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
that that we can solve this little

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.180 
that that we can solve this little
problem<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.870> one<00:01:01.470> of<00:01:01.620> them<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.950> course<00:01:02.100> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
problem and one of them is of course to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.850 
problem and one of them is of course to
go<00:01:02.399> back<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.790> 2d<00:01:03.149> background<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.680> has

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
go back to a 2d background that has

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.679 
go back to a 2d background that has
something<00:01:05.309> bright<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.759> it<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.299> let<00:01:09.539> this

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
something bright in it so we let this

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.330 
something bright in it so we let this
load<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.200> we'll<00:01:10.319> turn<00:01:10.469> off<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.799> grid<00:01:11.009> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
load and we'll turn off the grid and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.840 
load and we'll turn off the grid and
I'll<00:01:12.270> show<00:01:12.389> you<00:01:12.479> what<00:01:12.569> I'm<00:01:12.689> talking<00:01:12.719> about<00:01:13.850> as

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
I'll show you what I'm talking about as

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.450 
I'll show you what I'm talking about as
you<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.149> see<00:01:15.590> because<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.039> background

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you can see because of the background

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.730 
you can see because of the background
having<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:18.090> light<00:01:18.509> source<00:01:18.840> built<00:01:19.200> into<00:01:19.649> it

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
having a light source built into it

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.849 
having a light source built into it
basically<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.850> light<00:01:20.999> color<00:01:21.469> we<00:01:22.469> can<00:01:22.649> see

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:22.859 
basically just a light color we can see

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:26.510 
basically just a light color we can see
you<00:01:23.009> through<00:01:23.189> silhouette<00:01:23.700> our<00:01:23.999> people<00:01:25.520> but

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
you through silhouette our people but

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.739 
you through silhouette our people but
what<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.759> that's<00:01:26.999> not<00:01:27.060> what<00:01:27.209> you<00:01:27.389> were<00:01:27.600> looking

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:27.749 
what if that's not what you were looking

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:30.109 
what if that's not what you were looking
for<00:01:27.959> okay<00:01:28.590> there's<00:01:29.100> another<00:01:29.399> way<00:01:29.639> to<00:01:29.700> do<00:01:29.969> it

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
for okay there's another way to do it

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.169 
for okay there's another way to do it
and<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.749> can<00:01:30.899> use<00:01:31.049> fog<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.979> with<00:01:32.189> so

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
and we can use fog to do that with so

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:34.160 
and we can use fog to do that with so
let's<00:01:33.329> go<00:01:33.450> ahead<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.659> turn<00:01:33.840> off<00:01:34.020> for

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
let's go ahead and turn off for

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.699 
let's go ahead and turn off for
background<00:01:34.649> back<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.429> black<00:01:36.380> go<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.439> set

background back to the black go to set
article<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.109> let's<00:01:40.109> just<00:01:40.289> bring<00:01:40.579> simple

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
article and let's just bring simple

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:49.560 
article and let's just bring simple
foggy<00:01:41.819> in<00:01:42.119> here<00:01:44.630> we<00:01:45.630> go

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.260 

now<00:01:50.570> while<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.900> fog<00:01:51.080> loads<00:01:51.970> what<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.090> need<00:01:53.240> to

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
now while the fog loads what you need to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.200

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
realize is with no light source nothing

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.970 
realize is with no light source nothing
can<00:01:56.420> be<00:01:56.600> seen<00:01:56.870> unless<00:01:57.170> something<00:01:57.860> is

can be seen unless something is
highlighting<00:01:58.580> it<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:58.730> that's<00:01:59.420> what<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.720> fog

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
highlighting it and that's what the fog

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.080

gee I'm sorry control gene back and

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.360 
gee I'm sorry control gene back and
forth<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.380> turn<00:02:18.560> learn<00:02:18.740> off<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.980> grid<00:02:19.190> while

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
forth to turn learn off the grid while

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.910 
forth to turn learn off the grid while
you're<00:02:19.520> working<00:02:19.820> with<00:02:20.000> these<00:02:20.740> so<00:02:21.740> I'm<00:02:21.800> going

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
you're working with these so I'm going

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.199 
you're working with these so I'm going
to<00:02:21.950> go<00:02:22.040> ahead<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.250> move<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.670> fog<00:02:22.910> back

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
to go ahead and move the fog back

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.490 
to go ahead and move the fog back
further<00:02:25.510> now<00:02:26.510> let's<00:02:26.720> play<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.050> take<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.230> look

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
further now let's play and take a look

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.540 
further now let's play and take a look
turn<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.520> grid<00:02:28.700> off<00:02:29.980> now<00:02:30.980> they're<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.370> little

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
turn the grid off now they're a little

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.630 
turn the grid off now they're a little
plainer<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.870> people<00:02:33.230> are<00:02:33.440> because<00:02:34.430> the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
plainer the people are because the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.949 
plainer the people are because the
source<00:02:34.880> is<00:02:35.030> behind<00:02:35.330> this<00:02:40.570> now<00:02:41.570> in<00:02:41.690> order<00:02:41.780> to

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
source is behind this now in order to

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.020 
source is behind this now in order to
get<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.140> different<00:02:42.410> look<00:02:42.620> let's<00:02:43.489> go<00:02:43.640> in<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:43.910> use

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
get a different look let's go in and use

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.380 
get a different look let's go in and use
just<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.420> little<00:02:44.660> bit<00:02:44.810> of<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.290> HDR<00:02:45.650> life<00:02:46.390> so

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
just a little bit of the HDR life so

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.160 
just a little bit of the HDR life so
we're<00:02:47.540> going<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.720> go<00:02:47.810> in<00:02:47.930> stage<00:02:48.520> atmosphere

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
we're going to go in stage atmosphere

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.479 
we're going to go in stage atmosphere
and<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:51.290> they<00:02:51.410> don't<00:02:51.560> need<00:02:51.680> any<00:02:51.830> inclusion<00:02:52.400> as

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
and so they don't need any inclusion as

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.759 
and so they don't need any inclusion as
dark<00:02:52.670> as<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:53.030> going<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.330> be<00:02:53.480> turn<00:02:54.080> on<00:02:54.200> HDR

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
dark as this is going to be turn on HDR

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.610 
dark as this is going to be turn on HDR
turn<00:02:55.519> on<00:02:55.670> tone<00:02:55.940> map<00:02:56.239> do<00:02:56.840> not<00:02:56.989> worry<00:02:57.230> about<00:02:57.290> what

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
turn on tone map do not worry about what

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.539 
turn on tone map do not worry about what
tone<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.100> might<00:02:58.400> do<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:59.090> may<00:02:59.900> actually<00:03:00.549> show

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
tone that might do it may actually show

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:02.740 
tone that might do it may actually show
some<00:03:01.700> different<00:03:02.000> colors<00:03:02.269> or<00:03:02.420> some<00:03:02.540> funny

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
some different colors or some funny

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:10.539 
some different colors or some funny
colors<00:03:04.540> now<00:03:05.540> move<00:03:06.350> on<00:03:06.530> down<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:09.340> let's<00:03:10.340> turn

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
colors now move on down and let's turn

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.320 
colors now move on down and let's turn
on<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.760> tune<00:03:11.030> shader<00:03:12.640> use<00:03:13.640> text<00:03:14.000> your<00:03:14.120> color

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
on the tune shader use text your color

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:24.840 
on the tune shader use text your color
and<00:03:17.950> turn<00:03:18.950> both<00:03:19.190> these<00:03:19.370> two<00:03:19.549> black

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.630 

okay<00:03:25.850> now<00:03:26.210> let's<00:03:26.420> see<00:03:26.570> what<00:03:26.690> we<00:03:26.840> have<00:03:30.490> now<00:03:31.490> as

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
okay now let's see what we have now as

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.680 
okay now let's see what we have now as
you<00:03:31.730> can<00:03:31.820> see<00:03:31.880> you're<00:03:32.120> getting<00:03:32.210> kind<00:03:32.480> of<00:03:32.600> a

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
you can see you're getting kind of a

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.200 
you can see you're getting kind of a
stylized<00:03:33.230> look<00:03:33.790> especially<00:03:34.790> with<00:03:35.120> the

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
stylized look especially with the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.100 
stylized look especially with the
cartoon<00:03:35.570> shader<00:03:35.900> added<00:03:37.660> now<00:03:38.660> something<00:03:38.930> else

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
cartoon shader added now something else

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.020 
cartoon shader added now something else
we<00:03:39.320> can<00:03:39.350> do<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:40.430> is<00:03:40.550> just<00:03:40.580> to<00:03:40.790> give<00:03:40.940> you

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
we can do and this is just to give you

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.900 
we can do and this is just to give you
some<00:03:41.090> ideas<00:03:41.630> is<00:03:41.900> use<00:03:42.620> water<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.250> I<00:03:43.490> use<00:03:43.670> water

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
some ideas is use water and I use water

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.790 
some ideas is use water and I use water
and<00:03:44.060> quite<00:03:44.210> a<00:03:44.240> bit<00:03:44.450> of<00:03:44.570> things<00:03:44.780> not<00:03:45.200> just<00:03:45.260> for

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
and quite a bit of things not just for

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.110 
and quite a bit of things not just for
water<00:03:46.100> either<00:03:46.510> but<00:03:47.510> for<00:03:47.960> this<00:03:48.050> one<00:03:48.910> let's<00:03:49.910> go

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
water either but for this one let's go

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.560 
water either but for this one let's go
ahead<00:03:50.240> and<00:03:50.360> look<00:03:50.510> at<00:03:50.630> river<00:03:50.870> flow<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:55.570> while

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
ahead and look at river flow and while

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.680 
ahead and look at river flow and while
it<00:03:56.720> loads<00:03:56.870> you'll<00:03:57.170> notice<00:03:57.530> that<00:03:58.540> every<00:03:59.540> time

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
it loads you'll notice that every time

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.050 
it loads you'll notice that every time
we<00:03:59.810> turn<00:03:59.990> anything<00:04:00.230> on<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.890> has<00:04:01.040> to<00:04:01.190> do<00:04:01.370> with

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
we turn anything on that has to do with

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.820 
we turn anything on that has to do with
anything<00:04:02.300> other<00:04:02.540> than<00:04:02.720> black<00:04:03.050> light<00:04:03.440> source

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
anything other than black light source

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.580 
anything other than black light source
it<00:04:04.100> will<00:04:04.220> show<00:04:04.430> up<00:04:04.459> so<00:04:05.330> what<00:04:05.600> we<00:04:05.750> see<00:04:05.990> here<00:04:06.020> is

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
it will show up so what we see here is

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.220 
it will show up so what we see here is
the<00:04:07.370> actual<00:04:07.700> reflection<00:04:08.030> of<00:04:08.570> the<00:04:08.660> colors<00:04:09.080> of

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
the actual reflection of the colors of

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.320 
the actual reflection of the colors of
the<00:04:09.950> characters<00:04:10.430> even<00:04:10.940> though<00:04:11.030> there's<00:04:11.209> no

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
the characters even though there's no

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:20.229 
the characters even though there's no
light<00:04:11.570> source<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:12.440> show<00:04:12.620> them<00:04:18.970> now<00:04:19.970> this<00:04:20.090> is

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
light source to show them now this is

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.180 
light source to show them now this is
just<00:04:20.269> another<00:04:20.780> different<00:04:21.260> kind<00:04:21.440> of<00:04:21.530> look<00:04:21.769> it

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
just another different kind of look it

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.080 
just another different kind of look it
can<00:04:22.370> be<00:04:22.460> used<00:04:22.610> for<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:22.820> lot<00:04:22.970> of<00:04:23.060> different

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
can be used for a lot of different

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:31.570 
can be used for a lot of different
things<00:04:29.770> now<00:04:30.770> what<00:04:30.919> a<00:04:30.950> lot<00:04:31.100> of<00:04:31.130> people<00:04:31.220> don't

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
things now what a lot of people don't

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.490 
things now what a lot of people don't
realize<00:04:31.940> is<00:04:32.210> that<00:04:32.390> fog<00:04:32.690> is<00:04:32.870> actually<00:04:33.230> a<00:04:33.290> pretty

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
realize is that fog is actually a pretty

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.890 
realize is that fog is actually a pretty
powerful<00:04:33.680> tool<00:04:34.250> in<00:04:34.400> itself<00:04:34.750> what<00:04:35.750> these

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
powerful tool in itself what these

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.540 
powerful tool in itself what these
particle<00:04:36.320> effects<00:04:36.620> are<00:04:36.830> from<00:04:37.040> in<00:04:37.130> most<00:04:37.310> cases

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
particle effects are from in most cases

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.700 
particle effects are from in most cases
are<00:04:37.910> spinning<00:04:38.390> images<00:04:38.840> or<00:04:39.020> things<00:04:39.470> like<00:04:39.560> that

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
are spinning images or things like that

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.980 
are spinning images or things like that
for<00:04:40.100> lack<00:04:40.280> of<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.490> better<00:04:40.520> term<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:41.330> we<00:04:41.840> can

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
for lack of a better term and we can

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.390 
for lack of a better term and we can
always<00:04:42.140> come<00:04:42.440> in<00:04:42.590> with<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.800> particle<00:04:43.250> itself

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
always come in with the particle itself

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.960 
always come in with the particle itself
and<00:04:43.850> make<00:04:44.000> some<00:04:44.150> changes<00:04:44.630> so<00:04:45.820> let's<00:04:46.820> go<00:04:46.940> ahead

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
and make some changes so let's go ahead

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.000 
and make some changes so let's go ahead
and<00:04:47.150> go<00:04:47.330> into<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.660> particle<00:04:50.169> and<00:04:51.169> let's<00:04:51.950> just

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
and go into the particle and let's just

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.180 
and go into the particle and let's just
change<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.430> diffuse<00:04:53.830> for<00:04:54.830> right<00:04:54.979> now<00:04:55.010> we'll

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
change the diffuse for right now we'll

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.590 
change the diffuse for right now we'll
do<00:04:55.460> something<00:04:55.669> very<00:04:55.940> simple<00:04:56.210> we'll<00:04:56.419> just

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
do something very simple we'll just

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.350 
do something very simple we'll just
change<00:04:56.750> it<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.020> red<00:04:58.750> and<00:04:59.979> as<00:05:00.979> you<00:05:01.100> can<00:05:01.250> see<00:05:01.360> you

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
change it to red and as you can see you

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.360 
change it to red and as you can see you
get<00:05:02.510> a<00:05:02.540> red<00:05:02.720> solid<00:05:02.960> background<00:05:03.370> bowling

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
get a red solid background bowling

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.290 
get a red solid background bowling
around

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.460 

now<00:05:11.300> let's<00:05:11.480> go<00:05:11.600> back<00:05:11.780> to<00:05:11.810> our<00:05:11.960> atmosphere

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
now let's go back to our atmosphere

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.520 
now let's go back to our atmosphere
let's<00:05:12.710> turn<00:05:12.889> off<00:05:12.920> our<00:05:13.389> tune<00:05:14.389> shader<00:05:16.030> and<00:05:17.530> we

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
let's turn off our tune shader and we

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.800 
let's turn off our tune shader and we
have<00:05:18.710> basically<00:05:19.160> the<00:05:19.760> same<00:05:19.970> thing<00:05:20.030> with<00:05:20.780> a

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
have basically the same thing with a

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.830 
have basically the same thing with a
sharper<00:05:21.260> image<00:05:23.470> and<00:05:25.450> again<00:05:26.450> what<00:05:26.630> a<00:05:26.660> lot<00:05:26.810> of

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
sharper image and again what a lot of

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.140 
sharper image and again what a lot of
people<00:05:26.930> don't<00:05:27.350> realize<00:05:27.770> is<00:05:28.070> what<00:05:28.880> you<00:05:29.030> can

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
people don't realize is what you can

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.690 
people don't realize is what you can
actually<00:05:29.330> do<00:05:29.690> with<00:05:29.930> article<00:05:30.560> you<00:05:31.520> can

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
actually do with article you can

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.070 
actually do with article you can
substitute<00:05:32.060> almost<00:05:32.660> any<00:05:32.840> image<00:05:34.840> that's<00:05:35.840> out

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
substitute almost any image that's out

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.440 
substitute almost any image that's out
there<00:05:36.320> for<00:05:36.500> this<00:05:36.560> particle<00:05:39.669> and<00:05:40.669> get<00:05:41.060> varying

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
there for this particle and get varying

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.220 
there for this particle and get varying
effects<00:05:42.760> depending<00:05:43.760> on<00:05:43.910> how<00:05:44.600> you<00:05:44.660> set<00:05:44.810> it<00:05:45.110> up

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
effects depending on how you set it up

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:54.780 
effects depending on how you set it up
and<00:05:45.380> what<00:05:45.530> lighting<00:05:45.890> what<00:05:46.010> atmosphere<00:05:46.640> using

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:04.860 

so<00:05:55.790> we'll<00:05:56.000> go<00:05:56.150> back<00:05:58.450> turn<00:05:59.450> off<00:05:59.630> tone<00:05:59.930> map<00:06:03.430> and

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
so we'll go back turn off tone map and

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.210 
so we'll go back turn off tone map and
this<00:06:05.870> will<00:06:06.020> give<00:06:06.050> you<00:06:06.290> an<00:06:06.380> idea<00:06:06.500> what<00:06:06.950> it<00:06:07.040> looks

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
this will give you an idea what it looks

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.060 
this will give you an idea what it looks
like<00:06:07.430> without<00:06:08.120> such<00:06:08.510> dramatic<00:06:08.960> lighting<00:06:12.070> now

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
like without such dramatic lighting now

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.560 
like without such dramatic lighting now
to<00:06:13.130> show<00:06:13.400> you<00:06:13.460> what<00:06:13.669> this<00:06:13.820> file<00:06:14.060> can<00:06:14.210> really<00:06:14.450> do

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
to show you what this file can really do

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.000 
to show you what this file can really do
I'm<00:06:14.810> going<00:06:14.990> to<00:06:15.050> grab<00:06:15.169> it<00:06:15.260> again<00:06:15.590> and<00:06:15.740> bring<00:06:15.890> it

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
I'm going to grab it again and bring it

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.250 
I'm going to grab it again and bring it
forward<00:06:16.040> and<00:06:16.700> of<00:06:17.210> course<00:06:17.270> to<00:06:17.479> see<00:06:17.780> your<00:06:17.960> fog

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
forward and of course to see your fog

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.219 
forward and of course to see your fog
you<00:06:19.040> can<00:06:19.190> always<00:06:19.450> turn<00:06:20.450> on<00:06:20.630> the<00:06:20.750> boundaries

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
you can always turn on the boundaries

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.690 
you can always turn on the boundaries
and<00:06:22.000> you<00:06:23.000> adjust<00:06:23.390> those<00:06:23.570> boundaries<00:06:24.700> right

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
and you adjust those boundaries right

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.940 
and you adjust those boundaries right
here<00:06:25.880> in<00:06:25.970> your<00:06:26.090> mid<00:06:26.270> volume<00:06:26.680> but<00:06:27.680> this<00:06:27.830> will

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
here in your mid volume but this will

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.620 
here in your mid volume but this will
work<00:06:28.070> for<00:06:28.130> what<00:06:28.490> we<00:06:28.610> need<00:06:28.789> for<00:06:28.940> right<00:06:29.150> now<00:06:29.180> so

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
work for what we need for right now so

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.690 
work for what we need for right now so
I'm<00:06:30.410> going<00:06:30.560> to<00:06:30.620> bring<00:06:30.740> this<00:06:30.860> fog<00:06:31.100> forward<00:06:31.550> so

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700 
I'm going to bring this fog forward so

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.480 
I'm going to bring this fog forward so
it's<00:06:31.820> more<00:06:32.000> prevalent<00:06:33.190> and<00:06:34.190> we're<00:06:34.340> just<00:06:34.400> going

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
it's more prevalent and we're just going

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.750 
it's more prevalent and we're just going
to<00:06:34.669> play<00:06:35.620> it<00:06:36.620> takes<00:06:36.830> a<00:06:36.950> lot<00:06:37.100> for<00:06:37.250> this<00:06:37.340> fog<00:06:37.610> to

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
to play it takes a lot for this fog to

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.000 
to play it takes a lot for this fog to
spin<00:06:38.030> out<00:06:40.930> now<00:06:41.930> that's<00:06:42.110> just<00:06:42.260> changing<00:06:42.740> out<00:06:42.830> an

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
spin out now that's just changing out an

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.700 
spin out now that's just changing out an
image

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.800 

and<00:06:47.710> actually<00:06:47.950> we<00:06:48.220> need<00:06:48.370> to<00:06:48.520> bring<00:06:49.390> it<00:06:49.540> up<00:06:49.630> just

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810 
and actually we need to bring it up just

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.670 
and actually we need to bring it up just
a<00:06:50.020> little<00:06:50.170> closer<00:06:50.440> so<00:06:51.900> we<00:06:52.900> can<00:06:53.140> see<00:06:53.380> a<00:06:53.410> little

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
a little closer so we can see a little

00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:05.220 
a little closer so we can see a little
better<00:07:03.330> now<00:07:04.330> if<00:07:04.450> you<00:07:04.570> want<00:07:04.780> it<00:07:04.840> again<00:07:05.050> just

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
better now if you want it again just

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.840 
better now if you want it again just
read<00:07:05.470> fog<00:07:05.740> you<00:07:06.040> just<00:07:06.250> go<00:07:06.340> ahead<00:07:06.400> and<00:07:06.490> change<00:07:06.640> it

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
read fog you just go ahead and change it

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.180 
read fog you just go ahead and change it
to<00:07:07.000> a<00:07:07.030> solid<00:07:07.240> red<00:07:07.480> color<00:07:07.950> probably<00:07:08.950> would<00:07:09.070> be

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190 
to a solid red color probably would be

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.730 
to a solid red color probably would be
best<00:07:09.430> to<00:07:09.580> use<00:07:09.760> a<00:07:09.790> gradient<00:07:10.330> ramp<00:07:10.560> something<00:07:11.560> a

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:11.740 
best to use a gradient ramp something a

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.740 
best to use a gradient ramp something a
gradient<00:07:12.130> image<00:07:12.280> that<00:07:13.030> would<00:07:13.180> go<00:07:13.360> from<00:07:13.690> a

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
gradient image that would go from a

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.110 
gradient image that would go from a
great<00:07:14.170> read<00:07:14.440> to<00:07:14.890> say<00:07:15.190> a<00:07:15.220> light<00:07:15.460> orange<00:07:15.730> or

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 
great read to say a light orange or

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.900 
great read to say a light orange or
something<00:07:16.420> in<00:07:16.510> that<00:07:16.540> color<00:07:17.700> but<00:07:18.700> i<00:07:18.730> hope<00:07:18.880> this

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:18.910 
something in that color but i hope this

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.540 
something in that color but i hope this
just<00:07:19.270> gives<00:07:19.420> you<00:07:19.540> an<00:07:19.660> idea<00:07:19.750> of<00:07:20.260> how<00:07:21.220> doing

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550 
just gives you an idea of how doing

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.130 
just gives you an idea of how doing
simple<00:07:21.910> things<00:07:21.970> can<00:07:22.600> make<00:07:22.750> something<00:07:23.020> look

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.140 
simple things can make something look

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.710 
simple things can make something look
totally<00:07:23.380> different
