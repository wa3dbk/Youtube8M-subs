00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.890
 what you have just seen 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.140
 graphics cards worth 2200 euro 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.020
 we have the launch of the geforce 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.029
 gtx 780 taken to the occasion 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.390
 Here is a very special quad sli 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.310
 here are all graphics cards 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.619
 to see the title cooler 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.870
 Nurse is this beautiful design in the 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.400
 black cromm plexiglas look and yes we 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.489
 have you been chronologically rude 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.590
 sorted by date of appearance 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.270
 the reference designs are the deep ones 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:51.469
 going out x770 the dtx shared 67 80 and 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.390
 the 87 which is brand new and yes pure 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.359
 outwardly, only the whole falls 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.510
 new gtx 780 ti on the nvidia here 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:02.899
 bit yes the gloomy can aspire 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.540
 because on the plexiglas that look up 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.190
 releasing the aluminum lamella is one 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.400
 attached dark film and also the 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.000
 The lettering of the 780 ci is new 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.340
 black that is the only one 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.799
 difference between the 78th 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.930
 So the cooler and the previous cards 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:25.670
 on titan cooler base because the cvp 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.040
 has remained the same graphics card 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.689
 So the new gtx 780 kg has 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.090
 a tdp of 250 watts 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:36.350
 just like the GTX 480 and the times 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.049
 Only the GTX 770 count three applications 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.409
 of useful 230 watts and stays that way 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.979
 slightly cooler and quieter turn the 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.979
 take a look around 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:58.350
 what strikes both the gtx 770 as well 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:00.210
 also the gtx 780 and the 780 ci feature 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.100
 all over a memory on the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.369
 back 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.310
 only the gtx times contributes for this 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.140
 back still a whopping 3 gigabytes more 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.280
 memory so there is a piece of page 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.280
 and on the side 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.870
 yes, that's the biggest one 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.230
 Distinctive feature if you have the 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.300
 coolers have dismounted these cards 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.460
 nvidia states that the gtx times 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.890
 continues to exist in contrast 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.570
 to the 87th 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.970
 which only gamer responds asks the titan 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.340
 Benefits like the high case in between 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.570
 performance and six gigabytes of memory now 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.280
 the 64 GB memory is of course too 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.530
 interesting for players that if we 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.020
 test the gtü makes itself more accurate 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.000
 see if this graphics card opposite 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.880
 currently disadvantages we expect that 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.810
 especially in the area of ​​gaming klotz 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.910
 text etc 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.290
 yes yes the whole new one has to go now 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.560
 then install it with wax 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.560
 do 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.880
 benchmarks done and have to say a lot 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.870
 fast and relatively quiet , especially 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.709
 have watched this video and it now 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.580
 read in the test 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.580
 90
