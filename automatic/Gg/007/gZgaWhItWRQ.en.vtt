00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.869
 Now the hot phase is starting 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.000
 get 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.760
 I thought but now home cooking 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.820
 offices what new fiver chain two strikers 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.180

 mehdi ben attia 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:51.629
 the reporting and the last in 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:55.379
 defender is the victim as rv 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.510
 Let's play a silver player and 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.340
 Although the estrada I hope so 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.610

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:10.020

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.939
 time for the brother penner in the game 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.619
 By the way, that means roulette on sand 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.799
 I think it's really cool 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.340
 abstained from taking up or of course 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.680
 not so blatant but you see the brain in the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.820
 team again we have a gold player 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:34.680
 with the good wayne rooney the first st 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.439
 is the brother danijel saric and the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.229
 second voice is a silver voice and 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.229
 that's the good gabby gabriel 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.670
 agbonlahor and now let the tens 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.670
 unfortunately and me afterwards again 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:00.729
 kevin bacon next ii 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.370
 problems 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.049
 problems 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.329
 lehmann 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.890
 Armenia 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.890
 more 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.860
 You've seen her right again 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.530
 cool goals have been there and this team 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.140
 I do not make a mistake 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.000
 I thought that's what problems horny 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.320
 new works of film I have never 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.260
 played again 15 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.440
 even this sound like a noise again 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.570
 I have never played rooney and 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.480
 or sokrates or so i can 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.000
 not one and have me something and so 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.100
 where she builds at all surprised 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.720
 the team plays with it and you 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.480
 You will also be surprised in-house because that 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.670
 is abnormal hammer on the offensive 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.020
 just like 100 defensive and the most 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.020
 surprised the two have me ye 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.910
 clearly the three of them one can 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.020
 that's what anglers expect, too 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.090
 if a 73 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.730
 you know him from the other old ones 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.950
 he was already quite op and 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.300
 also in this part is pretty much op 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.340
 but we have the two right here 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.320
 both defensive and offensive 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.520
 to work with forward 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.290
 incorporated and are now the 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.060
 the size of the disadvantage but the knowledge 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.220
 otherwise it is really solid 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.180
 and five-chain can be really strong 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.830
 especially if you are still up 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.110
 offensively poses or something similar in the game 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.550
 then you always come one always has 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.930
 such a mix between offensive and 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.150
 defensive and that always fits and goes 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.970
 is still one of the back there 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.070
 even clear everything if one faster 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.070
 is brought so and overall I give 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.230
 the team a 98 out of ten the only one 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.700
 was 9 8 and 10 of 10 is easy 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.970
 that know the truth are small like 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.799
 the two zdf zm position but well 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.780
 otherwise there is not really a drawback 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.320
 otherwise you could still with ten out of ten 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.150
 go 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.890
 yes I hope you liked again 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.630
 leave rating there and I thank you 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.790
 still for the very small support on 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.020
 a video and see you next 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.020
 video three and four
