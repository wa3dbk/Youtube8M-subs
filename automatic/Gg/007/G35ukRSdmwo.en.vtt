beach cruiser and of course this machine

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.139 
beach cruiser and of course this machine
is<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> rocket<00:00:32.309> ship<00:00:32.340> compared<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.000> that

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
is like a rocket ship compared to that

what I found is they have created a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.520 
what I found is they have created a
perfect<00:00:35.760> bike<00:00:36.000> sprinting<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.110> what<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.290> love

saddle<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.689> bottom<00:01:40.020> bracket<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.439> incredibly

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
saddle the bottom bracket is incredibly

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.069 
saddle the bottom bracket is incredibly
stiff<00:01:41.280> now<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.729> way<00:01:41.939> Jamis<00:01:42.509> does<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.930> is

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
stiff now the way Jamis does this is

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.020 
stiff now the way Jamis does this is
they<00:01:43.200> use<00:01:43.350> three<00:01:43.710> different<00:01:43.740> diameter<00:01:44.700> tubes

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
they use three different diameter tubes

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.760 
they use three different diameter tubes
depending<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.899> what<00:01:46.110> size<00:01:46.320> frames<00:01:46.619> that

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
depending on what size frames that

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.440 
depending on what size frames that
they're<00:01:46.920> making<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.430> way<00:01:47.970> they<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.329> keep
