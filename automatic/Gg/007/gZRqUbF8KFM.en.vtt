00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.320 

okay<00:00:01.829> I've<00:00:01.920> reworked<00:00:02.250> my<00:00:02.429> snake<00:00:02.730> puppet<00:00:03.120> thing

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
okay I've reworked my snake puppet thing

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.210 
okay I've reworked my snake puppet thing
again<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:04.080> went<00:00:04.259> back<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.710> original

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
again and I went back to the original

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.490 
again and I went back to the original
and<00:00:05.460> what<00:00:06.180> I<00:00:06.240> did<00:00:06.420> was<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.660> drop<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.930> hole<00:00:07.170> through

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
and what I did was I drop a hole through

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.100 
and what I did was I drop a hole through
here<00:00:07.710> so<00:00:07.859> this<00:00:07.980> sticks<00:00:08.340> can<00:00:08.550> flop<00:00:08.880> around<00:00:09.110> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
here so this sticks can flop around the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.860 
here so this sticks can flop around the
bottom<00:00:10.530> one<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:11.309> originally<00:00:12.120> drill<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.690> hole

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
bottom one I originally drill the hole

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.419 
bottom one I originally drill the hole
but<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.110> didn't<00:00:13.320> like<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.469> so<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:13.860> think<00:00:13.920> put<00:00:14.340> it

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
but I didn't like it so I think put it

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.420 
but I didn't like it so I think put it
back<00:00:14.639> kind<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.179> way<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.480> was<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:16.279> think<00:00:17.279> this

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
back kind of the way it was I think this

00:00:17.430 --> 00:01:12.840 
back kind of the way it was I think this
will<00:00:17.609> work<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.330> tested<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:18.930> yet

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.150 

oh<00:01:14.110> yeah<00:01:15.110> I<00:01:15.140> can<00:01:15.410> see<00:01:15.560> where<00:01:15.710> I<00:01:15.740> can<00:01:15.979> make<00:01:16.130> that

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
oh yeah I can see where I can make that

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.760 
oh yeah I can see where I can make that
work<00:01:16.540> my<00:01:17.540> string<00:01:17.840> down<00:01:18.020> at<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.200> bottom<00:01:18.380> I've

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
work my string down at the bottom I've

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.850 
work my string down at the bottom I've
got<00:01:19.040> a<00:01:19.070> I've<00:01:19.460> got<00:01:20.450> a<00:01:20.600> little<00:01:20.750> wire<00:01:21.080> attachment

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
got a I've got a little wire attachment

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.880 
got a I've got a little wire attachment
on<00:01:21.950> here<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:23.030> hold<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.420> string<00:01:23.720> at<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.500> right

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
on here to hold the string at the right

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.770 
on here to hold the string at the right
height<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:26.229> it<00:01:27.229> just<00:01:27.560> slipped<00:01:27.740> a<00:01:28.130> little<00:01:28.160> bit

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
height and it just slipped a little bit

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.749 
height and it just slipped a little bit
but<00:01:29.780> I<00:01:29.840> think<00:01:30.200> that's<00:01:31.190> a<00:01:31.280> pretty<00:01:31.460> easy

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
but I think that's a pretty easy

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.389 
but I think that's a pretty easy
adjustment<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.509> make<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.920> think<00:01:34.130> was<00:01:34.250> like

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
adjustment to make and I think was like

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.880 
adjustment to make and I think was like
it<00:01:34.550> is<00:01:34.700> perfected<00:01:35.410> it's<00:01:36.410> going<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.590> be<00:01:36.680> right

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
it is perfected it's going to be right

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.520 
it is perfected it's going to be right
