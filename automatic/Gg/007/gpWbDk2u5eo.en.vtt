00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.800 
getting this is because i wish to do
some<00:03:12.470> penetration<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:14.389> deformation<00:03:15.389> tests

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
some penetration and deformation tests

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.240 
some penetration and deformation tests
on<00:03:16.709> some<00:03:17.129> pellets<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.739> essentially

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
on some pellets and this is essentially

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.619 
on some pellets and this is essentially
the<00:03:23.370> same<00:03:23.579> type<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:23.940> clay<00:03:24.299> if<00:03:24.480> i'm<00:03:24.599> not

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
the same type of clay if i'm not

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.229 
the same type of clay if i'm not
mistaken<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:25.349> we<00:03:25.650> used<00:03:25.859> to<00:03:26.069> use<00:03:26.310> way<00:03:26.669> back

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
mistaken that we used to use way back

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.509 
mistaken that we used to use way back
when<00:03:27.480> when<00:03:27.780> we<00:03:27.930> were<00:03:28.049> in<00:03:28.379> grade<00:03:28.709> school<00:03:29.250> or

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
when when we were in grade school or

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.759 
when when we were in grade school or
elementary<00:03:29.819> school<00:03:30.449> or<00:03:31.349> whatever<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.739> like

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
elementary school or whatever you like

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.009 
elementary school or whatever you like
to<00:03:31.919> refer<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.489> as<00:03:35.209> if<00:03:36.209> it's<00:03:36.419> not<00:03:36.599> the<00:03:36.780> same

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
to refer to it as if it's not the same

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:50.760 
to refer to it as if it's not the same
it's<00:03:37.349> very<00:03:37.680> similar<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.340> it

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.070 

okay<00:03:51.770> and<00:03:52.160> as<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.430> said<00:03:52.489> I'm<00:03:53.390> gonna<00:03:53.599> do<00:03:53.870> this

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
okay and as I said I'm gonna do this

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.860 
okay and as I said I'm gonna do this
when<00:03:54.530> I'm<00:03:54.680> purchasing<00:03:55.160> this<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:56.120> try<00:03:56.420> out<00:03:56.599> for

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
when I'm purchasing this to try out for

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.589 
when I'm purchasing this to try out for
use<00:03:57.080> with<00:03:57.349> some<00:03:57.680> ballistic<00:03:58.489> testing<00:03:58.879> for

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
use with some ballistic testing for

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.190 
use with some ballistic testing for
penetration<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:00.980> deformation<00:04:01.959> on<00:04:02.959> some

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
penetration and deformation on some

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.309 
penetration and deformation on some
pellets<00:04:04.269> alright<00:04:05.269> if<00:04:05.569> you<00:04:05.720> guys<00:04:05.750> have<00:04:06.170> ever

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
pellets alright if you guys have ever

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.800 
pellets alright if you guys have ever
used<00:04:06.650> this<00:04:06.860> ballistic<00:04:07.730> clay<00:04:07.910> or<00:04:08.209> any<00:04:08.390> modeling

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
used this ballistic clay or any modeling

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.650 
used this ballistic clay or any modeling
clay<00:04:09.519> for<00:04:10.519> ballistics<00:04:10.970> testing<00:04:11.330> I<00:04:11.510> would

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
clay for ballistics testing I would

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.940 
clay for ballistics testing I would
definitely<00:04:12.019> love<00:04:12.170> to<00:04:12.230> hear<00:04:12.560> about<00:04:12.650> your

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
definitely love to hear about your

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.009 
definitely love to hear about your
experiences<00:04:13.550> or<00:04:13.940> if<00:04:14.269> you<00:04:14.360> have<00:04:14.510> any<00:04:14.690> videos

experiences or if you have any videos

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.370 
experiences or if you have any videos
you<00:04:15.349> can<00:04:15.970> steer<00:04:16.970> me<00:04:17.209> in<00:04:17.419> the<00:04:17.510> right<00:04:17.660> direction

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.990 

cuz<00:04:21.380> I<00:04:21.440> remember<00:04:21.500> back<00:04:21.859> in<00:04:21.889> the<00:04:22.070> day<00:04:22.340> when<00:04:22.760> they

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
cuz I remember back in the day when they

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.090 
cuz I remember back in the day when they
used<00:04:23.210> to<00:04:23.419> nice<00:04:23.930> to<00:04:23.990> get<00:04:24.200> a<00:04:24.260> lot<00:04:24.440> of<00:04:24.590> gun

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
used to nice to get a lot of gun

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.969 
used to nice to get a lot of gun
magazines<00:04:25.610> and<00:04:25.820> stuff<00:04:26.169> before<00:04:27.169> ballistic

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
magazines and stuff before ballistic

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.330 
magazines and stuff before ballistic
gels<00:04:28.310> they<00:04:28.910> were<00:04:29.030> always<00:04:29.240> using<00:04:29.870> clay<00:04:30.380> they

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
gels they were always using clay they

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.480 
gels they were always using clay they
would<00:04:31.850> have<00:04:32.030> huge<00:04:32.810> chunks<00:04:33.380> of<00:04:33.470> clay<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.950> mean

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
would have huge chunks of clay I mean

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.110 
would have huge chunks of clay I mean
big<00:04:34.790> chunks<00:04:35.210> of<00:04:35.270> clay<00:04:35.419> and<00:04:36.340> shoot<00:04:37.340> those<00:04:37.610> and

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
big chunks of clay and shoot those and

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.840 
big chunks of clay and shoot those and
recover<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.780> bullets<00:04:39.080> and<00:04:39.440> I<00:04:39.770> think<00:04:40.610> that<00:04:40.729> was

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
recover the bullets and I think that was

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.840 
recover the bullets and I think that was
probably<00:04:41.030> back<00:04:41.630> in<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.960> 70s<00:04:42.919> and<00:04:43.130> early<00:04:43.280> 80s

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
probably back in the 70s and early 80s

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.590 
probably back in the 70s and early 80s
and<00:04:44.750> that<00:04:45.050> was<00:04:45.200> pretty<00:04:45.410> much<00:04:45.560> what<00:04:45.740> they<00:04:45.830> used

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
and that was pretty much what they used

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.390 
and that was pretty much what they used
alright<00:04:47.600> as<00:04:47.900> I<00:04:48.020> said<00:04:48.260> questions<00:04:49.010> comments

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
alright as I said questions comments
