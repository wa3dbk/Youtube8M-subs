00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 today 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.240
 took the opportunity to see how many times 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.240
 they have shot both teams 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.190
 muntari 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.470
 and manages to cut the play ends of 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.240
 volley 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.240
 stoner that will take the milan 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.510
 I could not have topped it better but the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.510
 goalkeeper has not stayed still 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.710
 a partner opens up and can receive 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.520
 Well we got to rest 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.760
 match with the result glasses tie to 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.409
 zero is hard to believe one of the two 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.540
 teams is dominating with certain 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.560
 clarity but my friend so that the 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.560
 scoreboard is not 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.340
 the match resumes in this second 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.380
 half this has already begun 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.009
 and retrieves the ball the play has been 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.009
 very short 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.780
 and see a good time 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.130
 I will never do 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.680
 the round cannon 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.680
 the cake 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.280
 in the milan 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.660
 and then they are coming out hot are the 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.660
 only ones that go for the game 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.020
 his partner goes up looking for space 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.060
 free 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.060
 this move can be important 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.810
 let's see where that ball falls 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.240
 is a partner for madrid 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.680
 the technician puts all the meat in the 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.260
 grill with these two new 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.260
 additions as you see it from here 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.300
 the list for table now perfectly 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.670
 that shot well is going to control the 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.500
 game 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.190
 the referee interrupts the play by 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.190
 out of the game 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:05.140
 sergio ramos- with the ball 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.140
 and Maria with the ball 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.730
 to look for one of those dangers are 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.730
 area centers 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.110
 will have to see it repeated has been seen by 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.610
 written ruiz is never easy for the 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.319
 referee and they deserve the benefit of the 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.060
 doubt but the repetition shows 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.540
 clearly that he has accepted well for the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.000
 time is Christian ronaldo tried it 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.549
 without luck the goalkeeper was very 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.220
 Attentive to this lad to this Portuguese 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.470
 He likes to surprise the opponent from afar if 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.739
 the defenses continue to allow only 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.090
 take care of your hand they have to prevent you from 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.709
 any coast to try again 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.709
 because this guy does not forgive
