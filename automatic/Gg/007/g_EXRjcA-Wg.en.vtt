00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.410
 is life 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.070
 the worker leaves home 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.070
 he leaves the affiliate start to emerge 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.889
 other workers also expect the monkey to the difficult service 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:14.559
 the ones in the white shirt 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.480
 how many of striped shirt 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.570
 They want the same thing. 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.529
 It's 7 o'clock duty 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.999
 the boss of white shirts if we lose our white shirt for luck 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.829
 I did not imagine such dedication 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.400
 the error of another's life 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.940
 the city itself 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.530
 employed worker davis servise emis 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.790
 and that's enough 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.570
 1 to 0 corinthians before going to the menu there 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.649
 but the saints also 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.820
 as he had to win anyway so he does not have to win 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.880
 any way I do not have to play that we win 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.460
 frank williams permanent ban as 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.379
 geilson perceived and managed is the draw the santista the world 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.150
 but it's only the beginning know that employee asked 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.180
 with the solution 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.780
 now have rl that he receives from rosinei 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.370
 he therefore 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.370
 no tiebreaker 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.380
 a normal result for a classic work day 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.930
 but the warmth of São Paulo on Sunday of the sun and the open possibilities make it clear 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.340
 And that's not all 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.730
 when he got up unnoticed 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.460
 and successful 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.810
 but as the scoreboard 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.429
 It's enough, the saints still have a way. 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.600
 I prefer to work with 45 minutes plus legal additions 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.850
 no santa cruz 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.880
 before there is nothing left 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.880
 because the second time starts 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.540
 without rogério 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.060
 expelled trying to stop the running of tévez 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.810
 including Egypt 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.189
 imagine with ten 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.830
 and even more fire 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.719
 where are they 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.460
 he realizes again 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.050
 must be carried out 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.050
 a throw is in an erratic position 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:12.739
 little advance 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.249
 Okay, confirmed. 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:15.649
 the live score 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:17.330
 three times we lose 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.159
 4 to 1 Corinthians Lorena has been delaying 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.159
 because when we are out of the classroom dilma 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.349
 so paulo 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:28.969
 done result 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.969
 the standard worker asks to leave early from work 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.639
 to mention that it resends 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:39.409
 in the third set 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.559
 do the third 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.879
 pedro proença that he produced the prolific author of the study 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.710
 only out of despair of the saints 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.710
 There's still more play, I get it. 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.559
 last month 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:56.369
 this phase 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:59.369
 a full hand is gone 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.209
 the penalty was finally taken 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:05.949
 marcelo mattos 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.949
 but the seventh 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.859
 I remember having taken so many goals in a single game 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.139
 played for the club 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:16.359
 in commerce 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.069
 a historical score an unforgettable afternoon 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.129
 the biggest rout of the Brazilian championship so far seven goals for the Corinthians 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.379
 six points difference from the second placed to five rounds of the 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.209
 It is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine another Brazilian champion 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.439
 do not be the corinthians even though the goal players have not yet 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.339
 internally it counts 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:42.699
 so young people try to finish the championship in 15 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.429
 to mislead the press 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:47.899
 we do not have to be afraid to head in the place and know that we have gained nothing 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:49.749
 rally champion 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:52.789
 looking for the parish who will be the champion 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:56.009
 For me, but you have to keep this handful of relatives 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.399
 and then the santos maicon good for mexico 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:04.139
 in the Mexican capital the corinthians will decide a place in the semifinals of the cup 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.379
 South American vs Cougars 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.980
 and needs only a draw because of a 2-1 win in the first game 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.540
 in São Paulo more this time may not be so easy beyond the two thousand and six hundred 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.410
 meters of altitude of the city of mexico the games marathon made the technician 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.280
 antônio lopes to save some holders as marcelo mattos and you and the 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.409
 attacker nilmar is not subscribed to this competition carlitos tevez se 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.349
 presents to the Argentine national team and enjoyed merit the Brazilian national team 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.349
 Now it's time to give us a snack. 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.229
 names as players play well 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.449
 was terrible and rhythm of play also as the Corinthians travels with 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.590
 only 17 players 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.620
 will miss one on the reservation bank but will not lack confidence 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.370
 You are a fan of the sport globe. 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.580
 the boca juniors six days later we saw 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.380
 yesterday's goals
