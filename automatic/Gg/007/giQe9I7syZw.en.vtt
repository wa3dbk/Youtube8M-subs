to<00:00:29.039> emphasize<00:00:29.519> three<00:00:29.880> things<00:00:30.349> exfoliation<00:00:31.349> is

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
to emphasize three things exfoliation is

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.310 
to emphasize three things exfoliation is
a<00:00:31.710> must<00:00:32.070> because<00:00:32.550> if<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.870> don't<00:00:34.050> exfoliate

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
a must because if you don't exfoliate

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.410 
a must because if you don't exfoliate
your<00:00:34.650> skin<00:00:34.710> all<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.520> cells<00:00:35.820> are<00:00:36.030> blocking

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
your skin all that cells are blocking

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.370 
your skin all that cells are blocking
the<00:00:37.140> pores<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.740> no<00:00:37.950> product<00:00:38.400> can<00:00:38.550> enter<00:00:38.970> and

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
the pores and no product can enter and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.030 
the pores and no product can enter and
besides<00:00:40.380> exfoliation<00:00:41.070> will<00:00:41.900> promote<00:00:42.900> you<00:00:43.800> our

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
besides exfoliation will promote you our

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.770 
besides exfoliation will promote you our
own<00:00:44.400> collagen<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.210> will<00:00:45.390> promote<00:00:45.600> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
own collagen it will promote a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.590 
own collagen it will promote a
stimulation<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.710> your<00:00:46.860> own<00:00:46.980> collagen

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
stimulation of your own collagen

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.380 
stimulation of your own collagen
hydration<00:00:48.600> without<00:00:48.870> hydration<00:00:50.180> let's<00:00:51.180> say

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
hydration without hydration let's say

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.860 
hydration without hydration let's say
this<00:00:52.070> dehydration<00:00:53.070> equals<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.730> sulk<00:00:54.060> wrinkled

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
this dehydration equals to sulk wrinkled

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.160 
this dehydration equals to sulk wrinkled
skin<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.400> if<00:00:57.150> you<00:00:57.330> don't<00:00:57.510> hydrate<00:00:57.780> your

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
skin and so if you don't hydrate your

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.100 
skin and so if you don't hydrate your
body<00:00:58.230> from<00:00:59.060> inside<00:01:00.060> and<00:01:01.610> externally<00:01:03.110> you're

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
body from inside and externally you're

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.070 
body from inside and externally you're
going<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.800> suffer<00:01:05.309> with<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> results<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
going to suffer with the results of a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.400 
going to suffer with the results of a
saggy<00:01:07.410> skin<00:01:07.800> because<00:01:08.780> what<00:01:09.780> happened<00:01:10.230> is<00:01:10.380> that

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
saggy skin because what happened is that

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.400 
saggy skin because what happened is that
dehydration<00:01:10.830> will<00:01:11.700> cause<00:01:12.120> the<00:01:12.840> collagen

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
dehydration will cause the collagen

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.280 
dehydration will cause the collagen
fibers<00:01:13.440> to<00:01:14.250> become<00:01:14.670> riddled<00:01:15.210> breakdown<00:01:15.870> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
fibers to become riddled breakdown and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.760 
fibers to become riddled breakdown and
then<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.640> result<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.240> sagged<00:01:18.630> wrinkled<00:01:19.409> skin

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
then the result is sagged wrinkled skin

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.760 
then the result is sagged wrinkled skin
and<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:21.150> nutrition<00:01:21.750> nutrition<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.500> very

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
and the nutrition nutrition is very

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.790 
and the nutrition nutrition is very
important<00:01:23.430> because<00:01:23.940> our<00:01:24.510> bodies<00:01:25.260> is<00:01:25.409> made<00:01:25.620> out
