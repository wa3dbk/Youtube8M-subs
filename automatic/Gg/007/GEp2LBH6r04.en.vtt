my<00:00:36.210> gun<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.540> removable<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.380> we're<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.680> be

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
my gun is removable so we're going to be

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.639 
my gun is removable so we're going to be
taking<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.219> off<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:39.050> putting<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.170> back<00:00:40.200> on

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
taking that off and putting it back on

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.790 
taking that off and putting it back on
later<00:00:41.309> after<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.879> put<00:00:42.059> some<00:00:42.210> more<00:00:42.390> paint<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.750> it

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.279 

okay<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.010> first<00:00:47.539> step<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.750> very<00:00:48.780> subtle

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
okay the first step is very subtle

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.010 
okay the first step is very subtle
you're<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.489> want<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> use<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.570> bit<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
you're going to want to use a bit of

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.310 
you're going to want to use a bit of
vulgar<00:00:52.860> metal<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.579> dry<00:00:54.510> brush<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.899> over<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
vulgar metal and dry brush it over the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
vulgar metal and dry brush it over the
spine<00:00:55.770> at<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.010> back<00:00:57.649> so<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.680> don't<00:00:58.800> get<00:00:59.100> any

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
spine at the back so you don't get any

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.920 
spine at the back so you don't get any
of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> indentations<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.629> still<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
of the indentations but you still get a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.500 
of the indentations but you still get a
nice<00:01:01.140> metallic<00:01:01.530> look<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.250> do<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> same<00:01:03.239> thing

want to know how big this actually is
here<00:06:55.560> is<00:06:55.680> a<00:06:55.710> look<00:06:55.919> at<00:06:56.159> the<00:06:56.370> standard<00:06:56.879> warrior

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
here is a look at the standard warrior

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.320 
here is a look at the standard warrior
areas<00:06:58.500> next<00:06:59.099> to<00:06:59.279> the<00:06:59.550> stalker<00:06:59.759> which<00:07:00.120> is

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
areas next to the stalker which is

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.540 
areas next to the stalker which is
pretty<00:07:00.629> massive<00:07:01.020> and<00:07:01.469> they'll<00:07:02.339> see

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
pretty massive and they'll see

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.490 
pretty massive and they'll see
annihilation<00:07:03.149> bars<00:07:03.330> next<00:07:03.599> to<00:07:03.899> give<00:07:04.050> you<00:07:04.139> a<00:07:04.259> bit

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 
annihilation bars next to give you a bit

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.559 
annihilation bars next to give you a bit
of<00:07:04.529> bit<00:07:05.219> more<00:07:05.370> size<00:07:05.580> comparison<00:07:06.029> it's<00:07:06.509> a

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:06.569 
of bit more size comparison it's a

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:07.399 
of bit more size comparison it's a
pretty<00:07:06.899> big

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:07.409 
pretty big

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:10.129 
pretty big
here's<00:07:07.560> a<00:07:07.710> standing<00:07:08.219> up<00:07:08.310> normally<00:07:09.139> probably

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:10.139 
here's a standing up normally probably

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.409 
here's a standing up normally probably
about<00:07:10.259> five<00:07:10.680> times<00:07:10.889> the<00:07:11.099> size<00:07:11.310> of<00:07:11.699> five<00:07:12.240> times

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 
about five times the size of five times

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:15.079 
about five times the size of five times
the<00:07:12.569> height<00:07:12.719> of<00:07:12.870> a<00:07:12.960> person<00:07:12.990> maybe<00:07:14.000> three<00:07:15.000> or

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:15.089 
the height of a person maybe three or

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:17.929 
the height of a person maybe three or
four<00:07:15.149> or<00:07:15.719> five<00:07:15.930> and<00:07:16.639> trying<00:07:17.639> to<00:07:17.699> slightly

00:07:17.929 --> 00:07:17.939 
four or five and trying to slightly

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:22.179 
four or five and trying to slightly
anything<00:07:18.419> in<00:07:18.539> a<00:07:18.629> side<00:07:18.839> view<00:07:18.870> of<00:07:19.349> all<00:07:19.770> of<00:07:19.889> them

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:22.189 

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:24.769 

so<00:07:23.189> it's<00:07:23.310> about<00:07:23.610> as<00:07:23.969> long<00:07:24.180> as<00:07:24.389> in<00:07:24.539> the<00:07:24.629> law

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:24.779 
so it's about as long as in the law

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:28.279 
so it's about as long as in the law
relation<00:07:25.169> barge<00:07:25.379> maybe<00:07:25.680> not<00:07:27.259> smell<00:07:28.259> so

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:28.289 
relation barge maybe not smell so

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:32.389 
relation barge maybe not smell so
concentrated<00:07:29.099> in<00:07:29.219> this<00:07:29.310> mess<00:07:29.580> so<00:07:30.149> if<00:07:30.240> you<00:07:31.399> put

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:32.399 
concentrated in this mess so if you put

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:34.600 
concentrated in this mess so if you put
the<00:07:32.550> nourish<00:07:33.149> bar<00:07:33.389> in<00:07:33.539> front<00:07:33.629> of<00:07:33.839> it<00:07:33.930> you<00:07:33.960> can

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:34.610 
the nourish bar in front of it you can

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.100 
the nourish bar in front of it you can
see<00:07:35.610> that<00:07:35.789> pretty<00:07:35.939> much<00:07:36.180> the<00:07:36.240> same<00:07:36.509> length<00:07:36.779> the

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110 
see that pretty much the same length the

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.480 
see that pretty much the same length the
annihilation<00:07:37.560> barge<00:07:37.830> is<00:07:37.949> slightly<00:07:38.250> longer

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:38.490 
annihilation barge is slightly longer

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.100 
annihilation barge is slightly longer
just<00:07:38.879> because<00:07:39.089> of<00:07:39.149> its<00:07:39.270> engines<00:07:39.719> at<00:07:39.870> the<00:07:39.930> back

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.110 
just because of its engines at the back

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.450 
just because of its engines at the back
but<00:07:40.919> all<00:07:41.159> three<00:07:41.460> very<00:07:41.789> imposing<00:07:42.330> and<00:07:42.719> powerful

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:43.460 
but all three very imposing and powerful

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.189 
but all three very imposing and powerful

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 
models on the battlefield especially the

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:50.899

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:50.909 
Warriors so stay tuned for more painting

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:52.879 
Warriors so stay tuned for more painting
