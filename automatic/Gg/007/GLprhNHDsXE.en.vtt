00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:18.410
 mothers will not return until they have fed the little ones 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.410
 manage alone 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.140
 the sea bears have been reproducing here thousands of years formerly this 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.720
 it was an island 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.360
 but with the passage of the centuries the sand dragged towards the north by the 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.940
 benguela stream the continent union so now the jackals 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.940
 they have free access to the colony 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.450
 the jackal gives a small exploratory bite to the puppy to check 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.890
 her strength 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.890
 a lonely jackal prefers the weak or sick 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.390
 a more serious threat comes 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.490
 one and in brown 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.880
 the hyena is much bigger than the shaka 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.880
 and attack the puppies years 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.620
 the sea bears down the water but on land have more view 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.060
 very poor 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.790
 if something remains motionless 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.790
 will approach her 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.620
 maybe the large groups provide security the jackals are 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.000
 more scavengers than predators 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.710
 The best option a jackal has for tasting sea bear meat is 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.710
 remain in the shadow of a whale that seeks food 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.540
 for most of the year the temples lead a rather precarious life 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.659
 in the desert 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.430
 but for a few weeks when the sea bears are reproducing the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.430
 food supply seems almost 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.659
 the line also the best option 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:44.589
 I'm looking for an unattended sleeping puppy 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:49.969
 an adult sea bear could scare a hyena a puppy just can not 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.969
 Do nothing 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.109
 for the colony 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.239
 it is a circumstance of life 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.430
 a fifth of the offspring will not exceed their first month of life 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:35.999
 many die victims of the east 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:40.769
 with so many puppies around the hyena just with seeing the best parts of 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:41.919
 each dam 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.919
 letting the jackals collect the works 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.169
 p 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:02.969
 Even though you have it, you kill hundreds of puppies every year 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.069
 hundreds of thousands survive 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.329
 for the sea bears as well as for many other animals that live here the 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.329
 Balance between life and death keeps the right direction 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.879
 the ship is a hard land 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:26.219
 where survival depends on balance and lives on the edge of 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.969
 razor 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:32.549
 between opposites and extremes like heat and cold wind and water the sea and 

00:04:32.549 --> 00:04:38.599
 the desert shore and they can adapt and find a place where it is 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.599
 a balance that is worth fighting for 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.300
 hourly 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.300
 the last years minute and a half 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.080
 then when you see them
