eyebrow and so that the very thick hair

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.490 
eyebrow and so that the very thick hair
it<00:00:34.879> doesn't<00:00:35.239> hurt<00:00:35.480> while<00:00:35.750> I'm<00:00:35.870> threading<00:00:36.260> it

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
it doesn't hurt while I'm threading it

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.640 
it doesn't hurt while I'm threading it
later<00:00:36.800> on<00:00:40.600> then<00:00:41.600> I'm<00:00:41.810> going<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:41.990> go<00:00:42.140> ahead<00:00:42.260> and

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
later on then I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.800 
later on then I'm going to go ahead and
begin<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.130> threading<00:00:43.490> process<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:44.390> if<00:00:44.690> you

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
begin the threading process so if you

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.540 
begin the threading process so if you
aren't<00:00:45.050> familiar<00:00:45.470> with<00:00:45.800> threading<00:00:46.370> you're

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
aren't familiar with threading you're

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.190 
aren't familiar with threading you're
just<00:00:46.730> going<00:00:46.880> to<00:00:46.910> go<00:00:47.120> ahead<00:00:47.240> and<00:00:47.600> tie<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:47.900> piece

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
just going to go ahead and tie a piece

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.400 
just going to go ahead and tie a piece
of<00:00:48.260> string<00:00:48.680> cut<00:00:49.370> any<00:00:49.550> excess<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:50.300> then<00:00:50.840> loop

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
of string cut any excess and then loop

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.580 
of string cut any excess and then loop
it<00:00:51.500> around<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:52.130> begin<00:00:52.790> to<00:00:53.300> thread<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.470> way

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
it around and begin to thread so the way

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.590 
it around and begin to thread so the way
that<00:00:54.770> it<00:00:54.890> works<00:00:55.160> is<00:00:55.340> you're<00:00:56.060> gonna<00:00:56.360> be

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
that it works is you're gonna be

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.350 
that it works is you're gonna be
threading<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.800> opposite<00:00:58.370> way<00:00:58.610> of<00:00:58.850> your<00:00:59.090> hair

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
threading the opposite way of your hair

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.450

growth<00:00:59.660> so<00:01:00.560> as<00:01:00.680> you<00:01:00.800> can<00:01:00.920> see<00:01:00.980> I'm<00:01:01.220> going<00:01:01.340> to<00:01:01.399> be

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
growth so as you can see I'm going to be

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.840 
growth so as you can see I'm going to be
threading<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.360> right<00:01:03.070> since<00:01:04.070> my<00:01:04.460> eyebrows

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
threading to the right since my eyebrows

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.929 
threading to the right since my eyebrows
grow<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.840> opposite<00:01:06.409> way<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:06.979> then<00:01:07.670> I<00:01:07.759> go

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
grow the opposite way and then I go

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.700 
grow the opposite way and then I go
ahead<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:08.240> just<00:01:08.570> comb<00:01:08.840> my<00:01:08.990> eyebrows<00:01:09.350> just<00:01:09.619> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.590 
ahead and just comb my eyebrows just a
bit<00:01:09.889> and<00:01:10.069> I'm<00:01:10.460> going<00:01:10.549> to<00:01:10.609> be<00:01:10.729> continuing<00:01:11.420> this

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
bit and I'm going to be continuing this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.050 
bit and I'm going to be continuing this
process<00:01:12.200> for<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.829> next<00:01:13.039> eyebrow<00:01:13.490> it's<00:01:13.909> gonna

process for the next eyebrow it's gonna

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.050 
process for the next eyebrow it's gonna
be<00:01:14.329> threading<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.319> the<00:01:15.469> left<00:01:15.859> because<00:01:16.399> again

be threading to the left because again
it's<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:17.479> opposite<00:01:18.049> way<00:01:18.729> towards<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.939> hair

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
it's the opposite way towards the hair

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.239 
it's the opposite way towards the hair
growth<00:01:20.420> of<00:01:20.659> my<00:01:20.899> eyebrow<00:01:21.319> so<00:01:21.889> I'm<00:01:21.979> just<00:01:22.100> going

going<00:01:52.329> to<00:01:52.359> continue<00:01:52.570> on<00:01:53.049> to<00:01:53.289> doing<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.979> ends

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
going to continue on to doing the ends

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.310 
going to continue on to doing the ends
of<00:01:54.579> the<00:01:54.759> brows<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.299> this<00:01:55.570> is<00:01:55.719> very<00:01:56.020> very

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
of the brows and this is very very

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.649 
of the brows and this is very very
important<00:01:56.860> especially<00:01:57.610> when<00:01:58.270> you're<00:01:58.420> trying

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
important especially when you're trying

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.230 
important especially when you're trying
to<00:01:58.780> define<00:01:59.289> the<00:01:59.469> shape<00:01:59.740> of<00:01:59.770> your<00:01:59.979> eyebrow<00:02:00.610> so

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
to define the shape of your eyebrow so

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.419 
to define the shape of your eyebrow so
as<00:02:01.299> you<00:02:01.390> can<00:02:01.509> see<00:02:01.569> I<00:02:01.929> am<00:02:02.259> threading<00:02:02.829> upwards

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
as you can see I am threading upwards

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.350 
as you can see I am threading upwards
since<00:02:04.030> my<00:02:04.299> eyebrows<00:02:04.719> does<00:02:04.990> grow<00:02:05.649> downwards<00:02:06.490> so

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
since my eyebrows does grow downwards so

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.880 
since my eyebrows does grow downwards so
we're<00:02:07.659> just<00:02:07.840> going<00:02:07.959> to<00:02:07.990> continue<00:02:08.470> on<00:02:08.619> doing

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
we're just going to continue on doing

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.160 
we're just going to continue on doing
this<00:02:09.039> technique<00:02:09.280> over<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.060> over<00:02:10.390> until<00:02:10.629> we

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
this technique over and over until we

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.530 
this technique over and over until we
achieve<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.860> perfect<00:02:12.310> brow<00:02:12.519> on<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:13.239> top

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
achieve the perfect brow on the top

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.180 
achieve the perfect brow on the top
portion<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:18.660> then<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.720> usually<00:02:20.140> continue<00:02:20.980> on

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
portion and then I usually continue on

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.220 
portion and then I usually continue on
to<00:02:21.670> kind<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:22.060> going<00:02:22.299> a<00:02:22.450> little<00:02:22.750> bit<00:02:22.959> higher

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
to kind of going a little bit higher

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.780 
to kind of going a little bit higher
than<00:02:23.470> my<00:02:23.620> eyebrow<00:02:23.980> just<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.519> we<00:02:24.640> don't

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
than my eyebrow just so that we don't

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.520 
than my eyebrow just so that we don't
have<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.120> line<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.989> people<00:02:26.319> have

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
have that line that people have

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.199 
have that line that people have
sometimes<00:02:26.829> you<00:02:27.160> know<00:02:27.250> when<00:02:27.370> we<00:02:27.519> wax<00:02:27.819> our

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
bit higher than my eyebrow and then I'm

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.550 
bit higher than my eyebrow and then I'm
