00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.670 
think the world is in need of positive
messages<00:01:08.920> our<00:01:09.810> way<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.870> look<00:01:11.200> at<00:01:11.350> it<00:01:11.500> is

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
messages our way to look at it is

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.950 
messages our way to look at it is
actually<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.550> use<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.120> language<00:01:13.300> of<00:01:13.690> sweets

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
actually to use the language of sweets

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.260 
actually to use the language of sweets
so<00:01:14.290> we<00:01:14.860> have<00:01:14.950> done<00:01:15.160> a<00:01:15.190> collection<00:01:15.790> based<00:01:16.000> on

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
so we have done a collection based on

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.290 
so we have done a collection based on
some<00:01:16.750> very<00:01:16.780> pop<00:01:17.440> objects<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.250> then<00:01:18.970> for

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
some very pop objects and then for

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.300 
some very pop objects and then for
summer<00:01:19.510> we<00:01:19.810> have<00:01:19.960> something<00:01:20.320> very<00:01:20.650> strong<00:01:21.040> in

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
summer we have something very strong in

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.730 
summer we have something very strong in
terms<00:01:21.520> of<00:01:21.670> color<00:01:21.910> blocking<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.900> neon<00:01:23.380> colors

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
terms of color blocking and neon colors

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.070 
terms of color blocking and neon colors
the<00:01:24.190> energy<00:01:24.700> that<00:01:24.820> comes<00:01:25.000> from<00:01:25.180> color<00:01:25.540> is

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
the energy that comes from color is

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.750 
the energy that comes from color is
definitely<00:01:26.530> something<00:01:26.710> that<00:01:26.980> swatch<00:01:27.220> likes

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
definitely something that swatch likes

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.010 
definitely something that swatch likes
to<00:01:28.000> celebrate<00:01:28.480> and<00:01:28.750> we<00:01:29.110> get<00:01:29.320> a<00:01:29.350> lot<00:01:29.560> out<00:01:29.590> of<00:01:29.740> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
to celebrate and we get a lot out of it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.890 
to celebrate and we get a lot out of it
the<00:01:32.020> idea<00:01:32.290> of<00:01:32.500> swatch<00:01:32.920> is<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.670> eventually<00:01:34.450> lead

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
the idea of swatch is to eventually lead

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.320 
the idea of swatch is to eventually lead
people<00:01:35.620> to<00:01:35.800> stop<00:01:36.250> and<00:01:36.430> think<00:01:36.640> for<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:36.880> while<00:01:37.090> and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
people to stop and think for a while and

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.140 
people to stop and think for a while and
that's<00:01:37.810> why<00:01:37.990> some<00:01:38.470> of<00:01:38.590> our<00:01:38.710> watches<00:01:39.150> actually

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
that's why some of our watches actually

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.690 
that's why some of our watches actually
have<00:01:40.300> a<00:01:40.330> message<00:01:40.870> and<00:01:41.080> some<00:01:41.950> of<00:01:42.100> them<00:01:42.280> have<00:01:42.670> a

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
have a message and some of them have a

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.899 
have a message and some of them have a
message<00:01:43.270> that<00:01:43.300> you<00:01:43.510> can<00:01:43.690> discover<00:01:44.170> if<00:01:44.530> you

years ago when swatch was founded it

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.450 
years ago when swatch was founded it
actually<00:01:52.060> created<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:53.050> ground<00:01:53.409> for<00:01:54.220> the

actually created the ground for the

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.180 
actually created the ground for the
evolution<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.360> Swiss<00:01:55.600> watch<00:01:55.810> industry

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
evolution of the Swiss watch industry

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.490 
evolution of the Swiss watch industry
because<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.729> vision<00:01:57.909> of<00:01:58.090> Miss<00:01:58.270> Eric<00:01:58.540> was<00:01:59.020> to

have a volume product that a lot of
people<00:02:01.750> could<00:02:01.870> afford<00:02:02.200> so<00:02:02.560> that<00:02:02.710> they<00:02:02.830> could

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
people could afford so that they could

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.550 
people could afford so that they could
get<00:02:03.190> reacquainted<00:02:03.580> with<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.600> values<00:02:05.049> that
