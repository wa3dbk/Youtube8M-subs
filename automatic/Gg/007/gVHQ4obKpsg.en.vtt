00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.190 
with those shoes and obviously the
reason<00:00:40.530> why<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.340> because<00:00:41.700> these<00:00:42.480> shoes<00:00:42.809> are<00:00:43.170> a

these<00:00:48.690> shoes<00:00:48.989> are<00:00:49.260> extremely<00:00:50.219> comfortable

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
these shoes are extremely comfortable

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.709 
these shoes are extremely comfortable
I'm<00:00:51.719> absolutely<00:00:52.410> amazed<00:00:53.010> how<00:00:53.879> comfortable

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719

they<00:00:54.930> are<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:56.190> believe<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.600> reason

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
they are and I believe one of the reason

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.490 
they are and I believe one of the reason
is<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.320> they're<00:00:58.969> relatively<00:00:59.969> wide<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:01.320> it's

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
is that they're relatively wide so it's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.230 
is that they're relatively wide so it's
easy<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.609> put<00:01:02.820> your<00:01:03.059> foot<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:04.400> you<00:01:05.400> have

easy to put your foot in you have

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.020 
easy to put your foot in you have
control<00:01:06.930> over<00:01:07.229> how<00:01:07.710> tight<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.580> want<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.850> have
