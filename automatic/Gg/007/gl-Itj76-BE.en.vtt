00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 geroge 9 april 2014 in switzerland because 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.290
 in a few hours this showcase will start 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.019
 music meeting and interviews at 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.429
 Swiss TV radio on networks 1 is not the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.340
 first time in switzerland 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.049
 no for sure over time they are 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.550
 came here several times to do concerts 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:24.420
 and it's always a nice experience from where 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.539
 dress I go to Germany pass by 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.550
 here and around very much indeed I have read 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.250
 that divides his home between Italy and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.250
 very precise berlin 8 and hints 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.270
 unfortunately my German is limited 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.739
 anyway, I'm fine with small things 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.629
 the right one 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.719
 Now let's go back to the album instead 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.420
 released the month ago the impossible is 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.699
 certainly released precisely around mid-February 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.129
 what impact it is having with loyalists 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.480
 with loyal fans and theirs 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.850
 they had been waiting a long time for a new cd 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.660
 of unpublished and this time has arrived 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.430
 after ten years 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.250
 in the meantime made many others 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.189
 very interesting artistic experiences 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:18.840
 and this evening I will propose two rather three of 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:21.240
 these of these are the impossible 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.479
 certainly the number one gave the title 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.900
 to the album as we could explain 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.119
 to paraphrase this title is a 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.240
 title that I wanted to dedicate the new ones 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.009
 generations I frequent a lot i 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.630
 young and I must say that I am 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.610
 intelligent motivated the minister from 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.829
 really extraordinary times yes 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.590
 they engage despite the historical period 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.940
 is what is very much 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.430
 how to say 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.710
 heavy because there are no certainties but to 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.460
 sometimes the impossible can't become one 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.890
 certainty does not mean this this 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.950
 long term let's say darkness 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.250
 let's put it this way, then don't have one 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.740
 end don't start having to see again 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.610
 a future to see a bar anyway 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.610
 he mentions trezza 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.500
 among all of his songs he is in 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.900
 mind someone we could call the 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.140
 more enigmatic than all difficult 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.709
 to decipher but it depends on why a 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.370
 times that song that looks 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.370
 impossible to decipher 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.970
 you get the person we can 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:51.720
 I sit in it with my arm and 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.180
 so what i do n't know are some 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.099
 they will be quite decipherable but there is 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.099
 always who we find ourselves 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.050
 before I watched evidence from afar 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.690
 in study 2 of the network 1 radio 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.090
 switzerland antonella ruggiero even if it is 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.760
 a test even if it's just a 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.340
 try what you're doing 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.230
 it's not that he just plays the song but 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.590
 he lives it every time as if it were the 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.360
 before it is so so naturally 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.340
 so much so that there is never a performance 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.980
 like any other you will never find the 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.950
 same song sung in the same way 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.510
 also during I think today we did 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.600
 three times a sample folder itself 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.180
 but always different because so in the way of 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.280
 to be and to experience music once 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.200
 I saw it because it will no longer be lyric 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.470
 etc. antonella's answer 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.180
 ruggiero was because the lyric read 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.360
 it needs rigor and precise rules 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.850
 which you will not be able to follow is true in lyric 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.299
 the world of classical music has 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.030
 absolutely need a study of 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.450
 an absolute rigor and is precise and is 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.630
 just let it be so use and sing 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:29.350
 or play songs from other eras must 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.520
 being is a very tiring job 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.680
 from this point of view though 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.960
 extraordinary instead need freedom 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.669
 freedom, freedom and freedom of action 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.820
 along with other musicians who 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.919
 they also come from maybe from that world 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:46.330
 but freedom of action also means 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:49.810
 creativity she is social facebook yes 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.229
 oil sidonia facebook I have all that 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.770
 which is needed to interact 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:05:00.990
 although I am not at the computer for hours 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.990
 priest to communicate I communicate from time to time 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.600
 I would like to take the last images 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.690
 with the one that looks at one of the many 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.060
 archive footage that the Swiss TV of 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.430
 antonella ruggiero and she wants to know 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.120
 before that date is no i want to know 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.680
 anything 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:37.330
 I would like to know nothing then I see the 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:37.330
 our tablet here qua bob bob is pretty 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:45.490
 because my nickname bazaar because 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.560
 we have always been able to do everything ourselves 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:52.120
 from songs to arrangements and i 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.220
 texts for tour organization 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.670
 so a bazzaro our in all 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.680
 senses 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:02.730
 but because it is usually nothing but life 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.500
 of the artist is born and ends up on stage 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.690
 it's not just his nare but there are 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.940
 a thousand other things to take care of that 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.500
 clearly they go ahead in full 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.520
 an organization also because we are not 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.960
 only the five of us working there 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.230
 there are many many many people 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:24.760
 collaborators we are a 25 people from which 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:27.750
 we must send the company forward 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.750
 in my way possible 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000
