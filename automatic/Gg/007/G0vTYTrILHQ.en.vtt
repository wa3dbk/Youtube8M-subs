00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
that you use five-minute epoxy there's

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.670 
that you use five-minute epoxy there's
only<00:02:38.099> always<00:02:38.370> four<00:02:38.700> pieces<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.329> glue<00:02:39.569> on<00:02:39.780> with

only always four pieces to glue on with

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.240 
only always four pieces to glue on with
you<00:02:40.829> buy<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.670> way<00:02:41.790> we<00:02:41.970> got<00:02:42.180> ours<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:43.250> let's

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
you buy it the way we got ours so let's

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.830 
you buy it the way we got ours so let's
take<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.430> look<00:02:44.640> at<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.819> finished<00:02:45.000> airplane<00:02:45.599> I

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
take a look at the finished airplane I

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.280 
take a look at the finished airplane I
didn't<00:02:46.290> do<00:02:46.349> any<00:02:46.530> construction<00:02:47.930> video<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.140> it

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
didn't do any construction video of it

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.930 
didn't do any construction video of it
because<00:02:49.620> really<00:02:49.859> the<00:02:50.370> only<00:02:50.489> thing<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.819> need

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
because really the only thing you need

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.720 
because really the only thing you need
to<00:02:51.000> do<00:02:51.239> is<00:02:51.629> glue<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.349> wings<00:02:52.560> on<00:02:52.859> on<00:02:53.160> each<00:02:53.459> side

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
to do is glue the wings on on each side

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.970 
to do is glue the wings on on each side
here<00:02:54.650> move<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.769> pores<00:02:56.250> or<00:02:56.340> vertical<00:02:57.060> stabs<00:02:57.329> on

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
here move the pores or vertical stabs on

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.110 
here move the pores or vertical stabs on
and<00:02:58.980> then<00:02:59.459> put<00:02:59.489> your<00:02:59.730> servo<00:03:00.180> covers<00:03:00.599> on<00:03:00.829> on<00:03:02.120> the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
and then put your servo covers on on the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.690 
and then put your servo covers on on the
bottom<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:04.319> wires<00:03:04.590> for<00:03:04.859> the<00:03:04.920> circles<00:03:05.370> are<00:03:05.519> run

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
bottom the wires for the circles are run

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.990 
bottom the wires for the circles are run
along<00:03:06.030> pre-cut<00:03:06.989> tracks<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:08.400> all<00:03:08.519> you<00:03:08.549> do<00:03:08.819> is

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
along pre-cut tracks so all you do is

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.849 
along pre-cut tracks so all you do is
run<00:03:09.180> those<00:03:09.629> up<00:03:09.870> push<00:03:10.260> them<00:03:10.409> up<00:03:10.500> through<00:03:10.769> the

is<00:04:31.370> it's<00:04:32.370> got<00:04:32.580> holes<00:04:32.820> in<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.150> bottom<00:04:33.330> as<00:04:33.570> you

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
is it's got holes in the bottom as you

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.230 
is it's got holes in the bottom as you
can<00:04:33.840> see<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:35.220> those<00:04:35.370> are<00:04:35.550> finger<00:04:35.850> holes<00:04:36.030> to

can see and those are finger holes to

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.340 
can see and those are finger holes to
hold<00:04:36.360> it<00:04:36.540> for<00:04:36.570> launching<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.260> define<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.370> CG

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
hold it for launching and define the CG

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.469 
hold it for launching and define the CG
just<00:04:40.350> hold<00:04:40.590> this<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.850> you<00:04:42.120> place<00:04:42.330> your

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
just hold this and you place your

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.100 
just hold this and you place your
battery<00:04:42.900> in<00:04:43.110> here<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:45.330> you<00:04:45.449> just<00:04:45.630> slide<00:04:45.780> it

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
battery in here and you just slide it

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.879 
battery in here and you just slide it
until<00:04:46.590> you<00:04:46.770> find<00:04:47.100> the<00:04:47.520> CG<00:04:48.229> when<00:04:49.229> it<00:04:49.350> balances

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
until you find the CG when it balances

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.840 
until you find the CG when it balances
nice<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:50.430> steady<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:52.530> level<00:04:52.979> that's<00:04:53.639> your

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
nice and steady and level that's your

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.640 
nice and steady and level that's your
battery<00:04:54.180> location<00:04:54.780> you<00:04:54.960> can<00:04:55.080> mark<00:04:55.350> it<00:04:55.470> with

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
battery location you can mark it with

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.180 
battery location you can mark it with
pen<00:04:56.040> or<00:04:56.280> something<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:57.120> then<00:04:57.419> just<00:04:58.100> put<00:04:59.100> the
