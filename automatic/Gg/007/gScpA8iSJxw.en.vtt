00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
times a decent effort doesn't mean you

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.179 
times a decent effort doesn't mean you
will<00:01:06.869> never<00:01:07.020> know<00:01:07.320> because<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.770> video<00:01:08.070> will

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
will never know because this video will

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.800
