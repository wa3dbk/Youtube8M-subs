00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:14.930
 polaris 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:17.990
 this bait refers to the classification 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.740
 passive bait now i'll show in 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.329
 about what it should 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.439
 do it in the water 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:29.509
 how should it work properly to 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.820
 paint give you a ride because it 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.320
 We are not just a container of water is in our 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.170
 aquarius is specially trained for 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.840
 to show into action how she is 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.350
 It works like this 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.440
 should perform bait in the water 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.690
 that is, the wiring must be done 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.399
 pulsating so wiggle 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.559
 the bait she knows is intended to 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.899
 imitations of some maggots worm 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.640
 insect caterpillars trapped in water 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.050
 either worms living in the water 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.850
 but you said more correctly 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.859
 like a larva I'm here and so from here 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.440
 I look like she moves there yes that is 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.770
 you can hold it intermittent such 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.220
 jerking one of the advantages of the bait is 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.329
 that she rises during a pause 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.659
 up now show it will demonstrate 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.810
 rises 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.100
 tails up and freezes ie fish 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.490
 following her 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.579
 watching not deciding on attack yet 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.850
 she saw on pause how it stopped 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:31.189
 the larva can easily pull it into 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.860
 mouth proatakovat peck on her 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.380
 well what are some bait when you pause 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.539
 lie on the bottom lie horizontally he 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.130
 Now I will try and fill up with fish 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.610
 a little harder to do when 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.610
 bait style perpendicular to the bottom 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.520
 choose a convenient 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.580
 I say that and more the claimant should to 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.790
 notches contribute to this property 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.880
 on almost all of our body baits 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.130
 bait here are the ribs these ribs 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.150
 hold air together 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.290
 I'll show it too 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.210
 and this air does not allow the bait to fall 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.050
 because there is another kind of silicone 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.150
 it has a more floating property 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.910
 great buoyancy and he's on his own 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.950
 it stands regardless of air bubbles but 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.360
 This silicone has other 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.030
 negative factors 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.989
 he melts he stretches and his 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.660
 it is practically impossible to make a convenient and 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.760
 the edibility of passive bait is one thing 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.680
 of the most important qualities because the bait 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.860
 passively on pause she is nothing 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.650
 seduces fish fish became interested in her 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.820
 and passed for not stopping and here in that 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.950
 phase when the fish 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.550
 almost already about attacked but also something 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.220
 interferes she senses this smell and all she 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:52.049
 can't stand about smells 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.630
 such smells you used on lighthouses on 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:59.040
 bis may 3 as we used garlic 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.200
 Anise time a little bit and I have passed 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.230
 I remember we tested all the smells 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.450
 just best that day worked by 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.330
 my garlic and anise in what the essence 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.090
 attractant he should not just smell 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.280
 don't just smell for a fisherman because 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.670
 fish is a completely different creature like 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.890
 she reacts to me very well known this 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.799
 Attractant is the oil that is impregnated 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.700
 silicone must contain 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.329
 amino acids protein 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.250
 which give edible properties not 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.530
 give the fish to understand that this is some kind 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.420
 artificial bait sensing these 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.760
 Proteins longer she delays it in 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.860
 her mouth has an incentive to attack 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.959
 that is, our bait 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.120
 soaked in attractants who 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.409
 contain both amino acids and proteins that 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.650
 proved by many tests that is 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:55.049
 the fish attacked the bait even in pauses until 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.049
 two minutes still lying bait
