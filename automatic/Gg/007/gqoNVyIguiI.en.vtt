wouldn't<00:02:10.560> think<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.950> would<00:02:11.009> be<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.160> fast<00:02:11.550> so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
wouldn't think it would be that fast so

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.210 
wouldn't think it would be that fast so
this<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.810> just

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
this is just

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.510 
this is just

application<00:02:16.520> /<00:02:17.030> mod<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.510> think<00:02:17.870> it's<00:02:17.990> more<00:02:18.050> of<00:02:18.230> a

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
application / mod I think it's more of a

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.040 
application / mod I think it's more of a
mod<00:02:18.500> than<00:02:18.710> an<00:02:18.830> application<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.610> it's<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.840> think

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
mod than an application and it's I think

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.750 
mod than an application and it's I think
it's<00:02:21.260> really<00:02:21.530> actually<00:02:21.800> better<00:02:22.190> than<00:02:22.310> using

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
it's really actually better than using

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.250 
it's really actually better than using
the<00:02:22.910> lock<00:02:23.120> button<00:02:23.390> because<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:23.870> can<00:02:23.990> kind<00:02:24.170> of

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
the lock button because you can kind of

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.050

get<00:02:24.410> annoying<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.310> click<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.610> button<00:02:25.850> every
