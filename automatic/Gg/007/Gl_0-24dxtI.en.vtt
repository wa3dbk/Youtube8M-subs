00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:11.209
 Speedlink 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.139
 Low but no 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.139
 To become pictures 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:22.730
 Actually it is title of a planned slingshot fall with a whole matter 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.839
 equipped with a good dose of courage and a breeze jump felt 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.479
 The following pictures add up to the star rise in shallow water 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.300
 first the introduction 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.720
 You Holst on ceiling elevations, kiss maximum plays and jumpsteen from the group 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.720
 out 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.000
 and now to get the necessary impetus for the turn you pull the board 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.810
 maximum to have you sir 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.400
 average with the head 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.490
 under-challenged and shoulder inside 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.470
 So the whole body rolls in and follows the turn of Ulrich Homburg 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.970
 in the flight phase remain as long as possible rolled up 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.360
 that's already turned off by the wind 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.360
 The arms are borrowed to the body 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.640
 the seal is now flown again 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.640
 This will give you another spin impulse 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.000
 Let's concentrate on the landing now 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.250
 You also keep the compact body position of the flight phase for landing 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.390
 at and 4 is just the blessing with which she called lightly up 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.480
 most of the time I came to a standstill with the word 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.560
 but stay up in the air and into the water 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.560
 then immediately proceed with a water level 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.009
 Let's have a closer look at the phone 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.369
 to bounce boat through sparkling maximum tight 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.499
 and he reaches for the fork with the saw land further back 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.969
 the most important phases again in the overview 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.749
 Put on the jump and the porta 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:45.859
 incurred 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.859
 get and turn body inside 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.469
 for landing seals on hers 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.899
 the most common mistakes at Speedway 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:28.029
 Do you jump like in this attempt to shallow abyss the guests are not small 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:29.209
 strong enough 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.549
 maybe not enough time for the rotation result of the nose tip 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.549
 early into the water 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:50.359
 where error 2 slips under the moped times from the loops 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:54.119
 he has no chance to survive the rotation salvation 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:07.159
 The movement to the clubs can only be on the water 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:19.470
 simple spooners on shallow water you should 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.470
 before the first try but certainly dominate 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:34.039
 Some sequences of the Beat Club can be landed, so to speak, in the dry 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.719
 pretty good 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:39.319
 so that at all times a sense of active movement moves from and to 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.349
 Body holds 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.240
 move Dino Altmann forward Le 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.099
 refrain from rotating it 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.059
 You will quickly feel the rotation skate which is necessary 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:52.129
 Speed ​​up once to turn around its own axis 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:54.520
 the rotation becomes especially intense 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.849
 "If you vary behind the shore 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.380
 previously with the winners continue to sink 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.380
 to grab the sheaf and therefore keep it as usual 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.280
 This part of the movement can already be practiced on the water with little wind 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:24.779
 Jump off the train with a report from the board towards Formula i 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.030
 so studies mastered the first part of the Rotation Times offer 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.550
 To conclude, the institutes once again show their speed in Oppenheim 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.929
 Dorsch initiates the rotation very actively and thus creates a complete 

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:43.749
 Rotation on a mirror-smooth track 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:47.269
 higher you will of course come over a small wave to take off 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.930
 Cod show you here a stick calculate speed up over the stern wave 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.439
 a motorboat 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:58.189
 13 meter of half a meter, I reach several meters in height 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.319
