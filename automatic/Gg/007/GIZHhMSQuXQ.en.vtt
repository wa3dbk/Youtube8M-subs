have a quick look okay so here we have
our<00:02:58.950> main<00:02:59.250> hull<00:02:59.579> that's<00:03:00.150> pretty<00:03:00.480> cool<00:03:00.719> because

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
our main hull that's pretty cool because

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.589 
our main hull that's pretty cool because
it's<00:03:01.889> got<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.430> bit<00:03:02.670> that<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:02.849> slots<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.389> now

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
it's got this bit that just slots in now

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.250 
it's got this bit that just slots in now
a<00:03:03.629> clever<00:03:03.959> person<00:03:04.200> or<00:03:04.920> add<00:03:05.189> in<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:06.180> old<00:03:06.420> magnet
