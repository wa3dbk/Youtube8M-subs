 today we are going to prepare a delicious to the Chinese little boy 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.299
 for this recipe we will use mostly 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.179
 leftovers from the previous day for example a-rod of the day after a pirate of the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.679
 meat that is the day after and then we will use cut carrot 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.130
 chopped onion 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.050
 b with entity distant prawns I say scrambled sunflower oil 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.460
 a little bit of pepper and a little bit of soy 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.460
 let's start with the failure and that recipe 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.090
 let's take the fire 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.660
 sunflower oil 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.750
 ian ditch that gets hot when heated and well 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.430
 we are going to try to make it out of all the art of port our ass 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.380
 and we removed half of the oil that we have put 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.760
 now let's continue the bacon well because it is what releases more fat 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.270
 and when I have picked up a little bit of color 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.320
 let's add the onion 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.430

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.430

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.460
 and I affect the onion a little bit 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.140
 Now let's add the agro 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.140
 and we are going to draw well 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.070
 do not forget is that when you go out to heat the oil admitted micaela 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.580
 fiteqa is used is for what to lubricate well all the luck not all our 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.940
 we are going to draw a bit 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.960
 until it closes well frozen the rice we were also going to add the bahamas 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.829
 and there are already more expensive ingredient 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.829
 in both the peas the carrots 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:21.289

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.849
