Virgil's<00:01:19.579> Aeneid<00:01:20.499> my<00:01:21.499> aim<00:01:22.189> always<00:01:22.880> with

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
Virgil's Aeneid my aim always with

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.359 
Virgil's Aeneid my aim always with
classics<00:01:23.869> as<00:01:24.109> what<00:01:24.319> Dylan<00:01:24.679> is<00:01:24.859> to<00:01:25.069> sort<00:01:25.279> of

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.789 
classics as what Dylan is to sort of
bring<00:01:25.579> out<00:01:25.789> so<00:01:26.569> great<00:01:26.779> literature<00:01:27.259> I<00:01:27.529> think

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
bring out so great literature I think

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.989 
bring out so great literature I think
Dylan<00:01:28.219> is<00:01:28.369> of<00:01:28.789> genius<00:01:29.240> of<00:01:29.569> my<00:01:30.499> generation<00:01:30.999> in

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:31.999 
Dylan is of genius of my generation in

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:34.269 
Dylan is of genius of my generation in
terms<00:01:32.299> of<00:01:32.509> his<00:01:32.810> use<00:01:33.109> of<00:01:33.139> a<00:01:33.409> language<00:01:33.619> english

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:34.279 
terms of his use of a language english

terms of his use of a language english
language<00:01:34.779> in<00:01:35.779> music<00:01:36.319> but<00:01:36.349> also<00:01:36.709> just<00:01:36.919> as<00:01:37.279> a

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
language in music but also just as a

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.330 
language in music but also just as a
poet<00:01:37.639> who<00:01:37.969> happens<00:01:38.539> to<00:01:38.719> sing<00:01:38.959> so<00:01:39.349> since<00:01:40.130> that's

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
poet who happens to sing so since that's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.239 
poet who happens to sing so since that's
what<00:01:40.490> virgil<00:01:40.789> was<00:01:41.029> and<00:01:41.599> what<00:01:41.929> Horace<00:01:42.289> was<00:01:42.829> in

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
what virgil was and what Horace was in

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:46.120 
what virgil was and what Horace was in
in<00:01:43.819> antiquity<00:01:44.419> the<00:01:44.689> to<00:01:45.439> me<00:01:45.590> there's<00:01:45.799> a<00:01:45.889> fairly

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
in antiquity the to me there's a fairly

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.389 
in antiquity the to me there's a fairly
seamless<00:01:46.459> fit<00:01:46.969> between<00:01:47.359> the<00:01:47.719> two<00:01:48.310> it's<00:01:49.310> a

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
seamless fit between the two it's a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.279 
seamless fit between the two it's a
beauty<00:01:49.700> of<00:01:49.819> these<00:01:49.939> texts<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:50.989> of<00:01:51.109> this

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
beauty of these texts and of this

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.459 
beauty of these texts and of this
discipline<00:01:51.950> that<00:01:52.069> it<00:01:52.249> stays<00:01:52.549> there<00:01:53.469> waiting

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
discipline that it stays there waiting

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.129 
discipline that it stays there waiting
to<00:01:54.499> be<00:01:54.649> sort<00:01:54.979> of<00:01:55.009> remoulded<00:01:55.789> and<00:01:56.029> reviewed<00:01:56.749> and

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:57.139 
to be sort of remoulded and reviewed and

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:01.449 
to be sort of remoulded and reviewed and
revised<00:01:57.880> by<00:01:58.880> new<00:01:59.119> generation<00:02:00.020> so<00:02:00.319> it's<00:02:00.499> a<00:02:00.679> like

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
revised by new generation so it's a like

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.849 
revised by new generation so it's a like
the<00:02:01.639> leaves<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:02.179> the<00:02:02.209> trees<00:02:02.539> which<00:02:02.929> fall<00:02:03.499> but

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
the leaves of the trees which fall but

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:07.539 
the leaves of the trees which fall but
