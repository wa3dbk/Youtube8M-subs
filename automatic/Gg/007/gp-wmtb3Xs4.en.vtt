you<00:00:12.389> record<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:14.130> rules<00:00:14.429> are<00:00:15.320> not<00:00:16.320> that

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
you record and the rules are not that

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.830 
you record and the rules are not that
simple<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:19.310> we're<00:00:20.310> rows<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.119> voxel<00:00:21.570> find

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
simple so we're rows of the voxel find

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.679 
simple so we're rows of the voxel find
our<00:00:22.020> page<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.590> not<00:00:22.800> now<00:00:23.130> like<00:00:23.640> our<00:00:23.939> rules<00:00:26.689> so

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
our page it's not now like our rules so

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.689 
our page it's not now like our rules so
yeah<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.230> we're<00:00:28.410> basically<00:00:28.920> hitting<00:00:29.519> the

video over there basically we're

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.920

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
to love the club I think if he was told

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.949 
to love the club I think if he was told
he<00:02:41.849> didn't<00:02:42.090> have<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.209> place<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:42.690> keep

he didn't have a place I can keep

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.650 
he didn't have a place I can keep
probably<00:02:43.379> after<00:02:44.129> it's<00:02:44.700> widely<00:02:44.940> reported<00:02:45.209> that

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
probably after it's widely reported that

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.570 
probably after it's widely reported that
he<00:02:45.780> was<00:02:45.930> happy<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.290> move<00:02:46.410> on<00:02:46.560> in<00:02:46.680> January<00:02:47.130> you

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.259 
know and he has been messed around a bit
and<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.530> think<00:02:50.069> that<00:02:50.220> he's<00:02:50.310> been<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:51.120> know<00:02:51.239> a
