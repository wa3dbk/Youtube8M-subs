when the carriage comes across

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.789 
when the carriage comes across
I'll<00:01:47.130> pull<00:01:47.549> back<00:01:47.729> here<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.299> see<00:01:48.540> a

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:15.710 
see it come into the picture here pretty
soon<00:02:08.750> there<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:14.269> there's<00:02:15.269> no<00:02:15.510> more

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
soon there it is so that there's no more

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.199 
soon there it is so that there's no more
than<00:02:16.050> about<00:02:16.650> two<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.310> half<00:02:17.370> feet<00:02:17.819> of<00:02:17.849> lead

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
than about two and a half feet of lead

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.199 
than about two and a half feet of lead
screw<00:02:18.540> that's<00:02:18.690> ever<00:02:19.080> unsupported<00:02:20.030> no<00:02:21.030> matter

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
screw that's ever unsupported no matter

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.990 
screw that's ever unsupported no matter
which<00:02:21.390> direction<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.140> carriage<00:02:22.530> goes<00:02:23.000> come

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
which direction the carriage goes come

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.320 
which direction the carriage goes come
back<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.390> other<00:02:24.420> way<00:02:25.519> it'll<00:02:26.519> catch<00:02:26.819> this<00:02:27.060> in

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
back the other way it'll catch this in

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:37.850 
back the other way it'll catch this in
and<00:02:27.540> drag<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.959> other<00:02:28.110> half

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.070 

and<00:02:38.860> again<00:02:39.130> you<00:02:39.250> can<00:02:39.400> see<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:40.630> looks<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.960> little

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
and again you can see it looks a little

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.510 
and again you can see it looks a little
bit<00:02:41.260> longer<00:02:41.530> at<00:02:41.710> this<00:02:41.830> angle<00:02:42.070> but<00:02:42.370> there's

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
bit longer at this angle but there's

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.650 
bit longer at this angle but there's
probably<00:02:42.610> about<00:02:42.820> two<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.120> half<00:02:43.240> feet<00:02:43.480> of

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
probably about two and a half feet of

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.530 
probably about two and a half feet of
screw<00:02:43.930> exposed<00:02:44.620> there<00:02:45.180> probably<00:02:46.180> about<00:02:46.270> the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
screw exposed there probably about the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.330 
screw exposed there probably about the
same<00:02:46.780> on<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.020> other<00:02:47.170> side<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:47.950> does<00:02:48.310> a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
same on the other side so it does a

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
same on the other side so it does a
pretty<00:02:48.580> good<00:02:48.670> job<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.060> supporting<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:51.360> there's

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
pretty good job of supporting it there's

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.650 
pretty good job of supporting it there's
a<00:02:52.450> little<00:02:52.600> closer<00:02:53.010> view<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.580> one<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.600> the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
a little closer view of the one of the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.990 
a little closer view of the one of the
followers<00:02:56.050> and<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:57.070> can<00:02:57.220> see<00:02:57.460> it's<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.790> little

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
followers and you can see it's a little

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.380 
followers and you can see it's a little
wider<00:02:58.180> at<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.510> bottom<00:02:58.840> here<00:02:59.820> so<00:03:00.820> that<00:03:01.030> has<00:03:01.360> a

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
wider at the bottom here so that has a

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.360 
wider at the bottom here so that has a
good<00:03:01.780> base<00:03:02.020> to<00:03:02.080> ride<00:03:02.380> on<00:03:02.530> top<00:03:02.680> two<00:03:02.860> extrusion

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
good base to ride on top two extrusion

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.560 
good base to ride on top two extrusion
and<00:03:03.460> you<00:03:03.520> can<00:03:03.670> also<00:03:03.820> see<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.360> where<00:03:04.450> I've

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
and you can also see that where I've

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.210 
and you can also see that where I've
machined<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:05.050> so<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.470> sits<00:03:05.710> down<00:03:05.950> in<00:03:06.130> the

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
machined it so that it sits down in the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.750 
machined it so that it sits down in the
groove<00:03:06.900> it's<00:03:07.900> pretty<00:03:08.440> much<00:03:08.650> trapped<00:03:09.070> between

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
groove it's pretty much trapped between

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.550 
groove it's pretty much trapped between
that<00:03:10.150> groove<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.900> lead<00:03:11.080> screw<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.380> mean

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
that groove and the lead screw I mean

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.370 
that groove and the lead screw I mean
you<00:03:11.650> can't<00:03:11.920> really<00:03:12.720> get<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.780> out<00:03:13.960> of<00:03:13.990> there

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
you can't really get it out of there

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.500 
you can't really get it out of there
but<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.430> can<00:03:15.580> see<00:03:15.760> how<00:03:15.850> much<00:03:16.000> play<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:16.360> lead

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
but you can see how much play the lead

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.780 
but you can see how much play the lead
screw<00:03:16.720> might<00:03:16.960> have<00:03:17.170> without<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:18.580> that's

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
screw might have without it and that's

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.460 
screw might have without it and that's
just<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.090> guess<00:03:19.420> half<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.840> play<00:03:20.050> because<00:03:20.350> it

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
just I guess half the play because it

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.710 
just I guess half the play because it
can<00:03:20.590> go<00:03:20.740> the<00:03:20.860> other<00:03:20.950> direction<00:03:21.070> too<00:03:21.720> without

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
can go the other direction too without

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.280 
can go the other direction too without
the<00:03:22.840> follower<00:03:23.200> I<00:03:23.700> used<00:03:24.700> any<00:03:25.180> either<00:03:26.050> number

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
the follower I used any either number

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.680 
the follower I used any either number
eight<00:03:26.530> or<00:03:26.710> number<00:03:26.950> ten<00:03:27.130> machine<00:03:27.490> screws<00:03:27.910> from

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
eight or number ten machine screws from

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.660 
eight or number ten machine screws from
underneath<00:03:29.020> I<00:03:29.380> just<00:03:29.560> tap<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:30.010> top<00:03:30.220> part<00:03:30.520> and

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
underneath I just tap the top part and

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.410 
underneath I just tap the top part and
put<00:03:31.570> screws<00:03:31.870> in<00:03:31.930> from<00:03:32.350> from<00:03:32.710> the<00:03:32.800> bottom<00:03:33.420> to

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
put screws in from from the bottom to

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.330 
put screws in from from the bottom to
hold<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.660> two<00:03:34.780> pieces<00:03:35.020> together<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.740> it's

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
hold the two pieces together and it's

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.770 
hold the two pieces together and it's
essentially<00:03:36.910> just<00:03:37.090> trapped<00:03:37.390> in<00:03:37.570> there

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
essentially just trapped in there

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.850 
essentially just trapped in there
there's<00:03:37.960> nothing<00:03:38.230> else<00:03:38.320> holding<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:38.710> in

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
there's nothing else holding it in

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.980 
there's nothing else holding it in

push it over by hand so you can see it

push it over by hand so you can see it
come<00:04:02.710> into<00:04:02.890> the<00:04:03.010> picture

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.780 

I<00:04:08.540> extended<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.600> bottom<00:04:10.370> so<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.640> would

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
I extended the bottom so that it would

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.880 
I extended the bottom so that it would
go<00:04:11.970> underneath<00:04:12.330> the<00:04:12.600> lead<00:04:12.810> nut<00:04:13.080> and<00:04:13.350> the

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
go underneath the lead nut and the

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.320 
go underneath the lead nut and the
leading<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.310> wouldn't<00:04:14.580> be<00:04:14.670> what<00:04:14.820> pushed<00:04:15.150> it

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
leading that wouldn't be what pushed it

leading that wouldn't be what pushed it
it<00:04:16.230> makes<00:04:16.440> contact<00:04:16.739> well<00:04:17.730> it<00:04:18.030> will<00:04:18.150> make

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
it makes contact well it will make

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.500 
it makes contact well it will make
contact<00:04:18.900> down<00:04:19.079> here<00:04:19.320> at<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.470> bottom<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:20.730> let

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
contact down here at the bottom and let

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.629 
contact down here at the bottom and let
me<00:04:21.600> move<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:22.019> a<00:04:22.049> little<00:04:22.109> bit<00:04:22.410> for<00:04:22.680> it

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
me move that a little bit for it

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.999 
me move that a little bit for it
and<00:04:25.150> that's<00:04:25.870> what<00:04:26.139> pushes<00:04:26.500> it<00:04:26.650> in<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:26.889> other

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
and that's what pushes it in the other

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:32.460 
and that's what pushes it in the other
direction<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:29.830> I<00:04:29.860> hope<00:04:30.129> that<00:04:30.419> kind<00:04:31.419> of<00:04:31.509> solves

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
direction so I hope that kind of solves

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.159 
direction so I hope that kind of solves
the<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.889> mystery<00:04:33.219> about<00:04:33.340> these<00:04:33.900> for<00:04:34.900> anyone
