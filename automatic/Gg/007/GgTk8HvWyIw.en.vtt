to put make sure that these windows are

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.689 
to put make sure that these windows are
going<00:00:19.199> back<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> right<00:00:19.920> order<00:00:19.980> they<00:00:20.520> don't

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
going back in the right order they don't

going back in the right order they don't
go<00:00:20.820> back<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.210> right<00:00:21.359> order<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.810> could

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
go back in the right order you could

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.880 
go back in the right order you could
break<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.410> window

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
break the window

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.040 
break the window
you<00:00:23.100> can<00:00:23.250> damage<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.730> actual<00:00:24.240> storm<00:00:24.600> frame

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
you can damage the actual storm frame

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.200 
you can damage the actual storm frame
itself<00:00:25.529> or<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.250> frame<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.760> storm<00:00:27.029> system

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
itself or the frame of the storm system

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.089 
itself or the frame of the storm system
and<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.599> don't<00:00:27.750> want<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:28.019> any<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.349> those<00:00:28.619> it

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
and you don't want to do any of those it

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.290 
and you don't want to do any of those it
makes<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.400> lot<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.640> work<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.000> don't<00:00:30.179> need

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
makes a lot of work that you don't need

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.089 
makes a lot of work that you don't need
to<00:00:30.449> do<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> biggest<00:00:31.710> thing<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.070> that

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
to do so the biggest thing is that

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.060 
to do so the biggest thing is that
there's<00:00:32.550> three<00:00:32.610> tracks<00:00:33.329> here<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.320> one<00:00:34.800> track

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
there's three tracks here so one track

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.040 
there's three tracks here so one track
is<00:00:35.250> for<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> window<00:00:35.820> next<00:00:36.420> track<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.719> for<00:00:36.989> that

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
is for the window next track is for that

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.600 
is for the window next track is for that
second<00:00:37.500> window<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> third<00:00:38.309> track<00:00:38.579> is

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
second window and the third track is

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.270 
second window and the third track is
actually<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> screens<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.070> because<00:00:41.070> they

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
actually for the screens so because they

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.880 
actually for the screens so because they
actually<00:00:41.610> tear<00:00:42.030> inwards<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.290> first<00:00:43.559> window

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
actually tear inwards the first window

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.470 
actually tear inwards the first window
that<00:00:43.920> you're<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.280> put<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
that you're going to put in is the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
that you're going to put in is the
narrowest<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.649> what<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.829> want<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.219> you

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
narrowest so what you want to do is you

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.279 
narrowest so what you want to do is you
want<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.460> line<00:00:47.700> these<00:00:47.879> up<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.840> these<00:00:48.989> ones<00:00:49.200> are

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
want to line these up so these ones are

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.569 
want to line these up so these ones are
actually<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.649> different<00:00:50.039> height<00:00:50.280> which<00:00:50.550> is

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
actually a different height which is

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.610 
actually a different height which is
fine<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.660> biggest<00:00:52.020> thing<00:00:52.199> though<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.440> which

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
fine the biggest thing though is which

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.740 
fine the biggest thing though is which
one<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.100> narrowest<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.090> window<00:00:54.270> here

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
one is the narrowest so this window here

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.590 
one is the narrowest so this window here
is<00:00:55.020> actually<00:00:56.010> narrower<00:00:56.489> than<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.879> window

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
is actually narrower than that window

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.869 
is actually narrower than that window
there<00:00:57.780> which<00:00:58.109> means<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.530> goes<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.920> first<00:00:59.160> if

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
there which means it goes in first if

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.540 
there which means it goes in first if
you<00:01:00.000> try<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> put<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> wider<00:01:01.320> window<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.160> first

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
you try to put the wider window in first

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.520 
you try to put the wider window in first
you're<00:01:03.180> actually<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.660> jam<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.320> there

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
you're actually going to jam it in there

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.200 
you're actually going to jam it in there
you<00:01:04.739> could<00:01:04.890> break<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.339> these<00:01:05.460> clips<00:01:05.850> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you could break one of these clips you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.390 
you could break one of these clips you
could<00:01:06.330> break<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> actual<00:01:07.140> storm<00:01:07.860> frame<00:01:08.159> or

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
could break the actual storm frame or

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.039 
could break the actual storm frame or
the<00:01:08.490> glass<00:01:08.700> none<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.390> those<00:01:09.479> things<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.869> want

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the glass none of those things you want

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.960 
the glass none of those things you want
to<00:01:10.110> do<00:01:10.260> will<00:01:11.070> move<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> screen<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
to do will move the screen out of the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.370 
to do will move the screen out of the
way<00:01:13.280> take<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> narrowest<00:01:14.970> window<00:01:15.330> first<00:01:15.630> make

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
way take the narrowest window first make

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.899 
way take the narrowest window first make
sure<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.650> these<00:01:16.830> tabs<00:01:17.189> are<00:01:17.430> actually

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
