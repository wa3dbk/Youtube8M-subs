00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 hey people welcome exercise videos 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.680
 and that's what we want tonight in one 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.660
 small live stream 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.330
 before I now explain what exactly the 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:33.490
 then I start for a nice stone 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.710
 serve at 21 o'clock a little word pig 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.710
 Although we are playing the ethno company 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.330
 Graf Film Craft is a notebook which 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.540
 based on terra firma with a few 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.700
 small extra moss the the game 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.050
 still further to the large part one must 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.730
 first seen terra firma power so 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.370
 have played with all of what 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.470
 start to hear and since then I have 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.840
 Last time the company cook meant something 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.239
 very very short was as good as no 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.800
 terra firm body have played 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.460
 i almost no idea what when 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.229
 where why why do it with whom 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.619
 and therefore I will 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.200
 probably a bit 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.369
 But I can be stuck now 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.540
 maybe rely on you and 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.250
 maybe you are in it, too 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.970
 livestream maybe if consumers came 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.860
 here 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.210
 and at the moment we can do it all 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.400
 playing together 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.440
 If you are there, you can certainly be mine 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.760
 help because i help a bit 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.020
 could use right but yes quite 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.660
 Good to show you what they are in there 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.830
 is in this motto yes next to the 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.630
 basic things of this creative 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.640
 people are still so things here 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.370
 top like computer nothing or yes immediately 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.260
 I know both to be no more 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.910
 then there are ever sheriffs knows 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.440
 also not exactly the same as in part 2 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.300
 peters here are all the plates 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.150
 Company creates things with one still 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.060
 rather big then bibliographic 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.470
 decoration purposes computers of murder 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.479
 but is only to use if you 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.479
 really did everything with his 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.210
 company force the recipes here too 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.710
 so a little different 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.030
 left olaf what I think 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.460
 even not at all bad fits 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.250
 because this whole warcraft is one anyway 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.080
 bit realism is more realistic than 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.000
 many other technology klotz and so on 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.250
 a little bit here in this feeling with 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.530
 pure grasp his electric 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.810
 also relatively realistic offered the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.640
 Focused on the current with the 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.519
 Power is just not running ampere 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.170
 wanted and those with scrum and last 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.850
 side we still have the rangers 2 motto 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.890
 who built sometime then 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.269
 comes from ado and makes us everything 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.860
 broken so I hope you're happy 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.950
 as well as I insist that a tornado 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.360
 afterwards and my fun and messed up 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.950
 we would say under 16 o'clock only 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.950
 kitsch score or before 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.440
 then it is
