00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.870
 boys, how are we, I hope that 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.380
 let's all be very good just like me 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.550
 today in this video we are going to this beauty 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:17.130
 who is here 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:22.260
 what are the lenses of the new suit of 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.860
 spider-man 22 and we are going to give them also 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.240
 the web schÃ¼rrer 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.560
 already completed 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.210
 it's very similar right now , photos have already come out 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.580
 where it is seen in more detail in the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.190
 websites but then this is what I did 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.050
 I was very similar to the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.870
 original 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.090
 I like it very much you will judge 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.430
 you will say how they were but one 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.880
 which I definitely like 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.780
 very much 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.940
 it's really if they realize it's in this 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.760
 opportunity something that I liked that 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.750
 they kept the first movie is 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.910
 which are reflective just like these and 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.580
 I have the light off for you 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.040
 see the reflectives that are if they are given 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.870
 count there 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.900
 it is measured 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.900
 If the lenses are in full light 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.430
 you do not see the reflective because all the light 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.270
 of the lenses 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.950
 and it does not look like it will not be so effective if 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.440
 has to be one in one point of view 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.550
 then dark and that outside plus 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:37.800
 so that it looks has also the form 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.800
 curved as is the led 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.390
 and so 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.500
 I already have that I have the mind I have the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.680
 Launches networks 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.920
 I'm making a suit that is custom 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.750
 and that 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.750
 work 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.130
 and this is the material of the suit 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.740
 this is not the exact material I know that 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.970
 it's not, but it's already very similar 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.400
 and I like it a lot 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.560
 is a grid of your bricks as 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.350
 it's originally the movie but the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.310
 color is pretty pretty good I 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.310
 turn the light on 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.520
 again 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.240
 that is the color 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.940
 if they realize 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.950
 is very 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.870
 very nice 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.790
 and this is the theft for those who ask 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.510
 what is the pattern that is the pattern 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.150
 that is the pattern that I use reality 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.210
 it's not a pattern 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.000
 well 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.100
 but what one does is the cuts of the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.140
 suit for what 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.560
 so I do not use any kind of pattern 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.920
 the raw material is like that the red and the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.420
 It is also like that and so nothing 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.800
 boys, I hope you like the video 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.800
 they already know likes 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.580
 bye
