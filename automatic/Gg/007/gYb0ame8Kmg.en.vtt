epic

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.850 

we<00:00:55.360> hurried<00:00:55.630> all<00:00:55.780> season<00:00:56.200> that<00:00:56.440> they<00:00:56.680> had<00:00:56.830> a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
we hurried all season that they had a

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.560 
we hurried all season that they had a
good<00:00:57.040> snow<00:00:57.370> here<00:00:57.610> it's<00:00:57.730> been<00:00:57.880> snowing<00:00:58.330> a<00:00:58.390> lot

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
and when we got here we really couldn't

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.110 
and when we got here we really couldn't
believe<00:01:01.390> our<00:01:01.420> eyes<00:01:01.600> there's<00:01:02.440> snow<00:01:03.040> everywhere

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
believe our eyes there's snow everywhere

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.430 
believe our eyes there's snow everywhere
powder<00:01:04.120> everywhere<00:01:04.570> it's<00:01:04.930> like<00:01:05.050> really

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
powder everywhere it's like really

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.760 
powder everywhere it's like really
really<00:01:05.590> good<00:01:06.990> because<00:01:07.990> there's<00:01:08.200> so<00:01:08.350> much<00:01:08.530> snow

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
really good because there's so much snow

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.650 
really good because there's so much snow
here<00:01:08.890> it's<00:01:09.310> really<00:01:09.550> easy<00:01:09.730> to<00:01:09.880> find<00:01:10.210> bigger

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
here it's really easy to find bigger

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.930 
here it's really easy to find bigger
stuff<00:01:11.080> to<00:01:11.260> drop<00:01:11.500> off<00:01:11.740> stuff<00:01:12.040> that<00:01:12.310> I<00:01:12.460> probably

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
stuff to drop off stuff that I probably

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.120 
stuff to drop off stuff that I probably
would<00:01:13.360> think<00:01:13.630> twice<00:01:13.810> about<00:01:13.960> dropping<00:01:14.770> off<00:01:14.920> in

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
would think twice about dropping off in

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.580 
would think twice about dropping off in
Europe<00:01:15.460> because<00:01:15.910> in<00:01:16.150> in<00:01:16.780> Europe<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.320> fully

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
Europe because in in Europe you fully

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.400 
Europe because in in Europe you fully
got<00:01:17.950> moving<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.460> bit<00:01:18.640> of<00:01:18.790> powder<00:01:19.060> slow<00:01:19.450> and<00:01:19.660> and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
got moving a bit of powder slow and and

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.680 
got moving a bit of powder slow and and
maybe<00:01:20.650> a<00:01:20.740> rocker<00:01:21.610> some<00:01:21.820> ice<00:01:22.000> below<00:01:22.270> you<00:01:22.540> or

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
maybe a rocker some ice below you or

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.960 
maybe a rocker some ice below you or
certainly<00:01:23.020> this<00:01:23.260> season<00:01:23.680> anyway<00:01:24.070> so<00:01:24.729> it<00:01:24.850> was

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
certainly this season anyway so it was

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.180 
certainly this season anyway so it was
really<00:01:25.120> nice<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.690> just<00:01:25.870> day<00:01:26.110> take<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.560> cliff<00:01:26.920> and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
really nice to just day take a cliff and

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.790 
really nice to just day take a cliff and
jump<00:01:27.759> off<00:01:27.940> a<00:01:27.970> bit<00:01:28.240> knowing<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.780> if<00:01:29.200> I<00:01:29.470> didn't

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
jump off a bit knowing that if I didn't

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.710 
jump off a bit knowing that if I didn't
land<00:01:29.979> properly<00:01:30.520> it<00:01:30.729> didn't<00:01:30.970> really<00:01:31.060> matter<00:01:31.330> it

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
land properly it didn't really matter it

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.870 
land properly it didn't really matter it

I've been tumbling about lots as well
that's<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:35.830> part<00:01:36.310> of<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.550> fun<00:01:41.460> yeah<00:01:42.460> we've<00:01:42.759> been

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790

that bad often and it was pretty
physical<00:01:49.479> so<00:01:50.229> I<00:01:50.259> think<00:01:50.410> to<00:01:50.710> do<00:01:50.830> free<00:01:51.040> widening

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610

physical so I think to do free widening
need<00:01:51.970> a<00:01:52.000> good<00:01:52.560> physical<00:01:53.560> condition<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:55.180> fling

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
aspects of of this chick because she

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.460 
aspects of of this chick because she
doesn't<00:02:19.120> do<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.390> lot<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.600> food<00:02:19.900> writing<00:02:20.110> and

doesn't do a lot of food writing and

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.530 
doesn't do a lot of food writing and
she's<00:02:21.040> definitely<00:02:21.250> never<00:02:21.640> been<00:02:21.970> back<00:02:22.269> country

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540
