00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
the spirituality even though there's a

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.680 
the spirituality even though there's a
very<00:05:59.890> transient<00:06:02.280> combination<00:06:03.540> so<00:06:04.540> that

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
very transient combination so that

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.280 
very transient combination so that
people<00:06:05.050> will<00:06:05.230> come<00:06:05.590> some<00:06:06.370> transfer<00:06:06.970> as<00:06:07.930> little

people will come some transfer as little

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.160 
people will come some transfer as little
as<00:06:08.440> six<00:06:08.770> months<00:06:08.860> or<00:06:09.370> a<00:06:09.400> year<00:06:09.520> and<00:06:10.150> yet<00:06:10.750> because

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 
as six months or a year and yet because

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.040 
as six months or a year and yet because
of<00:06:11.530> that<00:06:11.740> initial<00:06:12.340> welcome<00:06:12.880> there's<00:06:13.810> the

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
of that initial welcome there's the

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.740 
of that initial welcome there's the
there's<00:06:14.470> the<00:06:14.590> ability<00:06:15.310> to<00:06:16.120> get<00:06:16.360> to<00:06:16.630> know

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
there's the ability to get to know

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.540 
there's the ability to get to know
people<00:06:17.200> quickly<00:06:17.380> and<00:06:17.770> then<00:06:17.920> I<00:06:18.070> think<00:06:18.340> that

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
people quickly and then I think that

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.860 
people quickly and then I think that
generates<00:06:19.180> its<00:06:19.420> own<00:06:21.210> openness<00:06:22.210> and<00:06:22.450> therefore

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
generates its own openness and therefore

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.460 
generates its own openness and therefore
depth<00:06:23.170> of<00:06:23.670> relationship<00:06:24.930> for<00:06:25.930> that<00:06:26.110> reason

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
depth of relationship for that reason

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:32.010 
depth of relationship for that reason
the<00:06:26.890> church<00:06:28.890> is<00:06:29.890> absolutely<00:06:30.580> vital<00:06:31.020> because

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
the church is absolutely vital because

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.650 
the church is absolutely vital because
that<00:06:32.440> is<00:06:32.680> a<00:06:32.710> stability<00:06:34.830> in<00:06:35.830> their<00:06:36.130> lives<00:06:36.660> where

that is a stability in their lives where

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.940 
that is a stability in their lives where
