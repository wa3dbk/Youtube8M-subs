00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hello, all guys and girls, how are you? 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.230
 you are hoping that very well since 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.900
 we walk a little plot what is the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.570
 reason why our 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.599
 vacation and we go back to the routine of 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.240
 work work and work 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.310
 we can say that we do it with the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.800
 recharged batteries with renewed energies 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.480
 and with a slight smile drawn on the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.400
 face that will help us face 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.880
 this new season this new course 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.070
 with more desire with more force with more 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.840
 energy as I say but I do not want to embitter 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.480
 with our sorrows we are not for 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.760
 that but to entertain them and to 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.070
 do so I'll tell you a little bit 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.140
 about our vacation 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.600
 We actually went to Madrid to 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.420
 barcelona two super cities two super 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.840
 capital cities immense huge and 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.079
 varied overwhelming cosmopolitan one 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.680
 dimension different from valencia one step 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.920
 above that I would not choose to cast 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.629
 roots that yes it is true valencia- me 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.400
 I really like it as a city to live in 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.930
 her to stay forever until the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.150
 end of the days 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.160
 so they have loved me because they have 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.520
 more possibilities have more 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.460
 restaurants more iconic sites 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.020
 more places to go out more stores greater 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.700
 range of possibilities and that's always 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.579
 it is good that there are more options where 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.829
 choose and fulfill it perfectly and 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.270
 well we've seen from there then 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.329
 countless things almost all 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.789
 typical of the area but everything has been 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.679
 especially thanks to the great company 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.770
 we've had there starting with 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.810
 madrid with super tomato and omega esp 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.490
 the first thing surely know 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.590
 youtube and if I 'm not going to put the link 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.090
 of your channel and the second one because maybe 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.939
 have you ever read it on twitter 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.210
 writing or writing me with him or 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.520
 with anna good 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.010
 the point is that they are two magnificent 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.320
 people we have already confirmed it 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.090
 We intuited by twitter on Skype that we 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.490
 We were going to wear very well and that's how it was 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.890
 we have confirmed that they are the host and 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.990
 from here send them a huge greeting a 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.790
 huge hug and tell them how good the 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.200
 we will repeat that surely when 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.959
 have a chance to stay again 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.150
 we will do it if they are clear good 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.170
 in Barcelona we have had the pleasure 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.580
 hand-held oven company a youtuber 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.690

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.370
 I also leave the link here in the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.620
 description and what to say then that we 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.830
 he welcomed us immediately invited us to his house to 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.290

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.640
 I wanna be the high that I almost have 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.100
 nightmares with the game is that of the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.040
 noses we also play a board game 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.330
 of monsters from tokyo hilarious 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.830
 in fact we loved it so much that 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.970
 surely we will buy it for our 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.280
 valÃ¨ncia level dinners and in general 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.069
 Thanks to them, thanks also to 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.829
 sergio sergio servÃ­n 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.480
 Well, we have had a visit 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.849
 even better than we expected 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.989
 Pleasant vacations and in general 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:02.269
 company in fact I have a theory and it's 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.950
 that the people we meet in person 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.810
 that you take YouTube less seriously or you 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.819
 he takes it as what is a hobby that does not 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.500
 is looking at numbers every day 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.620
 in the end we make better crumbs with 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.750
 they do not we do not have that feeling that 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.049
 they want us because we can see if we can 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.090
 give them likes and if such but that we 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.299
 they leave a full feeling of people of 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.319
 true not of number diggers but 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.749
 well you understand me finally 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.819
 that I wanted to tell you good apart 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:33.620
 gameplay that you see in the background pikmin 3 that 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.450
 with pikmin pass because as I said the 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.040
 again was going to analyze video of 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.010
 I already had it ready before I left 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.930
 of the trip was published on the 22nd it seems to me 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.579
 when the embargo ends and good 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.859
 understand that finally 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.950
 you have a game at the height of what is 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:51.019
 deserves uy a Mr. pikmin 3 so good 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.459
 better than the previous ones and that I've 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.169
 let this gameplay for you to try 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.599
 those who do not know him understand what 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:59.569
 is going to summarize it quickly is a 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:02.900
 kind of lemmings mixed with job 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:06.379
 Real-time war strategy 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.120
 good is complicated is so complicated 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.579
 that the best definition would be to say that 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.139
 It is a unique game and it is what it is 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.730
 unique and only game of nintendo 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.680
 so you already have an excuse for the 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.570
 that you do not have it to go thinking of 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.070
 another way he swallowed that he's taking the 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.539
 I'm going to wait 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.630
 surely a little more to anna than 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:28.009
 right now he's playing in a concert 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.680
 and nothing said that we come back with 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:32.659
 energies with desire to continue giving cane 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.159
 over here and see you right away 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:36.080
 although the month will be hard because we have 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:37.970
 game with ahead in a couple of 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.370
 I'm going to try to book a week 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.050
 little hole after leaving work 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.810
 after capturing and commenting all 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.669
 those mandala videos to be with 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.320

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.320
