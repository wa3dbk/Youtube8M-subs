square<00:01:23.520> or<00:01:24.150> rectangle<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.170> rectangle<00:01:25.470> yes<00:01:26.159> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
square or rectangle a rectangle yes and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.690 
square or rectangle a rectangle yes and
you<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.210> sure<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.770> position<00:01:29.220> this

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
you make sure that you position this

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.140 
you make sure that you position this
with<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.689> line<00:01:31.159> going<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.369> same<00:01:32.610> way<00:01:32.790> as<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
with that line going the same way as it

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.719 
with that line going the same way as it
is<00:01:33.270> there<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.590> seems<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.009> okay<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> can't

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
is there and it seems like okay I can't

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.160 
is there and it seems like okay I can't
tell<00:01:35.909> what<00:01:36.060> I'm<00:01:36.150> making<00:01:36.329> but<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.020> do

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
tell what I'm making but if you just do

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.230 
tell what I'm making but if you just do
a<00:01:37.200> quick<00:01:37.290> peak<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.250> peels<00:01:38.549> back<00:01:38.820> you'll

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
a quick peak as this peels back you'll

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.730 
a quick peak as this peels back you'll
see<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.600> these<00:01:39.780> then<00:01:40.049> are<00:01:40.229> going<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.500> matter

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
see that these then are going to matter

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.889 
see that these then are going to matter
and<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.400> double<00:01:41.790> check<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.210> once<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.600> right

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
and so double check that once it's right

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.899 
and so double check that once it's right
so<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.530> followed<00:01:43.829> right<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.460> diagrams

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
so it's a followed right the diagrams

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.490 
so it's a followed right the diagrams
are<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.420> patterns<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.110> reason<00:01:46.380> they're

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
are in the patterns for a reason they're

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.410 
are in the patterns for a reason they're
really<00:01:46.920> great<00:01:47.130> visually<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.939> now<00:01:48.119> you'll<00:01:48.270> do

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
really great visually so now you'll do

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.639 
really great visually so now you'll do
the<00:01:48.540> same<00:01:48.570> thing<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:48.960> don't<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.470> go

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the same thing so don't have you go

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.590 
the same thing so don't have you go
ahead<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.950> sew<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.159> one<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.570> you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
ahead and sew that one and this one you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.300 
ahead and sew that one and this one you
can<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:51.869> chain<00:01:52.290> piece<00:01:52.320> these<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.159> get

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
can just chain piece these if you get

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.209 
can just chain piece these if you get
them<00:01:53.399> all<00:01:53.549> marked<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.780> sew<00:01:55.110> every<00:01:55.829> single

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
make these two units short clothesline

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.229 
make these two units short clothesline
so<00:02:24.819> we're<00:02:25.000> gonna<00:02:25.120> just<00:02:25.450> check<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:26.050> make<00:02:26.200> sure

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
so we're gonna just check to make sure

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.720 
so we're gonna just check to make sure
snip<00:02:28.239> those<00:02:28.450> apart<00:02:28.840> all<00:02:29.470> right<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.580> first

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
snip those apart all right so the first

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.670 
snip those apart all right so the first
thing<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:31.239> I<00:02:31.269> always<00:02:31.390> like<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.870> do<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.410> fold

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
thing that I always like to do is fold

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.180 
thing that I always like to do is fold
this<00:02:32.950> back<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.700> make<00:02:34.480> sure<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:35.200> looks<00:02:35.500> right

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
this back and make sure it looks right

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.250 
this back and make sure it looks right
yours<00:02:36.849> matches<00:02:37.300> yours<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.720> mine<00:02:37.870> matches

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
yours matches yours and mine matches

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.710 
yours matches yours and mine matches
mine<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:38.769> we<00:02:38.890> can<00:02:39.040> get<00:02:39.370> correctly<00:02:39.790> now<00:02:40.269> and

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
mine so we can get correctly now and

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.410 
mine so we can get correctly now and
then<00:02:41.200> you're<00:02:41.349> gonna<00:02:41.470> just<00:02:41.769> cut<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:42.880> off<00:02:43.120> I

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
then you're gonna just cut this off I

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.479 
then you're gonna just cut this off I
like<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.930> use<00:02:44.230> my<00:02:44.470> ruler<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.800> rotary<00:02:45.280> cutter

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
like to use my ruler and rotary cutter

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.720 
like to use my ruler and rotary cutter
because<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:45.940> think<00:02:46.090> it's<00:02:46.330> faster<00:02:46.780> but<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:48.610> can

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
because I think it's faster but you can

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.430 
because I think it's faster but you can
also<00:02:48.880> just<00:02:49.120> use<00:02:49.420> scissors<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.989> do<00:02:50.260> this

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
also just use scissors to do this

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.000 
also just use scissors to do this
because<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.760> already<00:02:51.940> know<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.739> your<00:02:53.739> seam

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
because you already know that your seam

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.820 
because you already know that your seam
line<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.580> in<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.760> correct<00:02:55.120> place<00:02:55.440> so<00:02:56.440> I<00:02:56.470> put

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
line is in the correct place so I put

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.170 
line is in the correct place so I put
the<00:02:56.920> quarter<00:02:57.250> inch<00:02:57.400> line<00:02:57.640> along<00:02:58.000> that

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
the quarter inch line along that

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.850 
the quarter inch line along that
stitching<00:02:58.480> line<00:02:58.780> but<00:02:58.989> you<00:02:59.080> wouldn't<00:02:59.380> have<00:02:59.590> to

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
stitching line but you wouldn't have to

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.199 
stitching line but you wouldn't have to
this<00:03:00.400> is<00:03:00.549> where<00:03:00.730> just<00:03:00.970> these<00:03:01.030> little

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
this is where just these little

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.240 
this is where just these little
triangles<00:03:01.810> are<00:03:02.019> our<00:03:02.140> waist<00:03:02.380> so<00:03:02.650> let's<00:03:02.920> go<00:03:03.130> away

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
triangles are our waist so let's go away

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.309 
triangles are our waist so let's go away
I<00:03:03.730> suppose<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.660> could<00:03:04.810> save<00:03:04.989> them<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.230> do

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
I suppose you could save them and do

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.430 
I suppose you could save them and do
something<00:03:05.680> really<00:03:05.830> tiny<00:03:06.190> later<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:08.110> now<00:03:08.140> we're

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
something really tiny later so now we're

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.520 
something really tiny later so now we're
going<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.799> press<00:03:09.299> these<00:03:10.299> I<00:03:10.690> just<00:03:10.720> set<00:03:11.080> my<00:03:11.110> seam

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
going to press these I just set my seam

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.470 
going to press these I just set my seam
and<00:03:11.769> press<00:03:11.830> it<00:03:12.819> toward<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.180> triangle<00:03:15.480> that

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
and press it toward the triangle that

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.870 
and press it toward the triangle that
one<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:18.010> same<00:03:18.220> thing<00:03:18.489> with<00:03:18.640> this<00:03:18.820> one

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
one and the same thing with this one

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.960 
one and the same thing with this one
part<00:03:19.720> of<00:03:20.019> getting<00:03:20.320> a<00:03:20.620> nice<00:03:20.950> quilt<00:03:21.430> block<00:03:21.670> it's

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
part of getting a nice quilt block it's

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.060 
part of getting a nice quilt block it's
depressed<00:03:22.420> as<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.660> go<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:23.410> notice<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.799> press

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
depressed as you go you notice you press

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.940 
depressed as you go you notice you press
the<00:03:24.280> seam<00:03:24.489> flat<00:03:24.810> then<00:03:25.810> opened<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.410> up<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.799> want

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
the seam flat then opened it up you want

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.860 
the seam flat then opened it up you want
up<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.190> fibers<00:03:27.549> they<00:03:27.760> tend<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.090> bend<00:03:28.359> easier

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
up the fibers they tend to bend easier

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.300 
up the fibers they tend to bend easier
and<00:03:29.140> nice<00:03:29.350> crisp<00:03:29.709> alright

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
and nice crisp alright

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
so now we're ready to join these into

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.270 
so now we're ready to join these into
units<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.269> what<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.660> want<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:34.900> do<00:03:35.079> is<00:03:35.380> take

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
units and what you want to do is take

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.960 
units and what you want to do is take
this<00:03:36.459> long<00:03:36.900> side<00:03:37.900> of<00:03:38.290> each<00:03:38.470> one<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:39.130> put<00:03:39.730> them

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
this long side of each one and put them

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.809 
this long side of each one and put them
together<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.799> little<00:03:42.010> triangles<00:03:42.519> are<00:03:42.790> in

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
together so the little triangles are in

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.360 
together so the little triangles are in
opposite<00:03:43.540> corners<00:03:43.600> yep<00:03:44.410> exactly

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
opposite corners yep exactly

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.920

have<00:04:04.299> your<00:04:04.420> block<00:04:04.720> so<00:04:05.049> you<00:04:05.109> would<00:04:05.410> join<00:04:05.950> them

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.819 
would press the seams the opposite
direction<00:04:13.150> so<00:04:13.329> when<00:04:13.810> you<00:04:13.930> join<00:04:14.350> those<00:04:14.530> two

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
direction so when you join those two

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.129
