out though is within one CNC different
types<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.259> tool<00:01:31.409> paths<00:01:31.680> are<00:01:31.920> called

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
types of tool paths are called

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.340 
types of tool paths are called
operations<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.479> if<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.689> were<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.930> profile

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
operations so if you were to profile

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.020 
operations so if you were to profile
something<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:34.950> called<00:01:35.159> an<00:01:35.280> operation<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
something it's called an operation a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.630 
something it's called an operation a
pocket<00:01:36.630> that's<00:01:36.840> also<00:01:37.229> an<00:01:37.350> operation<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.100> all

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
pocket that's also an operation and all

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.789 
pocket that's also an operation and all
your<00:01:38.850> operations<00:01:39.509> are<00:01:39.659> stored<00:01:39.990> here<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.740> you

tools now these tools are for verifying

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.090 
tools now these tools are for verifying
geometry<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:52.079> example<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.770> interrogate

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
geometry for example you can interrogate

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.429 
geometry for example you can interrogate
an<00:01:53.460> arc<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.939> find<00:01:54.149> out<00:01:54.329> its<00:01:54.509> location<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.290> its

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
an arc and find out its location and its

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.310 
an arc and find out its location and its
arc<00:01:55.710> radius<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.780> interrogate<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
arc radius you can interrogate the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.069 
arc radius you can interrogate the
surface<00:01:59.159> area<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.759> part<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.329> location<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.990> a

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
surface area of a part the location of a

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.840 
surface area of a part the location of a
vertice<00:02:01.590> or<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.860> distance<00:02:02.189> between<00:02:02.310> two

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
vertice or the distance between two

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.330 
vertice or the distance between two
points<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.840> think<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:05.040> area

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
points so think of this as the area

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.059 
points so think of this as the area
where<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.880> can<00:02:06.090> access<00:02:06.450> all<00:02:06.930> your

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
projects something to point out for

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.800 
projects something to point out for
example<00:02:38.550> let's<00:02:39.060> say<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.240> want<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.480> load<00:02:39.660> this

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
example let's say I want to load this

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.630 
example let's say I want to load this
part<00:02:40.110> I'm<00:02:40.290> gonna<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:40.770> left-click<00:02:41.070> on<00:02:41.280> that

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
part I'm gonna just left-click on that

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.880 
part I'm gonna just left-click on that
okay<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:42.390> there's<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.930> part<00:02:43.170> what's

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
okay so there's the part what's

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.920 
okay so there's the part what's
interesting<00:02:44.100> about<00:02:44.459> one<00:02:44.790> CNC<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:45.810> a

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
interesting about one CNC is that it's a

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.800 
interesting about one CNC is that it's a
multi<00:02:46.440> document<00:02:47.190> application<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.209> what<00:02:48.630> that

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
multi document application and what that

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.750 
multi document application and what that
means<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.650> can<00:02:49.830> be<00:02:49.950> working<00:02:50.400> on<00:02:50.520> more

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
means is that you can be working on more

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.670 
means is that you can be working on more
than<00:02:50.940> one<00:02:51.180> document<00:02:51.840> at<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.050> same<00:02:52.200> time

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
than one document at the same time

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.040 
than one document at the same time
within<00:02:52.920> one<00:02:53.220> CNC<00:02:53.790> let<00:02:54.360> me<00:02:54.450> give<00:02:54.600> me<00:02:54.660> an<00:02:54.750> example

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
within one CNC let me give me an example

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.660 
within one CNC let me give me an example
you<00:02:55.320> can<00:02:55.470> see<00:02:55.650> I've<00:02:55.770> already<00:02:55.920> loaded<00:02:56.520> this

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
you can see I've already loaded this

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.670 
you can see I've already loaded this
part<00:02:57.000> file<00:02:57.270> let's<00:02:57.959> load<00:02:58.140> another<00:02:58.410> one<00:02:58.620> I'm

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
part file let's load another one I'm

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.260 
part file let's load another one I'm
gonna<00:02:58.830> go<00:02:58.920> back<00:02:59.130> here<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.370> recent<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.120> I'm

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
gonna go back here to recent and I'm

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.190 
gonna go back here to recent and I'm
gonna<00:03:00.480> just<00:03:01.320> left-click<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:02.540> okay<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:04.080> we

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
gonna just left-click that okay so we

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.320 
gonna just left-click that okay so we
have<00:03:04.320> two<00:03:04.500> parts<00:03:04.860> here<00:03:05.100> if<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.640> want<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:05.940> work<00:03:06.090> on

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
have two parts here if I want to work on

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.390 
have two parts here if I want to work on
both<00:03:06.690> parts<00:03:07.050> at<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.290> same<00:03:07.530> time<00:03:07.800> I<00:03:07.830> can<00:03:08.160> go<00:03:08.280> up

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
both parts at the same time I can go up

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.580 
both parts at the same time I can go up
here<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.610> window<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.270> we'll<00:03:09.570> select<00:03:09.810> cascade

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
here to window and we'll select cascade

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.400 
here to window and we'll select cascade
and<00:03:10.860> now<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.400> can<00:03:11.640> see<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:12.000> we<00:03:12.180> have<00:03:12.450> all<00:03:12.900> the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
and now you can see that we have all the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.590 
and now you can see that we have all the
parts<00:03:13.590> up<00:03:13.860> here<00:03:14.130> okay<00:03:14.850> there's<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.510> original

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
parts up here okay there's the original

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.360 
parts up here okay there's the original
part<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.290> started<00:03:16.709> with<00:03:16.800> there's<00:03:17.040> nothing

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
part I started with there's nothing

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.890
