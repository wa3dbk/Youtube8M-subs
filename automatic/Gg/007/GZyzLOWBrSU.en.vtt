00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.290
 there are those who minute here I bring 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.700
 new video one of the new videos that 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.280
 I will be bringing to the channel because 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.930
 new video here you mean I talk about the 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.340
 edition of the video I want to give you a lot 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.220
 more effort to the channel because for the 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.830
 they did not know we did not know the channel 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.200
 he dies and you want that if he dies 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.140
 Well, if I've been erased lately 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.520
 approximately 40 videos or more and they have 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.670
 removed 400,000 views or more 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.530
 shit if I fuck that without counting that the 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.510
 views have gone down along with the likes 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.270
 so I've decided to make a change in 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.000
 the resounding channel could you explain us 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.530
 Of course, as you can see, I will try hard 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.020
 more in the issues I will bring to more games 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.330
 indie I will give more variety in itself but only 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.009
 we like my sister in believing i know and 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.509
 that will not stop in the channel but 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.330
 I want you to give more opportunity to 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.100
 others co2 and maybe they have a better time 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.990
 and well then after all this 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.550
 monologue here done in my head the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.380
 I really wanted to tell you, I know 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.520
 that the subject is a bit serious but the 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.950
 I do not really care and the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.360
 reproductions neither the views nor the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.460
 videos good in part the videos yes 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.380
 because I have part of my effort but 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.960
 the truth I think this is like a 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.670
 I start a start from scratch that I want 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.100
 do I want to do the videos again 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.410
 as before I want to make them or even 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.230
 better as they see better editions and 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.670
 everything I used to spend a lot of time before 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.190
 editing and that because I liked it now 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.200
 he just recorded a video I play him 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.420
 the truth that I do not like me I want 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.820
 back to how it was before and well I hope 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.320
 that you really do not support I saw 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.270
 who used to support him long after 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.430
 that I did not do it anymore and it gave me a little 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.619
 little laziness stopped for good 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.930
 to do it literally ok but good 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.520
 apart from this I want to tell you that in 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.110
 the channel is also going to have a series 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.880
 I do not know how it's going to be called but 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.770
 will be showing previous plugins of 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.440
 minecraft because I do this I'm going to more than 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.390
 Because I see nothing that you will 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.190
 I really liked the series of creating a 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.230
 server from zero percent where they 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.630
 he taught how to make his servers and 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.060
 all those things as well I now 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.610
 is bringing plugins more than anything 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.380
 premium or pay but I'll see if 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.210
 is the possibility of raffling them are 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.590
 the quanta to you or give it to him 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.900
 without you having to pay anything 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.880
 because I bring them because I plan to bring 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.440
 more than anything premium because if you 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.950
 fixing are the most fun that is 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.170
 they are the most parents to me it seems for something 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.520
 They are paid and I want something as different 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.210
 in the channel because if I bring you something 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.470
 basic as basic x plugins that are 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.000
 find anywhere because the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.720
 it's true that he loses a little 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.950
 sense of the video but well I hope that 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.200
 also support that series I'll be 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.610
 also raffling those good the prince 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.750
 which is bringing clear if the owner 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.130
 access but actions well then to 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.660
 the best I do not even review from 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.580
 you and more than anything because I do not want 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.410
 that you stay without anything ok and 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.970
 I was also going to tell them how good 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.440
 something happened on my server yesterday already 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.120
 they know that my server always 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.040
 I leave the description by the way is he 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.750
 that also involves the screen 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.209
 and the impression that I leave it here but 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.189
 well it happened some skyworks that I 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.650
 I tried to improve I wanted to bring them 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.629
 new maps for you to play 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.549
 because many did not want it and well I 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.980
 I tried to bring them but there was a 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.569
 error trying to improve messages and 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.109
 all therefore to exhibit a little better not 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.420
 Well, what happened was that by moving 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.950
 messages a super awful bug happened 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.629
 that made it clear they will not be good 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.760
 erased is that statistics continue 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.010
 archived but not as loading 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.200
 that is the problem because more than anything 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.409
 important in on and so good 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.280
 thanks to this I am going to bring you a flame 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:56.049
 a draw of two megas ranks and one 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.450
 fine you already know so that you can 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.889
 vote for the time of day for all those 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.720
 things he pinches think that 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.730
 it's just the ultra so good that 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.099
 I'm going to be doing it here in 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.340
 the facebook group the microphone of 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.840
 facebook as it is called server 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.220
 You know , I leave you the 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.840
 description in case you want to spend 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.939
 and they want to participate I do not know here not what 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.590
 I'll do maybe in the afternoon but more 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.530
 that nothing then is to help them as a 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.870
 reimburse you what is enough 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.389
 of what happened because the truth many and 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.120
 they bothered others equal gave equal 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.620
 everything that happened and good to me did not give me 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.760
 anyway I want to give them something in return and 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.800
 Well, as it does not cost me 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.870
 practically give them a range you 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.700
 but of course what are the ranges and not 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.530
 donate but well, this is a 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.139
 special situation and more than anything else 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.880
 that's why I'm going to do it ok I hope that if 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.580
 you are interested in this because 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.840
 that they go to and reach to arm the group 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.910
 lest I'm not going to post it if 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.740
 you see that he already says something like luck 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.840
 or something like that, they are already participating 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.730
 I think that's what I'm going to say 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.980
 participated or something like that because the truth 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.870
 they do not need to do much since 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.210
 He's practically like a narrator of mine 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.490
 trying to converse by compensating the 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.410
 you here so well I hope that 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.390
 you liked this video I do not know how much 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.190
 the gameplay is left if you do not have any left 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.080
 so much good I hope that if they want 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.520
 you can go or you can leave the 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.229
 example and until the end so they see 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.280
 as good, I hope you have 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.450
 liked and see you in the next 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.450
 we live bye
