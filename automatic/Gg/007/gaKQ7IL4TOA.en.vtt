00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
exhaust is it has a beltronics escape in

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.359 
exhaust is it has a beltronics escape in
there<00:00:19.720> you<00:00:19.869> can<00:00:19.990> open<00:00:20.380> valve<00:00:20.619> in<00:00:20.860> closed<00:00:21.100> valve

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
there you can open valve in closed valve

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.750 
there you can open valve in closed valve
so<00:00:22.360> when<00:00:22.750> you<00:00:22.869> want<00:00:23.110> to<00:00:23.230> be<00:00:23.349> quiet<00:00:23.619> you<00:00:24.580> can

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
and while free flow you can open the

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.900 
and while free flow you can open the
valve<00:00:31.150> right<00:00:31.989> now<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.619> muffler<00:00:33.040> the<00:00:33.520> valve<00:00:33.730> is

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
valve right now the muffler the valve is

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
know you can hear the different on the

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:21.160 
know you can hear the different on the
sound<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.680> I'm<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> flow<00:01:11.310> out<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.610> farm

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.929 

right<00:01:22.170> now<00:01:22.290> basically<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.130> free<00:01:23.340> flow<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
right now basically it's a free flow and

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.450 
right now basically it's a free flow and
then<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.900> has<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> very<00:01:25.409> unique<00:01:25.560> function<00:01:26.310> that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
then it has a very unique function that

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.760 
then it has a very unique function that
is<00:01:26.610> only<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> world<00:01:27.930> right<00:01:28.350> now<00:01:28.409> it's

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
is only one in the world right now it's

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.370 
is only one in the world right now it's
the<00:01:28.860> ultra<00:01:29.310> function<00:01:29.869> what<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.020> mean<00:01:31.229> is

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
the ultra function what that mean is

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590 
the ultra function what that mean is
when<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.650> press<00:01:31.860> alt<00:01:32.100> oh<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:33.210> see<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
when you press alt oh you see the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.230 
when you press alt oh you see the
modulation<00:01:34.259> become<00:01:34.710> quiet<00:01:35.040> what<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.850> mean<00:01:36.180> is

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
modulation become quiet what I mean is

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.850 
modulation become quiet what I mean is
the<00:01:37.140> valve<00:01:37.470> will<00:01:37.770> open<00:01:39.110> whatever<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.320> set<00:01:40.649> on

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the valve will open whatever you set on

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.850 
the valve will open whatever you set on
the<00:01:41.130> RPN<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.140> also<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> throttle

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the RPN and also on the throttle

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.639 
the RPN and also on the throttle
position<00:01:44.399> sensor<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.810> set<00:01:46.170> whatever

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
position sensor so you can set whatever

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.070 
position sensor so you can set whatever
you<00:01:46.860> want<00:01:47.060> when<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.090> want<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.420> valve<00:01:48.630> open

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
you want when you want a valve open

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.800 
you want when you want a valve open
which<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.440> great<00:01:49.920> because<00:01:50.190> a<00:01:50.549> CD<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.630> want

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
which is great because a CD you want

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.840 
which is great because a CD you want
more<00:01:51.930> torque<00:01:52.319> you<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.429> have<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> valve

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
more torque you can have the valve

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.790 
more torque you can have the valve
closed<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.750> then<00:01:54.869> when<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.080> full<00:01:55.289> throttle

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
closed and then when you full throttle

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.100 
closed and then when you full throttle
when<00:01:56.039> it<00:01:56.159> heads<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.390> setting<00:01:57.720> you<00:01:57.840> said

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
when it heads to the setting you said

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.070 
when it heads to the setting you said
the<00:01:58.979> valve<00:01:59.220> open<00:01:59.759> may<00:01:59.970> become<00:02:00.300> free<00:02:00.539> flow<00:02:00.810> so

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
the valve open may become free flow so

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.380 
the valve open may become free flow so
that's<00:02:01.289> this<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.100> very<00:02:02.399> unique<00:02:02.940> and<00:02:03.179> i

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
that's this it's a very unique and i

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.529 
that's this it's a very unique and i
like<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.810> muffler<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.319> lot<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.060> later<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.270> as

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
like this muffler a lot and later on as

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.600 
like this muffler a lot and later on as
