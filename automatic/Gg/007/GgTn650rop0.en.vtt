00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
you around that just kind of plan on

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.809 
you around that just kind of plan on
keeping<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.880> board<00:02:41.120> just<00:02:41.330> trying<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.750> you

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.140 

Oh

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.530 

the<00:02:52.150> whole<00:02:52.299> slide<00:02:52.629> show<00:02:52.900> part<00:02:54.540> pretty

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
the whole slide show part pretty

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.479 
the whole slide show part pretty
complicated<00:02:56.290> but<00:02:56.469> once<00:02:56.739> you<00:02:56.890> get<00:02:57.010> down<00:02:57.159> with

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
complicated but once you get down with

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.319 
complicated but once you get down with
the<00:02:57.519> 180<00:02:57.969> it's<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.359> keeper<00:02:58.540> easy<00:02:58.840> so<00:03:00.329> I'm

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
the 180 it's a keeper easy so I'm

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.149 
the 180 it's a keeper easy so I'm
slideshow<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:01.959> goods<00:03:02.200> actually<00:03:02.620> click<00:03:03.010> it

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
slideshow of goods actually click it

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.179 
slideshow of goods actually click it
unless<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.430> want<00:03:03.609> a<00:03:03.640> slideshow<00:03:04.150> instead<00:03:04.930> of

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
unless you want a slideshow instead of

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:10.319 
unless you want a slideshow instead of
like<00:03:06.189> 48<00:03:06.760> hours<00:03:07.150> before<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.569> joke<00:03:07.750> applied<00:03:09.329> so

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
like 48 hours before a joke applied so

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.550 
like 48 hours before a joke applied so
that<00:03:10.359> would<00:03:10.629> be<00:03:10.659> like<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.959> combination<00:03:11.200> of

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
that would be like the combination of

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.089 
that would be like the combination of
clothes<00:03:11.799> stylism<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:13.810> if<00:03:14.079> you<00:03:14.170> have<00:03:14.290> both<00:03:14.530> both

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
clothes stylism so if you have both both

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.929 
clothes stylism so if you have both both
of<00:03:15.250> those<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.579> should<00:03:15.609> be<00:03:15.939> pretty<00:03:16.090> good<00:03:16.439> so<00:03:17.439> I

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:17.939 
of those I should be pretty good so I

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:34.399 
of those I should be pretty good so I
know<00:03:19.260> tried<00:03:20.260> demonstrate<00:03:20.769> again

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.789 

all<00:03:35.409> right<00:03:35.560> now<00:03:35.739> just<00:03:35.860> talk<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:38.590> I'm

all right now just talk so I'm

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.429 
all right now just talk so I'm
troubleshooting<00:03:39.579> with<00:03:39.819> that<00:03:40.090> would<00:03:40.299> be<00:03:40.450> nuts

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 
troubleshooting with that would be nuts

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.030 
troubleshooting with that would be nuts
looking<00:03:41.769> hard<00:03:42.040> enough<00:03:43.260> or<00:03:44.260> just<00:03:44.530> not<00:03:44.650> dragging

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
looking hard enough or just not dragging

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.670 
looking hard enough or just not dragging
it<00:03:45.099> far<00:03:45.280> enough<00:03:45.959> dragging<00:03:46.959> it<00:03:47.079> gets<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.470> about

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
it far enough dragging it gets you about

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.240 
it far enough dragging it gets you about
the<00:03:47.860> 18<00:03:48.190> here<00:03:48.340> in<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.519> 90<00:03:48.879> and<00:03:50.980> me<00:03:51.129> would
