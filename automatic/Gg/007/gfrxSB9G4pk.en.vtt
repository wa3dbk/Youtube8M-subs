multiple samples to me but somehow

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.649 
multiple samples to me but somehow
you're<00:01:32.130> doing<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.060> would<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.630> to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
you're doing it so I would like to

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.319 
you're doing it so I would like to
receive<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> lot<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.530> these<00:01:34.770> tempur-pedic

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
receive a lot of these tempur-pedic

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.510 
receive a lot of these tempur-pedic
memory<00:01:36.329> foam<00:01:36.630> things<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.829> construct<00:01:38.369> a

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
memory foam things so I can construct a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.969 
memory foam things so I can construct a
bed<00:01:38.790> completely<00:01:39.509> out<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.869> samples<00:01:40.470> just

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
bed completely out of samples just

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.069 
bed completely out of samples just
millions<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.970> millions<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.540> these<00:01:42.750> little

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
millions and millions of these little

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.260 
millions and millions of these little
tiny<00:01:43.350> samples<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.549> yeah<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.790> someone<00:01:45.030> wants<00:01:45.240> to

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
tiny samples so yeah if someone wants to

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.039 
tiny samples so yeah if someone wants to
link<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.990> where<00:01:46.860> they<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.430> sign<00:01:47.909> me<00:01:48.180> up<00:01:48.210> for

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
link to where they can sign me up for

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.679 
link to where they can sign me up for
these<00:01:49.320> samples<00:01:49.979> down<00:01:50.520> below<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> comments

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
these samples down below in the comments

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.050 
these samples down below in the comments
that<00:01:52.170> would<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.470> awesome<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.610> all<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.790> you

that would be awesome so that all of you
guys<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.570> send<00:01:54.899> me<00:01:55.250> memory<00:01:56.250> foam<00:01:56.340> samples<00:01:57.270> but

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
guys can send me memory foam samples but

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.120 
guys can send me memory foam samples but
I<00:01:57.719> urge<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.110> click<00:01:58.350> one<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.710> those<00:01:58.890> three
