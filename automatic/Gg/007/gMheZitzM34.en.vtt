00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.860 
have been getting a few more things done
here<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> machine<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.480> I'm<00:00:48.570> gonna<00:00:48.690> give

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
here on the machine and I'm gonna give

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.520 
here on the machine and I'm gonna give
you<00:00:48.960> guys<00:00:49.079> an<00:00:49.260> update<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.960> when<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:51.989> first<00:00:52.290> built

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
you guys an update so when I first built

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.350 
you guys an update so when I first built
this<00:00:52.710> thing<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.220> used<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.730> tubing<00:00:54.090> bender

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
this thing I used the tubing bender

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.500 
this thing I used the tubing bender
quite<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> bit<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.610> what<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.059> means<00:00:57.300> is

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
quite a bit and so what that means is

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.240 
quite a bit and so what that means is
that<00:00:57.540> there's<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> lot<00:00:58.409> of<00:00:58.440> areas<00:00:58.890> anymore

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that there's not a lot of areas anymore

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.850 
that there's not a lot of areas anymore
that<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.699> use<00:01:00.360> as<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> reference<00:01:00.839> to<00:01:01.320> true<00:01:01.680> up

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
that I can use as a reference to true up

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.700 
that I can use as a reference to true up
the<00:01:01.890> rear<00:01:02.400> suspension<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.050> have<00:01:04.470> been

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
the rear suspension but I have been

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.570 
the rear suspension but I have been
using<00:01:04.890> one<00:01:05.610> area<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.149> it's<00:01:06.360> pretty<00:01:07.110> effective

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
using one area and it's pretty effective

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.649 
using one area and it's pretty effective
and<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> original<00:01:09.119> frame

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and it's one of the original frame

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.310 
and it's one of the original frame
pieces<00:01:09.930> right<00:01:10.920> down<00:01:11.190> there<00:01:11.810> it<00:01:12.810> goes<00:01:13.050> across

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
pieces right down there it goes across

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.980 
pieces right down there it goes across
like<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.160> it's<00:01:14.759> Square<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.600> machine

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
like that and it's Square to the machine

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.200 
like that and it's Square to the machine
so<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.130> see<00:01:17.399> it<00:01:17.490> there<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:17.789> got<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> bit

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
so you can see it there it's got a bit

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.570 
so you can see it there it's got a bit
of<00:01:18.240> red<00:01:18.450> paint<00:01:18.660> on<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.280> I've<00:01:20.490> been

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
of red paint on it so I've been

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.870 
of red paint on it so I've been
referencing<00:01:21.210> off<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.729> you<00:01:23.729> guys

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
referencing off of that and you guys

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.389 
referencing off of that and you guys
also<00:01:24.240> remember<00:01:24.660> in<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.350> video<00:01:25.770> or<00:01:25.860> two<00:01:25.890> back<00:01:26.220> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
of extra tubing how to tack weld it

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.029 
of extra tubing how to tack weld it
underneath<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.660> machine<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.649> use<00:01:31.830> as<00:01:32.009> a

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
underneath the machine just to use as a

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.090 
underneath the machine just to use as a
table<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.670> prop<00:01:32.970> all<00:01:33.149> kinds<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.479> stuff<00:01:33.690> up<00:01:33.869> with

table to prop all kinds of stuff up with
well<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.280> tubing<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.729> still<00:01:35.910> here<00:01:36.270> see<00:01:37.110> it's

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
well that tubing is still here see it's

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.370 
well that tubing is still here see it's
still<00:01:37.470> being<00:01:37.619> used<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.990> but<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.110> I've<00:01:40.229> got

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
still being used and but now I've got

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.109 
still being used and but now I've got
one<00:01:40.800> in<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.009> different<00:01:41.130> location<00:01:41.399> here<00:01:41.970> and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
done is I I true this piece of tubing up

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.050 
done is I I true this piece of tubing up
against<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.259> original<00:02:02.250> frame<00:02:02.580> rail<00:02:02.819> right

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
against that original frame rail right

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.430 
against that original frame rail right
there<00:02:03.239> the<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.479> with<00:02:03.539> the<00:02:03.750> red<00:02:03.869> paint<00:02:04.080> on<00:02:04.259> it

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
there the one with the red paint on it

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.949 
there the one with the red paint on it
so<00:02:05.220> I<00:02:05.250> made<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.670> made<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> measurement<00:02:06.630> from

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
so I made that made the measurement from

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.750 
so I made that made the measurement from
here<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.349> there<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.560> same<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.310> both<00:02:08.610> sides<00:02:10.760> so

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
here to there the same on both sides so

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.059 
here to there the same on both sides so
what<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.090> means<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.690> now<00:02:13.590> I've<00:02:13.739> got<00:02:13.920> this

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
what that means is now I've got this

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.729 
what that means is now I've got this
honkin<00:02:14.550> long<00:02:14.730> piece<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.390> tubing<00:02:15.750> which<00:02:16.560> is

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
honkin long piece of tubing which is

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.550 
honkin long piece of tubing which is
longer<00:02:16.950> than<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:18.209> machine<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.660> wide<00:02:18.900> going

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
longer than the machine is wide going

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.500 
longer than the machine is wide going
the<00:02:19.739> length<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.160> machine<00:02:20.459> here<00:02:20.489> or<00:02:20.849> is<00:02:21.000> all

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
the length of the machine here or is all

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.690 
the length of the machine here or is all
the<00:02:21.599> way<00:02:21.690> along<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.870> back<00:02:22.020> there<00:02:22.520> well<00:02:23.520> that's

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
the way along the back there well that's

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.900 
the way along the back there well that's
a<00:02:23.849> true<00:02:24.060> piece<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.170> can<00:02:25.410> reference<00:02:25.910> this

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
a true piece that I can reference this

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.080 
a true piece that I can reference this
bearing<00:02:27.870> carrier<00:02:28.200> against<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.550> what<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:29.940> saw

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
bearing carrier against so what you saw

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.030 
bearing carrier against so what you saw
me<00:02:30.239> doing<00:02:30.390> earlier<00:02:30.810> there<00:02:31.080> as<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.440> was<00:02:31.590> uh<00:02:31.620> just

me doing earlier there as I was uh just

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.979 
me doing earlier there as I was uh just
putting<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.030> level<00:02:33.300> on<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.599> machine<00:02:33.870> in

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
putting a level on the machine in

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.229 
putting a level on the machine in
different<00:02:34.319> different<00:02:34.709> areas<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.280> true<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.150> up

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
different different areas to true it up

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.509 
different different areas to true it up
and<00:02:36.480> what<00:02:37.349> I'm<00:02:37.440> trying<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.769> do<00:02:37.920> here<00:02:38.190> right<00:02:38.220> now

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
and what I'm trying to do here right now

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.800 
and what I'm trying to do here right now
is<00:02:40.069> get<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.220> lengths<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.879> tubing<00:02:42.239> correct

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
is get the lengths of the tubing correct

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.309 
is get the lengths of the tubing correct
for<00:02:43.170> these<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.650> arms<00:02:43.950> because<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.370> want<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.580> start

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
for these a arms because I want to start

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.920 
for these a arms because I want to start
making<00:02:46.319> them<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:47.790> originally<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.360> had<00:02:48.660> only

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
making them so originally I had only

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.590 
making them so originally I had only
tack<00:02:49.260> welded<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:50.430> front<00:02:50.970> here<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.420> left

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
tack welded the front here and I left

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.920 
tack welded the front here and I left
the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.839 
the
loose<00:02:52.260> because<00:02:53.099> I<00:02:53.129> was<00:02:53.370> thinking<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.760> was

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
loose because I was thinking I was

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.429 
loose because I was thinking I was
probably<00:02:54.090> gonna<00:02:54.420> have<00:02:54.689> to<00:02:54.780> fine-tune<00:02:55.319> the

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
probably gonna have to fine-tune the

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.130 
probably gonna have to fine-tune the
lengths<00:02:55.939> so<00:02:56.939> that's<00:02:57.150> what<00:02:57.299> I've<00:02:57.420> done<00:02:57.569> now<00:02:57.629> so

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
lengths so that's what I've done now so

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.319 
lengths so that's what I've done now so
I've<00:02:58.890> got<00:02:59.129> this<00:02:59.280> thing<00:02:59.459> pretty<00:02:59.670> well<00:02:59.909> where<00:03:00.299> I

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
I've got this thing pretty well where I

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.899 
I've got this thing pretty well where I
want<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.629> have<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.930> sitting<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.579> I<00:03:02.579> should

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
want to have it sitting and I should

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:03.949 
want to have it sitting and I should
show<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.120> one<00:03:03.329> more<00:03:03.480> thing<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.750> I'm<00:03:03.930> doing

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
show you one more thing that I'm doing

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:12.830 
show you one more thing that I'm doing
here<00:03:06.590> see<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.650> use<00:03:07.829> this<00:03:08.040> square<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:11.629> put<00:03:12.629> it<00:03:12.750> up

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
here see I use this square and put it up

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.979 
here see I use this square and put it up
against<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.319> bearing<00:03:13.980> carrier<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.750> see<00:03:15.750> I

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
against this bearing carrier and see I

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.819 
against this bearing carrier and see I
can<00:03:16.920> use<00:03:17.099> that<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:19.290> tubing<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.799> I

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
can use that that the tubing that I

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.490 
can use that that the tubing that I
trued<00:03:20.129> up<00:03:20.250> with<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.549> frame<00:03:21.290> see<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:24.439> so<00:03:25.439> I

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
trued up with the frame see that so I

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.659 
trued up with the frame see that so I
can<00:03:25.739> true<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.069> up<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:27.780> that's<00:03:27.989> it's<00:03:28.379> it's<00:03:29.340> true

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
can true it up so that's it's it's true

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.179 
can true it up so that's it's it's true
this<00:03:29.909> way<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.450> bearing<00:03:30.870> carrier<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.409> it's

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 
this way that bearing carrier and it's

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.949 
this way that bearing carrier and it's
also<00:03:32.370> true<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.000> way<00:03:33.209> because<00:03:33.419> I<00:03:33.599> put<00:03:33.840> the

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
also true this way because I put the

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.879 
also true this way because I put the
level<00:03:34.260> on<00:03:34.409> it<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:35.000> also<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.359> way<00:03:36.540> too

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
level on it and also this way too

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.909 
level on it and also this way too
because<00:03:37.889> I<00:03:38.219> put<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.459> level<00:03:38.700> on<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:38.879> this<00:03:39.090> way<00:03:39.919> so

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
because I put a level on it this way so

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.509 
because I put a level on it this way so
and<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:43.709> know<00:03:43.739> maybe<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.189> not<00:03:44.219> ultra

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
and you know maybe it's not ultra

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.089 
and you know maybe it's not ultra
precise<00:03:45.150> yet<00:03:45.419> but<00:03:45.659> the<00:03:46.230> whole<00:03:46.409> goal<00:03:46.620> here<00:03:46.950> is

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
precise yet but the whole goal here is

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.729 
precise yet but the whole goal here is
just<00:03:47.129> to<00:03:47.489> figure<00:03:48.359> out<00:03:48.629> my<00:03:48.810> lengths<00:03:49.260> here<00:03:49.560> that

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
just to figure out my lengths here that

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.099 
just to figure out my lengths here that
I<00:03:49.769> need<00:03:49.889> for<00:03:50.250> these<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:51.389> tubes<00:03:51.629> here<00:03:51.840> for<00:03:52.049> the

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
I need for these the tubes here for the

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.300 
I need for these the tubes here for the
a<00:03:52.139> arms<00:03:52.439> and<00:03:52.590> I'm<00:03:52.650> gonna<00:03:52.829> show<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.040> now<00:03:53.129> how

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
a arms and I'm gonna show you now how

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.809 
a arms and I'm gonna show you now how
I'm<00:03:53.609> gonna<00:03:53.760> figure<00:03:54.480> that<00:03:54.599> out<00:03:55.370> so<00:03:56.370> one<00:03:56.639> more

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
I'm gonna figure that out so one more

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.580 
I'm gonna figure that out so one more
thing<00:03:56.849> that<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.359> reference<00:03:57.599> tube<00:03:58.049> is<00:03:58.229> handy

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
thing that that reference tube is handy

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.390 
thing that that reference tube is handy
for<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:59.419> getting<00:04:00.419> this<00:04:00.510> bearing<00:04:00.930> carrier<00:04:01.400> set

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
for is getting this bearing carrier set

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.550 
for is getting this bearing carrier set
up<00:04:02.549> as<00:04:02.699> far<00:04:02.909> as<00:04:02.940> front<00:04:03.329> to<00:04:03.449> back<00:04:03.629> you<00:04:04.319> know<00:04:04.409> this

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
up as far as front to back you know this

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.580 
up as far as front to back you know this
way<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:04.919> that<00:04:05.010> way<00:04:05.359> because<00:04:06.359> one<00:04:07.169> into<00:04:07.409> this

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
way and that way because one into this

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.009 
way and that way because one into this
axle<00:04:08.489> sits<00:04:08.790> in<00:04:08.970> here<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.510> other<00:04:09.659> end<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:09.930> the

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
axle sits in here the other end of the

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.409 
axle sits in here the other end of the
axle<00:04:10.379> is<00:04:10.470> over<00:04:10.709> there<00:04:10.859> so<00:04:11.159> I<00:04:11.189> want<00:04:11.489> them<00:04:11.669> to<00:04:11.879> be

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
axle is over there so I want them to be

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.409 
axle is over there so I want them to be
pretty<00:04:12.599> much<00:04:12.720> in<00:04:12.870> line<00:04:13.579> so<00:04:14.579> I<00:04:14.879> can<00:04:15.180> reference

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
pretty much in line so I can reference

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.319 
pretty much in line so I can reference
off<00:04:15.810> of<00:04:15.989> here<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:17.070> know<00:04:17.220> how<00:04:17.639> far<00:04:17.880> back<00:04:17.909> I<00:04:18.269> need

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
off of here you know how far back I need

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.390 
off of here you know how far back I need
to<00:04:18.510> come<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.079> once<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:19.590> had<00:04:19.769> this<00:04:19.919> whole

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
to come and once I had this whole

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.430 
to come and once I had this whole
assembly<00:04:20.909> set<00:04:21.449> up<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.690> way<00:04:21.780> I<00:04:21.810> wanted<00:04:22.139> it<00:04:22.229> I

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
assembly set up the way I wanted it I

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.310 
assembly set up the way I wanted it I
cut<00:04:23.070> this<00:04:23.159> little<00:04:23.370> piece<00:04:23.610> of<00:04:23.789> rod<00:04:24.150> here<00:04:24.479> and<00:04:24.690> I

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
cut this little piece of rod here and I

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.920 
cut this little piece of rod here and I
just<00:04:25.560> use<00:04:26.520> it<00:04:26.550> as<00:04:26.759> a<00:04:26.789> little<00:04:27.360> tool<00:04:27.539> here<00:04:27.570> to

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
just use it as a little tool here to

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.839 
just use it as a little tool here to
measure<00:04:28.080> see<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.979> bolt<00:04:29.159> on<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.400> bottom<00:04:29.669> there

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
measure see the bolt on the bottom there

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.110 
measure see the bolt on the bottom there
and<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:30.120> just<00:04:30.150> touches<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.870> reference<00:04:31.560> tube

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
and it just touches the reference tube

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.580 
and it just touches the reference tube
so<00:04:33.120> now<00:04:33.690> when<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:33.900> want<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.199> work<00:04:34.320> on<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.560> other

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
so now when I want to work on the other

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.409 
so now when I want to work on the other
side<00:04:34.919> I<00:04:34.949> just<00:04:35.250> take<00:04:35.430> this<00:04:35.610> little<00:04:35.820> piece<00:04:36.150> of

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
side I just take this little piece of

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.749 
side I just take this little piece of
rod<00:04:36.599> and<00:04:36.840> I<00:04:37.409> can<00:04:37.590> quickly<00:04:37.770> reference<00:04:38.159> off<00:04:38.580> of

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
rod and I can quickly reference off of

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.760 
rod and I can quickly reference off of
the<00:04:38.820> tube<00:04:39.030> and<00:04:39.210> I<00:04:39.659> can<00:04:39.840> I<00:04:40.050> can<00:04:40.229> get<00:04:40.409> at<00:04:40.590> least

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
the tube and I can I can get at least

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.689 
the tube and I can I can get at least
this<00:04:41.009> way<00:04:41.250> back<00:04:41.880> very<00:04:42.240> quickly<00:04:42.650> so<00:04:43.699> anyways

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
this way back very quickly so anyways

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.529 
this way back very quickly so anyways
back<00:04:44.909> to<00:04:44.970> these<00:04:45.270> bunks<00:04:45.720> and<00:04:45.870> this<00:04:46.050> tubing<00:04:46.440> so

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
back to these bunks and this tubing so

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.120 
back to these bunks and this tubing so
because<00:04:48.539> this<00:04:48.750> carrier<00:04:49.409> is<00:04:49.620> sitting<00:04:49.949> where<00:04:50.070> I

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
because this carrier is sitting where I

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.409 
because this carrier is sitting where I
want<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:50.520> now<00:04:51.139> it<00:04:52.139> shows<00:04:52.710> me<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:54.150> lengths

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
want it now it shows me that the lengths

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.300 
want it now it shows me that the lengths
of<00:04:54.479> the<00:04:54.599> tube<00:04:54.810> are<00:04:55.050> not<00:04:55.500> correct<00:04:55.860> for<00:04:55.949> all<00:04:56.159> of

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
of the tube are not correct for all of

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.290 
of the tube are not correct for all of
them<00:04:56.430> so<00:04:57.360> what<00:04:57.720> I<00:04:57.750> did<00:04:57.960> is<00:04:58.199> I<00:04:58.620> took<00:04:58.979> my<00:04:59.250> caliper

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.380 

and<00:05:02.390> I<00:05:02.450> measured<00:05:02.810> in<00:05:02.990> here<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:04.430> see<00:05:04.670> how<00:05:05.240> much

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
and I measured in here to see how much

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.910 
and I measured in here to see how much
of<00:05:05.510> a<00:05:05.600> gap<00:05:05.810> there<00:05:06.050> was<00:05:06.170> this<00:05:06.380> is<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.650> one<00:05:06.770> that

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
of a gap there was this is the one that

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.790 
of a gap there was this is the one that
has<00:05:07.040> the<00:05:07.070> most<00:05:07.280> gap<00:05:07.900> so<00:05:08.900> I<00:05:08.930> don't<00:05:09.350> have<00:05:09.470> to<00:05:09.620> cut

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
has the most gap so I don't have to cut

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.280 
has the most gap so I don't have to cut
anything<00:05:10.040> off<00:05:10.310> of<00:05:10.340> this<00:05:10.640> one<00:05:10.960> but<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.170> other

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
anything off of this one but the other

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.500 
anything off of this one but the other
ones<00:05:12.500> I<00:05:12.620> do<00:05:12.680> because<00:05:13.160> they<00:05:13.880> don't<00:05:14.090> have<00:05:14.330> as

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
ones I do because they don't have as

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.050 
ones I do because they don't have as
much<00:05:14.720> gap<00:05:15.020> so<00:05:15.260> then<00:05:15.380> I<00:05:15.530> referenced<00:05:16.400> over<00:05:16.940> to

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
much gap so then I referenced over to

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.720 
much gap so then I referenced over to
the<00:05:17.180> other<00:05:17.300> ones<00:05:17.510> and<00:05:17.660> I<00:05:17.750> made<00:05:17.930> a<00:05:17.960> mark<00:05:18.730> and

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
the other ones and I made a mark and

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.610 
the other ones and I made a mark and
this<00:05:20.420> one<00:05:20.600> I'm<00:05:20.690> gonna<00:05:20.780> have<00:05:20.960> to<00:05:21.110> cut<00:05:21.290> the<00:05:21.440> most

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
this one I'm gonna have to cut the most

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.910 
this one I'm gonna have to cut the most
off<00:05:21.890> of<00:05:22.930> because<00:05:23.930> it's<00:05:24.080> already<00:05:24.230> collapsed<00:05:24.800> up

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
off of because it's already collapsed up

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.990 
off of because it's already collapsed up
all<00:05:25.070> the<00:05:25.220> way<00:05:26.230> so<00:05:27.250> I'm<00:05:28.250> gonna<00:05:28.460> cut<00:05:28.640> all<00:05:28.820> these

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
all the way so I'm gonna cut all these

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.180 
all the way so I'm gonna cut all these
tubes<00:05:29.270> now<00:05:29.540> and<00:05:29.810> also<00:05:30.500> once<00:05:30.710> I've<00:05:30.860> got<00:05:31.010> them

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
tubes now and also once I've got them

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.250 
tubes now and also once I've got them
all<00:05:31.310> cut<00:05:31.580> then<00:05:32.360> I'm<00:05:32.510> gonna<00:05:32.600> drill<00:05:32.900> all<00:05:33.110> the

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
all cut then I'm gonna drill all the

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.440 
all cut then I'm gonna drill all the
holes<00:05:33.290> in<00:05:33.620> them<00:05:33.770> you<00:05:34.760> know<00:05:34.880> like<00:05:35.030> I<00:05:35.150> did<00:05:35.300> for

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
holes in them you know like I did for

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.960 
holes in them you know like I did for
these<00:05:35.770> so<00:05:36.770> I<00:05:36.800> can<00:05:37.040> do<00:05:37.130> those<00:05:37.310> spot<00:05:37.610> welds<00:05:37.880> in

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
these so I can do those spot welds in

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.480 
these so I can do those spot welds in
there<00:05:38.350> so<00:05:39.350> that's<00:05:39.530> the<00:05:39.770> plan<00:05:39.950> now<00:05:40.160> I<00:05:40.190> got<00:05:40.400> to

there so that's the plan now I got to

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.030 
there so that's the plan now I got to
take<00:05:40.640> this<00:05:40.820> all<00:05:41.000> apart<00:05:41.470> cut<00:05:42.470> all<00:05:42.590> the<00:05:42.710> tubing

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
take this all apart cut all the tubing

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.420 
take this all apart cut all the tubing
drill<00:05:43.730> holes<00:05:44.290> so<00:05:45.290> the<00:05:45.860> other<00:05:45.950> day<00:05:46.130> my<00:05:46.160> wife

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
was doing all this with the machine so I

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.380 
was doing all this with the machine so I
said<00:05:50.990> well<00:05:51.260> because<00:05:52.190> I<00:05:52.220> can<00:05:52.580> and<00:05:52.880> because<00:05:53.240> I

good reasons so here's where we're at
with<00:05:59.840> the<00:05:59.930> machine<00:06:00.230> now<00:06:01.420> so<00:06:02.420> I've<00:06:02.570> got<00:06:02.750> both

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
with the machine now so I've got both

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.570 
with the machine now so I've got both
hubs<00:06:03.260> lined<00:06:03.530> up<00:06:03.710> now<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:03.920> way<00:06:04.130> I<00:06:04.160> want<00:06:04.400> them<00:06:04.550> to

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
hubs lined up now the way I want them to

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.630 
hubs lined up now the way I want them to
be<00:06:05.200> both<00:06:06.200> ends<00:06:07.510> so<00:06:08.510> what<00:06:08.750> I<00:06:08.780> want<00:06:08.960> to<00:06:09.020> do<00:06:09.140> now<00:06:09.290> is

machine so once I have the the a arms or

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.440 
machine so once I have the the a arms or
the<00:06:27.890> rods<00:06:28.100> for<00:06:28.340> the<00:06:28.400> arms<00:06:28.700> all<00:06:28.850> welded<00:06:29.180> up<00:06:29.270> then

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
the rods for the arms all welded up then

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.720 
the rods for the arms all welded up then
I<00:06:29.510> put<00:06:29.690> it<00:06:29.750> all<00:06:29.840> back<00:06:29.960> together<00:06:30.140> and<00:06:30.700> then<00:06:31.700> I

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:31.730 
I put it all back together and then I

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.110 
I put it all back together and then I
want<00:06:32.150> to<00:06:32.420> start<00:06:33.280> bridging<00:06:34.280> and<00:06:34.400> reinforcing

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
want to start bridging and reinforcing

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.040 
want to start bridging and reinforcing
them<00:06:35.270> getting<00:06:36.170> ready<00:06:36.380> for<00:06:36.680> the<00:06:37.010> shock<00:06:37.460> mount

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
them getting ready for the shock mount

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.330 
them getting ready for the shock mount
so<00:06:39.050> I<00:06:39.080> was<00:06:39.290> trying<00:06:39.470> something<00:06:39.800> new<00:06:39.950> today<00:06:40.070> I

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
so I was trying something new today I

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.080 
so I was trying something new today I
rigged<00:06:40.670> up<00:06:40.760> my<00:06:40.940> welder<00:06:41.330> to<00:06:41.510> a<00:06:41.540> foot<00:06:41.960> switch<00:06:42.260> and

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
rigged up my welder to a foot switch and

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.520 
rigged up my welder to a foot switch and
then<00:06:44.090> all<00:06:44.180> I<00:06:44.240> have<00:06:44.390> to<00:06:44.540> do<00:06:44.660> is<00:06:44.810> just<00:06:44.960> rotate<00:06:45.380> the

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
then all I have to do is just rotate the

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.230 
then all I have to do is just rotate the
tubing<00:06:45.890> and<00:06:46.100> try<00:06:46.640> and<00:06:46.760> get<00:06:46.850> at<00:06:47.000> the<00:06:47.030> right

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 
tubing and try and get at the right

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.520 
tubing and try and get at the right
speed<00:06:47.570> so<00:06:49.030> kind<00:06:50.030> of<00:06:50.090> interesting<00:06:50.510> I<00:06:50.690> probably

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.530 
speed so kind of interesting I probably

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.120 
speed so kind of interesting I probably
try<00:06:51.830> it<00:06:51.890> again

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
try it again

00:06:52.130 --> 00:07:14.659 
try it again
I<00:06:52.310> kind<00:06:52.610> of<00:06:52.640> liked<00:06:52.820> it<00:06:53.350> so<00:06:54.350> we're<00:06:55.190> not<00:06:55.400> too<00:06:55.550> bad

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:14.669 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.480 

I<00:07:15.409> also<00:07:16.409> the<00:07:16.680> other<00:07:16.800> day<00:07:16.979> made<00:07:17.219> up<00:07:17.340> these

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490 
I also the other day made up these

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.809 
I also the other day made up these
corner<00:07:18.030> tabs<00:07:18.659> here<00:07:19.020> are<00:07:19.139> the<00:07:19.259> braces<00:07:19.919> these

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 
corner tabs here are the braces these

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:23.689 
corner tabs here are the braces these
guys<00:07:21.090> here<00:07:21.409> so<00:07:22.409> I<00:07:22.439> made<00:07:22.800> four<00:07:23.069> of<00:07:23.099> those<00:07:23.249> up<00:07:23.490> and

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:23.699 
guys here so I made four of those up and

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.510 
guys here so I made four of those up and
they<00:07:24.150> support<00:07:24.599> the<00:07:24.810> longest<00:07:25.259> of<00:07:25.409> the<00:07:26.009> brackets

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 
they support the longest of the brackets

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.580 
they support the longest of the brackets
the<00:07:26.699> ones<00:07:26.879> in<00:07:27.029> the<00:07:27.120> back<00:07:27.270> here<00:07:27.569> so<00:07:28.229> they<00:07:28.439> come

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:28.590 
the ones in the back here so they come

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.950 
the ones in the back here so they come
around<00:07:28.800> in<00:07:28.919> the<00:07:28.949> back<00:07:29.129> like<00:07:29.340> that

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 
around in the back like that

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.909 
around in the back like that
so<00:07:30.960> for<00:07:31.469> them<00:07:31.740> and<00:07:32.580> I<00:07:33.479> may<00:07:33.900> also<00:07:34.110> relocate<00:07:34.800> the

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 
so for them and I may also relocate the

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:38.119 
so for them and I may also relocate the
mouth<00:07:35.069> where<00:07:35.249> yet<00:07:35.400> I'm<00:07:35.520> not<00:07:35.550> sure<00:07:36.020> it<00:07:37.129> normally

00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:38.129 
mouth where yet I'm not sure it normally

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:39.679 
mouth where yet I'm not sure it normally
gets<00:07:38.310> bolted<00:07:38.580> to<00:07:38.819> where<00:07:38.999> those<00:07:39.120> rolls<00:07:39.419> of<00:07:39.569> tape

00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:39.689 
gets bolted to where those rolls of tape

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:43.129 
gets bolted to where those rolls of tape
are<00:07:39.930> and<00:07:41.180> exhaust<00:07:42.180> is<00:07:42.389> here<00:07:42.569> coming<00:07:42.779> on<00:07:42.960> here

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:43.139 
are and exhaust is here coming on here

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:46.159 
are and exhaust is here coming on here
so<00:07:43.349> I<00:07:43.379> may<00:07:43.710> end<00:07:43.949> up<00:07:44.460> putting<00:07:44.699> it<00:07:44.909> behind<00:07:45.779> here

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:46.169 
so I may end up putting it behind here

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:49.129 
so I may end up putting it behind here
sideways<00:07:46.710> we'll<00:07:47.699> see<00:07:47.939> yet<00:07:48.150> whether<00:07:48.539> even<00:07:48.930> I

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:49.139 
sideways we'll see yet whether even I

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:51.439 
sideways we'll see yet whether even I
need<00:07:49.349> to<00:07:49.529> and<00:07:49.909> also<00:07:50.909> there's<00:07:51.120> some<00:07:51.300> more

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:51.449 
need to and also there's some more

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:54.080 
need to and also there's some more
bracing<00:07:52.259> and<00:07:52.590> stuff<00:07:52.800> that<00:07:52.830> comes<00:07:53.490> up<00:07:53.669> in<00:07:53.819> here

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.090 
bracing and stuff that comes up in here

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:59.330 
bracing and stuff that comes up in here
so<00:07:54.919> we'll<00:07:55.919> play<00:07:56.400> that<00:07:56.580> a<00:07:56.610> little<00:07:56.819> bit<00:07:56.909> by<00:07:57.060> ear
