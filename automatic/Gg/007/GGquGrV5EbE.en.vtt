a<00:04:24.810> windshield<00:04:25.110> I<00:04:25.500> guess<00:04:25.620> he's<00:04:25.770> looking<00:04:25.980> out

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
a windshield I guess he's looking out

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.700 
a windshield I guess he's looking out
the<00:04:26.160> windshield<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:27.169> was<00:04:28.169> assumed<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:28.530> it's

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
the windshield I was assumed that it's

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.050 
the windshield I was assumed that it's
called<00:04:28.890> a<00:04:28.919> windshield<00:04:29.130> so<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:29.460> don't<00:04:29.789> know<00:04:29.910> I'm

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
called a windshield so I don't know I'm

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.210 
called a windshield so I don't know I'm
not<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.380> military<00:04:31.380> guy<00:04:31.590> but<00:04:31.979> up

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
missile I wish this guy would have got

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.650 
missile I wish this guy would have got
his<00:04:40.380> dog<00:04:40.560> tags<00:04:40.890> but<00:04:41.160> instead<00:04:41.520> I<00:04:41.580> guess<00:04:42.330> he<00:04:42.480> paid

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
his dog tags but instead I guess he paid

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.300 
his dog tags but instead I guess he paid
the<00:04:42.810> right<00:04:42.960> move<00:04:43.140> you<00:04:43.290> know<00:04:43.410> he<00:04:43.590> shot<00:04:44.070> him<00:04:44.190> off

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
the right move you know he shot him off

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.890 
the right move you know he shot him off
before<00:04:44.520> he<00:04:44.760> could<00:04:44.910> fire<00:04:45.150> that<00:04:45.180> tow<00:04:45.540> missile

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
before he could fire that tow missile

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.990 
before he could fire that tow missile
into<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.200> tank<00:04:46.410> so<00:04:46.500> he's<00:04:46.710> he's<00:04:47.490> saving<00:04:47.910> his

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
on top of the building and it looked

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.520 
on top of the building and it looked
like<00:05:15.030> he<00:05:15.240> was<00:05:15.360> moving<00:05:15.690> pretty<00:05:15.720> good<00:05:15.990> as<00:05:16.290> he<00:05:16.380> was

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
like he was moving pretty good as he was

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.200 
like he was moving pretty good as he was
coming<00:05:16.680> down<00:05:16.920> so<00:05:17.100> it<00:05:17.160> looks<00:05:17.280> like<00:05:17.340> you<00:05:18.000> have

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
coming down so it looks like you have

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
coming down so it looks like you have
some<00:05:19.340> good<00:05:20.340> maneuverability<00:05:20.880> when<00:05:21.870> it<00:05:21.960> comes

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
some good maneuverability when it comes

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.130 
some good maneuverability when it comes
to<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:22.980> parachute<00:05:23.430> and<00:05:23.580> here<00:05:23.760> we<00:05:23.880> have<00:05:24.140> is

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
to the parachute and here we have is

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:31.430 
to the parachute and here we have is
that<00:05:25.320> Wally<00:05:27.440> walling<00:05:28.490> ran<00:05:29.490> into<00:05:29.730> a<00:05:30.440> concrete

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
that Wally walling ran into a concrete

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.810 
that Wally walling ran into a concrete
wall<00:05:31.740> and<00:05:33.380> then<00:05:34.380> here<00:05:34.680> this<00:05:34.919> viewpoint<00:05:35.400> looks

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
wall and then here this viewpoint looks

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.030 
wall and then here this viewpoint looks
like<00:05:36.000> it's<00:05:36.210> from<00:05:36.300> a<00:05:36.750> UAV<00:05:37.260> so<00:05:37.650> we're<00:05:37.800> getting<00:05:37.919> to

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
like it's from a UAV so we're getting to

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.860 
like it's from a UAV so we're getting to
