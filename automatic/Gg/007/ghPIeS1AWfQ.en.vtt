a good afternoon more medic 1 today I've
got<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:03.300> Kawasaki<00:00:04.259> Mule<00:00:05.299> 3000<00:00:06.299> on<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.509> bench

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
got a Kawasaki Mule 3000 on the bench

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.740 
got a Kawasaki Mule 3000 on the bench
and<00:00:08.059> basically<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.389> wasn't<00:00:09.960> getting<00:00:10.500> fuel<00:00:10.980> pump

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
and basically I wasn't getting fuel pump

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.169 
and basically I wasn't getting fuel pump
power<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:13.170> my<00:00:13.290> fuel<00:00:13.530> pump<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.070> on<00:00:15.000> these

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
power to my fuel pump and on these

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.269 
power to my fuel pump and on these
Kawasaki<00:00:15.900> engines<00:00:16.289> here<00:00:16.619> I'm<00:00:16.770> gonna<00:00:16.980> kill<00:00:17.250> it

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
Kawasaki engines here I'm gonna kill it

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:25.009 
Kawasaki engines here I'm gonna kill it
right<00:00:17.490> quick<00:00:21.320> you<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:22.970> basically<00:00:24.019> two

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
right quick you have basically two

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.170 
right quick you have basically two
things<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.680> will<00:00:25.890> keep<00:00:26.189> your<00:00:26.580> fuel<00:00:26.939> pump

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
things that will keep your fuel pump

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.840 
things that will keep your fuel pump
from<00:00:27.420> working<00:00:28.970> you<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> fuel<00:00:30.510> pump<00:00:30.779> relay

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
from working you have a fuel pump relay

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.360 
from working you have a fuel pump relay
which<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.030> located<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.350> right<00:00:34.380> or<00:00:34.829> seating

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
which is located on the right or seating

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.869 
which is located on the right or seating
on<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.579> left<00:00:35.790> hand<00:00:36.000> side<00:00:36.239> by<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.540> battery<00:00:37.879> and

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
on the left hand side by the battery and

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.560 
on the left hand side by the battery and
it's<00:00:41.210> here<00:00:42.210> next<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.930> voltage<00:00:43.350> regulator

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
it's here next to the voltage regulator

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.490 
it's here next to the voltage regulator
sometimes<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.840> goes<00:00:46.020> out<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.500> not<00:00:46.590> always

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
sometimes that goes out but not always

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.639 
sometimes that goes out but not always
the<00:00:49.500> only<00:00:49.620> other<00:00:50.010> thing<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:51.289> happens<00:00:52.289> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the only other thing that happens and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.619 
the only other thing that happens and
I'll<00:00:52.860> explain<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.460> how<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:53.820> wire<00:00:54.360> this

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
I'll explain to you how they wire this

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.760 
I'll explain to you how they wire this
thing<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:56.960> I've<00:00:57.960> already<00:00:58.170> took<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
thing up I've already took in the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.160 
thing up I've already took in the
flywheel<00:00:59.370> cover<00:00:59.579> off<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.510> three<00:01:00.840> bolts

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
flywheel cover off it's just three bolts

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.529 
flywheel cover off it's just three bolts
it's<00:01:01.320> real<00:01:01.530> simple

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
it's real simple

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.950 
it's real simple
and<00:01:03.539> right<00:01:03.780> down<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.040> flywheel

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
and right down there on the flywheel

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.179 
and right down there on the flywheel
right<00:01:06.960> here<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.040> an<00:01:08.490> igniter<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:10.200> runs<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
right here is an igniter that runs the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.420 
right here is an igniter that runs the
ignition<00:01:11.880> modules<00:01:12.530> it's<00:01:13.530> basically<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
ignition modules it's basically just a

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.840 
ignition modules it's basically just a
pickup<00:01:14.670> coil<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.540> they<00:01:16.409> run<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.250> fuel<00:01:17.460> pump

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
pickup coil but they run the fuel pump

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.520 
pickup coil but they run the fuel pump
signal<00:01:18.630> through<00:01:18.840> there<00:01:19.020> too

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
signal through there too

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.520 
signal through there too
and<00:01:19.619> when<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.400> wire<00:01:20.990> they've<00:01:21.990> got<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.320> routed

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
and when this wire they've got it routed

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.819 
and when this wire they've got it routed
right<00:01:22.830> behind<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.369> engine<00:01:26.180> puller<00:01:27.180> or

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
right behind this engine puller or

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.960 
right behind this engine puller or
lifting<00:01:28.829> bracket<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:30.150> rubbed<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.630> into<00:01:31.970> so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
lifting bracket and it rubbed it into so

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.450 
lifting bracket and it rubbed it into so
it<00:01:33.540> was<00:01:33.689> an<00:01:33.840> easy<00:01:33.960> find<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.250> matter

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
it was an easy find it's just a matter

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.730 
it was an easy find it's just a matter
of<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.600> enough<00:01:36.840> room<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
of if you have enough room and see the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.830 
of if you have enough room and see the
move<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.850> yellow<00:01:39.060> wire<00:01:39.329> was<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> one

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
move that the yellow wire was the one

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.340 
move that the yellow wire was the one
that<00:01:39.930> was<00:01:40.049> broken<00:01:40.350> or<00:01:41.689> chafed<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.990> half<00:01:43.490> but<00:01:45.350> if

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
that was broken or chafed in half but if

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.630 
that was broken or chafed in half but if
you<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.590> enough<00:01:46.799> room<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.310> solder<00:01:47.520> that

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
you have enough room you can solder that

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.630 
you have enough room you can solder that
wire<00:01:47.970> back<00:01:48.240> together<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:49.009> I<00:01:50.360> hope<00:01:51.360> you

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
wire back together and I hope you

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.050 
wire back together and I hope you

a Kawasaki Mule 3000 I wasn't getting
fuel<00:02:01.740> pump<00:02:02.009> pressure<00:02:02.750> but<00:02:03.750> now<00:02:03.899> she<00:02:03.960> runs<00:02:04.350> good
