painful knee comes out and slides into

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.240 
painful knee comes out and slides into
the<00:02:59.200> back<00:02:59.459> well<00:03:00.459> okay<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.180> here<00:03:01.600> is<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:03.070> one

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
the back well okay so here is the one

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.100 
the back well okay so here is the one
for<00:03:03.489> each<00:03:03.670> fan<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:06.000> don't<00:03:07.000> call<00:03:07.329> a<00:03:07.360> master<00:03:07.840> one

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
for each fan I don't call a master one

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.699 
for each fan I don't call a master one
it<00:03:08.200> is<00:03:08.320> but<00:03:08.680> I<00:03:08.910> say<00:03:09.910> that's<00:03:10.840> good<00:03:11.079> that<00:03:11.530> could

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
it is but I say that's good that could

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.350 
it is but I say that's good that could
go<00:03:11.890> on<00:03:11.950> eBay<00:03:12.280> or<00:03:12.519> what-have-you<00:03:12.700> I'll<00:03:13.150> just

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
go on eBay or what-have-you I'll just

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:23.670 
go on eBay or what-have-you I'll just
keep<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:14.340> you'll<00:03:15.340> need<00:03:15.489> it

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.770 

so<00:03:24.040> there's<00:03:24.220> that<00:03:24.489> is<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:24.790> a<00:03:24.820> piece<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.299> paper

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.670 

I<00:03:29.610> guess<00:03:30.610> as<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:30.910> see<00:03:31.230> there's<00:03:32.230> all<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.500> hard

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
I guess as you see there's all the hard

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.250 
I guess as you see there's all the hard
drives<00:03:32.769> they're<00:03:33.250> neatly<00:03:33.700> arranged<00:03:34.480> ready<00:03:35.049> for

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
drives they're neatly arranged ready for

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.060 
drives they're neatly arranged ready for
SATA<00:03:35.500> which<00:03:36.010> is<00:03:36.160> good<00:03:37.019> really<00:03:38.019> easy<00:03:38.230> I'm<00:03:39.010> not

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
SATA which is good really easy I'm not

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.800 
SATA which is good really easy I'm not
sure<00:03:39.310> how<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.489> power<00:03:39.790> things<00:03:40.180> gonna<00:03:40.450> stick

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
sure how the power things gonna stick

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.920 
sure how the power things gonna stick
out<00:03:41.019> it<00:03:41.320> might<00:03:41.530> be<00:03:41.709> a<00:03:41.739> bit<00:03:41.890> touch-and-go<00:03:42.130> but

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
out it might be a bit touch-and-go but

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.410 
out it might be a bit touch-and-go but
hey<00:03:43.930> definitely<00:03:44.920> right<00:03:45.310> angles<00:03:45.700> here<00:03:47.910> yeah<00:03:48.940> so

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
hey definitely right angles here yeah so

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.220 
hey definitely right angles here yeah so

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
let's have a look let's figure out how

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.240 
let's have a look let's figure out how
we<00:04:27.440> can<00:04:27.710> do<00:04:27.950> that<00:04:29.260> pushpins<00:04:30.260> maybe<00:04:31.750> I'm<00:04:32.750> just

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
we can do that pushpins maybe I'm just

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:48.059 
we can do that pushpins maybe I'm just
there<00:04:34.250> we<00:04:34.370> go<00:04:34.580> one<00:04:36.970> two<00:04:41.020> three

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:50.399 

I<00:04:48.099> can<00:04:48.969> insane<00:04:49.509> the<00:04:49.689> other<00:04:49.809> side<00:04:50.080> something's

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 
I can insane the other side something's

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:59.630 
I can insane the other side something's
gonna<00:04:50.589> reach<00:04:50.800> around<00:04:51.099> to<00:04:51.189> do<00:04:51.339> that

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.350 

three<00:05:00.900> hopefully<00:05:01.900> that's<00:05:02.050> it<00:05:02.940> okay<00:05:03.940> so<00:05:04.000> that's

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
three hopefully that's it okay so that's

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.810 
three hopefully that's it okay so that's
the<00:05:04.630> that's<00:05:05.260> the<00:05:05.410> top<00:05:05.680> off<00:05:05.890> obviously<00:05:06.640> what's

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
the that's the top off obviously what's

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.550 
the that's the top off obviously what's
the<00:05:06.970> wires<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.510> stuff<00:05:08.670> yeah<00:05:09.670> -<00:05:10.110> its<00:05:11.110> -<00:05:11.320> fans

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
the wires and stuff yeah - its - fans

definitely sitting up there and

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.620 
definitely sitting up there and
hopefully<00:05:13.660> the<00:05:13.930> radio<00:05:14.230> will<00:05:14.470> go<00:05:14.620> at<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.250> Bob

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
hopefully the radio will go at the Bob

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.360 
hopefully the radio will go at the Bob
that's<00:05:16.630> good<00:05:16.870> so<00:05:17.200> we<00:05:17.290> leave<00:05:17.410> that<00:05:17.470> on<00:05:17.740> like

that's good so we leave that on like
that<00:05:18.520> at<00:05:18.700> the<00:05:18.760> moment<00:05:18.790> I<00:05:20.790> case<00:05:21.790> there<00:05:22.440> so<00:05:23.440> I

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
that at the moment I case there so I

that at the moment I case there so I
actually<00:05:23.680> I<00:05:23.860> need<00:05:24.010> to<00:05:24.130> take<00:05:24.340> that<00:05:24.460> off<00:05:24.520> during

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
actually I need to take that off during

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.210 
actually I need to take that off during
I<00:05:27.870> okay<00:05:28.870> that's<00:05:29.200> a<00:05:29.350> place<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:29.950> why<00:05:30.070> is<00:05:30.130> it

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
I okay that's a place and why is it

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:55.260 
I okay that's a place and why is it
strong<00:05:30.550> enough

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:03.090 

simple<00:05:56.270> enough

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.550 

okay<00:06:04.100> say<00:06:05.229> 140
