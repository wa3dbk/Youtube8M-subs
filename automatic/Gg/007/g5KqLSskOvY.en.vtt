00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
full charge and I noticed it was kind of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.080 
full charge and I noticed it was kind of
acting<00:00:30.539> up<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:30.810> me<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.430> come<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.550> find<00:00:32.820> that

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
acting up on me and come to find that

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.110 
acting up on me and come to find that
when<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.630> was<00:00:33.780> done<00:00:34.140> fully<00:00:34.440> charging<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.070> had<00:00:35.850> no

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
when I was done fully charging I had no

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.750 
when I was done fully charging I had no
power<00:00:36.450> button<00:00:36.840> functionality<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.710> as<00:00:38.550> well<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
power button functionality and as well a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.060 
power button functionality and as well a
smart<00:00:39.059> case<00:00:39.329> wasn't<00:00:39.570> working<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> device

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
smart case wasn't working but the device

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
smart case wasn't working but the device
would<00:00:41.280> power<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.379> I<00:00:43.820> realized<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.000> I

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
would power on and I realized that I

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
would power on and I realized that I
could<00:00:45.450> completely<00:00:46.140> power<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.559> off<00:00:46.680> if<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.070> held

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
could completely power it off if I held

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.369 
could completely power it off if I held
down<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> power<00:00:47.789> button<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.329> could<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:49.140> well

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
down the power button I could as well

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.439 
down the power button I could as well
take<00:00:50.039> screenshots<00:00:50.610> by<00:00:50.850> holding<00:00:51.149> down<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
take screenshots by holding down the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.000 
take screenshots by holding down the
home<00:00:51.480> button<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.110> power<00:00:52.500> button<00:00:52.590> at<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
same time and so there was functionality

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.150 
same time and so there was functionality

with<00:01:59.790> that

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
with that

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.749 
with that
and<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.840> returned<00:02:01.200> an<00:02:01.320> iPad<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:02.100> my<00:02:02.280> client

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
and so I returned an iPad to my client

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.420 
and so I returned an iPad to my client
with<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.780> note<00:02:03.990> basically<00:02:04.350> no<00:02:04.740> features<00:02:05.159> in

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
with the note basically no features in

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.809 
with the note basically no features in
terms<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.439> case<00:02:07.439> turning<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.369> screen<00:02:08.610> on

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
terms of the case turning the screen on

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.930 
terms of the case turning the screen on
and<00:02:09.000> off<00:02:09.140> well<00:02:10.140> he<00:02:10.679> soon<00:02:10.920> contacted<00:02:11.580> me<00:02:11.700> again

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
and off well he soon contacted me again

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.160 
and off well he soon contacted me again
to<00:02:12.060> let<00:02:12.209> me<00:02:12.300> know<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.599> his<00:02:12.750> battery

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
to let me know that his battery

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.850 
to let me know that his battery
was<00:02:13.349> draining<00:02:13.650> way<00:02:14.370> too<00:02:14.430> quickly<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.900> was

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
was draining way too quickly and I was

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.400 
was draining way too quickly and I was
able<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.190> test<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.900> started<00:02:19.290> to

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
able to test that and so I started to

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.260 
able to test that and so I started to
mess<00:02:19.530> around<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.130> sure<00:02:20.430> enough<00:02:20.459> my<00:02:20.880> theory

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
mess around and sure enough my theory

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.630 
mess around and sure enough my theory
came<00:02:21.510> true<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.080> let's<00:02:22.410> go<00:02:22.530> ahead<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.130> have

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
came true so let's go ahead and I have

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.839 
came true so let's go ahead and I have
this<00:02:23.760> iPad<00:02:24.300> already<00:02:24.630> taken<00:02:24.930> apart<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.700> as<00:02:26.700> you

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
this iPad already taken apart and as you

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.780 
this iPad already taken apart and as you
can<00:02:27.000> see<00:02:27.060> my<00:02:27.420> power<00:02:27.630> switch<00:02:27.959> right<00:02:28.170> now<00:02:28.790> works

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
can see my power switch right now works

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.870 
can see my power switch right now works
I<00:02:30.750> actually<00:02:31.200> for<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.680> demonstration<00:02:32.400> put<00:02:32.730> in

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
I actually for the demonstration put in

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.030 
I actually for the demonstration put in
the<00:02:33.030> old<00:02:33.180> sensor<00:02:33.720> I<00:02:33.750> plugged<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.590> back<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.920> at

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
the old sensor I plugged it back in at

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.309 
the old sensor I plugged it back in at
least<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.489> it<00:02:36.030> started<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.450> work<00:02:36.630> fine<00:02:36.959> again

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
least and it started to work fine again

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.979 
least and it started to work fine again
so<00:02:38.190> let<00:02:38.280> me<00:02:38.370> go<00:02:38.489> ahead<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.670> show<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.780> is

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
so let me go ahead and show you this is

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.559 
so let me go ahead and show you this is
the<00:02:40.019> original<00:02:40.590> Apple<00:02:41.100> power<00:02:41.760> button<00:02:42.209> switch

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569

the original Apple power button switch
and<00:02:43.160> flex<00:02:44.160> cable<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.120> completely<00:02:45.510> works

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
and flex cable and it completely works

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.530 
and flex cable and it completely works
and<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:47.100> have<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.310> magnet<00:02:47.880> here<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.300> can<00:02:48.510> use

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
and I have a magnet here that I can use

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.470 
and I have a magnet here that I can use
as<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:50.340> pretend<00:02:50.670> as<00:02:50.819> my<00:02:51.000> Smart<00:02:51.269> Cover

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
as a to pretend as my Smart Cover

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.610 
as a to pretend as my Smart Cover
networks<00:02:51.900> as<00:02:52.110> well

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
networks as well

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.770 
networks as well
when<00:02:53.430> flashed<00:02:53.730> over<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.090> correct<00:02:54.330> position

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
when flashed over the correct position

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.229 
when flashed over the correct position
and<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:56.130> should<00:02:56.880> or<00:02:57.450> has<00:02:57.660> been<00:02:58.940> waking<00:02:59.940> this<00:03:00.060> up

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
and it should or has been waking this up

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.789 
and it should or has been waking this up
as<00:03:00.420> well<00:03:02.090> well<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:04.080> works<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.500> doesn't<00:03:04.650> work

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
as well well it works and doesn't work

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:12.729 
as well well it works and doesn't work

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
then that goes down and plugs in to the

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.289 
then that goes down and plugs in to the
little<00:03:34.230> extended<00:03:35.010> board<00:03:35.280> but<00:03:36.000> there's<00:03:36.150> this

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
little extended board but there's this

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.500 
little extended board but there's this
little<00:03:36.510> job<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:36.989> write<00:03:37.230> here<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:38.390> then<00:03:39.390> it

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
little job you write here that then it

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.030 
little job you write here that then it
make<00:03:39.630> sense<00:03:39.840> for<00:03:39.959> not<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.380> be<00:03:40.530> on<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.769> board

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
make sense for not to be on the board

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.860 
make sense for not to be on the board
they<00:03:41.489> must<00:03:41.700> have<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:42.060> up<00:03:42.180> here<00:03:42.420> for<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.660> reason

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
they must have it up here for a reason

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.979 
they must have it up here for a reason
in<00:03:43.200> its<00:03:43.350> placement<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.070> sure<00:03:44.880> enough<00:03:44.989> though

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
in its placement and sure enough though

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.449 
in its placement and sure enough though
it<00:03:46.170> doesn't<00:03:46.350> state<00:03:46.709> this<00:03:46.920> on<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.100> lot<00:03:47.310> of

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
it doesn't state this on a lot of

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.740 
it doesn't state this on a lot of
listings<00:03:47.820> when<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.060> look<00:03:48.209> at<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.420> repair

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
listings when you look at the repair

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.740 
listings when you look at the repair
part<00:03:49.079> like<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.280> one<00:03:50.459> here<00:03:50.850> that<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.239> have<00:03:51.540> to

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
part like this one here that I have to

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.039 
part like this one here that I have to
my<00:03:51.870> side<00:03:53.780> this<00:03:54.780> is<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:54.989> new<00:03:55.320> flex<00:03:55.829> cable<00:03:56.220> and

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
my side this is a new flex cable and

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.229 
my side this is a new flex cable and
basically<00:03:58.220> this<00:03:59.220> little<00:03:59.519> set<00:03:59.850> of<00:03:59.970> resistors

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
basically this little set of resistors

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.830 
basically this little set of resistors
or<00:04:00.690> whatever<00:04:01.200> sensors<00:04:01.590> this<00:04:01.769> is<00:04:02.390> works<00:04:03.390> for

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
or whatever sensors this is works for

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.020 
or whatever sensors this is works for
your<00:04:03.900> smart<00:04:04.200> case<00:04:04.380> cover<00:04:04.650> so<00:04:05.400> basically<00:04:05.819> right

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
your smart case cover so basically right

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.930 
your smart case cover so basically right
here<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.390> have<00:04:06.709> four<00:04:07.709> decently<00:04:08.700> strong

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
here you have four decently strong

to the power switch but just by plugging
this<00:04:53.330> in<00:04:53.630> I<00:04:53.870> could<00:04:54.800> test<00:04:55.040> this<00:04:55.190> switch<00:04:55.520> and

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
this in I could test this switch and

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.050 
this in I could test this switch and
immediately<00:04:56.840> I<00:04:56.930> had<00:04:57.520> full<00:04:58.520> responsiveness

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
immediately I had full responsiveness

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.030 
immediately I had full responsiveness
and<00:04:59.420> also<00:05:00.260> leaving<00:05:00.560> this<00:05:00.650> plugged<00:05:00.920> in

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
and also leaving this plugged in

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.400 
and also leaving this plugged in
overnight<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.700> trying<00:05:02.660> to<00:05:02.750> use<00:05:02.930> up<00:05:03.110> as<00:05:03.230> much

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
overnight and trying to use up as much

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.160 
overnight and trying to use up as much
energy<00:05:03.860> from<00:05:03.980> this<00:05:04.190> iPad<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.630> battery<00:05:06.050> level

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
energy from this iPad the battery level

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.890 
energy from this iPad the battery level
seemed<00:05:06.590> to<00:05:06.740> hold<00:05:07.280> much<00:05:07.610> better<00:05:07.940> so<00:05:08.780> my

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
seemed to hold much better so my

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
seemed to hold much better so my
conclusion<00:05:09.500> is<00:05:10.210> this<00:05:11.210> sensor<00:05:11.690> here<00:05:12.020> which<00:05:12.770> is

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
conclusion is this sensor here which is

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.730 
conclusion is this sensor here which is
your<00:05:13.100> smart<00:05:13.460> case<00:05:13.640> sensor<00:05:14.170> my<00:05:15.170> guess<00:05:15.410> is<00:05:15.590> I

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
your smart case sensor my guess is I

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.830 
your smart case sensor my guess is I
overheated<00:05:16.460> it<00:05:16.580> when<00:05:17.000> trying<00:05:17.330> to<00:05:17.420> remove<00:05:17.660> the

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
overheated it when trying to remove the

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.390 
overheated it when trying to remove the
original<00:05:17.930> crack<00:05:18.850> digitizer<00:05:19.850> and<00:05:20.320> I<00:05:21.400> wouldn't

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
original crack digitizer and I wouldn't

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.160 
original crack digitizer and I wouldn't
say<00:05:22.610> it<00:05:22.670> killed<00:05:23.030> its<00:05:23.210> functionality<00:05:23.990> but

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
say it killed its functionality but

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.310 
say it killed its functionality but
definitely<00:05:24.590> altered<00:05:25.070> it<00:05:25.220> from<00:05:25.730> its<00:05:25.910> original

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
definitely altered it from its original

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.010 
definitely altered it from its original
intended<00:05:27.320> purpose<00:05:27.830> in<00:05:28.070> doing<00:05:28.180> so<00:05:29.180> I<00:05:29.210> my<00:05:29.780> guess

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
intended purpose in doing so I my guess

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.590 
intended purpose in doing so I my guess
is<00:05:30.230> it<00:05:30.350> stayed<00:05:30.590> stuck<00:05:31.070> down<00:05:31.460> to<00:05:31.820> say<00:05:32.090> in<00:05:32.360> the

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
is it stayed stuck down to say in the

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.890 
is it stayed stuck down to say in the
open<00:05:33.080> or<00:05:33.350> closed<00:05:34.310> position<00:05:34.900> constantly

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
open or closed position constantly

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.450 
open or closed position constantly
giving<00:05:36.110> a<00:05:36.200> signal<00:05:36.410> what<00:05:36.710> was<00:05:36.830> happening<00:05:37.310> with

giving a signal what was happening with

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.820 
giving a signal what was happening with
that<00:05:37.490> even<00:05:37.940> if<00:05:37.970> you<00:05:38.120> turn<00:05:38.300> it<00:05:38.480> off<00:05:38.690> as<00:05:38.990> far<00:05:39.800> as

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
that even if you turn it off as far as

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.480 
that even if you turn it off as far as
part<00:05:40.370> as<00:05:40.520> a<00:05:40.730> functionality<00:05:41.630> to<00:05:41.780> this<00:05:42.190> iPad<00:05:43.190> it

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
part as a functionality to this iPad it

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.030 
part as a functionality to this iPad it
still<00:05:44.350> created<00:05:45.350> a<00:05:45.410> signal<00:05:45.800> and<00:05:45.920> therefore

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
still created a signal and therefore

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.980 
still created a signal and therefore
drew<00:05:46.550> electricity<00:05:47.330> from<00:05:47.480> the<00:05:47.540> batteries

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
drew electricity from the batteries

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.340 
drew electricity from the batteries
causing<00:05:48.860> the<00:05:48.950> batteries<00:05:49.340> to<00:05:50.020> not<00:05:51.020> hold<00:05:51.200> a

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
causing the batteries to not hold a

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.370 
causing the batteries to not hold a
charge<00:05:51.560> for<00:05:51.950> very<00:05:52.280> long<00:05:52.490> at<00:05:52.670> all
