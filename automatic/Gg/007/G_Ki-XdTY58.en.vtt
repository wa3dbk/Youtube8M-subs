the<00:01:30.960> issue<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.950> play<00:01:32.189> itself<00:01:33.060> is

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
the issue I have with the play itself is

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.140 
the issue I have with the play itself is
that<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:36.540> guy<00:01:36.900> he<00:01:37.110> tries<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.470> pass<00:01:37.710> 285<00:01:38.520> morals

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
that the guy he tries to pass 285 morals

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.139 
that the guy he tries to pass 285 morals
is<00:01:40.400> he<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.640> get<00:01:41.820> stuck<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.409> linebacker

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
is he can get stuck on the linebacker

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.380 
is he can get stuck on the linebacker
right<00:01:45.149> there<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:46.729> that's<00:01:47.729> really<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.060> big

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
right there and that's really the big

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.020 
right there and that's really the big
issue<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.960> end<00:01:49.380> up<00:01:49.439> having<00:01:49.799> with<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.040> play<00:01:50.340> but

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
issue I end up having with this play but

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.760 
issue I end up having with this play but
I<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:52.320> how<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.680> plays<00:01:52.890> out<00:01:53.479> because<00:01:54.619> go<00:01:55.619> back

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
I like how it plays out because go back

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.520 
I like how it plays out because go back
to<00:01:56.149> quarterback<00:01:57.149> under<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:58.079> lot<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.259> pressure

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
to quarterback under a lot of pressure

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.459 
to quarterback under a lot of pressure
throws<00:01:59.270> it's<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> bad<00:02:00.509> pass<00:02:00.810> anyway<00:02:01.200> even<00:02:01.380> if

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
throws it's a bad pass anyway even if

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.590 
throws it's a bad pass anyway even if
the<00:02:01.590> tight<00:02:01.890> end<00:02:02.070> did<00:02:02.250> get<00:02:02.430> stuck<00:02:02.579> he<00:02:03.479> would

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
the tight end did get stuck he would

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.850 
the tight end did get stuck he would
still<00:02:03.899> be<00:02:04.079> behind<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.590> pass<00:02:06.860> constantly

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
still be behind this pass constantly

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.840 
still be behind this pass constantly
move<00:02:08.099> up<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> camera

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.150 

there<00:02:11.810> we<00:02:11.870> go<00:02:11.960> he<00:02:12.350> would<00:02:12.470> still<00:02:12.680> be<00:02:12.800> behind

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
there we go he would still be behind

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.620 
there we go he would still be behind
this<00:02:13.280> pass<00:02:13.580> because<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.970> can<00:02:17.120> see<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.420> ball

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
linebacker you might be up here maybe

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.330 
linebacker you might be up here maybe
but<00:02:31.520> not<00:02:31.850> up<00:02:32.240> on<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:33.800> safety<00:02:34.100> number<00:02:34.730> 25

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.490 
but not up on the safety number 25
there's<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.580> throw<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.300> here's<00:02:39.230> what<00:02:39.470> I

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
there's the throw and here's what I

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.310 
there's the throw and here's what I
really<00:02:40.010> love<00:02:41.800> it<00:02:42.800> doesn't<00:02:43.720> morph<00:02:44.720> into<00:02:45.020> this

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
really love it doesn't morph into this

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.010 
really love it doesn't morph into this
offensive<00:02:45.710> lineman's<00:02:46.190> helmet<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:47.450> doesn't

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
offensive lineman's helmet it doesn't

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.620 
offensive lineman's helmet it doesn't
hit<00:02:48.830> off<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.040> him<00:02:49.370> somehow<00:02:49.610> or<00:02:49.880> warp<00:02:50.120> over<00:02:50.420> into

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
hit off of him somehow or warp over into

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.150 
hit off of him somehow or warp over into
the<00:02:50.720> helmet<00:02:50.930> get<00:02:51.290> bounced<00:02:51.680> off<00:02:51.800> or<00:02:51.980> something

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
the helmet get bounced off or something

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.800 
the helmet get bounced off or something
like<00:02:52.220> that's<00:02:52.460> where<00:02:52.700> my<00:02:52.850> player<00:02:53.240> it<00:02:53.480> doesn't

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
like that's where my player it doesn't

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.860 
like that's where my player it doesn't
make<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.050> play<00:02:54.290> instead<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.910> ball<00:02:56.120> go

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
make the play instead the ball go

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.690 
make the play instead the ball go
straight<00:02:56.930> edge<00:02:57.440> trajectory<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.430> just

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
straight edge trajectory and it just

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.910 
straight edge trajectory and it just
shifts<00:02:59.120> only<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.930> make<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.200> animation<00:03:00.710> fit

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
shifts only to make the animation fit

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.330 
shifts only to make the animation fit
this<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:01.940> catch<00:03:02.210> either<00:03:02.840> why<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:04.070> if<00:03:04.190> there

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
this is a catch either why you if there

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.310 
this is a catch either why you if there
was<00:03:04.460> no<00:03:04.640> shift<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.180> mean<00:03:05.360> that<00:03:05.810> would<00:03:05.990> still<00:03:06.230> be

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
was no shift I mean that would still be

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.120 
was no shift I mean that would still be
a<00:03:06.350> catch<00:03:06.560> in<00:03:06.740> real<00:03:06.890> life<00:03:07.990> and<00:03:08.990> you<00:03:09.980> know

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
a catch in real life and you know

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.650 
a catch in real life and you know
frequently<00:03:10.730> you'll<00:03:10.910> see<00:03:11.120> things<00:03:11.300> were<00:03:11.540> like

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
frequently you'll see things were like

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.600 
frequently you'll see things were like
it<00:03:11.840> bounces<00:03:12.260> off<00:03:12.380> of<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.710> lineman's<00:03:13.130> helmet<00:03:13.520> or

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
it bounces off of a lineman's helmet or

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.880 
it bounces off of a lineman's helmet or
something<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:14.900> it's<00:03:15.050> you<00:03:15.110> can't<00:03:15.530> make<00:03:15.740> the

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
something so it's you can't make the

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.480 
something so it's you can't make the
play<00:03:16.120> but<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.390> actually<00:03:18.040> doesn't<00:03:19.040> do<00:03:19.310> that

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
play but it actually doesn't do that

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.880 
play but it actually doesn't do that
there's<00:03:19.970> no<00:03:20.180> shift<00:03:20.540> one<00:03:21.380> thing<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:21.650> don't<00:03:21.770> like

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
there's no shift one thing I don't like

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.200 
there's no shift one thing I don't like
us<00:03:22.100> right<00:03:22.280> here<00:03:22.340> he<00:03:22.670> gets<00:03:22.850> there<00:03:22.970> immediately

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
us right here he gets there immediately

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.520 
us right here he gets there immediately
shifted<00:03:23.570> into<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.960> tackle<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:27.260> tight

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
shifted into the tackle and this tight

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.720 
shifted into the tackle and this tight
end<00:03:27.710> acts<00:03:27.890> like<00:03:28.040> he's<00:03:28.130> still<00:03:28.310> catching<00:03:28.640> the

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
end acts like he's still catching the

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.300 
end acts like he's still catching the
ball<00:03:28.880> which<00:03:29.120> is<00:03:29.210> another<00:03:29.390> problem<00:03:30.310> but

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
ball which is another problem but

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.430 
ball which is another problem but
overall<00:03:32.150> this<00:03:32.450> was<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.660> really<00:03:32.900> well<00:03:33.140> played

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
overall this was a really well played

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.510 
overall this was a really well played
out<00:03:33.620> play<00:03:34.310> by<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.700> game<00:03:35.860> because<00:03:36.860> the

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
out play by the game because the

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.480 
out play by the game because the
quarterback<00:03:38.090> drops<00:03:38.990> back<00:03:39.260> he's<00:03:39.890> looking<00:03:40.310> and

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
quarterback drops back he's looking and

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.920 
quarterback drops back he's looking and
then<00:03:40.580> he<00:03:40.670> looks<00:03:40.880> back<00:03:41.180> real<00:03:41.480> quick<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.900> see

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
then he looks back real quick to see

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.710 
then he looks back real quick to see
their<00:03:42.200> name<00:03:42.350> pressure<00:03:42.650> coming<00:03:42.980> on<00:03:43.190> him<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:44.330> he

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
of the corner of his eye right here but

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.840 
of the corner of his eye right here but
he<00:03:51.560> can<00:03:51.710> see<00:03:52.660> Kimbrough<00:03:53.660> is<00:03:53.960> right<00:03:54.260> there<00:03:54.850> and

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
safety and elite safety let's just prove

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.040 
safety and elite safety let's just prove
that<00:04:31.460> point<00:04:31.730> because<00:04:32.270> I<00:04:32.390> know<00:04:32.450> something<00:04:32.930> like

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
that point because I know something like

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.030 
that point because I know something like
well<00:04:33.260> how<00:04:33.410> I<00:04:33.440> know<00:04:33.650> he's<00:04:33.920> a<00:04:33.950> leaders<00:04:34.430> like<00:04:34.730> that

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
well how I know he's a leaders like that
