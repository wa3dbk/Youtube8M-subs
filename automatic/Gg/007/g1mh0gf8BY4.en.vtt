well then the final steps you'll need to

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.280 
well then the final steps you'll need to
create<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.280> recovery<00:01:17.640> key<00:01:18.090> basically<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.140> so

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
create a recovery key basically it's so

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.899 
create a recovery key basically it's so
if<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.530> ever<00:01:19.650> forget<00:01:19.890> your<00:01:20.159> passwords<00:01:20.670> or
