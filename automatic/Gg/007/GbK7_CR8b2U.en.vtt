00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 and friends of youtube greets them 2038 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.880
 bringing you a new video this new 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.460
 video will try an arrangement of a 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.200
 texture that in my opinion is very good 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.109
 the first thing we should do 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.020
 I would download it from the link that I'm going to 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.980
 leave in the description and then we 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.519
 we go to the long chat blog and we go to the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.070
 option where it says the author's options 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:33.300
 here we only check this box if 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.120
 they have it unmarked then we go to 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.649
 textures package and here we look for the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.930
 folder where we have saved it in 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.489
 downloads 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.379
 text 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.649
 we only explain how they see is already 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:53.250
 installed would only be to give the button 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.250
 back 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.449
 once 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.160
 once epic of the process as you see already 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.260
 gave us everything good, we did not change what 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.750
 does this textures change us the 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.050
 armor is what they're going to see 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.050
 continuation 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.880
 here I already have something prepared 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.360
 and I will present to you what this 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.010
 paint what this texture does is that 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.820
 when we put all the 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:34.900
 tools and tools forgiveness 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:38.650
 the armors of the assemblers make us 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.710
 that see me appearance as you will see here 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.130
 I have the diamond erector but at 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.550
 time to put on what they see me 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.550
 change completely 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:56.490
 in the case of diamond that changes the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:00.490
 steve's face and an armor that would be 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:05.850
 a stick completely in my opinion is 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.850
 very good this texture since it is like this 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.819
 is originals of this structure from 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.230
 so 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.489
 and later 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.489
 let me leave this 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.819
 and now we 're going with the armor series 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.690
 is what makes us skeleton 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.690
 so now we take it 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.599
 and we only put it on 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.400
 how can you see this this texture is not 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.360
 is very complete for that at the time of 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.010
 put some equipment you can still see 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.000
 the color of the armor that we grab 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.480
 but when the creator updates the 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.060
 texture 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.380
 I'm going to update the link so that 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.830
 moment that you download them 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.120
 this does not have any kind of error 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.920
 as you can see here here I am already a 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:11.100
 complete is skeleton and let's go to the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:16.260
 next armor that would be the armor 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:19.610
 that converts us I think the grip is the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.600
 iron armor we just hold it 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.600
 and we stand 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.459
 as you can see here is jean and how 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.890
 you know the clipper is not the 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.739
 The real size of that asset is half 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.170
 and that I think the creator based on that 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:41.220
 it does not reach his legs but they 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.200
 I say that the creator is going to update it and 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.650
 when the current one I did I saved them 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.170
 I'm going to leave the link 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.740
 so now we 're going to the next 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.640
 to the next armor 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.400
 let's party 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.480
 and we go to the setter that we 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:04.650
 becomes a sick person it would be a 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.069
 mesh armor then we grabbed it 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.069
 we put it on 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.720
 how can you see 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.950
 here is the brother does not look like much 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.850
 but not only the helmet looks like the 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.700
 other doctor looks half bad but do not know 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.000
 worry that the creator will solve 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.250
 all these problems 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.480
 let's move on to the next 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:35.750
 and I think it would be the last 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.330
 that would be the armor that makes us 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.480
 in zombies that would be the armor of 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.620
 leather 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.979
 we usually grab it 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.010
 and we put it on as foresee this 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:51.380
 texture and it covers the entire body and 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:57.169
 in my opinion this end of this texture 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:05:00.699
 since the looks different 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:05.210
 assemblers to that other textures 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:07.370
 as you can see in my pine 6 very cool 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.830
 it's textured in my opinion I do not know how 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.020
 I ask them if this would be all for 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.440
 this video do not forget to give him the successes 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.669
 bust and we are also subscribe 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.669
 until the next video
