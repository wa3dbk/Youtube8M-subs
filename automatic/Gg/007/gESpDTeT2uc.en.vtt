move<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.190> don't<00:00:35.430> know<00:00:35.489> what<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.760> would<00:00:35.820> do<00:00:35.940> our

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
move I don't know what you would do our

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.080 
move I don't know what you would do our
breakaway<00:00:36.390> move<00:00:36.660> but<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.950> then<00:00:38.129> break<00:00:38.430> up<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
breakaway move but and then break up the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.660 
breakaway move but and then break up the
one<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.360> like<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.899> use<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> most<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.829> break<00:00:41.370> up

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
one I like to use the most is a break up

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.060 
one I like to use the most is a break up
I<00:00:41.790> think<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.210> soo<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.530> game<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
I think it's soo in this game the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.950 
I think it's soo in this game the
hitting<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.670> powerful<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.450> think<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:45.840> one

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
hitting is so powerful I think it's one

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.209 
hitting is so powerful I think it's one
of<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.110> only<00:00:46.260> ones<00:00:46.559> where<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.829> actually<00:00:47.129> have

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
of the only ones where you actually have

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.660 
of the only ones where you actually have
time<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> set<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.090> set<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.550> then

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
time to set it up set it up so and then

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.939 
time to set it up set it up so and then
you<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.879> do<00:00:50.940> offensive<00:00:51.420> zone<00:00:51.449> too<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:52.289> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
you can do offensive zone too but you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.170 
you can do offensive zone too but you
might<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.160> able<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.460> set<00:00:53.610> something<00:00:53.789> up<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
might be able to set something up on the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.150 
might be able to set something up on the
powerplay<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> always<00:00:55.530> found<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
powerplay but I always found that in the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.849 
powerplay but I always found that in the
offensive<00:00:56.789> zone<00:00:57.289> the<00:00:58.289> guys<00:00:58.469> are<00:00:58.620> pretty<00:00:58.770> much

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
offensive zone the guys are pretty much

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.069 
offensive zone the guys are pretty much
set<00:00:59.160> up<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.399> position<00:00:59.609> anyways<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.930> only

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
set up in position anyways like the only

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.900 
set up in position anyways like the only
one<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.260> might<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.949> able<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.430> behind<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
one I might be able to do is behind the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
one I might be able to do is behind the
net<00:01:03.830> maybe<00:01:04.830> at<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.250> point<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.760> don't<00:01:06.030> know<00:01:06.180> but

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
net maybe at the point I don't know but

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.920 
net maybe at the point I don't know but
I<00:01:07.260> feel<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.369> get<00:01:08.610> hit<00:01:08.820> too<00:01:09.000> much<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
I feel like you get hit too much in the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.700 
I feel like you get hit too much in the
offensive<00:01:10.439> zone

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
offensive zone

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.070 
offensive zone

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
everyone's gonna be breaking out and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.670 
everyone's gonna be breaking out and
then<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.899> kind<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.110> throw<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.380> up<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.649> that

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
then I can kind of throw it up like that

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.560 
then I can kind of throw it up like that
or<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> could<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.579> take<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.000> right<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.360> right

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
or I could just take it right in right

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.710 
or I could just take it right in right
so<00:01:49.399> what<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.430> want<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.850> do<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.360> see<00:01:51.540> how<00:01:51.689> I

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
basically just have three lines going

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.550 
basically just have three lines going
nuts<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.479> doesn't<00:01:54.869> look<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.020> there's<00:01:55.380> much

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
nuts it doesn't look like there's much

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.090 
nuts it doesn't look like there's much
creative<00:01:56.219> there<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.619> Zetterberg

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
creative there but you I have Zetterberg

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.730 
creative there but you I have Zetterberg
going<00:01:59.430> straight<00:01:59.969> up<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.869> got<00:02:01.110> two<00:02:01.350> kind<00:02:01.710> of

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
going straight up I have got two kind of

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.410 
going straight up I have got two kind of
going<00:02:02.009> out<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.369> loop<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:02.850> he's<00:02:03.000> gonna<00:02:03.149> cut

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
going out on a loop so he's gonna cut

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.510 
going out on a loop so he's gonna cut
he's<00:02:03.689> gonna<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> little<00:02:04.320> bit<00:02:04.469> slower<00:02:04.799> which

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
he's gonna be a little bit slower which

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.100 
he's gonna be a little bit slower which
is<00:02:05.729> an<00:02:05.850> outlet<00:02:06.180> pass

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
is an outlet pass

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.130 
is an outlet pass

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and I have Alfredson there on the left

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.320 
and I have Alfredson there on the left
side<00:02:10.400> actually<00:02:11.400> might<00:02:11.550> be<00:02:11.580> Cleary<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.150> this

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
side actually might be Cleary in this

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.320 
side actually might be Cleary in this
because<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:12.630> offline<00:02:12.990> but<00:02:13.820> yeah<00:02:14.820> anyways

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
because it's offline but yeah anyways

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.940 
because it's offline but yeah anyways
and<00:02:15.540> he<00:02:15.660> goes<00:02:15.840> right<00:02:16.080> up<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.410> if<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.680> wait<00:02:16.920> a

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
and he goes right up so if I wait a

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.940 
and he goes right up so if I wait a
couple<00:02:17.190> seconds<00:02:17.790> watch<00:02:18.750> him<00:02:18.930> go<00:02:19.110> he'll<00:02:19.710> keep

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
couple seconds watch him go he'll keep

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.040 
couple seconds watch him go he'll keep
going<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.640> then<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:20.880> can<00:02:21.090> fire<00:02:21.330> way<00:02:21.660> up<00:02:21.810> there

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
going and then I can fire way up there

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.230 
going and then I can fire way up there
that<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.800> Cleary<00:02:23.100> now<00:02:23.460> if<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.790> run<00:02:23.970> into

fact that I just don't think you have
enough<00:03:02.160> time<00:03:02.520> to<00:03:02.670> set<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:02.910> up<00:03:03.090> but<00:03:03.600> how<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.810> do

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
enough time to set it up but how you do

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.590 
enough time to set it up but how you do
it<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:05.370> first<00:03:05.670> guy<00:03:05.940> you're<00:03:06.300> recording
