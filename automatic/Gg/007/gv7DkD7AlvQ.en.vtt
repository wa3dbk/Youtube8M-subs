00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
work you can always try to stick a

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.810 
work you can always try to stick a
little<00:01:26.850> drop<00:01:29.240> make<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.360> work<00:01:31.280> down<00:01:32.280> into<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
little drop make it work down into the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
pen itself just like that and just let

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.330 
pen itself just like that and just let
it<00:01:36.930> soak<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.500> don't<00:01:37.590> want<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> whole

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
it soak in you don't want to do a whole

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.069 
it soak in you don't want to do a whole
lot<00:01:38.780> maybe<00:01:39.780> three<00:01:40.259> drops<00:01:40.590> at<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.890> most

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.190 

because<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.200> will<00:01:46.380> get<00:01:46.619> some<00:01:47.689> little<00:01:48.689> spew
