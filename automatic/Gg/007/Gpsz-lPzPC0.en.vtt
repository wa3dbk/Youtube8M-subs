insane in the penalty area probably one
of<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.040> best<00:01:35.280> finishes<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:36.060> tried

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
of the best finishes I have tried

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.760 
of the best finishes I have tried
because<00:01:36.960> his<00:01:37.110> strength<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.650> aggression

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
because his strength and aggression

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.649 
because his strength and aggression
really<00:01:38.400> helped<00:01:38.610> him<00:01:38.759> out<00:01:38.909> even<00:01:39.090> when<00:01:39.540> he's

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
really helped him out even when he's

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.690 
really helped him out even when he's
surrounded<00:01:40.020> by<00:01:40.259> defenders<00:01:40.799> he<00:01:40.979> still<00:01:41.250> manages

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
surrounded by defenders he still manages

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.580 
surrounded by defenders he still manages
to<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:41.939> her<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.299> target<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.990> most<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
to get her on target and most of the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.960 
to get her on target and most of the
time<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.950> ends<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.399> back<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.790> net

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
time it ends up in the back of the net

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.819 
time it ends up in the back of the net

his<00:02:05.460> disadvantages<00:02:06.360> are<00:02:06.540> he<00:02:06.659> has<00:02:06.810> balance

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
his disadvantages are he has balance

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.080 
his disadvantages are he has balance
issues<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.920> think<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.550> really<00:02:08.910> though

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
issues I think it is really though

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.180 
issues I think it is really though
because<00:02:09.720> even<00:02:10.050> when<00:02:10.259> defenders<00:02:10.679> are<00:02:10.800> strung

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
because even when defenders are strung

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.220 
because even when defenders are strung
into<00:02:11.400> perm<00:02:11.670> off<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.970> ball<00:02:12.120> he<00:02:12.480> ends<00:02:12.780> up<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
into perm off the ball he ends up on the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.590 
into perm off the ball he ends up on the
ground

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
ground

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.990 
ground
quite<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.930> lot<00:02:14.170> sometimes<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:14.920> have<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.370> put

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
quite a lot sometimes so you have to put

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.970 
quite a lot sometimes so you have to put
up<00:02:16.120> with<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.900> he<00:02:17.140> has<00:02:17.290> freestyle<00:02:17.740> skills

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
up with that and he has freestyle skills

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.100 
up with that and he has freestyle skills
so<00:02:18.340> he<00:02:18.580> has<00:02:19.000> been<00:02:19.150> downgraded<00:02:19.360> from<00:02:19.690> last<00:02:19.960> year

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
so he has been downgraded from last year

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.080 
so he has been downgraded from last year
with<00:02:20.290> his<00:02:20.320> skill<00:02:20.680> moves<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.340> freestyle<00:02:21.850> skills

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
with his skill moves so freestyle skills

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.900 
with his skill moves so freestyle skills
but<00:02:22.600> his<00:02:22.990> shooting<00:02:23.380> seems<00:02:23.950> way<00:02:24.340> more<00:02:24.370> better
