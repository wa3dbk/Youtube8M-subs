00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.639
 today the natalia nutritionist is urban 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.289
 brings us a recipe for a tiramisu 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.599
 dietary that can still consume 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.300
 people who have restrictions with the 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:25.679
 sugar 26 grams of sweeteners 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 whitfield 400 grams of cream cheese 320 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:31.919
 grams of milk cream 4 grams of 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.920
 unflavored gelatin 30 milliliters of water 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.920
 dietary cookies for base and coffee 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.589
 Instant for gelatin 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.890
 for each gram of gelatin we go to 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.899
 use 7 water granites here that 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.789
 let's do then let's hydrate 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.469
 again gelatin gelatin 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.489
 always moisturize in cold water let's 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.489
 take the cream cheese 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.040
 we always start to beat the thickest 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.010
 except when we are going to work with the 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.930
 condensed milk 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.900
 and once we're there we're going to add the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.110
 sweetener 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.110
 and let's go 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.259
 the coffee in water is already brown then 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.409
 one can add liquor then 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.969
 we're just going to soak the cookie 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.289
 we leave it there is a little bit not much 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:39.179
 ours that we were and during a little 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.179
 and we put the base ribbon of the cookie 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.530
 so that it gives a little more flavor to 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:54.010
 coffee I like to sprinkle coffee at 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:55.360
 cookies here and have its integrated 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.670
 then what we are going to do is 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.650
 add the milk cream also the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.120
 let's add while we beat the 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.350
 low speed while we go 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.350
 this unflavored gelatin 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.480
 the gelatin is very important that 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.000
 Let us listen when we 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.250
 so that it will not boil us when the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.379
 gelatin without savoring you miss the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.540
 property of hardening us the desserts and 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.370
 cough then simply that you 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.220
 see how some are formed around 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.319
 little bubbles there and we lower it we can 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.090
 make in the microwave while hanging 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.549
 of not going to boil or in a pot 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.799
 to bain-marie there is more visual you 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.090
 they can be more outstanding as they are 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.680
 that is not melting those 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.290
 gelatins and then they can do it 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.459
 also in a water bath and we already have the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.459
 jello list looks 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.090
 we are going to stir a little here because 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.320
 on the walls there is always a little 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:09.570
 then stuck like cream cheese then 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.570
 we just integrate well 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.700
 let's serve more or less until the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.920
 half and we put another base quote from 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.810
 cookies like to make it look like 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.810
 sponge cake that is like in capital 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.820
 again there then we are going to spray 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.650
 coffee and if we want to add the 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:56.920
 chopped nuts are also going to 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:56.920
 add there we add the last chapel 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.690
 and we come to refrigeration 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.270
 well then here we have the tiramisu 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.270
 let's spray a little coffee 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:22.049
 and share the dessert even with those who 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.970
 they take care of the sugar it's a wonder 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.910
 I propose that you prepare in your next 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.760
 family reunion a dietary dessert 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.900

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.900
