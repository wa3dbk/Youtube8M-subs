00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:18.900
 Hi there, this is a game review 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:23.150
 dev hunter by genre is scuba 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.140
 underwater hunting is such a common 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.060
 long time no longer well 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.509
 a series of the most original games and me 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.600
 it seems this game is great here 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:36.080
 such qualifications here in general let's 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.500
 let's start a new game and i'll show you right away 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.199
 in practice 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.900
 how little is the game 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.970
 so we appear here with water itself 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.720
 everything is very well detailed 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.019
 after all there is not much here but we need 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:57.830
 catch 2 any 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:57.830
 fish-drop fish than miss 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.590
 that's the surface of course is not so 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.410
 modeled cool like the underwater world 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.330
 so no no no no no no no 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:17.220
 chapter this keyboard is floating for sure 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:19.080
 or not need need need got caught yet 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.440
 name in well i'm not in fish 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.360
 I understand and honestly what my 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.729
 Basically, I don't care 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.090
 fish classification big fish 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.460
 small fish 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.320
 pull pull pull the fisherman to all 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.759
 You need to draw a ring of muscle 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.900
 use what the wheel is 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:43.070
 broken or not at all you have to 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.070
 like so everyone got it 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.070
 chic white here brown what 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:00.210
 washed surfaces 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:03.630
 Well, of course here now the graphics are not happy 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.410
 in general, such birds fly because 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.610
 landscape so abstract 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.650
 now we will look for you now 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.590
 the fish that we really need here 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.590
 This seems to be a flock of Crimea that I do not even know 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.050
 I think this on those helpers 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.120
 but 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.220
 it is smooth 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.220
 together where it shows us. 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.319
 probably not where is the usual established 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:45.380
 he looks 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:50.120
 now catch air to cool tough 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:54.340
 phrase fish tassels and 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.340
 you can't catch one 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.090
 on the bottom 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.090
 Caught caught caught far she alone 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.469
 It was 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:24.959
 I happened to you fish, no one 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:27.230
 swim away 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.230
 fish 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:39.070
 I fell Dad Dad let else that something is not 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.100
 because I float away nepal this is now 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:47.470
 there just need 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:55.740
 dublin is not a tag at all give on 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:55.740
 that you need air and swallow do not forget 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:04.969
 Yes, I do not like scuba hunting 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.330
 and don't like crazy 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.370
 this fish do not need to speak clearly 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:35.010
 and this one should have been okay then we mean 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.010
 these catch there already see 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:51.110
 not only at the last moment so 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.020
 not fair 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.270
 it's not fair to be the last moment right 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.840
 from under the nose 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.930
 did you it is not the fish that we 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.930
 need 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.940
 yes this is not what we need 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:43.399
 again no have caught us ends 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.399
 the air needs to go up 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:51.720
 even a warning of you is not prophets 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.720
 there are continue 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:04.110
 fish and ships poor mouse wheel 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:14.259
 how so hate again when so 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:17.530
 going on hate by the way of these 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:24.580
 fairy tales can not shoot should be 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:29.039
 the house crashes and the inscription 3 is good 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.039
 the fish are bad so we have it 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:38.370
 a scuba tree what what is it really like 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:41.789
 scuba tree okay for sure 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:44.910
 you already understand the essence of the game we are swimming 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:48.690
 shoot a fisherman do not happen 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:51.260
 back to that I think everything will not 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:54.900
 delay our review. so Littel 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:58.320

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:02.900

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.900
 it happens it will not be how could I become 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:09.090
 . that's 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:15.340
