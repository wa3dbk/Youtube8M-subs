00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
new building into the game and this

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.610 
new building into the game and this
building<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.989> making<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
building is going to be making for a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.220 
building is going to be making for a
game<00:00:59.100> changer<00:00:59.760> because<00:01:00.120> yesterday<00:01:00.719> we<00:01:00.960> spoke

game changer because yesterday we spoke

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.049 
game changer because yesterday we spoke
about<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.710> prototype<00:01:02.160> modules<00:01:02.609> these

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
about the prototype modules these

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.179 
about the prototype modules these
modules<00:01:03.539> are<00:01:03.719> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.019> be<00:01:04.140> used<00:01:04.379> into<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
modules are going to be used into the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.340 
modules are going to be used into the
weapon<00:01:05.610> lab<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.900> weapon<00:01:07.200> lab

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
weapon lab and the weapon lab

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.870 
weapon lab and the weapon lab
essentially<00:01:07.890> will<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.250> available<00:01:08.729> from

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
essentially will be available from

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.120 
essentially will be available from
headquarters<00:01:09.180> level<00:01:09.750> 15<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.200> above<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.710> it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
headquarters level 15 and above and it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.030 
headquarters level 15 and above and it
will<00:01:11.310> allow<00:01:11.640> us<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.909> create<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.470> listen<00:01:13.920> very

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
will allow us to create and listen very

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.870 
will allow us to create and listen very
carefully<00:01:14.310> very<00:01:15.210> powerful<00:01:15.990> prototype

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
carefully very powerful prototype

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.789 
carefully very powerful prototype
defense<00:01:17.880> weapons<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.960> means<00:01:19.229> that

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
defense weapons so that means that

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.920 
defense weapons so that means that
defense<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> be<00:01:21.000> relevant<00:01:21.509> again

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
defense is going to be relevant again

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.929 
defense is going to be relevant again
I<00:01:22.080> mean<00:01:22.290> defense<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> major<00:01:23.369> issue<00:01:23.610> into

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
I mean defense was a major issue into

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.969 
I mean defense was a major issue into
the<00:01:24.060> game<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.600> right<00:01:24.930> now<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.439> hopefully

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the game and right now that hopefully

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.270 
the game and right now that hopefully
should<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.369> fixed<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> weapon<00:01:27.720> lag<00:01:27.930> so

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
should be fixed with the weapon lag so

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.160 
should be fixed with the weapon lag so
it's<00:01:29.280> very<00:01:29.460> important<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.210> make<00:01:30.420> sure<00:01:30.450> that

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
it's very important to make sure that

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.780 
it's very important to make sure that
you're<00:01:31.350> able<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.770> defend<00:01:32.159> your<00:01:32.310> base<00:01:32.460> very

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
you're able to defend your base very

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.310 
you're able to defend your base very
well<00:01:33.030> especially<00:01:33.270> during<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> event<00:01:34.200> in

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
well especially during the event in

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.390 
well especially during the event in
which<00:01:34.350> hammer<00:01:34.770> man<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> be

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
which hammer man is going to be

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.920 
which hammer man is going to be
attacking<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.390> have<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.570> chance<00:01:36.810> of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
attacking you you have a chance of

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.390 
attacking you you have a chance of
getting<00:01:37.049> these<00:01:37.350> prototype<00:01:37.890> modules<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
getting these prototype modules to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.609 
getting these prototype modules to
upgrade<00:01:38.759> your<00:01:38.909> base<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.290> forth

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.980 
gonna be able to get these whenever you
defeat<00:01:47.579> opponents<00:01:47.909> onto<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.420> map<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:48.750> if<00:01:48.869> you

having a chance of getting one of these

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.530 
having a chance of getting one of these
prototype<00:01:53.189> modules<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.000> or<00:01:54.119> programs

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
prototype modules that is or programs

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.149 
prototype modules that is or programs
the<00:01:54.899> one<00:01:55.110> thing<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.439> I'm<00:01:55.530> really<00:01:55.560> excited

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the one thing that I'm really excited

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.310 
the one thing that I'm really excited
about<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.600> check<00:01:57.899> out<00:01:58.049> what

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
about is just to really check out what

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.200 
about is just to really check out what
kind<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.680> defense<00:01:59.250> weapons<00:01:59.670> were<00:01:59.790> able<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
kind of defense weapons were able to

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.510 
kind of defense weapons were able to
create<00:02:00.570> with<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> weapon<00:02:01.170> lab<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.530> there's

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
create with the weapon lab and there's

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.280 
create with the weapon lab and there's
also<00:02:02.700> not<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.000> thing<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.869> think<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.259> very

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
also not a thing that I think it's very

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.450 
also not a thing that I think it's very
important<00:02:04.860> for<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.040> take<00:02:05.310> into

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
important for you to take into

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.089 
important for you to take into
consideration<00:02:05.780> these<00:02:06.780> defense<00:02:07.469> weapons<00:02:07.890> are

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
consideration these defense weapons are

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.910 
consideration these defense weapons are
very<00:02:08.819> unstable<00:02:09.300> because<00:02:09.690> they<00:02:10.259> won't<00:02:10.560> last

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
very unstable because they won't last

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.360 
very unstable because they won't last
forever

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
forever

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.699 
forever
after<00:02:12.730> 12<00:02:13.090> days<00:02:13.180> they<00:02:13.660> will<00:02:13.810> stop<00:02:14.080> working<00:02:14.560> and

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
after 12 days they will stop working and

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.949 
after 12 days they will stop working and
they<00:02:15.129> will<00:02:15.280> explode<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.150> be<00:02:16.390> sure<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.810> prepare

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
they will explode so be sure to prepare

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.630 
they will explode so be sure to prepare
some<00:02:17.319> more<00:02:17.530> modules<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.099> that<00:02:18.220> way<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.400> can

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
some more modules in that way you can

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.059 
some more modules in that way you can
rebuild<00:02:19.030> these<00:02:19.269> prototype<00:02:20.140> defenses<00:02:20.769> and<00:02:20.920> so

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
rebuild these prototype defenses and so

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.770 
rebuild these prototype defenses and so
on<00:02:21.129> and<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.340> forth<00:02:21.640> if<00:02:21.819> you<00:02:22.450> by<00:02:22.569> any<00:02:22.599> chance
