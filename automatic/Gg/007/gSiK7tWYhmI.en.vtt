00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
felt really dull being in black and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.450 
felt really dull being in black and
white<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.500> mean<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.710> couldn't<00:00:34.920> really<00:00:35.070> minister

white I mean we couldn't really minister
these<00:00:35.610> are<00:00:35.820> these<00:00:36.450> subtle<00:00:36.750> things<00:00:36.989> like

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
these are these subtle things like

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.900 
these are these subtle things like
Ramona's<00:00:37.680> frequent<00:00:38.070> hair<00:00:38.190> dyeing<00:00:38.399> habits<00:00:38.730> or

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
Ramona's frequent hair dyeing habits or

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.520 
Ramona's frequent hair dyeing habits or
the<00:00:39.210> color<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.629> those<00:00:39.780> running<00:00:39.989> environments

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the color of those running environments

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.950 
the color of those running environments
so<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.340> color<00:00:41.520> does<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.480> does<00:00:42.629> add<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> new

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
so the color does it does add a new

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.270 
so the color does it does add a new
dimension<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> series<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:43.950> makes<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.219> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
dimension to the series and makes it a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.490 
dimension to the series and makes it a
whole<00:00:44.460> lot<00:00:44.489> more<00:00:44.700> enjoyable<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.180> read<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.110> yeah

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
whole lot more enjoyable to read so yeah

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.020 
whole lot more enjoyable to read so yeah
I<00:00:46.530> think<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.039> feels<00:00:47.219> more<00:00:47.370> complete<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.820> way

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
I think it feels more complete this way

to<00:01:17.970> look<00:01:18.150> better<00:01:18.360> than<00:01:18.420> they<00:01:18.600> were<00:01:18.720> before<00:01:18.810> now

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
to look better than they were before now

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.719 
to look better than they were before now
I<00:01:19.350> know<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.590> few<00:01:19.830> people<00:01:20.040> who've<00:01:20.340> been<00:01:20.460> calling

I know a few people who've been calling

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.280 
I know a few people who've been calling
this<00:01:20.820> an<00:01:20.939> omnibus<00:01:21.270> but<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:21.810> not<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.110> that

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
this an omnibus but it's not like that

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.440 
this an omnibus but it's not like that
at<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.860> basically<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.549> funny<00:01:23.909> one<00:01:24.150> it

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
at all it's basically just funny one it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.149 
at all it's basically just funny one it
was<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.930> bunch<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.229> significant<00:01:25.860> changes

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
was just a bunch of significant changes

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.710 
was just a bunch of significant changes
he's<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> small<00:01:26.670> comparison<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.240> did<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
he's a small comparison I did with the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.510 
he's a small comparison I did with the
original<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.650> pretty<00:01:28.920> clear<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
original and it's pretty clear that the

practically the same as the hardcover in
front<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.920> me<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.880> has<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> different

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
cover anyway overall this is a great

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.800 
cover anyway overall this is a great
addition<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> series<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.420> was<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> holy

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
addition to the series it was a holy

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.870 
addition to the series it was a holy
reading<00:01:46.170> experience<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:46.710> me<00:01:46.799> as<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.640> color

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
reading experience for me as the color

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.460 
reading experience for me as the color
pumps<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.329> love<00:01:48.540> life<00:01:48.750> into<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.079> comic<00:01:49.320> book

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
pumps a love life into the comic book

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.130 
pumps a love life into the comic book
now<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.640> isn't<00:01:50.970> exactly<00:01:51.180> essential<00:01:51.960> for

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
now but this isn't exactly essential for

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.240 
now but this isn't exactly essential for
those<00:01:52.259> who've<00:01:52.500> already<00:01:52.619> read<00:01:53.009> through<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
those who've already read through the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.100 
those who've already read through the
comic<00:01:53.490> books<00:01:53.670> but<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.210> basically<00:01:54.630> acts<00:01:54.840> like

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
comic books but it basically acts like

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.050 
comic books but it basically acts like
collector's<00:01:55.619> edition<00:01:55.979> well<00:01:56.310> sort<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.850> and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
collector's edition well sort of and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.940 
collector's edition well sort of and
plus<00:01:57.840> they<00:01:57.960> look<00:01:57.990> nice<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.350> yourself<00:01:58.649> at<00:01:58.770> least

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
plus they look nice in yourself at least

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.920 
plus they look nice in yourself at least
so<00:01:59.280> if<00:01:59.909> you're<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> hardcore<00:02:00.420> Scott<00:02:00.750> Pilgrim

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
so if you're a hardcore Scott Pilgrim

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.240 
so if you're a hardcore Scott Pilgrim
fan<00:02:01.229> there<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.560> might<00:02:01.710> want<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.890> pick<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.100> up

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
fan there you might want to pick this up

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.740 
fan there you might want to pick this up
but<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:02.850> you're<00:02:02.969> completely<00:02:03.270> new<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.570> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
but if you're completely new to the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.060 
but if you're completely new to the
series<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.500> probably<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> way<00:02:05.009> to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
series and this is probably the way to

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.889 
series and this is probably the way to
start<00:02:05.399> as<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.180> Scott<00:02:06.390> Pilgrim<00:02:06.570> when<00:02:06.780> it's

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
start as this is Scott Pilgrim when it's

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.479 
start as this is Scott Pilgrim when it's
full<00:02:07.079> glory<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.099> all<00:02:08.190> happening

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
full glory in out so it's all happening

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:08.660 
full glory in out so it's all happening
here

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
here

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.669 
here
the<00:02:09.270> next<00:02:09.569> color<00:02:09.750> edition<00:02:10.140> will<00:02:10.319> probably<00:02:10.560> be

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
the next color edition will probably be

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.760 
the next color edition will probably be
out<00:02:10.830> sometime<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.610> a

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770

out sometime it's a
and<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.280> probably<00:02:12.550> make<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> mini-review<00:02:13.150> based

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510
