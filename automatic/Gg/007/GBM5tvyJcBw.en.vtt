00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
see this if we could use this guy's an

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.330 
see this if we could use this guy's an
example<00:01:38.040> little<00:01:39.380> Timmy<00:01:40.759> for<00:01:41.759> there<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.600> go

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
example little Timmy for there we go

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.030 
example little Timmy for there we go
yeah<00:01:44.340> if<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.210> server<00:01:45.450> has<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.930> little<00:01:46.170> greater

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
yeah if a server has that little greater

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.280 
yeah if a server has that little greater
than<00:01:47.310> less<00:01:47.549> than<00:01:47.610> sign<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.450> easily<00:01:48.720> do

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
than less than sign you can easily do

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.859 
than less than sign you can easily do
this<00:01:49.320> without<00:01:49.770> any<00:01:50.189> colors<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.030> don't<00:01:51.689> think

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
this without any colors I don't think

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.530 
this without any colors I don't think
you<00:01:52.020> don't<00:01:52.320> need<00:01:52.530> any<00:01:52.829> colors<00:01:53.399> at<00:01:53.549> all<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.939> look

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540
