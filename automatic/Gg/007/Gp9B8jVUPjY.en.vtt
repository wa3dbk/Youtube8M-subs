00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
guess somebody just told me that the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.370 
guess somebody just told me that the
team<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.630> season<00:01:39.930> players<00:01:40.140> they<00:01:40.320> are

team of the season players they are

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.830 
team of the season players they are
