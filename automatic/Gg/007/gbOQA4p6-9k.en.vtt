00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.869
 Model Julia is already excited about her 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.820
 waiting for a trendy pony hairstyle 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.920
 no imagination forward with me 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.320
 A pony would look like that because I am 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.660
 never had one and a bit 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.980
 I fear that it is still difficult 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.100
 to get it that way 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.960
 without a hairdresser but her fear is 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.239
 unfounded because she is the good one 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.059
 Hands dry cut specialist Mike 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.070
 day knows what's in demand this summer 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.530
 which is very important for the pony 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.690
 Nowadays landfill is borne and 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.760
 this is the valid stop and then 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.980
 wants the broadway longer than one 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.900
 a bit like in the 60s and that 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.030
 result can be seen too 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.710
 if julia is still a bit uncertain 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.320
 So I'm not really in the game 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.200
 because I can not get out and 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.910
 I'm really scared to come to the mirror 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.100
 sometimes you have to look for new hairstyles 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.520
 get used to and the courage to change 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.220
 this includes trends in 2015 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.240
 area mens hairstyles require a lot 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.100
 to courage 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.720
 tell the customers that will be braver 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.800
 Man has one last year 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.520
 Little bit of what the magazine said 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.050
 give 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.640
 but now you have some already 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.960
 then come in and say okay now 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.200
 I really do the pages so far 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.760
 down to two millimeters and that 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.190
 This year is changing very much 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.260
 is also advice in summer again for women 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.300

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.490

 presented by star barber Patrick 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.440
 Cameron's creations prove that 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.330
 trend is going away from more accurate 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.630
 straightforwardness and orderly 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.630
 chaos, therefore, also courage to change 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.960
 and 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.960
