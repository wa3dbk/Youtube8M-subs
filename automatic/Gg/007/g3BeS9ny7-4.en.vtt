off<00:01:35.400> from<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.000> then<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.869> enter<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.560> sky

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
off from that and then you enter the sky

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.370 
off from that and then you enter the sky
grid<00:01:38.070> map<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.460> basically<00:01:39.390> most<00:01:39.689> guy<00:01:39.930> grid<00:01:40.140> maps

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
grid map so basically most guy grid maps

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.149 
grid map so basically most guy grid maps
because<00:01:41.810> you<00:01:42.810> kind<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.229> spawn<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
because you kind of just spawn on the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.469 
because you kind of just spawn on the
blocks<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.700> spot<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.119> middle<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
blocks and you spot in the middle and

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.179 
blocks and you spot in the middle and
it's<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.079> massive<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:46.829> that's<00:01:47.070> pretty

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
it's just so massive like that's pretty

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.030 
it's just so massive like that's pretty
cool<00:01:47.780> but<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.960> here<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.439> kind<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.770> wanted<00:01:49.950> to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
cool but on here we kind of wanted to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.340 
cool but on here we kind of wanted to
spawn<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.369> up<00:01:50.430> top<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.850> when<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.320> when<00:01:52.320> you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
spawn you up top so when you when you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.219 
spawn you up top so when you when you
jump<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.890> stuff<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.340> don't<00:01:53.579> die<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.509> you

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
jump in stuff you don't die so it is you

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.929 
jump in stuff you don't die so it is you
know<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.100> potential<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.640> fall

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
know you can you have potential to fall

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.480 
know you can you have potential to fall
on<00:01:57.119> other<00:01:57.360> blocks<00:01:57.750> per<00:01:58.020> se<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:59.009> basically

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
on other blocks per se so basically

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.670 
on other blocks per se so basically
we're<00:01:59.939> jmac<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.780> are<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.049> treat<00:02:01.409> this

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
we're jmac and I are going to treat this

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.200 
we're jmac and I are going to treat this
and<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.159> know<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.700> guys<00:02:02.880> are<00:02:03.000> gonna<00:02:03.090> be

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and I know that you guys are gonna be

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.580 
and I know that you guys are gonna be
like<00:02:03.329> you're<00:02:03.479> full<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.960> because<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.469> took

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
like you're full of because it took

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.200 
like you're full of because it took
you<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:04.860> long<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.219> get<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> download<00:02:05.850> link<00:02:06.060> out

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
you so long to get the download link out

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.330 
you so long to get the download link out
but<00:02:06.659> no<00:02:06.750> jmac<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.320> will<00:02:07.530> be<00:02:07.680> treating<00:02:08.190> this

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
but no jmac and I will be treating this

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.890 
but no jmac and I will be treating this
like<00:02:10.099> like<00:02:11.099> an<00:02:11.250> actual<00:02:11.610> minecraft<00:02:12.239> PC<00:02:12.660> server

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
like like an actual minecraft PC server

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.490 
like like an actual minecraft PC server
and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
and
what<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.040> mean<00:02:14.190> by<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.850> we<00:02:15.270> will<00:02:15.510> be

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
what I mean by that is that we will be

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.230 
what I mean by that is that we will be
updating<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.650> as<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:17.400> can<00:02:17.520> see<00:02:17.760> right<00:02:17.970> now

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
updating it as you can see right now

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.270 
updating it as you can see right now
it's<00:02:18.720> not<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.990> biggest<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.920> know<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.040> mean

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
it's not the biggest you know I mean

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.340 
it's not the biggest you know I mean
it's<00:02:20.430> actually<00:02:20.580> pretty<00:02:21.480> decent<00:02:21.720> size<00:02:22.080> it's

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
it's actually pretty decent size it's

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.260 
it's actually pretty decent size it's
pretty<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:23.400> know<00:02:23.520> guys<00:02:23.730> it's<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.060> pretty

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
pretty you know guys it's a pretty

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.470 
pretty you know guys it's a pretty
massive<00:02:24.680> server<00:02:25.680> or<00:02:26.040> not<00:02:26.520> server<00:02:26.850> but<00:02:27.180> it's<00:02:27.420> a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
massive server or not server but it's a

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.930 
massive server or not server but it's a
pretty<00:02:27.630> massive<00:02:27.840> map<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.980> mean<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.490> has<00:02:29.640> all

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
pretty massive map and I mean it has all

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.480 
pretty massive map and I mean it has all
the<00:02:29.970> things<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.600> skygrid<00:02:31.050> would<00:02:31.800> want<00:02:32.100> in<00:02:32.370> it

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
the things that skygrid would want in it

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.050 
the things that skygrid would want in it
and<00:02:32.760> but<00:02:33.570> basically<00:02:34.260> we<00:02:35.040> have<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.250> whole<00:02:35.700> nother

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
and but basically we have a whole nother

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.970 
and but basically we have a whole nother
I<00:02:36.300> wish<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.540> could<00:02:36.660> fly<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.870> little<00:02:37.140> quicker<00:02:37.290> we

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
I wish I could fly a little quicker we

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.620 
I wish I could fly a little quicker we
have<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.160> whole<00:02:38.400> other<00:02:38.580> section<00:02:39.209> over<00:02:39.600> here

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
have a whole other section over here

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.199 
have a whole other section over here
that<00:02:40.080> we<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.380> under<00:02:40.709> construction<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:42.060> we

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
that we is under construction that we

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.610 
that we is under construction that we
are<00:02:42.300> working<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.660> but<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.870> guys<00:02:42.990> wanted<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.380> so

are working on but you guys wanted it so
bad<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:45.120> kind<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:46.110> was<00:02:46.500> forced<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.980> just

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
bad that I kind of was forced to just

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.060 
bad that I kind of was forced to just
put<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.489> out<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:47.880> this<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.080> as<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.709> now<00:02:49.739> and

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
put this out so this is it as of now and

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.190 
put this out so this is it as of now and
it's<00:02:50.190> great<00:02:50.520> it's<00:02:50.820> still<00:02:51.120> skygrid<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.110> all

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
it's great it's still skygrid and all

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.490 
it's great it's still skygrid and all
that<00:02:52.410> but<00:02:53.160> um<00:02:53.400> jmac<00:02:54.090> should<00:02:54.390> be<00:02:54.540> extending<00:02:55.290> it

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
that but um jmac should be extending it

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.840 
that but um jmac should be extending it
up<00:02:56.280> with<00:02:56.880> me<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.300> then<00:02:57.630> we<00:02:57.989> will<00:02:58.230> also<00:02:58.850> that

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
up with me and then we will also that

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.550 
up with me and then we will also that
might<00:03:00.030> be<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.209> first<00:03:00.570> update<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:01.410> all

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
might be the first update so it's all

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.770 
might be the first update so it's all
the<00:03:01.680> way<00:03:01.770> up<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.040> top<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.400> then<00:03:02.790> maybe<00:03:03.480> in

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
the way up to the top and then maybe in

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.479 
the way up to the top and then maybe in
the<00:03:03.900> same<00:03:04.110> update<00:03:04.440> we<00:03:04.590> will<00:03:04.770> extend<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.340> all

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
the same update we will extend it all

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.370 
the same update we will extend it all
the<00:03:05.820> way<00:03:05.910> over<00:03:06.270> here<00:03:06.300> so<00:03:06.660> it'll<00:03:06.870> be<00:03:06.989> just

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
the way over here so it'll be just

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.550 
the way over here so it'll be just
absolutely<00:03:08.239> giant<00:03:09.239> but<00:03:09.690> yeah<00:03:09.840> guys<00:03:10.020> if<00:03:10.320> we

that's basically all I had I mean

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.720 
that's basically all I had I mean
skygrid<00:03:12.810> is<00:03:13.050> skygrid<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.430> guys<00:03:14.550> gonna

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
skygrid is skygrid and you guys gonna

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.130 
skygrid is skygrid and you guys gonna
have<00:03:14.940> fun<00:03:15.090> playing<00:03:15.390> at<00:03:15.540> all<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.780> want<00:03:15.930> and
