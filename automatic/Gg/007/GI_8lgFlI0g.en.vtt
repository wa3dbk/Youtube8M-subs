00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:29.979
 microsoft balearic 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.040

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.690
 four options the first one that says that is the type of product is worth that we want 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.730

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.320
 control 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.320
 in the second selection we would do the first 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.420
 engraved on you I'm going to reopen it because it seems that there has been a 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.770
 problem 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.090
 the page to see now we will select in the first control 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.170
 in the second selection area is not the first time he wanted the 3 60 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.120
 control fire in davos 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.120
 in the third selection we would do for our 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.220
 our 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.850
 OS 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.940
 and in the fourth we will select Spanish vale 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.080
 we would go something let's see and good that goes well 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.210
 one is left to a link that would give essebsi and jump and now 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.080
 unloaded we would load and areva next following next box office 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.020
 finish the installation by itself we would have 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.020
 maybe it is and green in 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.500
 of the command for a greeting in him this balance 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.620
 i good 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.799
 it would take one thing going to school 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.799
 netbooks kg 1 3 k num 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.810
 but the thing gets worse in the connections 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.870
 this after the command a year 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.800
 we have this although this does not need to be done 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 for lack of only one thing yes they are worth 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.070
 Well, I want to clarify that, but few 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.029
 I have not used it with 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:17.489
 games that do not make them good for you when you put the effect on them 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.619
 of the command 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:21.379
 you put the game 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.520
 they run game i the command because I already use it is because they go the game 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.009

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.949
