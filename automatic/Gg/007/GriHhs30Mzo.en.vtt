00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
coast I was beginning to think that

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.469

maybe<00:04:30.039> we'd<00:04:31.039> lost<00:04:31.220> wildlife<00:04:31.729> in<00:04:31.910> Britain<00:04:32.270> but

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479

wildlife<00:04:36.410> I<00:04:40.690> think<00:04:41.690> that<00:04:41.840> if<00:04:41.930> I<00:04:42.080> had<00:04:42.289> to<00:04:42.380> choose

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620
