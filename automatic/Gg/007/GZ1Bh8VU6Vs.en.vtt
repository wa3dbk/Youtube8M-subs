peroxide<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.140> your<00:00:31.380> piercings<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.099> it

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
peroxide on your piercings because it

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.459 
peroxide on your piercings because it
will<00:00:32.460> irritate<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.059> very<00:00:33.510> much<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
will irritate it very much so and the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.139 
will irritate it very much so and the
healing<00:00:34.739> process<00:00:34.770> will<00:00:35.280> be<00:00:35.430> cut<00:00:35.610> down<00:00:35.640> it's

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
healing process will be cut down it's

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.319 
healing process will be cut down it's
not<00:00:36.360> very<00:00:36.600> comfortable<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.469> you're<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
not very comfortable and you're it's a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.850 
not very comfortable and you're it's a
bigger<00:00:39.510> risk<00:00:39.719> for<00:00:39.960> an<00:00:40.020> infection<00:00:40.290> when<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.739> do

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
bigger risk for an infection when you do

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.250 
bigger risk for an infection when you do
that<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:42.120> most<00:00:42.300> natural<00:00:42.780> way<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.140> do

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
that so the most natural way you can do

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.970 
that so the most natural way you can do
it<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.559> use<00:00:43.860> sea<00:00:44.550> salt<00:00:44.579> soaks<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:46.350> couple<00:00:46.860> of

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
it is to use sea salt soaks a couple of

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.069 
it is to use sea salt soaks a couple of
times<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.280> day<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> few<00:00:48.059> minutes<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.930> to

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
times a day for a few minutes just to

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.920 
times a day for a few minutes just to
kind<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.590> clean<00:00:50.010> all<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.370> gunk<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.660> salt

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
kind of clean all that gunk out the salt

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.900 
kind of clean all that gunk out the salt
also<00:00:52.170> helps<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> healing<00:00:53.129> process<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
also helps the healing process on the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.750 
also helps the healing process on the
warm<00:00:54.180> water<00:00:54.449> soothes<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.430> it's<00:00:56.430> pretty

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
warm water soothes it so it's pretty

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.220 
warm water soothes it so it's pretty
much<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> only<00:00:57.180> way<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.510> advise<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.809> do<00:00:58.050> that

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
much the only way I advise to do that

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.670 
much the only way I advise to do that
but<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> problem<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.129> when<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.760> have

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
but the problem is when you have

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.599 
but the problem is when you have
piercings<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.739> are<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.160> your<00:01:02.309> cheeks

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
piercings that are like on your cheeks

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.390 
piercings that are like on your cheeks
it's<00:01:03.359> hard<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.809> do<00:01:03.930> soaks<00:01:04.250> especially<00:01:05.250> if<00:01:05.339> you

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it's hard to do soaks especially if you

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.010 
it's hard to do soaks especially if you
don't<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.610> shot<00:01:05.939> glasses<00:01:06.420> or<00:01:06.720> something

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
don't have shot glasses or something

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.910 
don't have shot glasses or something
like<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.260> they'll<00:01:07.470> spill<00:01:07.770> all<00:01:07.890> over

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
like that they'll spill all over

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.920 
like that they'll spill all over
yourself<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.970> if<00:01:09.060> you're<00:01:09.150> clumsy<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.750> me

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
yourself and if you're clumsy like me

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.810 
yourself and if you're clumsy like me
you<00:01:10.110> will<00:01:10.229> spill<00:01:10.560> all<00:01:10.770> over<00:01:11.010> yourself<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.610> and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
you will spill all over yourself and and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.690 
you will spill all over yourself and and
it's<00:01:12.600> not<00:01:12.810> pretty<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.650> found<00:01:14.340> out<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.520> way

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
it's not pretty so I found out a way

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.190 
it's not pretty so I found out a way
that<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.869> they're<00:01:16.049> being

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.350 
to dilute it too much with water because
then<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.140> won't<00:01:37.290> have<00:01:37.470> any<00:01:37.500> effect<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.640> about

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
then it won't have any effect so about

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.789 
then it won't have any effect so about
an<00:01:39.540> eighth<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.990> teaspoon<00:01:40.140> maybe<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.710> little

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
an eighth of a teaspoon maybe a little

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.740 
an eighth of a teaspoon maybe a little
bit<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.130> per<00:01:41.430> cup<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.790> water<00:01:41.970> should<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.479> just

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
bit more per cup of water should do just

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.499 
bit more per cup of water should do just
fine<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.259> you'll<00:01:44.159> need<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> funnel<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.880> know

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
fine and you'll need a funnel I know

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.510 
fine and you'll need a funnel I know
it's<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:46.200> little<00:01:46.439> bit<00:01:46.530> more<00:01:46.710> extra<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.189> prepare

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
it's a little bit more extra to prepare

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.219 
it's a little bit more extra to prepare
but<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.450> more<00:01:48.689> simple<00:01:48.930> when<00:01:49.200> it

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
but really it's more simple when it

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.289 
but really it's more simple when it
comes<00:01:49.470> down<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.520> already<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.180> my

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
comes down to it so I already have my

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.170 
comes down to it so I already have my
salt<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.720> there<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.110> I'm<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.229> going<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> pour

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
salt in there and I'm just going to pour

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.300 
salt in there and I'm just going to pour
lukewarm<00:01:54.180> water<00:01:54.240> now<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.750> temperature<00:01:55.310> warm

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
lukewarm water now the temperature warm

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.950 
lukewarm water now the temperature warm
enough<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.820> touch<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.240> not<00:01:57.299> too<00:01:57.540> hot<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
enough to the touch but not too hot to

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.389 
enough to the touch but not too hot to
irritate<00:01:58.290> your<00:01:58.409> piercing<00:01:58.829> because<00:01:59.009> then

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
irritate your piercing because then

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.490 
irritate your piercing because then
it'll<00:01:59.670> just<00:01:59.700> cause<00:02:00.119> more<00:02:00.420> problems<00:02:00.600> than<00:02:01.110> help

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
it'll just cause more problems than help

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.530 
it'll just cause more problems than help
so<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.820> pretty<00:02:02.969> much<00:02:03.180> it

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
so it's pretty much it

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.920 
so it's pretty much it
I'm<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> pour<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.290> in

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930

check the temperature like when you

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.520 
check the temperature like when you
check<00:02:40.740> maybe<00:02:41.250> smoke<00:02:41.520> before<00:02:42.050> we<00:02:43.050> feed<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.410> to

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530

that's pretty much it and I don't have a
mirror<00:02:47.870> kind<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.990> sucks<00:02:49.200> but<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.470> don't

spill-proof<00:02:51.890> kind<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.010> way<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.220> do<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.580> I'm

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
spill-proof kind of way to do it I'm

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.370 
spill-proof kind of way to do it I'm
just<00:02:53.850> going<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.150> feel<00:02:54.360> around<00:02:54.510> for<00:02:54.810> my<00:02:55.080> teak

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
and you do this see it's so much more

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260 
and you do this see it's so much more
simpler<00:02:58.620> than<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.860> shot<00:02:59.070> glass<00:02:59.190> because<00:03:00.120> you'll

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
simpler than a shot glass because you'll

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.350 
simpler than a shot glass because you'll
spill<00:03:00.480> all<00:03:00.600> over<00:03:00.630> yourself<00:03:01.820> very<00:03:02.820> important

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.180 
your labret works really well like a
surface<00:03:42.420> piercing<00:03:42.959> if<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.560> have<00:03:43.739> drivel
