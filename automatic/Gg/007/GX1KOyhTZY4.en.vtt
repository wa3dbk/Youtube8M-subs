00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:23.369
 the welcome press conference after the 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:30.239
 right 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:32.820
 Mai comes happy her team has 21 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.440
 Rebounds brought more than the bonner and 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.390
 the bonner as far as the weir on 19 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.950
 the latter had a free throw rate can 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.300
 the bonner won the only one very much 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.300
 good 3 had explained 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.989
 a strong game 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.070
 defended the world and the first 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:01:00.399
 quarter 27 points allowed 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.379
 88 in the end it was 88 points and me 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.339
 think so I believe 20 more points 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.259
 as in the first game 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.970
 that means who thinks on the defensive 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.229
 our tasks are not done 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.289
 we did not implement what we did 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.030
 have us and then it helps 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.299
 not even considering the rebound sovereignty 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.789
 Has 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.210
 We also had ten ball losses more 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:21.549
 and so far we have to 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.110
 take hold of our own nose and the 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:32.350
 congratulate bonnern for the deserved victory 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:33.700
 thank you the key was that was in 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.229
 the play offs arrived that was in 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.869
 first game not quite the case 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.569
 we have from the beginning who 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.819
 played aggressively you have to do something 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.310
 has to do when big problems on the 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:49.179
 whole game was awake from the beginning 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.590
 helper and then with the uno fans 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.170
 Of course, from afar, get on 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.610
 at the beginning we have the big shots as well 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.340
 met if you're honest I have 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.380
 in almost every year the bonn trainer 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.600
 I have never been so balanced 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.710
 team bought so tonight so 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.299
 any player who was on the field 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.549
 has also made at least nine points 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.420
 other things everyone has done 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.290
 responsibility 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.700
 that's with our little squad 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.549
 very important that he does not have one or two 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.260
 people like in oldenburg or three 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.209
 fail or are not so active 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.290
 just in attack and have today 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.329
 very well done and run the ball 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.620
 Let us have something we have expected 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.600
 also the players completely normal 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.680
 wise are not the first option and 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.720
 that was the deciding factor today 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.790
 that we want in these phases castle 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.530
 then try to defend more aggressively 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.670
 the first options took away that 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.870
 the other players in the in the 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.300
 have jumped and joined this 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.730
 feature also hit 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.900
 we have from him almost from the beginning to 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.880
 led the end of the game and therefore 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.410
 also believes in my opinion that 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.720
 game then the game deserves to win 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.380
 thanks again say sebastian away 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.830
 Wanted to ask one of the 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.830
 both coaches 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.520
 a term until the next game 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.010
 is my knowledge the day before 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.570
 in each case that means a thematic free 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.470
 become did would be the 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.780
 temporally the city is in the country house 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.810
 recently about we now offer the beko 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.160
 bbl to lay the game 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.650
 that would be for us unfortunately all fit 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.230
 is not possible the gameplay gives us 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.520
 now heavy task we have the same 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.440
 Like Oldenburg to honest customers 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.760
 there is no time to speak 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.410
 to prepare the next game 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.180
 that will look like that tomorrow 11 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.340
 from her drive to oldenburg 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.630
 drive and then the biggest work 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.390
 on the physiotherapist 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.580
 athletic coach to come that we 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.450
 relatively recover 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.900
 Saturday morning maybe maybe 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.730
 Maybe a hydrant is doing that 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.110
 we also fail him so with ours 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.630
 small squad we have to regenerate 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.400
 and that was really doing and for the 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.990
 Of course, one more task on Saturday 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.700
 a bit harder 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.600
 due to the small rotation but that 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.610
 Self-confidence is a bit 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.680
 be on our side and so we drive 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.090
 now strengthened after oldenburg gram was 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.400
 for us and for our club enormously 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.750
 for example, it is important to generate it 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.940
 Gives extra income for us we have 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.130
 this hall on the leg only costs one 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.120
 a bit of money then credit 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.230
 to pay off therefore five times are the 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.970
 situation in which we are very much now 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.500
 well 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.910
 we have to look how far the juice 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.910
 still enough for saturday 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:28.800
 the use of british haft the 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.750
 team to the site of his previous 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.850
 I thought I also believe because his 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.440
 his bbl topscorer with 13 points 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.430
 he has that in oldenburg a bit 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.229
 fearfully played and by this time 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.789
 he described had often the 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.889
 situation where he is drawn to the basket 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.740
 or has tried to set actions 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.910
 but then the conclusion sought and 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.250
 for everyone to talk again 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.539
 we had a very intensive training 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.490
 two days ago I have them too 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.110
 who put on the four because of 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.330
 märklin more or less 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.190
 beaten up 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.320
 but that also has a bit 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.889
 it also works to restore energy 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.669
 brought he is someone who is very much ours 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.889
 can help 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.389
 but he must also once again show that 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.400
 I hide that's one 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.169
 bit this narrow ridge on the he 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.190
 travels today it was excellent the 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.259
 Guarantee has also taken 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.240
 and we only trusted that 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.289
 Any chance because we have to 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.680
 to build on these guys 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.330
 fabi david himself the german player 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.940
 they are very important for us in that 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.830
 phase of the season now I have to wear 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.150
 Of course, it's time to go 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.780
 Oldenburg are playing away at the 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.130
 the atmosphere 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.270
 But now he has to confirm again 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:38.250
 this is not now a gaffe was 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.210
 simply go where you ask for the 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.280
 same principle 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.710
 but ultimately not have the question 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.210
 comfortable with the guidance today 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.980
 after the first picture 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.760
 always the functional points and marketing 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.790
 First time to this country how could 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.780
 you never will not settle 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.790
 from now we do not have the game 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.640
 mostly with a lead 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:04.360
 Manages to be safe 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.190
 this can be done in the last few minutes 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.950
 even tilt expressive three 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.610
 team if its a 2 of their 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.500
 to hit throws 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.510
 So I was a good ending 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.300
 I'm sure that the game at home 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.950
 is friendly himself against hagen experienced 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.350
 as such things can click on to against 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.730
 have tübingen at home 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.500
 Cap time in front was one 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.910
 Different game lost in basketball 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.830
 It is very fast and as I said 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.330
 once a minute before closing it was 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.400
 then probably something for me then 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.390
 also ticked off but before ever 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.820
 and again we see that the team 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.270
 also keeps you in good spirits and concentration 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.850
 holds high 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.000
 So not before the game 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.000
 check off 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.230
 If it's not just from Canada, thank you 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.470
 weinbrenner and conclude with that 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.470
 Press 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:05.800
 the beko basketball bundesliga you feel 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.800
 the dribble
