00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
the ball out on the age I thought that

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.570 
the ball out on the age I thought that
was<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.400> big<00:01:43.610> plus

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.330 

was<00:01:47.180> it<00:01:47.360> in<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.110> situation<00:01:48.920> where<00:01:49.160> Tosh

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
was it in the situation where Tosh

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.950 
was it in the situation where Tosh
fumble<00:01:49.820> was<00:01:49.970> just<00:01:50.090> an<00:01:50.180> extra<00:01:50.480> effort<00:01:50.570> played

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
fumble was just an extra effort played

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.760 
fumble was just an extra effort played
so<00:01:51.320> it<00:01:51.380> was<00:01:51.610> really<00:01:52.610> they<00:01:53.150> do<00:01:53.210> a<00:01:53.330> good<00:01:53.450> job

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
so it was really they do a good job

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.660 
so it was really they do a good job
stripping<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.830> ball<00:01:54.980> they've<00:01:55.280> done<00:01:55.430> it<00:01:55.550> all
