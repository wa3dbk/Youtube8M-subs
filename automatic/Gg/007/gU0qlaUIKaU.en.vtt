00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 or the one of magnitudes welcome again 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:06.390
 to my channel on that short day I'm going to do 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.150
 a boxing of this helicopter that I bought 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.809
 it's called the helicopter leg with control 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.089
 infrared remote three frequencies 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.039
 rechargeable via usb for use in 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.560
 interiors comes with propellers that 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.600
 allow lateral displacements as 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.289
 those who can see here apart from having 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.609
 your propellers up here normal and with 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.070
 these other laterals with that 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.480
 supposedly to facilitate the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.640
 lateral movement 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.579
 comes with stabilizer al gyroscopic and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.020
 It is basically for people over 14 years old 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.809
 then let's proceed to this one so 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.880
 quickly around here by sides has 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.710
 like some tapes I do not know if they can see 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.160
 mattel around here scalpel 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.079
 the story we broke one we broke the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.629
 other 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.850
 is a following video to reflect on 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.870
 flight both indoors and in 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.239
 exterior 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.609
 but these are basically more than anything 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.309
 for indoor flights since for its 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.820
 size and its weight are easily 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.710
 windblown this already 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.280
 I uncovered here we're going to look at what 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.280
 in the flesh 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.509
 this here we see that some things fell 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:27.100
 on this side it comes with propellers of 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:30.460
 spare with two large and brings two 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.560
 small and comes with the usb charger that 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.820
 it's interesting we can carry it with 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.460
 our computer or any 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.619
 USB device comes with its manual 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.899
 user before going to fly this 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.509
 device I recommend you first 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.460
 read the manual completely and see the 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.830
 following videos where I will do tests of 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.020
 Indoor and outdoor flight 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.060
 I will also teach you how to fly these 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.970
 devices then obviously comes 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.450
 with his control and his and the helicopter 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.450
 as such 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.330
 look perfectly has marked so 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.330
 I would have the squash here 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.160
 the control is also tied 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.660
 and very surely the battery this 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.810
 come with an internal rechargeable battery 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.880
 for usb and it would be necessary to buy the batteries 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.830
 of control and we would be ready to 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.990
 fly that's it for this video not 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.540
 forget to subscribe to my channel and leave me 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.520
 questions comments or suggestions and not 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.560
 lose the following videos where they will see 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.750
 to take flight indoors and 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.750
 outside of this helicopter thank you
