all<00:04:25.610> putting<00:04:26.540> our<00:04:26.660> status<00:04:27.200> but<00:04:28.270> know<00:04:29.270> some

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
all putting our status but know some

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.740 
all putting our status but know some
things<00:04:30.890> aren't<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:31.700> good<00:04:31.820> about<00:04:32.120> it<00:04:32.540> because

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
things aren't so good about it because

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.360 
things aren't so good about it because
it<00:04:32.990> looks<00:04:33.170> I<00:04:33.470> think<00:04:33.710> it<00:04:33.800> looks<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:34.010> bit<00:04:34.100> too<00:04:34.250> much

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
it looks I think it looks a bit too much

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.970 
it looks I think it looks a bit too much
like<00:04:34.520> a<00:04:34.640> new<00:04:34.820> series<00:04:35.120> TARDIS<00:04:35.770> don't<00:04:36.770> like

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
like a new series TARDIS don't like

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.100 
like a new series TARDIS don't like
because<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.670> like<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.970> old<00:04:38.060> series<00:04:38.570> TARDIS<00:04:38.960> is

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
because I like the old series TARDIS is

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.400 
because I like the old series TARDIS is
better<00:04:39.520> but<00:04:40.520> I<00:04:40.820> think<00:04:41.660> this<00:04:41.780> one<00:04:41.990> looks<00:04:42.140> quite

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
better but I think this one looks quite

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.780 
better but I think this one looks quite

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
gonna say I'm going into my own creation

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.270 
gonna say I'm going into my own creation
for<00:05:01.850> this<00:05:02.800> and<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.940> thing<00:05:05.180> about<00:05:05.410> Lego<00:05:06.410> is<00:05:06.890> you

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
for this and the thing about Lego is you

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.990 
for this and the thing about Lego is you
can<00:05:07.490> basically<00:05:07.760> build<00:05:08.600> anything<00:05:09.050> from<00:05:09.590> it<00:05:10.000> so

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
can basically build anything from it so

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.780 
can basically build anything from it so
that's<00:05:11.330> why<00:05:11.720> I<00:05:11.750> just<00:05:12.140> thought<00:05:12.260> wide<00:05:12.890> then<00:05:13.640> I

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
that's why I just thought wide then I

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.700 
that's why I just thought wide then I
just<00:05:14.030> build<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:14.510> Lego<00:05:14.690> Doctor<00:05:15.020> Who<00:05:15.170> circles<00:05:15.620> you

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
can build anything of Lego virtually

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.000

anything<00:05:18.860> so<00:05:19.550> i<00:05:20.410> just<00:05:21.410> thought<00:05:21.620> i<00:05:21.650> would<00:05:21.770> do

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010
