00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.699
 and use here 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.320
 do not 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.340
 one 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.340
 two 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.570
 ah 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.490
 and that hurt me enough you do not have 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.119
 want to do nothing just because you 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.550
 deduction great mistake and I'm not machine 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.860
 maybe I did not raise it in the best way 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.690
 I wanted to say that as it has no case 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.520
 try something to bother not 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.530
 we chase here we'll never catch him 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.180
 that's what you want is given to you 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.699
 beaten so you involve so many 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.640
 innocent and especially then so that 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:52.520
 do not close to mass and I understand you 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.520
 however, regardless of your reasons 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.880
 eye for eye, my friend 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.430
 here 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.000
 my deduction was not the wrong the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.969
 fact is that I can say that light 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.039
 yagami corner and that mass dawns 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.079
 second want but that is not enough for 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.259
 solve the case and that's why I'm 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.009
 depressed is so hard to understand yes 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.140
 Yes it is 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.329
 also hey what you say seems not to 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.689
 You are satisfied unless I am 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.899
 kira I will not be satisfied unless 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.720
 you're kira maybe there's some truth in 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.620
 that 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.300
 in fact now that you mention it you have 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.840
 reason I think I wanted it to be 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.840
 stretched 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.890
 as I said eye for an eye 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.280
 with I am stronger than I look 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.280
 you know 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.090
 I'll call the room to stop 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.690
 good news my seed is the number 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.830
 one in the popularity polls of 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.830
 the magazine 18 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:20.210
 in the next missing movie 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.390
 what was that another matsuda stupidity 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.860
 in short it is his specialty 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.860
 I'm listening to them
