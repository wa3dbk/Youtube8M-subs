 I'm a psychiatrist. 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.329
 but I want to quote here 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.989
 1 out of 5 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.310
 in chapter 1 Bible verses I'm not posted 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.040

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.010
 for us 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.930
 if people knew 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.680
 as an incentive 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.520

 of social health people lived more recent 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.450

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.179

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:00.300

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.269
 meeting eye color 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.370
 just the body chair 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.100
 with that black hair the eyes are the owners of the body 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.310
 only this the eyes to see with all this body will be eliminated 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.340
 by law 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.680
 chiossi the others are bad 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.140
 questions 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.140
 I know what to say then 500 of these are from the tjce by asking the ophthalmologist 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.549

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.320
 what he told me the following 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.310
 he says that the eye 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.030
 hospitalized with a critical clinical picture 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.690
 not exactly the world 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.690
 but it's a look 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.450
 it's a look 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.770
 how we gave you life 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.880
 but despite this the program 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.750
 no matter the things 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.650
 no matter the people no matter the sport matters is how we release him 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.069

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.640
 people the facts and things 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.510
 that's what everyone 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.960
 if you have a look at assaulting a ship 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.640
 an optimistic look 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.089
 a look 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:10.830
 with the big winner 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.920
 things 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.329
 everything gets better 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.169
 I know the story that says the following excerpt that 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:17.049
 interest 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.029
 It was very interesting that part of the shoe factory 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:21.229
 they went to India 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.739

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.320
 dilma phoned to check the boss will not work 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.439
 here we do not understand your part 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.059
 fifteen minutes later 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:36.689
 another executive asking to understand that peace and censorship to the internet 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.919
 hit India is going to be a bad deal for us because nobody here 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.499
 use them part 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:47.150
 look how incredible the fact that the same nobody wore shoe 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.480
 but the look of the former was pessimistic 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.890
 business will happen 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.059
 the look of the second was optimistic 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:55.630
 highlighted will be the best place in the world 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.330
 that's what we said 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.399
 the dream of being a singer 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:02.319
 I had to come with everything okay. 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.329
 then improved 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:05.500
 search 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.629
 than that of boquim 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.629
 every thing that happens in your life 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.080
 there are people who lived in 4 9 12 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.779
 this country is an issue 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:19.259
 every day of the show that has on the board the actress 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.569

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.030
 all of us 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.899
 and you will see how it is possible does not have a body 

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:31.899
 but the modern format a person was buried 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.159
 I believe 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.399
 crossing the harvest 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:39.349

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:44.760
