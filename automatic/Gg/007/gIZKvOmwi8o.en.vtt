00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 3 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.560
 we will see now how 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.170
 check daily activity on the 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.630
 site arts pole flo once connected on 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.900
 the site is the page on which we 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:24.810
 normally happens so by passing in 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:30.330
 the agenda part we will be able to consult 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.330
 the monthly agenda at the activity level 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.320
 there I will pass the agenda in day mode 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.620
 and we'll see how the 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.230
 day depending on the schedule and 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.670
 all sessions that are of the bear 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.970
 which interests us in fact now 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.850
 found lower on the page this is the 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.030
 summary of the activity here it is this 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:56.170
 clock there mainly in the center of 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.330
 the screen with cut in 24 hours with 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.920
 the level of activity so more than double 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.190
 then had activity then more and 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.259
 go deeper into intensive activity in the 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.970
 left part we can see the summary 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.920
 with the number of hours of activity followed 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.499
 the number of steps taken the number of 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.359
 kilos calories burned etc 

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:19.119
 and then under the clock 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:22.329
 we can see this activity cut into 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.819
 Intensity level ranging from position 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.979
 lying down to the intensive activity and then 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:29.799
 the time spent on these different 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.340
 intensities in the day by clicking 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:36.890
 once on the clock 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.340
 we will be able to split this activity 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.200
 on over 24 hours and then in the party 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.990
 right we will be able to judge from 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.880
 the effectiveness of the activity with a small 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:54.560
 recap of benefits 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:56.180
 we can see the detail and then we can 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.990
 see the goal 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:04.009
 the percentage of the daily goal 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.659
 reached is below some tips 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.509
 to reach the goal with 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.869
 different activities on different 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.789
 intensities 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.310
 if we want the details on the objective 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.940
 which has been fixed one can click to see 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.670
 the goal 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.890
 knowing that the goal has been set in 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.110
 function of the parameters that were 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.470
 recorded in the profile among others 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.370
 size weight activity level 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.370
 in the day etc 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.410
 if I come back now to the top of 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.410
 the calendar I can switch to weeks mode 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.519
 to see over the weeks the 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.340
 activities for each day the 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.160
 percentage of goal that is due 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.260
 to be reached and then below it 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.620
 level of activity with new the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.239
 summary on the week the total hours 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.970
 spent in different intensities 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.320
 and then the average achievement of 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.200
 the goal that has been set 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.200
 and then the same for the month 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:10.950
 so we have the view of the full month 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.950
 with the same summary below
