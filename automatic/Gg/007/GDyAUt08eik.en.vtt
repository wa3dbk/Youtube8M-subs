that as my favorite technique so get a
good<00:01:39.660> test<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.800> help<00:01:41.039> part<00:01:41.820> these<00:01:41.970> cards<00:01:42.300> are

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
good test of help part these cards are

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.620 
good test of help part these cards are
by<00:01:43.590> using<00:01:43.770> my<00:01:44.009> pet<00:01:44.250> thing<00:01:44.429> I<00:01:44.910> called<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
by using my pet thing I called the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.570 
by using my pet thing I called the
children<00:01:46.020> peel<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.380> my<00:01:46.530> card<00:01:47.009> turning<00:01:47.310> people

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
children peel of my card turning people

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.419 
children peel of my card turning people
basically<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.750> gonna<00:01:48.899> grab<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.830> tear

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
basically just gonna grab here and tear

00:01:50.429 --> 00:02:11.000 
basically just gonna grab here and tear
the<00:01:50.580> top<00:01:50.759> off<00:01:50.940> backers

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.170 

not<00:02:12.010> too<00:02:12.159> bad<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:13.090> little<00:02:14.079> slippery<00:02:14.469> parcel

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
not too bad the little slippery parcel

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.740 
not too bad the little slippery parcel
it<00:02:16.180> makes<00:02:16.359> a<00:02:16.450> little<00:02:16.629> tougher<00:02:16.950> but<00:02:18.750> hold

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
it makes a little tougher but hold

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.420 
it makes a little tougher but hold
together<00:02:19.959> it's<00:02:20.469> not<00:02:20.620> really<00:02:20.859> that<00:02:20.980> bad<00:02:21.159> with

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
together it's not really that bad with

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.830 
together it's not really that bad with
deck<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:22.079> don't<00:02:23.079> know<00:02:23.140> if<00:02:23.230> they're<00:02:23.379> any<00:02:24.840> harder

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
deck I don't know if they're any harder

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.599 
deck I don't know if they're any harder
easier<00:02:26.200> than<00:02:26.379> any<00:02:26.469> other<00:02:26.650> set<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:26.920> bicycles<00:02:27.489> of

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
easier than any other set of bicycles of

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.479 
easier than any other set of bicycles of
corn<00:02:27.959> but<00:02:28.959> that's<00:02:29.829> just<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.099> little<00:02:30.250> video

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
corn but that's just a little video

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.059 
corn but that's just a little video
research<00:02:31.030> for<00:02:31.359> you<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.780> don't<00:02:32.620> know<00:02:32.769> they<00:02:32.889> feel

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
research for you I don't know they feel

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.530 
research for you I don't know they feel
pretty<00:02:33.340> slippery<00:02:33.609> I<00:02:33.700> think<00:02:34.000> they're<00:02:34.120> slippier

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
pretty slippery I think they're slippier

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.280 
pretty slippery I think they're slippier
than<00:02:35.579> bicycles<00:02:36.579> that<00:02:36.700> I've<00:02:36.849> torn<00:02:37.689> here

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
than bicycles that I've torn here

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.530 
than bicycles that I've torn here
recently<00:02:38.769> in<00:02:38.889> the<00:02:38.980> past<00:02:39.159> that<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.090> picked<00:02:40.420> out

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
recently in the past that I picked out

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.660 
recently in the past that I picked out
picked<00:02:41.409> up<00:02:41.560> picked<00:02:41.859> up<00:02:42.040> somewhere<00:02:42.370> else<00:02:42.489> I'm

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
picked up picked up somewhere else I'm

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.119 
picked up picked up somewhere else I'm
not<00:02:42.700> sure<00:02:43.510> where<00:02:43.689> I<00:02:43.720> got<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.109> other<00:02:44.260> ones<00:02:44.439> well

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
not sure where I got the other ones well

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.830 
not sure where I got the other ones well
they<00:02:45.280> didn't<00:02:45.760> quite<00:02:45.939> feel<00:02:46.150> this<00:02:46.299> slippery<00:02:46.689> so

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
they didn't quite feel this slippery so

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.050 
they didn't quite feel this slippery so
I<00:02:46.870> think<00:02:47.049> these<00:02:47.139> are<00:02:47.200> slippery<00:02:47.829> all<00:02:48.639> right<00:02:48.790> all

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
I think these are slippery all right all

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.490 
I think these are slippery all right all
that's<00:02:49.329> new<00:02:49.510> carpeting<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.169> you<00:02:50.230> don't<00:02:50.409> get

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
that's new carpeting and you don't get

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.589 
that's new carpeting and you don't get
any<00:02:50.680> questions<00:02:50.889> check<00:02:51.370> out<00:02:51.579> car<00:02:51.819> very<00:02:52.090> calm
