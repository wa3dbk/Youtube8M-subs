indication that there's an imbalance in
the<00:00:53.760> base<00:00:53.969> chakra<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the base chakra because this is the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.200 
the base chakra because this is the
chakra<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.070> governs<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.579> health<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:57.000> the

chakra that governs the health of the
teeth<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.870> intuition<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.620> related<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
teeth the intuition is related to the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.639 
teeth the intuition is related to the
third<00:00:59.820> eye<00:01:00.000> chakra<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.719> sixth<00:01:01.020> chakra<00:01:01.230> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
third eye chakra the sixth chakra and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.070 
third eye chakra the sixth chakra and
the<00:01:02.340> third<00:01:02.609> eye<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
the third eye I like to see it's a

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.170 
the third eye I like to see it's a
little<00:01:04.259> bit<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:04.559> our<00:01:04.739> own<00:01:04.920> internal<00:01:05.580> movie

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
little bit like our own internal movie

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.600 
little bit like our own internal movie
screen<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:06.840> where<00:01:07.289> we<00:01:07.500> recall<00:01:07.950> our<00:01:07.979> memories

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
screen it's where we recall our memories

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.580 
screen it's where we recall our memories
when<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.180> dream<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.660> night<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.259> where<00:01:10.440> we

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
when we dream at night this is where we

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.830 
when we dream at night this is where we
see<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:10.950> dream<00:01:11.190> images<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.910> the<00:01:12.360> third<00:01:12.600> eye

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
see the dream images and the third eye

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.779 
see the dream images and the third eye
it's<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> home<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:14.009> our<00:01:14.130> intuition

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
it's really the home of our intuition

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:17.089 
it's really the home of our intuition
the<00:01:14.880> home<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.270> our<00:01:15.360> sixth<00:01:15.780> sense<00:01:16.050> and<00:01:16.410> it's

00:01:17.089 --> 00:01:17.099 
the home of our sixth sense and it's

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:18.800 
the home of our sixth sense and it's
really<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> muscle<00:01:18.060> we've<00:01:18.209> all<00:01:18.360> got<00:01:18.599> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
really like a muscle we've all got it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.930 
really like a muscle we've all got it
it's<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.649> about<00:01:19.890> developing<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
it's just about developing it and the

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.550 
it's just about developing it and the
more<00:01:21.209> we<00:01:21.360> develop<00:01:21.539> it<00:01:21.929> the<00:01:22.110> stronger<00:01:22.410> it

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
more we develop it the stronger it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.480 
more we develop it the stronger it
becomes

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
like physiologically it's shifted in me

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.120 
like physiologically it's shifted in me
and<00:02:07.400> it's<00:02:07.880> also<00:02:08.090> sort<00:02:08.540> of<00:02:08.630> um<00:02:08.869> flown<00:02:09.530> over<00:02:09.560> to
