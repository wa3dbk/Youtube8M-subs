00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
the eye than the really bright and I

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.120 
the eye than the really bright and I
mean<00:01:43.670> this<00:01:43.790> is<00:01:43.850> bright<00:01:44.210> too<00:01:44.479> but<00:01:45.170> my<00:01:45.950> other

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
mean this is bright too but my other

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.120 
mean this is bright too but my other
board<00:01:46.580> my<00:01:46.880> clay<00:01:47.210> board<00:01:47.510> is<00:01:47.960> like<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.800> very

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
board my clay board is like a very

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.610 
board my clay board is like a very
poisoning<00:01:52.130> kind<00:01:52.729> of<00:01:52.850> green<00:01:53.390> which<00:01:53.960> really

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
poisoning kind of green which really

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.100 
poisoning kind of green which really
hurts<00:01:54.950> my<00:01:55.190> eyes<00:01:55.220> when<00:01:55.760> I<00:01:55.790> watch<00:01:56.030> my<00:01:56.210> own<00:01:56.360> clay

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
hurts my eyes when I watch my own clay

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.180 
hurts my eyes when I watch my own clay
videos<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.400> i<00:01:58.760> think<00:01:59.030> this<00:01:59.420> is<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.930> lot<00:02:00.470> nicer<00:02:00.500> of

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
videos so i think this is a lot nicer of

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.160 
videos so i think this is a lot nicer of
a<00:02:01.310> color<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.880> look<00:02:02.060> at<00:02:02.270> while<00:02:02.630> somebody's

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
a color to look at while somebody's

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.490 
a color to look at while somebody's
doing<00:02:03.320> clay<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:04.240> clay<00:02:05.240> tutorials<00:02:05.900> so<00:02:06.290> that's

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
doing clay and clay tutorials so that's

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.509 
doing clay and clay tutorials so that's
why<00:02:06.650> I<00:02:06.680> got<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:08.649> next<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.890> got<00:02:10.369> this

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
in white and some other color which I

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.899 
in white and some other color which I
forgot<00:03:38.530> I<00:03:38.680> know<00:03:38.799> they<00:03:39.040> have<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:39.459> in<00:03:39.699> three
