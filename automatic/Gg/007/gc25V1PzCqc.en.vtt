you<00:04:34.890> enable<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:35.340> finish<00:04:36.180> Manik<00:04:36.620> dude<00:04:37.790> does

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
you enable it finish Manik dude does

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.500 
you enable it finish Manik dude does
that<00:04:38.940> stuff

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
that stuff

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.750

knew<00:05:10.419> it

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.430 

so<00:05:13.860> this<00:05:14.010> might<00:05:14.250> not<00:05:14.280> work<00:05:14.460> because<00:05:14.760> I<00:05:15.030> already

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
so this might not work because I already
