project today I'm stitching a design

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.780 
project today I'm stitching a design
called<00:00:06.420> Kaos<00:00:07.020> stars<00:00:07.560> it's<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.340> simple

called Kaos stars it's a simple
combination<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.630> shapes<00:00:09.900> but<00:00:10.290> it's<00:00:10.440> going<00:00:10.590> to

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
combination of shapes but it's going to

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.890

look great on your clothes so let's get
started<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:13.759> Kaos<00:00:14.759> stars<00:00:15.299> starts<00:00:16.230> with<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:16.980> a

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
started so Kaos stars starts with just a

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.970 
started so Kaos stars starts with just a
wiggly<00:00:17.609> line<00:00:17.900> and<00:00:18.900> then<00:00:19.320> you're<00:00:19.470> gonna<00:00:19.590> form<00:00:19.890> a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
wiggly line and then you're gonna form a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.570 
wiggly line and then you're gonna form a
circle<00:00:21.140> this<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> bit<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:22.740> plain<00:00:23.189> chain

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
circle this is a bit like plain chain

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.429 
circle this is a bit like plain chain
and<00:00:23.939> design<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.420> learned<00:00:24.630> previously<00:00:24.840> only

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
and design we learned previously only

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.480 
and design we learned previously only
we're<00:00:26.070> going<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.400> fill<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.510> circle<00:00:28.130> with<00:00:29.130> a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
we're going to fill in the circle with a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.820 
we're going to fill in the circle with a
star<00:00:30.060> shape<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.439> going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
star shape and it's just going to be a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.479 
star shape and it's just going to be a
straight<00:00:32.160> line<00:00:32.189> star<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:32.969> travel<00:00:33.540> stitch<00:00:33.719> in

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
out just fine

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.150 
out just fine
I'm<00:01:46.310> just<00:01:46.430> kind<00:01:46.610> of<00:01:46.670> cool<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:46.910> kind<00:01:47.180> of<00:01:47.240> angled

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
I'm just kind of cool I kind of angled

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.950 
I'm just kind of cool I kind of angled
very<00:01:49.160> very<00:01:49.460> slightly<00:01:50.000> angled<00:01:50.509> those<00:01:50.720> lines

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
very very slightly angled those lines

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.390 
very very slightly angled those lines
and<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.290> ends<00:01:51.500> up<00:01:51.590> looking<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.920> little<00:01:52.130> bit<00:01:52.340> more

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
and it ends up looking a little bit more

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.830 
and it ends up looking a little bit more
three-dimensional<00:01:53.240> I<00:01:53.300> think<00:01:53.479> that's<00:01:53.600> kind<00:01:53.810> of

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
three-dimensional I think that's kind of

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.430 
three-dimensional I think that's kind of
cool<00:01:54.080> now<00:01:54.820> we<00:01:55.820> go<00:01:55.970> out<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.420> do<00:01:56.600> one<00:01:56.869> more<00:01:57.200> right

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
cool now we go out and do one more right

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.290 
cool now we go out and do one more right
here

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
here

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.150 
here
this<00:01:59.300> is<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.479> foundational<00:02:00.290> line<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:00.979> that<00:02:01.009> you

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
this is a foundational line so that you

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.100 
this is a foundational line so that you
could<00:02:01.430> take<00:02:01.610> this<00:02:01.820> through<00:02:02.150> any<00:02:02.600> area<00:02:02.990> of<00:02:03.050> your

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
could take this through any area of your

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.370 
could take this through any area of your
belt<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:04.460> could<00:02:04.869> kind<00:02:05.869> of<00:02:05.900> wiggle<00:02:06.229> this

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
belt you could kind of wiggle this

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.050 
belt you could kind of wiggle this
through<00:02:06.619> a<00:02:06.650> border<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.490> could<00:02:07.640> we<00:02:07.729> get<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.910> list

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
through a border you could we get a list

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.639 
through a border you could we get a list
through<00:02:08.270> sashing<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:09.020> could<00:02:09.170> wheel<00:02:09.350> it<00:02:09.500> all

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
through sashing you could wheel it all

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.660 
through sashing you could wheel it all
over<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.920> block

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
over a block

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.580 
over a block
I'm<00:02:11.180> just<00:02:11.480> stitching<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:11.930> into<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.290> little

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
I'm just stitching this into a little

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.190 
I'm just stitching this into a little
four<00:02:12.800> inch<00:02:12.830> square<00:02:13.280> here<00:02:13.730> so<00:02:13.959> let's<00:02:14.959> you<00:02:15.080> know

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
four inch square here so let's you know

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.050 
four inch square here so let's you know
that<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:15.440> could<00:02:15.590> really<00:02:16.280> use<00:02:16.550> this<00:02:16.730> design

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
that you could really use this design

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.300 
that you could really use this design
just<00:02:17.090> about<00:02:17.540> anywhere<00:02:18.230> as<00:02:18.560> long<00:02:18.620> as<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.040> can

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
just about anywhere as long as you can

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.470 
just about anywhere as long as you can
place<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:20.360> starting<00:02:21.050> line<00:02:21.290> into<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:21.920> area

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
place the starting line into the area

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.699 
place the starting line into the area
and<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.510> can<00:02:23.720> do<00:02:23.840> just<00:02:24.019> about<00:02:24.110> anything<00:02:24.500> with

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
and you can do just about anything with

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.570 
and you can do just about anything with
it<00:02:25.660> okay<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:27.530> that's<00:02:27.800> what<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.010> get<00:02:28.100> started

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
it okay so that's what I get started

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.610 
it okay so that's what I get started
with<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.030> now<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.450> entire<00:02:30.019> rest<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.560> the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
with and now the entire rest of the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.770 
with and now the entire rest of the
design<00:02:30.920> is<00:02:31.160> very<00:02:31.790> very<00:02:32.060> simple<00:02:32.390> it's<00:02:32.570> just

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
design is very very simple it's just

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.559 
design is very very simple it's just
travel<00:02:33.260> stitching<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:34.280> echoing

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
travel stitching and echoing

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.449 
travel stitching and echoing
so<00:02:36.170> I'm<00:02:36.349> going<00:02:36.469> to<00:02:36.560> kind<00:02:36.709> of<00:02:36.739> set<00:02:37.010> my<00:02:37.129> scale

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
so I'm going to kind of set my scale

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.869 
so I'm going to kind of set my scale
here<00:02:37.909> and<00:02:38.090> I<00:02:38.150> want<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.450> keep<00:02:38.599> my<00:02:38.810> lines<00:02:39.879> this

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
here and I want to keep my lines this

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.030 
here and I want to keep my lines this
consistent<00:02:41.689> distance<00:02:41.959> apart<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:42.739> about<00:02:42.920> an

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
consistent distance apart it's about an

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.640 
consistent distance apart it's about an
eighth<00:02:43.219> of<00:02:43.430> an<00:02:43.519> inch<00:02:43.609> apart

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
eighth of an inch apart

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.059 
eighth of an inch apart
I'm<00:02:45.650> just<00:02:45.829> being<00:02:46.040> kind<00:02:46.579> of<00:02:46.640> careful<00:02:48.069> really

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
I'm just being kind of careful really

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.250 
I'm just being kind of careful really
careful<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:49.609> keep<00:02:49.819> those<00:02:50.120> lines<00:02:50.420> evenly

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
careful to keep those lines evenly

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.069 
careful to keep those lines evenly
spaced<00:02:51.819> and<00:02:52.819> I'm<00:02:52.909> gonna<00:02:53.090> fill<00:02:53.359> it<00:02:53.540> in<00:02:53.659> on<00:02:53.810> one

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
spaced and I'm gonna fill it in on one

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.199 
spaced and I'm gonna fill it in on one
side<00:02:54.349> completely<00:02:54.859> and<00:02:55.280> then<00:02:55.609> I'll<00:02:55.760> fill<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.150> in

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
side completely and then I'll fill it in

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.140 
side completely and then I'll fill it in
in<00:02:56.359> the<00:02:56.450> opposite<00:02:56.959> sight<00:02:57.230> completely<00:02:58.150> so

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
in the opposite sight completely so

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.300 
in the opposite sight completely so
here's<00:02:59.480> how<00:02:59.720> this<00:02:59.870> looks<00:03:00.290> as<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.799> builds<00:03:01.040> up

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
here's how this looks as it builds up

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.509 
here's how this looks as it builds up
across<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:02.090> quilt<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:03.470> very<00:03:03.950> very<00:03:04.250> simple

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
across the quilt it's very very simple

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.149 
across the quilt it's very very simple
just<00:03:04.819> travel<00:03:05.480> stitching<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.230> echoing<00:03:06.650> and

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
just travel stitching and echoing and

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.550 
just travel stitching and echoing and
even<00:03:08.000> if<00:03:08.120> your<00:03:08.269> echoes<00:03:08.599> aren't<00:03:09.049> you<00:03:09.470> know

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
even if your echoes aren't you know

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.009 
even if your echoes aren't you know
perfectly<00:03:10.069> spaced<00:03:10.400> apart<00:03:10.819> it's<00:03:11.120> no<00:03:11.450> big<00:03:11.750> deal

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
perfectly spaced apart it's no big deal

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.729 
perfectly spaced apart it's no big deal
just<00:03:12.560> do<00:03:13.129> the<00:03:13.250> best<00:03:13.459> job<00:03:13.639> that<00:03:13.819> you<00:03:14.000> can<00:03:14.299> as<00:03:15.290> you

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
just do the best job that you can as you

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.740 
just do the best job that you can as you
stitch<00:03:16.189> this<00:03:16.430> more<00:03:16.790> you're<00:03:17.239> going<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.569> gain<00:03:17.720> a

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
stitch this more you're going to gain a

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.770 
stitch this more you're going to gain a
lot<00:03:18.049> more<00:03:18.109> skill<00:03:18.650> for<00:03:19.010> echoing<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:19.790> your

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
lot more skill for echoing and your

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.970 
lot more skill for echoing and your
acting<00:03:21.109> it<00:03:21.230> will<00:03:21.349> become<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.680> lot<00:03:21.950> more

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
acting it will become a lot more

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.280 
acting it will become a lot more
consistent<00:03:22.700> as<00:03:22.849> you<00:03:23.000> go<00:03:23.180> so<00:03:23.510> don't<00:03:23.659> panic<00:03:23.959> if

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
consistent as you go so don't panic if

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.869 
consistent as you go so don't panic if
it's<00:03:24.470> not<00:03:24.650> perfect<00:03:25.099> when<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.400> first<00:03:25.609> get

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
it's not perfect when you first get

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.440 
it's not perfect when you first get
started<00:03:26.950> as<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.010> fill<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:29.120> remaining

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
started as you fill in the remaining

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.929 
started as you fill in the remaining
space<00:03:29.689> it'll<00:03:30.409> get<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:30.980> know<00:03:31.069> smaller<00:03:31.669> and

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939 
space it'll get you know smaller and

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.080 
space it'll get you know smaller and
smaller<00:03:32.209> space<00:03:32.450> like<00:03:33.260> this<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.889> then<00:03:34.700> all<00:03:34.730> I'm

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
smaller space like this and then all I'm

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.759 
smaller space like this and then all I'm
gonna<00:03:35.239> do<00:03:35.450> is<00:03:35.599> either<00:03:35.870> travel<00:03:36.379> stitch<00:03:36.590> or

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
gonna do is either travel stitch or

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.229 
gonna do is either travel stitch or
break<00:03:36.980> thread<00:03:37.310> I'm<00:03:37.430> probably<00:03:37.669> going<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.030> just

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
break thread I'm probably going to just

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.750 
break thread I'm probably going to just
travel<00:03:38.510> stitch<00:03:38.959> across<00:03:39.439> this<00:03:39.620> block<00:03:39.919> to<00:03:40.609> get

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
travel stitch across this block to get

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.490 
travel stitch across this block to get
to<00:03:40.879> the<00:03:41.000> other<00:03:41.120> side<00:03:41.479> and<00:03:41.780> then<00:03:41.900> just<00:03:42.139> fill<00:03:42.379> it

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
to the other side and then just fill it

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.000 
to the other side and then just fill it
in<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.739> opposite<00:03:43.129> side<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.459> exact<00:03:43.790> same<00:03:44.120> way

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
in the opposite side the exact same way

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.740 
in the opposite side the exact same way
when<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.040> came<00:03:46.159> up<00:03:46.400> with<00:03:46.729> the<00:03:46.879> idea<00:03:47.329> for<00:03:47.419> this

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
when I came up with the idea for this

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.990 
when I came up with the idea for this
design<00:03:48.169> it<00:03:48.590> was<00:03:48.709> mostly<00:03:49.220> just<00:03:49.310> with<00:03:49.579> the<00:03:49.699> idea

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
design it was mostly just with the idea

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.330 
design it was mostly just with the idea
of<00:03:50.060> you<00:03:50.659> know<00:03:50.690> these<00:03:51.049> circles<00:03:51.620> really<00:03:52.069> being

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
of you know these circles really being

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.670 
of you know these circles really being
able<00:03:52.489> to<00:03:52.669> stand<00:03:53.180> out<00:03:53.569> you<00:03:54.879> could<00:03:55.879> also<00:03:56.060> add

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
able to stand out you could also add

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.409 
able to stand out you could also add
accents<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:58.099> your<00:03:58.220> quote<00:03:58.430> within<00:03:58.609> and<00:03:58.970> you

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419 
accents to your quote within and you

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:00.969 
accents to your quote within and you
could<00:03:59.599> use<00:03:59.780> that<00:03:59.810> as<00:04:00.019> a<00:04:00.169> nice<00:04:00.409> place<00:04:00.739> to<00:04:00.769> put

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:00.979 
could use that as a nice place to put

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:04.180 
could use that as a nice place to put
maybe<00:04:01.459> a<00:04:01.579> hotfix<00:04:02.060> crystal<00:04:02.829> something<00:04:03.829> funky

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
maybe a hotfix crystal something funky

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.759 
maybe a hotfix crystal something funky
like<00:04:04.310> that<00:04:04.549> or<00:04:04.699> a<00:04:04.729> bead<00:04:05.530> you<00:04:06.530> could<00:04:06.650> definitely

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
like that or a bead you could definitely

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.860 
like that or a bead you could definitely
stitch<00:04:07.280> on<00:04:07.459> just<00:04:07.970> about<00:04:08.060> anything<00:04:08.389> onto<00:04:08.750> your

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
stitch on just about anything onto your

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.659 
stitch on just about anything onto your
quilt<00:04:09.109> or<00:04:09.290> really<00:04:09.530> accent<00:04:10.099> that<00:04:10.250> design<00:04:10.639> and

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
quilt or really accent that design and

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.460 
quilt or really accent that design and
make<00:04:11.449> it<00:04:11.569> stand<00:04:11.750> out<00:04:11.959> that<00:04:11.989> much<00:04:12.290> nicer

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
make it stand out that much nicer

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.920 
make it stand out that much nicer
so<00:04:15.470> that's<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:16.040> for<00:04:16.250> Kaos<00:04:16.640> stars<00:04:17.090> I<00:04:17.300> really
