 To the second video of the day, you do not 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.090
 saw a video came out here today that 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.620
 kleber the series is both asked and I 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.570
 I brought you 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.130
 today at 11 he left the club if you did not 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.359
 saw take a walk there and then give 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.100
 a look at this video is also very 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.680
 Nice too, per liter, it 's very beautiful. 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.740
 everything is wonderful so it looks 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.490
 there and came back from a bubble dad always 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.490
 clean 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.740
 where to start talking about expansion 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.240
 itself right 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.460
 we have a new collection of objects coming 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.620
 there for 2004 and it looks like she's going 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.910
 spin around the theme of halloween and me 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.800
 I'm a little suspicious to talk about this. 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.690
 theme because I really like it then if he 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.250
 Come on, I 'll really like it. 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.840
 using many objects that I think 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.239
 all objects may not match 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.250
 very well with luxurious party does not match 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.830
 very well with a 2004 object maybe 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.870
 rolled into a beautiful new with a few 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.570
 some things like doing in the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.210
 my house but I'll like only that 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.280
 this subject is a little suspect to talk about it 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.650
 so I'll like it or not I do not know 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.900
 and I also need to see more objects 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.400
 do not throw everything and of course 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.500
 that it has a date and has been released 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.900
 You check reviewed this picture here in the 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.630
 channel so you do not lose anything if I 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.150
 whether you like my opinion or not and 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.920
 also has twitter facebook there you 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.200
 saw the same opinions and everything I 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.420
 talk about the fate also calculate 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.520
 the expansion with the work will have 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.110
 a new resource that functions as clubs 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.420
 and that's exactly what this video will look like 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.850
 treat these clubs you kind of group 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.860
 only we'll be able to declare that it will 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.509
 be able to join the group where the group 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.610
 to be able to go out with the clothes he goes 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.080
 wear when they are together and also 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.420
 other types of behavior then 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.950
 leader is an improved group that 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.170
 system of group of university life 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.660
 social and will be improved by the sims 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.640
 4 of the galley you can enter in several 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.709
 clubs and also call them all will 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.660
 leave everything else only one at a time 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.310
 option will call everyone I believe 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.990
 It will be a zone so you will call 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.179
 only one club to go out to 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.490
 particular location can for example pick up 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.229
 a group of marombas and define their 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.119
 clothes and everything else they will stay 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.319
 most of the time in the gym or if 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.890
 they will be able to stay in other nodes 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.569
 also 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.340
 if the children will then be able to enter 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.349
 maromba group will have a child of 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.270
 five years the kind of movie tony parker 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.860
 I do not know if I'm going to have it but okay 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.569
 if you have this legal and you will also 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.480
 set for this group is whether it can 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.650
 be mean to the groups in the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.690
 uninteresting nerds those who 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.849
 are totally against the barons bombs 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.610
 you can also define this group for it 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.890
 be mean to the uninteresting group 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.750
 or it can be romantic with cuba 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.970
 romance lounge brings kitty and everything 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.580
 most of the maromba guys usually have 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.140
 October of the patricinha that motoboys and 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.360
 gives on the patricinhas everything but 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.980
 Finally there can modify all of these 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.390
 groups of these clubs we will be able to 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.580
 modify all the talk we 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.380
 want and even define what they are going to 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.120
 wear what I liked the most was open 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.500
 soon to be able to wear they will put 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.180
 a plaque alone in Rio must leave 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.920
 for the ballad they get the clubs going 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.320
 totally change the service so 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.150
 if he is shy but his club 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.130
 encourage him to flirt with some sim 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.380
 he will end up forgetting that he is 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.720
 shy and go there as the club runs 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.060
 knee affected the thiazinha then if so 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.280
 I do not know if I'm afraid. 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.890
 behind but finally he was afraid he goes 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.989
 get a fucking deal with the guys he does not 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.330
 It was mean, but he did something. 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.459
 club because it may 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.320
 happen that basically gave your 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.040
 movies will forget some traits that 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.989
 they have 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.430
 through the club because the club can 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.320
 to encourage him to do some other 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.870
 thing like other movies too 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.610
 does not necessarily have 15 can be the 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.470
 time you have inside the club and this 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.060
 unleashes a number of things bringing 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.160
 a lot of possibilities there for the 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.900
 This is because much of the normal state of the 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.360
 our movies as you know them 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.620
 they are programmed to have a 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.970
 autonomy is that we can disconnect 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.190
 He wants it but I've always been 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.230
 on and this autonomy is generated by 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.170
 basic needs of the cinema then 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.760
 they will be there until the cnp 6 even he 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.739
 will do things that the needs 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.660
 basic it then requires if it is 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.400
 hungry, he goes there and goes to eat everything else 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.260
 you will not automatically have to do 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.299
 Nothing still needs to be done that does not 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.040
 I just said that if he does not have any 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.959
 basic need to do everything else 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.640
 if you have full capacity it will do 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.260
 what traits allows then 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.040
 he was romantic he will start in 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.299
 Woman's top 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.739
 he was funny he 'll want 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.560
 talk to others to tell 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.539
 joke anyway that kind of thing but with the 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.640
 club and this is not going to happen he goes 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.130
 act differently depending on 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.110
 need of the club then it is the people who 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.570
 will define what we want for the 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.129
 club everything else and will change until the cnpc 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.770
 inside the game then the 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:35.929
 the silval is not only yours but like 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.909
 those who go are inside the club 

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:39.110
 NPCs all over the movies you 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.789
 met in the city 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.009
 they will change the behavior through 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.439
 the club you want you will be able to 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.539
 To limit this, then, it's very cool, man. 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:49.580
 the club can have ten rules then 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.589
 counting that five of these rules is the 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.839
 movies must do within that 

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:56.599
 club and five of them should not 

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:59.409
 do inside the club where he was the 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:03.499
 You have to attack a small cage but it can not 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:05.749
 to be naked in the academy of goods for 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:07.729
 to be able to define these rules is 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:09.979
 a list I believe in a list that will 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.839
 be there in time to create the club 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.819
 then everything else with this tool can 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:15.649
 create any type of club 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:17.209
 This will bring even more fun to 

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:19.039
 people inside the game we will have a 

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:21.709
 little more control over others 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.629
 sims inside the game then this will do 

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:25.789
 part of this month's simulation brings 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:27.139
 for us and we will get it 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.209
 modify other movies through 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.860
 these clubs, it's going to be really cool. 

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:33.439
 I particularly liked this. 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.509
 because these simple groups do not 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:38.029
 the university is the 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:39.860
 Christian group exit group is from 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:41.869
 car the night we called him 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.779
 to leave school with the crystals 

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:46.819
 neighbors purple there spinning right and then you 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:48.679
 had more interactions and more 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:50.449
 do some things in group and 

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:53.089
 he had social groups 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.159
 fixed then type nerds ahead is such 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:56.990
 thing the rebels do one thing I 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:58.939
 I'm a selection thing and you went into a 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.009
 of these and you can join anyone 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.839
 but now these clubs, the people 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.569
 will create a group that we will be able to 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:07.939
 create will put the need of it not 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:10.159
 modify clothes to hurt the place that they 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.990
 should then be very cool guy and 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:15.319
 I also believe that these clubs 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.119
 they will make you an agent 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:18.949
 the city, for example, you have 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:21.319
 a maromba club then you go 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:23.539
 send all those teams saying that 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:24.919
 they can only go to lots of 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:28.009
 gym then you go there in the gym 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.259
 they will talk there you must have another one 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:31.390
 group there that is the club's nightcap 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:33.400
 say so 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.250
 There's the simple one there that goes to 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.300
 determined the ballad of the city are there 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.820
 in that ballad 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.770
 Are you going to talk then, basically? 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.780
 we will be able to prove a little more 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.030
 understood them it's an angel they go 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.950
 ride and everything else then it will be alright 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.690
 better to find the movies in your group and 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.160
 everything else then this is what I hope you 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.780
 have liked another video here in the 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.550

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.540
