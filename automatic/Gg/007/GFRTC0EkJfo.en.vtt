that it doesn't hurt it doesn't hurt
like<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.670> water<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> ocean<00:01:03.960> because

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
like like the water in the ocean because

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.350 
like like the water in the ocean because
there<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.510> 3.5<00:01:06.510> solution<00:01:07.260> oh<00:01:08.000> yeah<00:01:09.000> because

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
there is of 3.5 solution oh yeah because

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.780 
there is of 3.5 solution oh yeah because
it's<00:01:09.570> about<00:01:09.750> staying<00:01:10.080> yeah<00:01:10.320> yeah

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
it's about staying yeah yeah

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.340 
it's about staying yeah yeah
so<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.979> this<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.250> salt<00:01:14.939> water<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.900> 1%

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
so in this this salt water this 1%

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.510 
so in this this salt water this 1%
solution<00:01:17.360> gives<00:01:18.360> moisture<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:19.250> your<00:01:20.250> eyes

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
solution gives moisture to your eyes

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.920 
solution gives moisture to your eyes
this<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.659> very<00:01:22.250> very<00:01:23.250> important<00:01:23.939> because<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
this is very very important because the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.850 
this is very very important because the
salt<00:01:25.880> remains<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.479> water<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.680> gets

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
salt remains the water and it gets

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.630 
salt remains the water and it gets
moisturing

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
moisturing

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.870 
moisturing
so<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.020> see<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.860> feel<00:01:32.130> much<00:01:32.310> better<00:01:32.369> with

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
wash with this 1% solution so I show you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.300 
wash with this 1% solution so I show you
how<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:38.159> ok<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:40.170> need<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> measure

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
how to do ok you have you need a measure

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.840 
how to do ok you have you need a measure
and<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.780> put<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.170> 100<00:01:43.799> milliliter<00:01:44.579> we

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
and you have to put in 100 milliliter we

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.600 
and you have to put in 100 milliliter we
just<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.509> did<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.200> 100<00:01:47.070> millimeter<00:01:47.520> it

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
just we just did it 100 millimeter it

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.660 
just we just did it 100 millimeter it
must<00:01:47.820> be<00:01:48.000> exactly<00:01:48.780> because<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.320> need<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> 1%

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
must be exactly because you need a 1%

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.090 
must be exactly because you need a 1%
solution<00:01:50.850> then<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.899> little<00:01:52.170> wooden

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
solution then we have this little wooden

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.800 
solution then we have this little wooden
spoon<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.590> there<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> hole<00:01:56.270> which<00:01:57.270> contains

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
spoon and there is a hole which contains

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.030 
spoon and there is a hole which contains
one<00:01:57.960> gram<00:01:58.590> all<00:01:59.579> right<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:01.860> have

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
one gram all right and you have to have

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.499 
one gram all right and you have to have
a<00:02:02.070> cup<00:02:04.189> yes

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
a cup yes

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.290 
a cup yes
has<00:02:05.990> about<00:02:06.530> about<00:02:07.159> about<00:02:07.369> half<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:07.970> cup<00:02:08.240> yeah

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
has about about about half a cup yeah

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.140 
has about about about half a cup yeah
but<00:02:11.300> really<00:02:12.069> every<00:02:13.069> measure<00:02:13.340> has<00:02:13.640> her

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
but really every measure has her

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.960 
but really every measure has her
eyeballs<00:02:14.540> here<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.520> buy<00:02:16.520> one<00:02:16.790> with

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
eyeballs here you buy one with

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.140 
eyeballs here you buy one with
milliliter<00:02:17.959> because<00:02:18.349> this<00:02:18.590> is<00:02:18.709> one<00:02:18.950> gram<00:02:19.310> okay

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
milliliter because this is one gram okay

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.920 
milliliter because this is one gram okay
so<00:02:20.720> unique<00:02:21.260> one<00:02:21.530> gram<00:02:22.040> then<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.940> make<00:02:23.600> it<00:02:23.750> like

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
so unique one gram then you make it like

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.760 
so unique one gram then you make it like
that<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.120> have<00:02:26.450> in<00:02:26.690> here<00:02:27.110> in<00:02:27.319> this<00:02:27.500> whole

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
that so you have in here in this whole

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.479 
that so you have in here in this whole
one<00:02:28.040> gram<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:29.090> put<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.390> in<00:02:29.510> there

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
one gram and you you put it in there
