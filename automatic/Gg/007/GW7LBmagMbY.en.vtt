00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
touches by both teams both teams I don't

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.020

think<00:00:29.849> we're<00:00:29.970> at<00:00:30.090> their<00:00:30.240> best<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.689> think

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
think we're at their best that I think

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.479

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
these long trips take a lot out of these

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.300 
these long trips take a lot out of these
players<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:50.820> we<00:01:51.030> can't<00:01:52.020> let's<00:01:52.470> not<00:01:52.740> go<00:01:52.979> over
