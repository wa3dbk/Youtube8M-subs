00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
to this it's such a unique premise for a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.170

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.209 
shounen to use a battle system light
especially<00:01:00.449> would<00:01:00.960> test<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.530> how<00:01:01.649> they're

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
especially would test and how they're

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.549 
especially would test and how they're
using<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:02.820> these<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.660> students<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.470> are

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
him down like he did and then how coral

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.350 
him down like he did and then how coral
since<00:06:22.200> they<00:06:22.320> put<00:06:22.530> down<00:06:22.800> karma<00:06:23.430> like<00:06:23.850> he<00:06:24.060> did<00:06:24.240> it

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
since they put down karma like he did it

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.050 
since they put down karma like he did it
was<00:06:24.479> similar<00:06:25.289> in<00:06:25.500> terms<00:06:26.010> of<00:06:26.370> trying<00:06:26.669> to<00:06:26.850> build

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
was similar in terms of trying to build

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.430 
was similar in terms of trying to build
them<00:06:27.240> up<00:06:27.330> and<00:06:27.510> let<00:06:27.600> them<00:06:27.750> know<00:06:27.780> a<00:06:27.900> sense<00:06:28.289> of

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
them up and let them know a sense of

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.650 
them up and let them know a sense of
failure<00:06:28.680> to<00:06:28.979> make<00:06:29.130> them<00:06:29.310> stronger<00:06:29.729> but<00:06:30.419> there

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
failure to make them stronger but there

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.020 
failure to make them stronger but there
was<00:06:30.780> different<00:06:31.200> methods<00:06:31.650> behind<00:06:32.250> it<00:06:32.490> so<00:06:32.669> yeah

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
was different methods behind it so yeah

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.610 
was different methods behind it so yeah
you<00:06:33.090> get<00:06:33.330> to<00:06:33.419> see<00:06:33.570> those<00:06:33.750> similarities<00:06:34.229> right
