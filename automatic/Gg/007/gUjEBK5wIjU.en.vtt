00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.290
 Hahaha 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.020
 very good and that state drone minecraft 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.330
 back a new kraft problem 1 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.350
 point 7.10 called headset works with 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.760
 Forges and the physicists will give them a bow 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.890
 to be able to use this mode so 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.750
 here we have one and we are going to expose 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.030
 some series of creatures for example 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.100
 let's put a kripper let's put 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.200
 a skeleton let's put it that way a bit 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.150
 in order but it is the zombie has to 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.340
 be yes or yes a slide I do not know if 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.050
 will work with the slim the truth because 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.750
 really this motive neither with nor with the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.100
 gas either with this model that makes 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.170
 when we shot someone in the head 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.580
 directly kills him worth it 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.339
 it will simply put us a castle of 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.050
 connection and we kill it then it's a lot 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.339
 easier to kill mox but we have to 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.010
 hit directly to the head 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:56.160
 then for example in a mod like 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.820
 it can be a play that does not stop moving 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.130
 or what I tell you is that it is not spent either 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.360
 a gas ie a silver fish has to 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.100
 be difficult, we did the giving 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.900
 directly in the head but good 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.580
 programs with these and in principle 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.890
 we started with the clipper is worth it if 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.690
 we give the clipper in the head like 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.030
 Knowing by ingestion and dying is 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.500
 simply with a single shot and if you 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.430
 we shoot rent for example with the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.030
 arch to the body as you see we meditate 1 2 3 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.220
 4 shots to be able to kill him and without 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.960
 However, a single ketchup can reach 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.490
 kill then it's pretty cool now 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 that it is quite good to be able to reach 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.970
 do this we do not have also the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.490
 skeleton in which if he gave us 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.990
 we could see it better but good management 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.479
 as you see it hits him in the head and what 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.130
 we load but we do not load it of a single 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.970
 I'm not going to put another one for you to see 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.420
 that if I do not give to the head then 12 or 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.270
 do not 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.310
 well more than one is worth if we put a 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.190
 zombie below this so it does not burn 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.220
 Well, something like this will happen 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.550
 uy almost sometimes yes sometimes it is not today today 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.530
 today today today today that of boot that 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.800
 bounce the circle explode come no no no 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.050
 do not 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.110
 again again another time again come 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.610
 this one has the helmet to the techniques 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.130
 how can you defend come exercise of 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.500
 equally to we have also in him is 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.050
 line that I am so that causes me doubts 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.840
 because of course he has loaded me a single touch 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.880
 but I do not know if it's because I've 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.500
 done headshot or directly to see 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.090
 let's try with this one it's worth if I do 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.450
 so we shoot to shoot the part 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.180
 top of the head that passes no 12 bar 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.040
 with two if this one with one is supposed and if 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.350
 It is not bounce as it involves the arrow 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.870
 that also and this well with one also 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.000
 die each one is light but let's go day 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.820
 I say I have no idea if after 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.500
 of the bow or not and let's wait for the pickman 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.470
 example you already know just like the zombie 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.480
 we have in our heads and it dies if we give it 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.130
 to a blake that this is what I fear the most 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.170
 the soldier gave me because now I have 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.420
 this wood then see if I give it 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.520
 to the blade in the head because this also 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.470
 he also dies fuck how good this 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.660
 here and I'm going to put some way by 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.450
 example in this case neutral is worth some 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.640
 pork 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.440
 a bat that we can see in the 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.410
 head to a bat a witch for 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.690
 example also on the track that you have 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.220
 It is very difficult to give a cow or 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.360
 a sheep or even a squid we are going to 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.400
 see what happens with the squid also 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.700
 then the pig can do it for 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.830
 Here the bow as in 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.170
 principle not in principle we're going to 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.239
 put them to try to do it again if 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.420
 we can directly in the head and not 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.420
 does not die the pig does not suffer from headsets 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.280
 why do not you imagine if I split a 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.750
 bat and images or my god what 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.640
 pro point I'm done 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.349
 is not that way able to hit the head in 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.880
 life to a witch for example then 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.420
 it also assumes that it has to work 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.970
 headshot although I give the hat the hat 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.579
 we still step on him let's see the same 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.200
 also how do we give the description or 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.170
 my god management to the pima that although 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.180
 what point pro I am a cow also for 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.209
 example let's see if I give the cow 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.609
 the head also dies when 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.609
 cows normally one 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.460
 do not run 22 shots if I give a sheep 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.750
 Well, I suppose it will be the same, but not 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.600
 I know what will happen to the same 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.100
 pig that is immune is worth it seems that 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.960
 yes it seems that it is immune we are going to try 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.650
 with another sheep just in case but in 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.710
 principle would seem that the management 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.410
 they affect it and there it goes, it does not affect it 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.259
 ok and the squid let's see the squid 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.630
 we have one here we are going to put a 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.550
 but we'll wait for him to look 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.580
 well with the head because if not we can not 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.590
 do it right there goes and it does not seem that 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.750
 is immune gave him a crush I got 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.940
 two so that he dies and we're going to try 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.030
 a couple of times because it works 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.969
 but it has not worked for the same reason 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.949
 one is worth 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.809
 no no no does not work works with the 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.039
 squid although I thought yes that 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:08.169
 it could have worked but it's not going to 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.729
 operate this visit also by 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.889
 example and now let's go through 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.999
 example with an anderman that assumes that 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.419
 the dates do not give but maybe 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:19.059
 is magically it gives maybe a chicken 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.079
 no the chicken tried and it does not matter what 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:21.759
 what do you put here 

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:25.089
 plays channel trying the ocelot 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:27.219
 maybe a horse a villager who also 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:28.539
 it will work safely a snow golem 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:31.269
 and an iron golem and with this 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:36.120
 we finish then it is worth the enter 

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:39.370
 we keep lenderman let's stop 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.400
 so it's not going to be that I do not want to be able to 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.440
 give to know is that clear either because if 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.270
 want to point the things that 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.680
 besides, it does not help us because of the fact 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.020
 that we can not hit with the arrows and 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.600
 we give a chicken we will see if the 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.490
 chicken is left 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.500
 I do not know what to say is that the chicken also 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.740
 bites a blow always what I want 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.710
 see is the headset uy almost there not either 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.190
 does not work the ocelot my god I have 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.190
 position 3 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.150
 no escape is so much having escapes not 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.990
 escapes 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:17.310
 it does not matter, my god, my oldest and give 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.130
 batches that bat and the others 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.020
 cats where they are no good idea the 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.490
 villager yes I know it works because 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.740
 I was testing before when we give 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.990
 today you want to cheat, we give and 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.090
 management the snow golem also 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.350
 It works when it was like that, how is it 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.020
 you too and he 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.270
 the iron goal when I give him then in 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.669
 beginning to move away from shot but not 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.760
 killed must give two facts in a row for 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:45.889
 that the golem ends up dying is this 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.889
 will remove or stay there forever 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.800
 golem 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.880
 a golem now you call headshot let's go 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.880
 let's see let's see 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:00.460
 now we do not give headshot to see we're going to 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:03.310
 give it and I do not give it, I do not hit it in the head 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.080
 uncle to see I'm going to give it again that I 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.720
 before with two shots I have loaded a 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.810
 golem vale goes the first one is a management and 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.210
 the second is other than yes or no 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.610
 I seriously, I've already charged 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:21.250
 one with two strokes can not be come a 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:24.220
 management and now the second and 3 1 and 4 a 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.680
 see this this is a very rare good thing 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.940
 the thing that works has the mod the 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.710
 it's really cool to me 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.770
 has loved to remove the rain that is 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.570
 He must listen with the utmost sadness and nothing 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.010
 let's hope a lot this video was 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.760
 it serves to expel the one that has to move we have 

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.760
 in the next video 

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:42.270
 up to 2000
