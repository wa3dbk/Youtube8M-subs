00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.950
 hi to everyone by itself minutes 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.660
 in this new video we are practically 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:28.750
 to the highlight of the presentations let me 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.720
 2015 today I try a little in the wood chips 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.170
 I tried a few days ago 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.880
 I'm trained a bit, let's say it's alone 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.460
 question of practice I say already 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:45.820
 however this james tiptree there is a bit 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.449
 bugged in quotation marks because it has some 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.830
 problem of rigid boy collisions 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.000
 somewhere 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.060
 I think he needs a little bit a 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.370
 moment of a systematic but yes enough 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.830
 find the right system the right way 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.160
 to let the logs go into being 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:09.180
 a little skilled with the rapier magazines here 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.150
 and nothing as you see it again 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.340
 the jobs really are profitable 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.560
 we also have forestry chips 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.580
 really a great level performance 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.490
 so if you take your hand 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.220
 really try your hand on the forests 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.790
 on the wood because you really do a bang 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.979
 of money 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.860
 coming soon in the next video e 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.810
 last I think we're going to see chainsaws 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.690
 I will show you the step to that on 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.750
 charger let's say the towing one 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.340
 in towed he must see the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.619
 ability to cut trees and 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.590
 chainsaws blah blah we say one thing 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.960
 really very very very interesting 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.720
 so let's see how here 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.030
 it works a little cheap actress me 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.909
 I always recommend not leaving us patricians 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.400
 and what in the midst of the casino trees 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.979
 because when playing sports you find yourself with 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.470
 lysis etc. you find the tools in 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.869
 around the forest then lived 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.540
 past he brought back a field from 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.110
 some because otherwise done on a 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.850
 casino and nothing goes well as options 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.080
 this one has the possibility of course 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.330
 to open it, here are some open the tape 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.990
 conveyor guardian 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.270
 lower the parking feet for 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.910
 stabilizing them in more abusiveness is known 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.460
 to open it and close it 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.170
 obviously to unload in the trailer e 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:40.200
 try recognized activate it in turns 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.100
 they get up, no camera, let's say 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.430
 on the arm so you need a little 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:53.060
 arrange yourself not that there is no let's say the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:56.820
 possibility of reviewing from the arm 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.140
 I am now trying to do some fail 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.140
 that for sure 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.739
 I can apologize you can't for the ne 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.910
 I am prevented but I have to say again 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:19.860
 take a little bit of hand two on the 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:22.349
 ok shot let's see if you pull them in and 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.360
 I strongly doubt 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:30.900
 here logs must be put 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:34.140
 here they must be practically laid down 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.849
 halfway through the ribbon 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.610
 here it is mammamia two in one shot 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:42.000
 guys this epic must be 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.099
 laid down in meta meta tape here 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.500
 practically where it starts to shoot because 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.170
 if I noticed that we say that the 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.650
 best point to do it to do it 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.569
 entering is another thing I noticed 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.500
 always as he had said last time 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:01.019
 make logs of sizes enough 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.750
 court that if we are here we say by three 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:07.440
 meters that you go well to get them e 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:12.079
 also the chipper in the belt facilitates 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.079
 a little the entries of the logs 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.280
 here 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.280
 let's see if we can do that too 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.389
 daje 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.000
 what network that really makes so much 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:32.319
 already courage the wagon which is practically 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.479
 almost already well enough I stop 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:36.669
 because everything is going too well 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.449
 how much something will happen then 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.250
 a bomb will explode and nothing for what 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.770
 regards the patricians and this ve his 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.560
 function as those strengthens we say 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.719
 that as movements etc. is a bit 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.870
 improved it does a little well there is a 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:55.259
 let's settle let's say the ward of 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.120
 shredding or otherwise for rest is ok 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.069
 see that we have already filled a beautiful one 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.969
 piece of trailer with three trunks 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:07.330
 go to that more dynamic plan stuff 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:09.400
 and all is enough now with wood chips you can 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.430
 store it at home or go to 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.740
 sell it now I'll show you I'll do it 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.060
 see everything so i will go directly to 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.270
 home 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.939
 so we are there then when 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:26.169
 you have your chips say we can 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:28.779
 if you want to download it, store it in the farm 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.520
 in this we say sector here 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:32.560
 here you can put it here 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.069
 temporarily to wait but the 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:40.169
 great offers of the biogas qua velo 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.169
 load with the ball normally 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:48.389
 Now let's go to a biogas department 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.039
 that we see another point the point of 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.659
 sale 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.849
 here we are at the station let's say del 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:55.649
 biogas 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:59.909
 just go from the back here with yours 

00:05:55.649 --> 00:06:03.419
 wagon appears downloaded trigger 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:09.559
 simply we say paid e 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:09.559
 also and quite well here it is 

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:17.369
 great that maybe if you want to 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.399
 take more money wait for offers 

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:22.860
 nothing when we say is paid by 

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:25.080
 Best back a moment beyond 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.959
 scar 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.080
 here we are again then as you have seen the 

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:32.969
 two possibilities of chips for yes 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.610
 they can touch at home or sell 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:37.529
 directly and enough for the rest 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.499
 we say there is nothing else to say 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:42.809
 so here I close his video and 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:45.029
 Chipped department and everything I hope to be 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:47.189
 was clear and do not take fear that is 

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:50.330
 you are not so clever because 

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:52.340
 we are still at the beginning and really there is 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.009
 there is still something to improve from 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.470
 fix everything anyway thought 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.389
 a little complexity and completeness 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.580
 so that the game then some 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:03.319
 error some arrangement must be 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.990
 made because you think a little 

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:08.210
 stuff that they have to fix everything 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.669
 think that in short there is a job not to 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.740
 behind I leave you then I greet you 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:14.780
 I give you an appointment at the next video 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.210
 I will do chainsaws we will go to see the 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.560
 cut of the oak trees of 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.960
 all there is around 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.250
 map in them of the step that is one 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.719
 I tell you just bomb for rest 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.909
 nothing then I had finished that video 

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:31.009
 we'll see if I'll do something else 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:32.659
 presentations, however, or they will come out 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:34.219
 maybe some way and start 

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:36.740
 present something or some map 

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:39.620
 maybe I'll make you start making videos 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:42.500
 let's say music like 2013 slowly 

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.870
 a bit of calm I hope to succeed 

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.090
 I leave you all and nothing 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.250
 greeting and thank you as always there 

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.550
 see you soon with next video 

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.550
 bye Bye
