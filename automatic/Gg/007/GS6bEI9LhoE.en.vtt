00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.460
 with that light-hearted air as a child nor 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.020
 the first thing too grown up 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.760
 pictures of him are teasing 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.410
 that at school they will have reserved for them 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.789
 classmates 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.890
 after seeing him win an ept 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.900
 put the mtt to fire and iron on 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.880
 pokerstars.com and win two rings 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.040
 to the aussie millions the first certainty 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.050
 what you have about him is that all those 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.149
 once they laughed today they no longer laugh 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.010
 because when mustafa kanit talks about 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.960
 poker now everyone listens with it 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.940
 religious silence which reserves to whom 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.210
 he obviously understood something more 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.210
 of others 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.900
 let's say mustafa canetto 23 years old I come 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.340
 but from the vein lives mortar vi 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.150
 nickname that I like best brings 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.140
 probably there is definitely 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.960
 surely cash games are players 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.229
 very strong, much stronger than me 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.720
 there are very few tournaments 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.170
 knowing me it does not leave one thing alone 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.940
 until I try I try to solve 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.830
 broad line so when I understand 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.170
 I could make money with this game there 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.400
 I am one hundred percent 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.619
 however, Australia was antonio Ã¨ 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.020
 quite simple to buy in low 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.479
 so they don't move so much it's more than 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.770
 another one I did in the last 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.860
 two years that changed the situation 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.950
 no doubt the victories confront each other 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.850
 with the best ones being respected by 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.580
 all 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.990
 many things I did as a second 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.530
 last year's best player can 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.259
 costar in tournaments so that already does to 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.110
 cite the only continuous results e 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.970
 that the best test anyway to go 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.500
 going to live abroad without a doubt 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.570
 was the poker choice 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.100
 speaking better I could do for one 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.750
 question of game though they are of 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.189
 comparison for a matter of gain 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.830
 for a price book opportunity for one 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.840
 global issue one that writes how 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.759
 you can be a professional player ad 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.710
 high levels in Italy because you can't 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.530
 compare yourself both playing and talking 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.900
 with anyone because if you are the best in 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.810
 italia games on pokerstars.it are the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.840
 better than poker.it and stay 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.970
 of pokerstars.it if you are on point 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.430
 com 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.590
 the best if you become the best 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.490
 it does not remain so for a long time therefore if 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.170
 so he was constantly forced to 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.090
 compare yourself to improve yourself and if you do it in 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.150
 group is much simpler 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.020
 I talk about poker with the best 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.990
 therefore continuously 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.030
 is the best thing there is to improve the 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.550
 best thing you can do 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.190
 I am perhaps the only one who can do it 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.940
 so in Italy currently this is the 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.840
 difference certainly makes the difference 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.340
 when you play a shot simply 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.100
 try talking to those who are there 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.410
 around and try to analyze the hit a 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.450
 solve it not only in the blow itself for 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.230
 itself but in all the dynamics and in 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.090
 all one hundred percent that can be 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.180
 maybe a simple preflop call 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.950
 but why is it done and this call 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.810
 preflop is brought up on the river in 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.730
 broad line then how to manage the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.860
 hand spending the minimum as well 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.950
 swelling to the fullest in the best way 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.380
 possible or otherwise be able to keep them 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.460
 reigns so much to be able to do so 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.690
 often make it possible to evaluate often 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.930
 bringing your opponent into error not 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.900
 never knowing where she is I made a mistake in 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.020
 first eight months lengthened more than 200 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.790
 mila on starz with therefore without doubt mi 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.220
 I found myself to the point that I had lost 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.959
 the beliefs in myself that anyway 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.130
 they were very high because always 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.790
 won mtt but there is however for like 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.170
 I'm done or missors put to study 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.480
 playing a lot every day 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.180
 the results came one like me 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.250
 even if it goes brock anyway 1 st king one 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.190
 you find it all the time 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.130
 that absolutely not though obviously 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.110
 to say conditions the conventions that 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.940
 there is in yourself especially then now 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.130
 it must be said that we can have any 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.959
 swing that I don't care 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.190
 absolutely nothing at the game level 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.190
 it wasn't like that before
