I have a lot to demonstrate and say that

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.880 
I have a lot to demonstrate and say that
seems<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.730> help<00:02:55.880> people<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:57.110> let<00:02:57.260> go<00:02:57.320> and<00:02:57.650> find

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
seems to help people to let go and find

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.920 
seems to help people to let go and find
that<00:02:58.100> deeper<00:02:58.670> place<00:02:58.880> in<00:02:59.090> themselves<00:02:59.420> but<00:02:59.630> also

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
that deeper place in themselves but also

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.610 
that deeper place in themselves but also
ways<00:03:00.920> of<00:03:01.160> practicing<00:03:01.480> language<00:03:02.480> of<00:03:02.990> music<00:03:03.170> in

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
ways of practicing language of music in

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.980 
ways of practicing language of music in
a<00:03:04.160> more<00:03:04.400> precise<00:03:04.820> way<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.390> have<00:03:05.510> more

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
a more precise way so you have more

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.070 
a more precise way so you have more
precision<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.740> more<00:03:07.130> freedom

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.110 

Oh
