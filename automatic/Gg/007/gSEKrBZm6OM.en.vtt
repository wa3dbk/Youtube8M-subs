 chain more open television 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.029
 never for what you think and we go with 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.290
 the myths and rites of the piñatas by 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.290
 course with gerardo jiménez 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.270

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.779
 not only at Christmas and birthdays 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.699
 are present even for dates like 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.609
 on April 30 and a day of coexistence 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.040
 the challenge of breaking a piñata is 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:37.400
 I presented 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.510
 a doll of this cable 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.400
 it's going to be for your birthday so that 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.070
 they like piñatas a lot 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.570
 represents for you will break a piñata 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.720
 well admission to very funny because 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.640
 he grabs sweets sometimes one of the 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.600
 myths is that you are missing this 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.460
 nice tradition 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.020
 I think it persists although a little 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.510
 modified because it is no longer the piñata 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.130
 traditional of the seven peaks but what 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.990
 What artisans do is wonderful 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.449
 adapting to the new characters that 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.350
 they look for the prodigal children that follows this 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.840
 magical now 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.850
 now thematic and not so much the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.619
 traditional of the guys this month 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.119
 representing the sins and their things 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.220
 one hour and nothing else is like to 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.080
 celebrate what the child wants from 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.670
 character with whom he identifies 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.229
 I think there have always been piñatas and 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.330
 It is always a beautiful tradition that 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.950
 we keep buying piñatas before not 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:31.090
 there was so much variety before they were just from 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:33.260
 peaks and it will be harder to break them 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.700
 although there is a whole family tradition 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.649
 of those who make piñatas all this 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.480
 tradition of the piñatas was born in the 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.300

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.290
 of all time more than anything the intention 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.350
