00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
which we all have you're a hobbyist

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.150 
which we all have you're a hobbyist
working<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:01.109> robotic<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.800> looking<00:01:02.070> at

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
working on robotic it's all looking at

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.880 
working on robotic it's all looking at
university<00:01:02.789> if<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.840> work<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.170> university<00:01:04.350> I

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
university if you work in a university I

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.700 
university if you work in a university I
was<00:01:05.040> saying<00:01:05.309> specialize<00:01:06.140> that's<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> key<00:01:07.650> to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
was saying specialize that's the key to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.359 
was saying specialize that's the key to
the<00:01:08.100> robotics<00:01:08.580> always<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.510> you're<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:09.930> happy

unmanned vehicles last year's prize that

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.420 
unmanned vehicles last year's prize that
it<00:01:25.500> was<00:01:25.619> two<00:01:25.770> million<00:01:27.500> really<00:01:28.500> they<00:01:29.009> take<00:01:29.250> that

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
it was two million really they take that

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.010 
it was two million really they take that
kind<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.790> software<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.570> build<00:01:30.780> an

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
kind of software that you can build an

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.740 
kind of software that you can build an
equipment<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.100> they<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.549> government<00:01:33.420> uses

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
equipment and they the government uses

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.990 
equipment and they the government uses
it<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.860> they<00:01:35.250> would<00:01:35.400> never<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.729> doing<00:01:35.939> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
it so they would never be doing a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.399 
it so they would never be doing a
competition<00:01:36.390> about<00:01:36.600> nature

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
competition about nature

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.690 
competition about nature
I<00:01:37.439> should<00:01:37.890> by<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.040> people<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.340> money<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.579> or

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
I should by the people of money in or

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.280 
I should by the people of money in or
the<00:01:38.909> competition<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.509> States<00:01:39.780> are<00:01:40.229> the

the competition in the States are the
same<00:01:40.560> people<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.920> came<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.250> the

kind of level you're talking about and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.109 
kind of level you're talking about and
they<00:01:47.220> would<00:01:47.369> never<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:47.640> giving<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.030> to

robotics<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.560> know<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.340> hasn't<00:01:56.490> got<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> video

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
robotics you know it hasn't got a video

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.600 
robotics you know it hasn't got a video
establish<00:01:57.390> corporations<00:01:58.100> it<00:01:59.100> hasn't<00:01:59.369> got<00:01:59.520> to

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
establish corporations it hasn't got to

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.700 
establish corporations it hasn't got to
be<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.850> big<00:02:00.000> boys<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.719> be<00:02:00.810> anybody<00:02:01.409> that's

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
be the big boys it can be anybody that's

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.999 
be the big boys it can be anybody that's
got<00:02:01.829> their<00:02:02.009> enthusiasm<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.790> can<00:02:03.390> get<00:02:04.009> backing

got their enthusiasm and can get backing
sponsors<00:02:05.880> buy<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.780> equipment<00:02:07.259> it's

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
sponsors buy the equipment it's

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.859 
sponsors buy the equipment it's
obviously<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:07.950> not<00:02:08.069> cheap<00:02:08.340> but<00:02:09.090> even<00:02:09.690> then

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
obviously it's not cheap but even then

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.020 
obviously it's not cheap but even then
there's<00:02:10.410> been<00:02:10.590> some<00:02:10.770> fantastic

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
there's been some fantastic

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.490 
there's been some fantastic
breakthroughs

breakthroughs

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.000

by<00:02:12.820> amateurs<00:02:13.820> and<00:02:14.060> obvious<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:15.320> robotics<00:02:15.620> and

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
by amateurs and obvious in robotics and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.160 
by amateurs and obvious in robotics and
it<00:02:16.370> will<00:02:16.460> continue<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:17.000> be<00:02:17.120> like<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.540> it's

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
it will continue to be like that it's

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.010 
it will continue to be like that it's
this<00:02:18.320> kind<00:02:18.530> of<00:02:18.710> feel<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.540> seems<00:02:20.810> that

this kind of feel to it it seems that

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.010 
this kind of feel to it it seems that

you've heard of that before you know we

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.420 
you've heard of that before you know we
