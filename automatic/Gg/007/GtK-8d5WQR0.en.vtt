00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.520
 city ​​skylines i want a new city 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.880
 Found on a new map that has 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.889
 Two reasons once my old jerky 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.530
 city ​​with 52,000 inhabitants on mine 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.540
 pc meanwhile pretty doll 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.220
 This is a bit annoying for me, though 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.960
 especially it annoys me that it is with you 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.050
 can jerky and look reasonable 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.880
 and that's why I'll get the 250,000 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.359
 inhabitants of the city first put on ice 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.220
 until the new pc got and the new one 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.199
 city ​​is also often has in the old pc yet 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.309
 run very smoothly and that is cool 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.090
 Also that there is a new map 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.680
 can try 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.160
 maybe even more interesting 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.030
 is with many mountains and rivers 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.100
 coastlines and so on what we have there 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.170
 still comes and which the new pc 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.020
 we can then decide together 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.309
 I should only continue to play it city 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.989
 through the old town to play such 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.250
 in the alternately play that can 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.649
 We then decide for her 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.730
 what you want the new map 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.260
 But I do not want to just like that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.430
 determine now but we can 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.800
 Do it together and do it over the steam 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.329
 workshop that's easy I can 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.519
 show you either have a short time either 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.229
 you bought your own game then you can 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.060
 Just go to the game title here 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.100
 in the library and then on ski 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.869
 Click workshop if your game is not 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.909
 have and just watch, so to speak 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.490
 you join the team on community 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.990
 here above community then you can see here 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.330
 workshop and then in the workshop 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.580
 You can just call in here 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.340
 workshop in search of cities 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.400
 look for skylines 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.350
 Citys said skyline looking wrong 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.619
 written 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:43.009
 so the skylines had that before 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.009
 folded 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.620
 Colon for that reason is called cities 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.380
 colon skylines - cities type 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.590
 you think it's okay and then you can 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.080
 you sort on the right side of 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.110
 a filter for the different categories 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.509
 create then one looks for mettmann 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.130
 displayed one of all available cards 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.590
 and then you can filter up with that 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.750
 what is the best proven 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.090
 map of all times which probably in the 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.790
 last three months which then 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.070
 most popular and so on and there you can 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.010
 you look around me and then a cool one 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.060
 choose more that I should play 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.430
 I would say we are doing it relatively 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.920
 simply I do not want to pretend any 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.489
 we do it that way i just had yours 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.130
 favorite map the name under the 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.470
 youtube video here or on 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.760
 facebook under the facebook entry and 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.900
 then i will just enter the entries 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:42.800
 see through and the suggestions on the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.750
 Most votes have then in the closer 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.239
 take selection and choose a map of it 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.320
 So ideally if you are now 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.370
 Here you say good 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.680
 10a you river or i dont know delta 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.900
 of the shadow the two maps have fallen 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.790
 you're good on me, of course 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.079
 youtube or facebook then an entry 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.220
 want written comments to the then 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.989
 you see someone else has that already 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.360
 written would naturally skilful 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.890
 just answer the entry and 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.450
 the entry a thumbs up 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.480
 give then that is for me 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.130
 to pick out clearly as if 30 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.450
 people the same map in single 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.269
 Write posts if it does not stop 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.709
 finds then 9 entry but we writes 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.660
 really made life easier when 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.730
 her the name if he is already from someone 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.000
 otherwise suggested was simply there 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.290
 wanted high and commented below 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.090
 more there really to say I 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.440
 think with the new city I will then 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.340
 on saturday I already have it 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.110
 Now do not think I head 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.510
 Saturday I have a city ​​skyline stream 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.890
 occurs and then it gives off 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.790
 sunday i already was i have 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.709
 not as many videos to front 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.209
 outbreaks as on sunday on monday 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.470
 it also the new following on youtube 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.410
 as I said I'm a bit sorry 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.900
 that follow by then I believe it 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.849
 follow 102 with the old city back 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.910
 currently very much and that 's already one 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.770
 a bit annoying that's what I want too 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.020
 not like that 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.430
 This is totally stupid for spectators 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.710
 if the further improvement suggestions 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.320
 I have what I'm still up to date 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.730
 can save new map states with mods 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.320
 I will be still reserved 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.450
 maybe I will install with the 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.580
 new map already a few motto that can 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.360
 his 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.180
 I have to but first 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.680
 Left out because I'm scared 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.330
 that I burden my computer even more 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.920
 as already said with the old one 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.090
 city ​​is already overburdened anyway 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.410
 The new city could be up 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.560
 Maybe it will be more relaxed 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.830
 so it makes sense to have a few there 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.880
 but little pugs actually install 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.590
 limit yourself when it comes to the 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.800
 Maps that stop in the comments 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.540
 a bit clearer I stay well 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.250
 hope you have fun in selecting the 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.810
 merckx and then in the new city 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.290
 I'm looking forward to a new city 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.670
 makes numerous starts and then 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.480
 we already have a cool card 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.480
 Many Thanks
