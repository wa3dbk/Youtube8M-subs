hey what's up everyone picked up this
new<00:00:10.280> Schumacher<00:00:11.280> battery<00:00:11.610> charger<00:00:12.090> it's<00:00:12.510> the

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
new Schumacher battery charger it's the

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.529 
new Schumacher battery charger it's the
SC<00:00:14.670> 1208<00:00:15.770> so<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.800> figured<00:00:17.039> I'd<00:00:17.190> do<00:00:18.150> kind<00:00:18.360> of<00:00:18.390> like

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
SC 1208 so I figured I'd do kind of like

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.750 
SC 1208 so I figured I'd do kind of like
review<00:00:18.900> on<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.560> kind<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.310> show<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.520> how<00:00:20.609> it

works

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.750 
works
maybe<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.080> got<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.440> you<00:00:22.590> don't<00:00:22.680> know<00:00:22.890> exactly

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
maybe you got one you don't know exactly

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.070 
maybe you got one you don't know exactly
how<00:00:24.270> it<00:00:24.390> works<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:24.930> but<00:00:26.180> should<00:00:27.180> always<00:00:27.330> refer

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
how it works so but should always refer

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.320 
how it works so but should always refer
to<00:00:28.170> your<00:00:28.260> owner's<00:00:28.530> manual<00:00:29.030> this<00:00:30.030> thing<00:00:30.240> is

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
to your owner's manual this thing is

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.779 
to your owner's manual this thing is
pretty<00:00:30.480> simple<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.200> use<00:00:31.230> but<00:00:31.680> yes<00:00:32.399> things

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:32.789 
pretty simple to use but yes things

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.270 
pretty simple to use but yes things
pretty<00:00:33.059> nice<00:00:33.239> does<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.629> 12<00:00:34.379> volt<00:00:34.620> batteries<00:00:35.070> and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
pretty nice does a 12 volt batteries and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.950 
pretty nice does a 12 volt batteries and
six<00:00:35.520> volt<00:00:35.899> we've<00:00:36.899> got<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.489> 12<00:00:38.489> amp<00:00:38.730> 6<00:00:39.060> amp<00:00:39.300> 3<00:00:39.570> amp

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
six volt we've got a 12 amp 6 amp 3 amp

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.050 
six volt we've got a 12 amp 6 amp 3 amp
I<00:00:39.989> think<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> 6<00:00:40.530> amp<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.890> basically<00:00:41.310> for<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> 6

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
I think the 6 amp is basically for a 6

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.260 
I think the 6 amp is basically for a 6
volt<00:00:42.860> application<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.220> for<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.610> 12<00:00:44.820> volt<00:00:45.030> side

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
volt application so for the 12 volt side

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.780 
volt application so for the 12 volt side
you've<00:00:45.420> got<00:00:45.450> basically<00:00:45.780> 3<00:00:46.320> amp<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.590> 12<00:00:46.800> amp

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
you've got basically 3 amp and 12 amp

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.290 
you've got basically 3 amp and 12 amp
selections<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:51.500> pretty<00:00:52.500> simple<00:00:52.680> display<00:00:53.300> it's

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
selections so pretty simple display it's

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.150 
selections so pretty simple display it's
digital<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:55.170> nice<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.770> thing<00:00:56.010> goes

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
digital it's nice this thing goes

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.440 
digital it's nice this thing goes
conventional<00:00:56.790> and<00:00:56.910> AGM<00:00:57.500> it's<00:00:58.500> got<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
conventional and AGM it's got the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.600 
conventional and AGM it's got the
reverse<00:01:00.450> polarity<00:01:00.930> protection<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.280> all<00:01:02.399> that

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
reverse polarity protection and all that

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.840 
reverse polarity protection and all that
good<00:01:03.239> stuff<00:01:03.379> so<00:01:05.390> alright<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.479> pretty<00:01:06.509> simple

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
good stuff so alright it's pretty simple

good stuff so alright it's pretty simple
like<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.939> said<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.329> any<00:01:09.450> battery<00:01:09.780> charger<00:01:10.139> you

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
like I said with any battery charger you

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.270 
like I said with any battery charger you
want<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> make<00:01:10.530> your<00:01:10.679> connections<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
want to make your connections to the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.910 
want to make your connections to the
battery<00:01:11.549> first<00:01:11.819> positive<00:01:12.450> first<00:01:12.920> negative

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
battery first positive first negative

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.679 
battery first positive first negative
second<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.490> then<00:01:15.359> plug<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.719> in<00:01:17.389> these<00:01:18.389> clamps

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
second and then plug it in these clamps

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.949 
second and then plug it in these clamps
are<00:01:18.869> actually<00:01:19.109> pretty<00:01:19.289> nice<00:01:19.469> too<00:01:20.689> if<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.810> look

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:21.959 
are actually pretty nice too if you look

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:24.289 
are actually pretty nice too if you look
at<00:01:22.170> them<00:01:22.289> they're<00:01:22.819> they're<00:01:23.819> set<00:01:24.029> up<00:01:24.060> pretty

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
at them they're they're set up pretty

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.870 
at them they're they're set up pretty
well<00:01:24.359> for<00:01:24.749> a<00:01:24.810> side<00:01:25.139> terminal<00:01:25.409> battery<00:01:25.880> which

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
well for a side terminal battery which

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.099 
well for a side terminal battery which
is<00:01:26.909> nice<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.329> got<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> side<00:01:27.869> terminal

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
is nice you got a side terminal

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:29.569 
is nice you got a side terminal
sometimes<00:01:28.679> those<00:01:28.859> thing<00:01:29.039> can<00:01:29.189> be<00:01:29.279> a<00:01:29.310> pain

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
sometimes those thing can be a pain

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.559 
sometimes those thing can be a pain
getting<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.149> clamps<00:01:30.450> onto<00:01:32.569> however

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
getting the clamps onto however

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:38.899 
getting the clamps onto however
schumacher<00:01:36.569> does<00:01:36.779> make<00:01:37.020> these<00:01:37.259> uh<00:01:37.909> terminal

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
schumacher does make these uh terminal

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.109 
schumacher does make these uh terminal
charging<00:01:39.299> poles<00:01:39.539> -<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.579> if<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.700> got<00:01:41.819> a<00:01:41.880> side

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
charging poles - so if you got a side

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.399 
charging poles - so if you got a side
terminal<00:01:42.389> battery<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.049> you're<00:01:43.139> having

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
terminal battery and you're having

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.249 
terminal battery and you're having
difficulties<00:01:44.039> getting<00:01:44.069> a<00:01:44.869> charger<00:01:45.869> clamps<00:01:46.229> go

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
difficulties getting a charger clamps go

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.379 
difficulties getting a charger clamps go
on<00:01:46.499> there<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.829> can<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.039> take<00:01:47.310> your<00:01:47.389> the

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:48.389 
on there you can just take your the

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:50.269 
on there you can just take your the
leads<00:01:48.599> off<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.959> battery<00:01:49.319> screw<00:01:49.950> these<00:01:50.069> on

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:50.279 
leads off the battery screw these on

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:54.099 
leads off the battery screw these on
there<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.729> you're<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.479> business

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:58.929 

alright<00:01:55.109> so<00:01:55.289> make<00:01:55.649> your<00:01:55.799> connections

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.620 

positive<00:01:59.939> positive<00:02:00.179> negative<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.929> negative

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
positive positive negative the negative

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:10.330 
positive positive negative the negative
and<00:02:03.859> plug<00:02:04.859> it<00:02:04.979> in

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.089 

so<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.580> kind<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.760> nice<00:02:11.849> about<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.269> is<00:02:13.099> it

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
so it's kind of nice about this is it

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.770 
so it's kind of nice about this is it
gives<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.430> real-time<00:02:14.670> voltage<00:02:15.420> reading

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
gives you a real-time voltage reading

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.229 
gives you a real-time voltage reading
which<00:02:15.959> batteries<00:02:16.739> basically<00:02:17.550> at<00:02:17.879> a<00:02:17.940> full

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
which batteries basically at a full

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.910 
which batteries basically at a full
charge<00:02:18.480> already<00:02:18.870> for<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.140> most<00:02:19.319> part<00:02:20.390> 13<00:02:21.390> 20

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
charge already for the most part 13 20

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.390 
charge already for the most part 13 20
and<00:02:24.620> basically<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.800> use<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.069> you're<00:02:26.280> going

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
and basically to use this you're going

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.620 
and basically to use this you're going
to<00:02:26.459> use<00:02:26.640> your<00:02:26.880> you're<00:02:27.150> going<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.450> select

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
to use your you're going to select

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.190 
to use your you're going to select
between<00:02:27.810> 3<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.380> 12<00:02:29.569> so<00:02:30.569> they<00:02:30.690> push<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.019> once

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
between 3 and 12 so they push it once

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.839 
between 3 and 12 so they push it once
I'd<00:02:31.349> be<00:02:31.440> three<00:02:31.680> push<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.130> again<00:02:32.310> that's<00:02:32.519> 12

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
I'd be three push it again that's 12

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.110 
I'd be three push it again that's 12
we'll<00:02:33.299> set<00:02:33.480> out<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.690> three<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:34.640> then<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.940> pick

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
we'll set out to three and then you pick

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.140 
we'll set out to three and then you pick
between<00:02:36.379> standard<00:02:37.379> or<00:02:37.830> AGM<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.849> go<00:02:38.970> it's

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
between standard or AGM and go it's

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.830 
between standard or AGM and go it's
standard<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:41.160> then<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.459> just<00:02:42.440> does<00:02:43.440> its<00:02:43.650> thing

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
standard and then it just does its thing

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.610 
standard and then it just does its thing
now<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.900> other<00:02:46.110> thing<00:02:46.290> that's<00:02:46.319> nice<00:02:46.560> about

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
now the other thing that's nice about

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.740 
now the other thing that's nice about
this<00:02:46.980> too<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.459> can<00:02:47.610> hook<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.060> up<00:02:48.180> plug<00:02:48.599> it

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
this too is you can hook it up plug it

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.039 
this too is you can hook it up plug it
in<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.140> if<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:49.950> don't<00:02:50.130> pick<00:02:50.370> anything<00:02:51.049> it'll

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
in and if you don't pick anything it'll

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.400 
in and if you don't pick anything it'll
basically<00:02:52.650> just<00:02:52.920> automatically<00:02:54.170> start<00:02:55.170> on

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
basically just automatically start on

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.740 
basically just automatically start on
the<00:02:55.829> 3<00:02:56.069> amp<00:02:56.250> mode<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:56.970> believe<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:57.390> selects

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the 3 amp mode and I believe it selects

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.800 
the 3 amp mode and I believe it selects
the<00:02:57.840> AGM<00:02:58.459> for<00:02:59.459> like<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.060> safest<00:03:00.480> charge<00:03:01.280> so

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
the AGM for like the safest charge so

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.910 
the AGM for like the safest charge so
even<00:03:03.810> if<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:03.989> just<00:03:04.140> make<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.530> connections

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
even if you just make the connections

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.770 
even if you just make the connections
plug<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.340> in<00:03:05.459> it's<00:03:05.849> kind<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.209> like<00:03:06.540> fully

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
plug it in it's kind of like fully

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.240 
plug it in it's kind of like fully
automatic<00:03:07.349> so<00:03:07.560> now<00:03:07.680> it's<00:03:07.829> showing<00:03:08.010> as<00:03:08.220> a

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
automatic so now it's showing as a

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.220 
automatic so now it's showing as a
percentage<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.090> battery's<00:03:09.450> at<00:03:09.599> 97

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
percentage of the battery's at 97

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.250 
percentage of the battery's at 97
percent<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:15.600> other<00:03:15.810> thing<00:03:15.989> that's<00:03:16.139> kind

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
percent so the other thing that's kind

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.940 
percent so the other thing that's kind
of<00:03:16.380> cool<00:03:16.530> about<00:03:16.560> this<00:03:16.920> too<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:18.950> display

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
of cool about this too is the display

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.740 
of cool about this too is the display
won't<00:03:20.340> kind<00:03:20.519> of<00:03:20.579> flash<00:03:20.819> around<00:03:21.030> then<00:03:21.450> after<00:03:21.720> a

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
won't kind of flash around then after a

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.080 
won't kind of flash around then after a
while<00:03:21.930> it'll<00:03:22.380> just<00:03:22.980> kind<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.310> go<00:03:24.030> dormant<00:03:24.980> so

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
while it'll just kind of go dormant so

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.520 
while it'll just kind of go dormant so
basically<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.389> digital<00:03:27.930> display<00:03:28.109> will<00:03:28.410> go

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
basically the digital display will go

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.039 
basically the digital display will go
out<00:03:28.739> just<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.549> let<00:03:29.700> your<00:03:29.819> charge<00:03:30.060> light<00:03:30.299> on<00:03:30.480> so

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
out just to let your charge light on so

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.990 
out just to let your charge light on so
if<00:03:31.139> you<00:03:31.230> want<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.530> check<00:03:31.709> on<00:03:31.950> what's<00:03:32.549> going<00:03:32.880> on

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
if you want to check on what's going on

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.059 
if you want to check on what's going on
you<00:03:33.510> would<00:03:33.660> just<00:03:33.930> push<00:03:34.530> one<00:03:34.769> of<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.950> buttons

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
you would just push one of the buttons

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.620 
you would just push one of the buttons
and<00:03:35.609> it'll<00:03:35.970> bring<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.180> display<00:03:36.600> back<00:03:36.810> on<00:03:37.130> and

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
and it'll bring the display back on and

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.210 
and it'll bring the display back on and
the<00:03:39.630> other<00:03:39.750> thing<00:03:40.019> about<00:03:40.109> this<00:03:40.410> model<00:03:40.650> too<00:03:41.010> is

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
the other thing about this model too is

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.890 
the other thing about this model too is
that<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:42.239> will<00:03:42.540> do<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:43.489> maintenance<00:03:44.489> mode

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
that it will do a a maintenance mode

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.420 
that it will do a a maintenance mode
which<00:03:45.900> makes<00:03:46.380> this<00:03:46.530> thing<00:03:46.739> pretty<00:03:47.040> versatile

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
which makes this thing pretty versatile

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.520 
which makes this thing pretty versatile
in<00:03:47.549> my<00:03:47.700> opinion<00:03:48.150> like<00:03:48.329> you<00:03:49.079> got<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.260> pretty

decent charge rate with your 12 amps you

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.500 
decent charge rate with your 12 amps you
got<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.799> 3<00:03:53.040> amp<00:03:53.160> mode<00:03:53.340> which<00:03:53.549> is<00:03:53.700> cool<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.180> like

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
got the 3 amp mode which is cool to like

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.750 
got the 3 amp mode which is cool to like
to<00:03:55.079> me<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.319> 3<00:03:55.560> up<00:03:55.650> mode<00:03:55.889> is<00:03:56.069> like<00:03:56.250> perfect<00:03:56.700> for

if you got a new battery and you're
looking<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.230> top<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.620> off<00:03:59.150> that's<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.239> great

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
looking to top it off that's a great

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.379 
looking to top it off that's a great
selection<00:04:01.200> right<00:04:01.500> there<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:02.269> the<00:04:03.269> other

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.960 
you don't have to screw around with
picking<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.710> voltage<00:04:23.100> or<00:04:23.250> any<00:04:23.400> of<00:04:23.550> that<00:04:23.580> and

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
picking the voltage or any of that and

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.190 
picking the voltage or any of that and
you<00:04:24.870> do<00:04:25.020> have<00:04:25.170> the<00:04:25.320> ability<00:04:25.350> to<00:04:25.740> charge<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.340> GM

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
you do have the ability to charge a GM

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.780 
you do have the ability to charge a GM
so<00:04:28.200> I<00:04:28.230> mean<00:04:28.440> all<00:04:28.650> in<00:04:28.770> all<00:04:28.890> pretty<00:04:29.220> good<00:04:29.400> charger

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
so I mean all in all pretty good charger

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.000 
so I mean all in all pretty good charger
so<00:04:30.090> like<00:04:30.240> I<00:04:30.360> was<00:04:30.450> saying<00:04:30.510> you<00:04:30.750> know<00:04:30.870> now<00:04:31.830> about

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
so like I was saying you know now about

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.540 
so like I was saying you know now about
this<00:04:32.370> place<00:04:32.610> kind<00:04:32.820> of<00:04:32.880> gone<00:04:33.030> dormant<00:04:33.680> so<00:04:34.680> if

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
this place kind of gone dormant so if

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.820 
this place kind of gone dormant so if
you<00:04:35.730> want<00:04:35.940> to<00:04:36.120> check<00:04:36.630> up<00:04:36.810> on<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:39.560> there<00:04:40.560> you<00:04:40.650> go

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
you want to check up on it there you go

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.270 
you want to check up on it there you go
showing<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.460> 99<00:04:42.390> percent<00:04:44.360> so<00:04:46.100> when<00:04:47.100> it<00:04:47.250> is

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
showing it 99 percent so when it is

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.760 
showing it 99 percent so when it is
fully<00:04:48.240> charged<00:04:48.630> you're<00:04:48.840> going<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.050> see<00:04:49.260> it's

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
fully charged you're going to see it's

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.260 
fully charged you're going to see it's
going<00:04:49.950> to<00:04:50.040> switch<00:04:50.220> over<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.550> a<00:04:50.700> green<00:04:51.030> light

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
going to switch over to a green light

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.000 
going to switch over to a green light
and<00:04:53.030> when<00:04:54.030> it's<00:04:54.180> in<00:04:54.420> that<00:04:54.680> when<00:04:55.680> that<00:04:55.800> green

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
and when it's in that when that green

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.040 
and when it's in that when that green
lights<00:04:56.310> on<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.550> also<00:04:56.940> indicates<00:04:57.540> that<00:04:57.690> it's

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
lights on that also indicates that it's

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.350 
lights on that also indicates that it's
going<00:04:58.260> into<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.650> maintenance<00:04:59.160> mode<00:04:59.370> and<00:05:00.090> one

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
going into a maintenance mode and one

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.970 
going into a maintenance mode and one
thing<00:05:00.510> I<00:05:00.570> notice<00:05:00.840> about<00:05:00.930> this<00:05:01.170> charger<00:05:01.590> is<00:05:01.620> it

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
thing I notice about this charger is it

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.440 
thing I notice about this charger is it
it<00:05:02.970> has<00:05:03.150> a<00:05:03.180> pretty<00:05:03.510> low<00:05:04.640> float<00:05:05.640> on<00:05:05.910> the<00:05:06.030> voltage

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
it has a pretty low float on the voltage

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.350 
it has a pretty low float on the voltage
I<00:05:06.800> think<00:05:07.800> when<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.280> was<00:05:08.370> checking<00:05:08.700> it<00:05:08.910> last<00:05:09.120> time

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
I think when I was checking it last time

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.210 
I think when I was checking it last time
I<00:05:09.390> had<00:05:09.600> it<00:05:09.630> on<00:05:09.780> the<00:05:09.840> Mustang<00:05:10.350> and<00:05:10.560> it<00:05:10.890> was<00:05:11.040> at

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
I had it on the Mustang and it was at

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.420 
I had it on the Mustang and it was at
like<00:05:11.370> 12<00:05:11.700> 70<00:05:12.240> whereas<00:05:13.140> like<00:05:13.410> any<00:05:14.190> of<00:05:14.340> the

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
like 12 70 whereas like any of the

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.190 
like 12 70 whereas like any of the
Schumacher<00:05:14.820> battery<00:05:15.240> maintainer<00:05:15.690> Zhai<00:05:15.990> have

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
Schumacher battery maintainer Zhai have

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.480 
Schumacher battery maintainer Zhai have
they<00:05:16.410> usually<00:05:16.560> float<00:05:17.010> out<00:05:17.190> at<00:05:17.370> about<00:05:17.460> 1330<00:05:18.300> so

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
they usually float out at about 1330 so

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.530 
they usually float out at about 1330 so
that's<00:05:20.490> kind<00:05:20.730> of<00:05:20.760> cool<00:05:20.910> too<00:05:21.120> a<00:05:21.150> little<00:05:21.330> bit

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
that's kind of cool too a little bit

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.720 
that's kind of cool too a little bit
lower<00:05:21.750> voltage<00:05:22.260> I<00:05:22.560> know<00:05:23.130> if<00:05:23.400> that<00:05:23.520> really

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
lower voltage I know if that really

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.250 
lower voltage I know if that really
matters<00:05:24.060> either<00:05:24.300> way<00:05:24.540> but<00:05:26.780> it's<00:05:27.780> kind<00:05:27.960> of<00:05:28.020> nice

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
matters either way but it's kind of nice

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.210 
matters either way but it's kind of nice
a<00:05:28.470> little<00:05:28.680> bit<00:05:28.800> lower<00:05:28.950> of<00:05:29.100> a<00:05:29.160> voltage<00:05:31.220> sail

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
a little bit lower of a voltage sail

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.970 
a little bit lower of a voltage sail
like<00:05:32.370> I<00:05:32.430> said<00:05:32.640> I<00:05:32.670> mean<00:05:32.820> I<00:05:33.470> like<00:05:34.470> this<00:05:34.590> thing<00:05:34.830> I

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
like I said I mean I like this thing I

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.060 
like I said I mean I like this thing I
think<00:05:35.220> this<00:05:35.370> is<00:05:35.490> more<00:05:35.730> of<00:05:35.850> like<00:05:36.680> you<00:05:37.680> know<00:05:37.710> your

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
think this is more of like you know your

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.100 
think this is more of like you know your
general<00:05:38.550> you<00:05:39.450> own<00:05:39.570> a<00:05:39.600> car<00:05:39.870> or<00:05:39.900> a<00:05:40.080> motorcycle

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
general you own a car or a motorcycle

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.230 
general you own a car or a motorcycle
you<00:05:40.830> need<00:05:40.950> a<00:05:40.980> battery<00:05:41.190> charger<00:05:41.760> that's<00:05:41.940> cool

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
you need a battery charger that's cool

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.140 
you need a battery charger that's cool
it's<00:05:42.720> going<00:05:42.840> to<00:05:42.900> work<00:05:43.050> out<00:05:43.230> for<00:05:43.380> that<00:05:43.850> as<00:05:44.850> far

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
it's going to work out for that as far

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.060 
it's going to work out for that as far
as<00:05:45.180> like<00:05:45.300> using<00:05:45.690> it<00:05:45.900> in<00:05:46.020> a<00:05:46.110> shop<00:05:46.350> condition<00:05:46.860> I

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
as like using it in a shop condition I

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.250 
as like using it in a shop condition I
mean<00:05:47.670> you<00:05:48.000> could<00:05:48.240> you<00:05:48.630> could<00:05:48.750> definitely<00:05:48.900> use

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
mean you could you could definitely use

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.910 
mean you could you could definitely use
it<00:05:49.290> in<00:05:49.590> that<00:05:49.800> scenario<00:05:50.040> although<00:05:50.610> I<00:05:51.770> think<00:05:52.770> the

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
it in that scenario although I think the

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.730 
it in that scenario although I think the
peak<00:05:53.160> here<00:05:54.000> you<00:05:54.090> see<00:05:55.070> it's<00:05:56.070> gone<00:05:56.250> green<00:05:56.580> so

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
peak here you see it's gone green so

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.020 
peak here you see it's gone green so
that<00:05:58.740> basically<00:05:58.890> means<00:05:59.130> battery's<00:05:59.730> charged

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
that basically means battery's charged

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.090 
that basically means battery's charged
but<00:06:00.300> it's<00:06:00.450> also<00:06:00.600> going<00:06:01.380> into<00:06:01.680> the<00:06:01.770> maintenance

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
but it's also going into the maintenance

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.800 
but it's also going into the maintenance
mode<00:06:02.280> so<00:06:02.580> I<00:06:02.610> mean<00:06:02.790> you<00:06:02.880> can<00:06:03.030> just<00:06:03.180> you<00:06:03.720> can

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
mode so I mean you can just you can

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.300 
mode so I mean you can just you can
leave<00:06:03.960> this<00:06:04.110> thing<00:06:04.320> on<00:06:04.470> here<00:06:04.620> plugged<00:06:04.950> in<00:06:05.130> it's

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
leave this thing on here plugged in it's

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.480 
leave this thing on here plugged in it's
just<00:06:05.460> going<00:06:05.550> to<00:06:05.640> maintain<00:06:05.850> it<00:06:07.190> but<00:06:08.190> anyways

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
just going to maintain it but anyways

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.670 
just going to maintain it but anyways
going<00:06:08.730> back<00:06:08.910> to<00:06:09.030> what<00:06:09.150> I<00:06:09.180> was<00:06:09.240> saying<00:06:09.480> I<00:06:09.840> think

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
going back to what I was saying I think

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.260 
going back to what I was saying I think
peak<00:06:10.950> charger<00:06:11.490> is<00:06:11.550> kind<00:06:11.790> of<00:06:11.880> have<00:06:12.000> an<00:06:12.120> edge

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
peak charger is kind of have an edge

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.180 
peak charger is kind of have an edge
because<00:06:12.720> the<00:06:13.050> peak<00:06:13.260> Chargers<00:06:13.710> will<00:06:13.920> show<00:06:14.130> you

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
because the peak Chargers will show you

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.810 
because the peak Chargers will show you
like<00:06:14.850> real<00:06:15.090> time<00:06:15.360> amperage<00:06:15.900> and<00:06:16.640> I've<00:06:17.640> had

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
like real time amperage and I've had

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.150 
like real time amperage and I've had
several<00:06:18.090> occasions<00:06:18.660> we're<00:06:18.960> seeing<00:06:19.710> that<00:06:19.890> real

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
several occasions we're seeing that real

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.060 
several occasions we're seeing that real
time<00:06:20.430> amperage<00:06:20.970> has<00:06:21.210> helped<00:06:21.510> me<00:06:22.040> make<00:06:23.040> a

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
time amperage has helped me make a

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.480 
time amperage has helped me make a
battery<00:06:23.580> problem<00:06:24.140> diagnosis<00:06:25.140> just<00:06:25.860> realizing

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
battery problem diagnosis just realizing

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.400 
battery problem diagnosis just realizing
that<00:06:26.520> the<00:06:27.240> battery<00:06:27.570> is<00:06:27.630> not<00:06:27.870> accepting<00:06:28.350> a

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
that the battery is not accepting a

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.490 
that the battery is not accepting a
proper<00:06:28.800> charge<00:06:29.060> so<00:06:30.060> I<00:06:30.360> think<00:06:30.900> that's<00:06:31.200> kind<00:06:31.410> of

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
proper charge so I think that's kind of

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.339 
proper charge so I think that's kind of
one<00:06:31.970> little<00:06:32.970> aspect<00:06:33.270> that<00:06:33.690> would<00:06:33.810> complain

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:34.349 
one little aspect that would complain

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:37.339 
one little aspect that would complain
with<00:06:34.619> this<00:06:34.770> thing<00:06:35.039> which<00:06:35.399> -<00:06:35.819> probably<00:06:36.599> 90%<00:06:37.050> of

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
with this thing which - probably 90% of

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:39.379 
with this thing which - probably 90% of
the<00:06:37.439> people<00:06:37.710> out<00:06:37.800> there<00:06:37.830> it's<00:06:38.189> irrelevant<00:06:38.430> but

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
the people out there it's irrelevant but

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:41.989 
the people out there it's irrelevant but
to<00:06:39.509> me<00:06:39.629> as<00:06:39.839> a<00:06:39.869> technician<00:06:40.349> like<00:06:40.849> trying<00:06:41.849> to

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:41.999 
to me as a technician like trying to

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:43.159 
to me as a technician like trying to
figure<00:06:42.300> out<00:06:42.330> if<00:06:42.569> something's<00:06:42.839> wrong<00:06:42.930> with<00:06:43.080> the

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
figure out if something's wrong with the

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.559 
figure out if something's wrong with the
battery<00:06:43.439> or<00:06:43.589> not<00:06:43.770> that<00:06:44.639> having<00:06:45.059> a<00:06:45.119> real<00:06:45.300> time

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:45.569 
battery or not that having a real time

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:46.909 
battery or not that having a real time
amperage<00:06:45.960> reading<00:06:46.349> is<00:06:46.499> definitely

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
amperage reading is definitely

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.129 
amperage reading is definitely
beneficial<00:06:47.309> to<00:06:47.550> me<00:06:47.669> so<00:06:47.939> I'm<00:06:48.389> kind<00:06:48.869> of<00:06:48.899> going<00:06:49.020> to

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 
beneficial to me so I'm kind of going to

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:50.839 
beneficial to me so I'm kind of going to
crave<00:06:49.409> that<00:06:49.589> on<00:06:49.770> a<00:06:49.800> battery<00:06:50.129> charger<00:06:50.550> just<00:06:50.729> for

00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:09.119 
got the fan built in there so when this

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:10.730 
got the fan built in there so when this
thing<00:07:09.180> is<00:07:09.389> pulling<00:07:09.659> 12<00:07:09.930> amps<00:07:10.289> and<00:07:10.409> it's<00:07:10.529> really

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 
thing is pulling 12 amps and it's really

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.529 
thing is pulling 12 amps and it's really
doing<00:07:11.219> a<00:07:11.309> heavy<00:07:11.459> charge<00:07:11.819> that<00:07:12.059> fan<00:07:12.240> will<00:07:12.389> come

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:12.539 
doing a heavy charge that fan will come

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:14.689 
doing a heavy charge that fan will come
on<00:07:12.689> and<00:07:12.869> keep<00:07:12.959> it<00:07:13.139> cool<00:07:13.349> you<00:07:14.279> know<00:07:14.369> you<00:07:14.459> have

on and keep it cool you know you have
the<00:07:14.789> flexibility<00:07:15.449> to<00:07:15.479> do<00:07:16.050> the<00:07:16.199> AGM<00:07:16.619> battery

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 
the flexibility to do the AGM battery

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:19.159 
the flexibility to do the AGM battery
and<00:07:17.339> at<00:07:18.029> the<00:07:18.149> end<00:07:18.270> of<00:07:18.330> day<00:07:18.479> it's<00:07:18.629> a<00:07:18.689> maintainer

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:19.169 
and at the end of day it's a maintainer

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:21.230

and<00:07:19.409> I<00:07:19.740> love<00:07:19.949> the<00:07:20.069> fact<00:07:20.279> that<00:07:20.399> it's<00:07:20.610> free<00:07:20.849> amp<00:07:21.059> -

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 
and I love the fact that it's free amp -

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.449 
and I love the fact that it's free amp -
like<00:07:21.509> that's<00:07:21.689> great<00:07:22.020> to<00:07:22.830> me<00:07:22.949> I<00:07:22.979> really<00:07:23.249> like<00:07:23.430> a

like that's great to me I really like a

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:25.339 
like that's great to me I really like a
3<00:07:23.789> or<00:07:23.909> 4<00:07:23.939> amp<00:07:24.360> charge<00:07:24.719> I<00:07:24.959> think<00:07:25.169> that's

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:25.349 
3 or 4 amp charge I think that's

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:30.379 
3 or 4 amp charge I think that's
definitely<00:07:26.129> a<00:07:26.459> good<00:07:26.729> way<00:07:27.119> to<00:07:27.180> go<00:07:29.119> say<00:07:30.119> like<00:07:30.300> I
