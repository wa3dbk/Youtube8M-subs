00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 welcome to the next collector 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.160
 We have another interview today 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.290
 especially at the start and that the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.990
 lift people yes every one of you knows 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.990
 support of it meanwhile team elements 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.570
 already a few days here in berlin goes 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.119
 Everything's fine and that's what they're doing 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:29.490
 Preparations for the 1 How are you 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:33.210
 because arrived Berlin was cheaper it 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.800
 is not so much longer you have 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.910
 immediately started to train immediately 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.160
 and there you have yourselves in the first 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.329
 city and her 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.820
 leadership style came later 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.340
 to start slowly in the trade too 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.840
 but exercise more routinely as a 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.399
 live a bit the current euro 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.289
 Preparations from side mainly 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:04.890
 very early or is the soli factor 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:07.200
 still to make analyzes 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.750
 and then on the solo tour hero 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.280
 try what is now nine patch 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.050
 good was like swapping in the forest not 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.310
 more is played a patch 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.320
 time improvement becomes a sandwich 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.490
 already has a little something 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.229
 codemasters like to keep a good eye 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.030
 and you as a supporter is to say the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.890
 Support tenant has also changed drastically 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.550
 changed or is it still relative 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.930
 unchanged 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.270
 Well, I think board is relative 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.650
 stayed the same I think such a count 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.300
 have thus turned up down 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.520
 but the ministers are moving in principle 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.410
 the same ristic rich heroes in 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.850
 you want to see the next season 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.160
 his rankings so to speak now 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.700
 reveal where the islam in things you 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.700
 do not say so yet 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.310
 14 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.160
 could train the scratch as 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.479
 pretty much more on everyone 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.710
 even spoken case and that he 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.899
 also the top team and then actually 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.220
 leaving out with you is like it has become 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.750
 because red until now in the team 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.100
 integrated would you say is up 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.929
 every case has been an update for you 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.060
 or 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:12.120
 I think in any case the fresh 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:18.959
 played minutes and it also have to be good 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:20.670
 about the same way and me 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.130
 think on track 1 team that we 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.750
 all same goal and he plays too 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.790
 relatively much the most of one 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.620
 is pretty high and therefore 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.989
 it fits purely good and everything still 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.610
 motivated by the precise and on the 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.560
 hotline of your energy you 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.780
 mothers from you are actually both 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.190
 not the most aggressive on the street 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.130
 is this 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.230
 so and then also from so you are 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:51.290
 together have become a little more aggressive or 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.290
 still designed for the driving style 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.010
 play games 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:11.640
 It all depends really we turned 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:22.350
 could play really had to show much 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:24.030
 not bad but you think he plays 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.220
 has two to thunder could also 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.740
 not at 10 we have boys playing 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.770
 The components show questions to show 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.450
 we are some new teams in esc 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.280
 is especially the challenger teams 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.870
 next to the whole bus touch and now how 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.730
 Do you want to assess what you have 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.310
 you already have them 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.900
 looked closer how big what for 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.970
 a big crawl the presentation 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.590
 next i think nothing and i think 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.459
 I gained strength 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.500
 so be stronger all over 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.170
 games of the turned on I think 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.290
 this year with also great midfield 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.680
 give where many teams relatively little 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.599
 they then but are then 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.819
 we show you that after the 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.890
 Qualification also many computer scientists 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.569
 how to get the chance the whole hour 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.250
 stopped 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.680
 that's super pretty right numerically 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.380
 the become policy 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.299
 So you do not have a team before 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.570
 you respect most currently has the 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.400
 all as equal opponents 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:31.759
 I think that in the team much stronger 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:35.690
 then I think that too many 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:37.820
 teams are relatively equally strong 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.220
 Do you have a particular offer ? 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.560
 first meters do not matter the most 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.880
 respectful but already before 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.650
 what would you say you go with 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.389
 my most caution off 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.250
 there are some new ones between us 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.870
 many say yes the end is with it 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.759
 awarded will perform extremely well in 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.509
 future which shops do you see there 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:05:01.490
 right now next to you, of course, he 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:08.180
 I think they were all skeptics we go 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:12.880
 always relatively good little relatively strong 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:17.410
 with the nation is after oktoberfest 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:21.380
 is really good 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.000
 Enel plan relatively well but I think 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.340
 the two stinging fans 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.380
 So it has a lot on the format dsds 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.910
 changed names have that one above all 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.980
 less player has twice against 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.050
 every team plays the personal one 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.940
 Will you shoot yourself for change? 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.260
 positive or do you prefer four? 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.080
 had what you had on a team games 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.150
 can adjust to the duration 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.460
 He has two best friends now 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.030
 personally would rather have per software 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.800
 best fries ship fund easy match 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.060
 but there probably is 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.440
 better for the fischer but i think 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.480
 if you play several games in each other 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.480
 the interesting and you have too 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.920
 tactically more if she brings him 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.350
 I remember that after the first game 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.070
 bit different now 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.630
 Stop that for a week 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.990
 that you can prepare a game and 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:11.750
 not a big fan sat down 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:15.860
 and now a two players stop too 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.090
 little something different about the intended 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.910
 probably stop thinking that 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:23.030
 better team anyway and somehow 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:25.760
 There are also these points post 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.260
 lightning so that is now in terms of 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.680
 the world is more important than important 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:33.080
 Fire department would you say that reminds 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.050
 anything about how to get the stream 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.419
 sees split as a team you have previously so 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.430
 a bit looser than that 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:43.330
 Sanskrit or is that he does not care 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.340
 I think so well 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.229
 that the mother with the title was there 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.539
 I'm the last example 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:54.550
 Actually , the teams wanted it first 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:56.860
 be rolled where then was direct 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.289
 after that and everything is packed tight 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.919
 at the barely time to garden if you 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:05.099
 classic table and you have to draw 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:08.560
 gets you look're not fit and 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:10.569
 Which more and more the poster 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.270
 to test if you 're okay and then 

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:15.610
 it has arrived and 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.280
 Now it's not that important anymore 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.710
 the right places and in terms of 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.090
 is on the upcoming split as are 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.949
 your expectations or 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.870
 Your goals really wanted to be natural 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:27.520
 that we are crazy about every team 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.469
 Realistically, your goal really 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.120
 place 1 or are you just now 

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:34.919
 picture with the new adeg first quiet 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.919
 tackle or start directly follow 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:49.060
 can play equally well and if we 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.800
 then better than the then I wish 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.900
 good luck with you maybe 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:57.310
 It will be that both of them in any case 

00:07:52.900 --> 00:08:01.889
 Thank you in the next next split 

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.889
 that you are doing here and we are on it
