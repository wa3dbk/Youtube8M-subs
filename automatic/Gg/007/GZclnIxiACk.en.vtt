00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:12.030
 this is the video presentation 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:15.030
 basic computer course dedicated to 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.600
 computer operation 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.770
 the course is suitable for little users 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.760
 experts as we will not go into 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.850
 ultra-specialist explanations and will be 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.219
 well to help experienced users who 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.280
 they will have a tool to indicate 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.219
 to friends and acquaintances who asked 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.789
 them information on computer science 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.050
 the course wants to provide one 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:48.629
 smattering of basic computer science 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.239
 to the novice user so that 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.780
 he can make the most of the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.510
 possibilities offered by the machine between 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.050
 the other things we will indicate what the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.280
 we will mention hardware and software 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.770
 also to the binary code that comes 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.250
 used by computer language 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.579
 so we 'll say what a beat is what a 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.210
 bytes and what are its multiples 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:21.659
 we'll see what a file is and what they are 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.070
 the main file types that the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.500
 computer uses we will give as well 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:33.240
 directions for ordering files and folders 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:37.079
 in a rational way avoiding a mountain 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:41.130
 of confusion we will also say only what 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.030
 partitions and how to manipulate them then 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.820
 we will mention the operation and 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.520
 to the use of the Internet indicating 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.109
 even the most popular browsers ed 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.670
 used 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:02:00.060
 then we will move on to the rgb and alla technique 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.909
 definition of pixels and as logic 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.270
 consequently we will treat the images 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:10.200
 raster and the vector ones then 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.280
 we will see the most used file types 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.879
 video field in the audio field and finally 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.300
 in the field of service and in office 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:24.540
 last we will mention non file types 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.120
 already treated but which are 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.269
 commonly used 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.660
 in conclusion I hope I can give 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.780
 those basic elements to how many yes 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.440
 find themselves using a computer 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.310
 without knowing anything about computer science 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.310
 Basic
