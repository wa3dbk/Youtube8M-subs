00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:02.010
 he needs from Chicago 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.010
 and then crashed 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.170
 it's natural, I have to say 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.709
 So I have to say 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.740
 Kravitz bring many hours of sunshine Euro and such 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.740
 the team is not in the business 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.279
 this is next to the ORF 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.060
 the Porsche Holding 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.110
 Of course, it is even more difficult for us 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.110
 For me, this is now from a different perspective 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.130
 I have to do it now I do not think you will watch the games 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.290
 Edgar not 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.290
 not so easy 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.450
 and to let know 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.450
 not everyone is one 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.840
 the gt2 category 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.100
 Of course this is the smallest class 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.100
 the differential speed 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 these are big in the games 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.580
 Of course we did not build that much 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.480
 during the protests 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.530
 under then we are of course 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.030
 a whole lot 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.030
 how is that for sure 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.470
 as a liar 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.800
 Schulz Business runtime 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.800
 until now is unclear 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.979
 only so small attitude 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.759
 it is very very difficult to do that 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.759
 Aria broke in 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.239
 a bit more time to test 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.239
 and now are sorted out 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.729
 Until today we were not bad either 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:57.389
 clear at the 24-hour race
