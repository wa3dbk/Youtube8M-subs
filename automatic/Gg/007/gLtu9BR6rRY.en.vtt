00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
one of the three goals yet which is a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.040 
one of the three goals yet which is a
kind<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.790> bit<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.910> letdown<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.690> still

50 kills which you know isn't really the
easiest<00:01:36.570> thing<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.829> know<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.189> is

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
easiest thing but you know it is

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.670 
easiest thing but you know it is
possible<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.150> came<00:01:40.049> close<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> couple

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
possible and came close to it a couple

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.060 
possible and came close to it a couple
times<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.310> know<00:01:41.340> sooner<00:01:41.909> or<00:01:41.939> later<00:01:42.320> I'll<00:01:43.320> end

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
times so I know sooner or later I'll end

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.700 
times so I know sooner or later I'll end
up<00:01:44.189> getting<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.119> think<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.110> best<00:01:46.320> route

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
up getting it but I think the best route

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.069 
up getting it but I think the best route
to<00:01:46.950> run<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.729> something<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
to run for that is something like the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.810 
to run for that is something like the
assault<00:01:49.320> package<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:49.979> sure<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.610> can

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
assault package for sure so I can

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.670 
assault package for sure so I can
actually<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.450> 50<00:01:51.750> kills<00:01:51.960> does<00:01:52.170> 50<00:01:52.439> kills

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
actually get the 50 kills does 50 kills

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.160 
actually get the 50 kills does 50 kills
is<00:01:52.890> really<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> easiest<00:01:53.610> thing<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.270> I'd

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
is really the easiest thing to get I'd

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.200 
is really the easiest thing to get I'd
probably<00:01:55.439> recommend<00:01:55.680> for<00:01:56.430> myself<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.060> this

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
probably recommend for myself to do this

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.819 
probably recommend for myself to do this
or<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.719> want<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.990> try<00:01:58.200> would<00:01:58.409> probably<00:01:58.740> be

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
or if you want to try would probably be

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.359 
or if you want to try would probably be
like<00:01:59.009> domination<00:01:59.759> or<00:01:59.909> kill<00:02:00.479> confirmed<00:02:00.860> us<00:02:01.860> or

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
like domination or kill confirmed us or

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.050 
like domination or kill confirmed us or
like<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.670> game<00:02:02.939> type<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:05.060> the

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
like a game type like that and the

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.029 
like a game type like that and the
assault<00:02:06.390> package<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.229> think<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:07.740> good<00:02:07.920> to

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
assault package but I think it's good to

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.710 
assault package but I think it's good to
use<00:02:08.220> kill<00:02:08.489> streaks<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.239> don't<00:02:09.479> actually

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
use kill streaks that you don't actually

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.900 
use kill streaks that you don't actually
have<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.170> use<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.069> computer<00:02:11.700> doesn't

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
have to use like the computer doesn't

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.040 
have to use like the computer doesn't
for<00:02:12.300> you

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
for you

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.410 
for you
maybe<00:02:13.380> like<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.620> predator<00:02:13.950> maybe<00:02:14.610> like<00:02:14.850> an<00:02:15.000> aah

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
maybe like a predator maybe like an aah

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.890 
maybe like a predator maybe like an aah
6<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.260> maybe<00:02:16.980> like<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> pavelow<00:02:17.550> or<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.750> could

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
6 and maybe like a pavelow or you could

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.840 
6 and maybe like a pavelow or you could
even<00:02:18.990> swap<00:02:19.320> out<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.620> age<00:02:19.710> 64<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.220> Reaper<00:02:20.580> if<00:02:20.700> you

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
even swap out the age 64 a Reaper if you

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.400 
even swap out the age 64 a Reaper if you
really<00:02:21.120> need<00:02:21.270> two<00:02:21.420> kills<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.870> bad<00:02:22.080> because<00:02:22.320> I

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
really need two kills that bad because I

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.170 
really need two kills that bad because I
do<00:02:22.470> think<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.860> Reaper<00:02:23.550> gets<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.820> bit<00:02:24.030> better

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
do think the Reaper gets a bit better

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.720 
do think the Reaper gets a bit better
but<00:02:24.900> if<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.440> do<00:02:25.560> end<00:02:25.800> up<00:02:25.830> dropping<00:02:26.070> 50<00:02:26.520> kills

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
but if you do end up dropping 50 kills

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.130 
but if you do end up dropping 50 kills
chances<00:02:27.180> are<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.390> gonna<00:02:27.510> recycle<00:02:27.690> through

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
chances are you gonna recycle through

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.780 
chances are you gonna recycle through
your<00:02:28.260> streaks<00:02:28.560> more<00:02:28.650> than<00:02:28.950> once<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.400> probably

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
your streaks more than once and probably

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.420 
your streaks more than once and probably
drop<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.150> Moab<00:02:30.480> which<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.710> know<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.100> will<00:02:32.310> get

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
drop on Moab which you know it will get

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.820 
drop on Moab which you know it will get
you<00:02:32.550> some<00:02:32.730> more<00:02:32.850> kills<00:02:33.150> two<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:34.500> I'm<00:02:34.590> still

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
you some more kills two so I'm still

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.590 
you some more kills two so I'm still
trying<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.070> get<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.220> 50<00:02:35.550> k<00:02:35.820> d<00:02:35.880> flawless<00:02:36.210> game

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
trying to get that 50 k d flawless game

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.470 
trying to get that 50 k d flawless game
the<00:02:37.170> next<00:02:37.500> thing<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.950> actually<00:02:38.610> kill<00:02:38.970> base<00:02:39.180> 2

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
the next thing is actually kill base 2

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.000 
the next thing is actually kill base 2
is<00:02:40.400> actually<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.810> double<00:02:42.810> Moab<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.350> then<00:02:43.710> I've

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
is actually a double Moab and then I've

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.980 
is actually a double Moab and then I've
gotten<00:02:44.340> close<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.640> one<00:02:45.000> time<00:02:45.240> I<00:02:45.270> think<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.780> was

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
gotten close to one time I think I was

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.040 
gotten close to one time I think I was
uh<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.470> think<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.340> was<00:02:47.460> all<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.580> got<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.970> 20<00:02:48.660> streak

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
uh I think I was all I got a 20 streak

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.720 
uh I think I was all I got a 20 streak
and<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.290> game<00:02:49.800> ended<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.190> didn't<00:02:50.400> have<00:02:50.520> enough

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
and the game ended I didn't have enough

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.430 
and the game ended I didn't have enough
time<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.000> find<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.450> kills<00:02:51.750> which<00:02:52.110> kind<00:02:52.380> of

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
time to find the kills which kind of

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.680 
time to find the kills which kind of
sucked<00:02:52.770> but<00:02:53.460> uh<00:02:53.490> I<00:02:53.940> want<00:02:54.240> to<00:02:54.270> be<00:02:54.360> able<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.570> get

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
sucked but uh I want to be able to get

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.370 
sucked but uh I want to be able to get
to<00:02:54.870> Moab's<00:02:55.290> in<00:02:55.470> one<00:02:55.680> game<00:02:55.950> which<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:58.080> see

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
to Moab's in one game which is a you see

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.540 
to Moab's in one game which is a you see
those<00:02:58.530> on<00:02:58.680> YouTube<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.370> lot<00:02:59.520> of

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
those on YouTube and a lot of

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.100 
those on YouTube and a lot of
commentators<00:03:00.030> seem<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.420> get<00:03:00.510> them<00:03:00.690> but<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:00.990> just

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
commentators seem to get them but I just

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.600 
commentators seem to get them but I just
haven't<00:03:01.320> found<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> opportunity<00:03:02.340> really<00:03:02.490> for

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
haven't found the opportunity really for

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.360 
haven't found the opportunity really for
myself<00:03:03.210> to<00:03:03.360> get<00:03:03.510> one<00:03:03.770> considering<00:03:04.770> I<00:03:04.860> kind<00:03:05.280> of

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
myself to get one considering I kind of

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.070 
myself to get one considering I kind of
play<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.550> little<00:03:05.760> more<00:03:05.940> slow<00:03:06.270> pace<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.780> get<00:03:06.930> my

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
play a little more slow pace to get my

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.750 
play a little more slow pace to get my
Moab's<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.710> most<00:03:07.860> people<00:03:08.070> I<00:03:08.310> guess<00:03:08.490> you<00:03:08.610> could

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
Moab's and most people I guess you could

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.840 
Moab's and most people I guess you could
say<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:09.530> I<00:03:10.530> just<00:03:11.130> need<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.310> find<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.730> right

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
say but I just need to find the right

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.280

that<00:03:34.260> i'd<00:03:34.350> probably<00:03:34.620> used<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:34.920> probably<00:03:35.160> be

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
that i'd probably used to probably be

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.320 
that i'd probably used to probably be
like<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.610> ACR<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.780> mp7<00:03:37.080> or<00:03:37.980> like<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.580> PP<00:03:38.880> 90

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
or something like that I'm guessing

somewhere along those guns are the guns

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.270 
somewhere along those guns are the guns
i'll<00:03:43.080> probably<00:03:43.290> end<00:03:43.410> up<00:03:43.590> getting<00:03:43.950> out<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.190> the

streaks i'm not sure what it is i'm

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.520 
streaks i'm not sure what it is i'm
gonna<00:04:45.330> have<00:04:45.599> to<00:04:45.720> probably<00:04:45.870> end<00:04:46.110> up<00:04:46.139> running<00:04:46.349> a

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
gonna have to probably end up running a

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.379 
gonna have to probably end up running a
salt<00:04:46.800> which<00:04:47.039> i<00:04:47.190> will<00:04:47.490> be<00:04:47.610> using<00:04:47.789> if<00:04:48.090> I'm<00:04:48.240> going

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
salt which i will be using if I'm going

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.180 
salt which i will be using if I'm going
for<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.660> hundred-plus<00:04:49.080> kills<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:49.710> was

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
for the hundred-plus kills I was

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.710 
for the hundred-plus kills I was
thinking<00:04:50.460> maybe<00:04:50.550> ground<00:04:51.030> war<00:04:51.360> because<00:04:51.599> I

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
thinking maybe ground war because I

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.570 
thinking maybe ground war because I
don't<00:04:51.900> ever<00:04:52.139> really<00:04:52.500> play<00:04:52.800> ground<00:04:53.099> war<00:04:53.190> at<00:04:53.460> all

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
don't ever really play ground war at all

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.279 
don't ever really play ground war at all
so<00:04:54.270> I'm<00:04:54.360> thinking<00:04:54.660> I<00:04:54.720> might<00:04:54.750> have<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.139> try

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
so I'm thinking I might have to try

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.689 
so I'm thinking I might have to try
ground<00:04:55.680> war<00:04:55.860> 0<00:04:55.889> to<00:04:56.099> try<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:56.430> get<00:04:56.520> this<00:04:56.639> a

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
ground war 0 to try and get this a

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.270 
ground war 0 to try and get this a
hundred<00:04:56.940> kill<00:04:57.330> game<00:04:57.860> because<00:04:58.860> it's<00:04:58.979> gonna<00:04:59.130> be

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
hundred kill game because it's gonna be

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.100 
hundred kill game because it's gonna be
killed<00:04:59.550> or<00:04:59.789> it's<00:05:00.000> gonna<00:05:00.060> be<00:05:00.240> hard<00:05:00.479> to<00:05:00.569> find<00:05:00.870> a

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
killed or it's gonna be hard to find a

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.680 
killed or it's gonna be hard to find a
hundred<00:05:01.919> enemies<00:05:02.250> to<00:05:02.490> kill<00:05:03.030> in<00:05:03.150> one<00:05:03.360> game<00:05:03.659> you

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
hundred enemies to kill in one game you

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.980 
hundred enemies to kill in one game you
don't<00:05:03.990> see<00:05:04.229> that<00:05:04.259> 100<00:05:05.159> plus<00:05:05.400> game<00:05:06.060> happen<00:05:06.840> very

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
don't see that 100 plus game happen very

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.339 
don't see that 100 plus game happen very
often<00:05:07.259> but<00:05:07.650> uh<00:05:08.750> those<00:05:09.750> are<00:05:09.960> my<00:05:10.199> three

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
often but uh those are my three

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.879 
often but uh those are my three
challenges<00:05:10.919> so<00:05:11.159> 5043<00:05:11.909> on<00:05:12.180> all<00:05:12.360> of<00:05:12.479> them<00:05:12.889> I

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
challenges so 5043 on all of them I

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.070 
challenges so 5043 on all of them I
don't<00:05:14.849> know<00:05:14.909> why<00:05:15.120> I<00:05:15.150> made<00:05:15.539> them<00:05:15.750> I<00:05:15.900> just

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
don't know why I made them I just

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.270 
don't know why I made them I just
thought<00:05:16.199> they<00:05:16.380> were<00:05:16.440> cool<00:05:16.680> things<00:05:17.039> that<00:05:17.159> I

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
thought they were cool things that I

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.550 
thought they were cool things that I
could<00:05:17.490> do<00:05:17.699> considering<00:05:18.569> I've<00:05:18.810> done<00:05:19.020> all<00:05:19.259> three

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
could do considering I've done all three

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.499 
could do considering I've done all three
of<00:05:19.590> them<00:05:19.800> in<00:05:20.069> the<00:05:20.490> past<00:05:20.669> call<00:05:20.909> of<00:05:21.030> duty's<00:05:21.270> even

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
of them in the past call of duty's even

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.089 
of them in the past call of duty's even
though<00:05:21.599> you<00:05:21.690> can't<00:05:21.900> really<00:05:22.050> do<00:05:22.409> a<00:05:22.440> double<00:05:22.770> Moab

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
though you can't really do a double Moab

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:24.860 
though you can't really do a double Moab
and<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.400> other<00:05:23.520> ones<00:05:23.759> but<00:05:24.270> I<00:05:24.569> did<00:05:24.720> get<00:05:24.810> a

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
and the other ones but I did get a

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.899 
and the other ones but I did get a
double<00:05:25.139> nuke<00:05:25.289> got<00:05:25.830> triple<00:05:26.190> nuke<00:05:26.340> actually<00:05:26.729> one

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
double nuke got triple nuke actually one

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:30.560 
double nuke got triple nuke actually one
