with<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.740> new<00:01:16.920> carburetor<00:01:17.280> i<00:01:17.520> don't<00:01:17.729> know

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
with this new carburetor i don't know

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.870 
with this new carburetor i don't know
how<00:01:17.970> well<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> choke<00:01:18.479> works<00:01:19.400> we<00:01:20.400> tried<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.670> one

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
how well the choke works we tried it one

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
how well the choke works we tried it one
time<00:01:20.909> before<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:22.200> took<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.409> long<00:01:22.619> time<00:01:22.680> but

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
time before it took a long time but

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.440 
time before it took a long time but
that's<00:01:23.280> because<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.640> was<00:01:23.729> brand<00:01:23.970> new<00:01:24.090> never

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
that's because it was brand new never

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.569 
that's because it was brand new never
had<00:01:24.659> any<00:01:24.840> gas<00:01:25.020> run<00:01:25.290> through<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.790> so<00:01:28.400> figure<00:01:29.400> to

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
had any gas run through it so figure to

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:37.460 
had any gas run through it so figure to
try<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.880> as<00:01:30.750> well<00:01:31.020> Oh<00:01:32.869> three<00:01:33.869> pumps<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.290> guess

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:46.640 

fired<00:01:38.160> right<00:01:38.430> up<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.880> go<00:01:39.470> that's<00:01:40.470> why

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.470 

not<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.580> I<00:01:47.670> got<00:01:47.700> something<00:01:48.120> rubbing<00:01:48.390> up
