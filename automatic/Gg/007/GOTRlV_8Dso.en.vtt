thousand<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:27.320> problem<00:03:27.680> is<00:03:27.769> when<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.070> do<00:03:28.250> tnt

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
thousand the problem is when you do tnt

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.610 
thousand the problem is when you do tnt
explosions<00:03:29.269> you<00:03:29.870> have<00:03:29.989> to<00:03:30.110> make<00:03:30.260> sure<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.500> get

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
explosions you have to make sure you get

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.590 
explosions you have to make sure you get
underneath<00:03:30.980> so<00:03:31.400> I<00:03:31.459> dug<00:03:31.790> like<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.090> lot<00:03:32.239> of<00:03:32.360> holes

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
underneath so I dug like a lot of holes

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.199 
underneath so I dug like a lot of holes
underneath<00:03:33.140> and<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:34.340> know<00:03:34.430> tunnels<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:35.120> then

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
underneath and you know tunnels and then

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.030 
underneath and you know tunnels and then
I<00:03:35.299> went<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.510> straight<00:03:35.840> up<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.290> this<00:03:36.739> is<00:03:36.890> the

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
I went it straight up and this is the

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.890 
I went it straight up and this is the
result<00:03:37.220> I'm<00:03:37.970> gonna<00:03:38.269> see<00:03:38.420> if<00:03:38.450> I<00:03:38.600> can<00:03:38.750> keep

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
result I'm gonna see if I can keep

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.930 
result I'm gonna see if I can keep
