know<00:04:26.380> I<00:04:27.380> used<00:04:27.860> to<00:04:27.980> have<00:04:28.100> long<00:04:28.280> hair<00:04:28.600> so<00:04:29.600> this<00:04:30.170> is

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
know I used to have long hair so this is

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
know I used to have long hair so this is
last<00:04:31.130> winter<00:04:31.580> was<00:04:32.450> I<00:04:32.780> was<00:04:32.990> bald<00:04:33.430> completely

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
last winter was I was bald completely

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.330 
last winter was I was bald completely
this<00:04:35.150> year<00:04:35.420> I<00:04:35.450> have<00:04:35.840> hair<00:04:36.050> as<00:04:36.950> you<00:04:37.040> can<00:04:37.190> tell

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
this year I have hair as you can tell

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.570 
this year I have hair as you can tell
but<00:04:38.000> I'm<00:04:38.660> not<00:04:38.840> used<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.200> not<00:04:39.590> being<00:04:39.980> able<00:04:40.130> to<00:04:40.280> be

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
but I'm not used to not being able to be

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.330 
but I'm not used to not being able to be
warm<00:04:40.930> so<00:04:42.940> I<00:04:44.770> guess<00:04:45.770> it<00:04:45.890> does<00:04:46.010> really<00:04:46.160> matter

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
warm so I guess it does really matter

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.060 
warm so I guess it does really matter
which<00:04:46.640> one's<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:47.000> front<00:04:47.320> but<00:04:48.320> here's<00:04:48.770> on<00:04:48.920> the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
which one's the front but here's on the

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.010 
which one's the front but here's on the
back<00:04:49.370> like<00:04:49.940> I'm<00:04:50.180> guessing<00:04:50.600> this<00:04:50.660> is<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:50.870> back

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
back like I'm guessing this is the back

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.390 
back like I'm guessing this is the back
plus<00:04:51.560> a<00:04:51.590> little<00:04:51.770> respect

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
plus a little respect

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.260 
plus a little respect
and<00:04:52.550> then<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:52.940> front<00:04:53.150> so<00:04:54.020> let's<00:04:54.170> try<00:04:54.350> it<00:04:54.410> on

SummerSlam

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.400 
SummerSlam
but<00:05:47.540> then<00:05:47.660> remembered<00:05:47.930> on<00:05:48.050> scene<00:05:48.229> and<00:05:48.350> got

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
but then remembered on scene and got

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.480 
but then remembered on scene and got
hurt<00:05:48.620> so<00:05:49.310> he<00:05:49.910> couldn't<00:05:50.570> debut<00:05:51.260> it<00:05:51.410> so<00:05:52.280> that's

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
hurt so he couldn't debut it so that's

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.400 
hurt so he couldn't debut it so that's
why<00:05:52.700> and<00:05:53.030> when<00:05:53.330> he<00:05:53.360> debuted<00:05:53.720> it<00:05:53.840> they<00:05:54.050> I<00:05:54.229> guess

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
why and when he debuted it they I guess

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.460 
why and when he debuted it they I guess
they<00:05:54.530> didn't<00:05:54.800> change<00:05:54.950> the<00:05:55.220> 11<00:05:55.580> to<00:05:55.669> 12<00:05:55.910> so<00:05:59.470> it's

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
they didn't change the 11 to 12 so it's

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.730 
they didn't change the 11 to 12 so it's
exactly<00:06:01.150> I<00:06:02.150> guess<00:06:03.080> I<00:06:03.169> should<00:06:03.320> show<00:06:03.350> you<00:06:03.530> guys
