00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.500
The choral begins,
without introduction

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.600
with the first tune
"In dulci jubilo"

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.580
transition

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.370
"Nun singet
und seid froh"

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.710
transition

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.750
"Unsres Herzens
Wonne"

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.750
or was all of it
a transition?

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.780
No, the movement
of the transition

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.980
is continued
with the melody

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.670
Flowing like water. The
scales up and down

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.060
The notes of melody
and accompaniment

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.720
seem to come out
of the movement

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.100
but the tune
can hardly be heard

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.270
because of this
"amazing variation"

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.370
so it would have
been better

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.770
Bach chooses
another way with

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.770
the accompaniment
of the first row

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.160
"In dulci jubilo"

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.570
On the
penultimate chord

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.280
a sharp dissonance
passing to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.980
c# minor

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.920
It sounds, as if Bach
wanted to compose

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.310
- by means of music -

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.810
behind the lyrics
of "In dulci jubilo"

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.450
a question mark

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.540
For the listener
in this point

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.590
the surprising
accompaniment chords

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.890
are confusing

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.460
so it would have
been easier
