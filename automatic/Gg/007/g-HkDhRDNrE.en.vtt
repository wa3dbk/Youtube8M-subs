it's in a joint
it's<00:00:23.070> an<00:00:23.130> adjoint<00:00:23.490> it's<00:00:23.640> not<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> muscle<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.510> on

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
it's an adjoint it's not a muscle so on

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.849 
it's an adjoint it's not a muscle so on
okay<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.830> uh<00:00:26.390> push-ups<00:00:27.390> work<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.529> chest

okay so just uh push-ups work the chest

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.849 
okay so just uh push-ups work the chest
pushing<00:00:29.730> muscle<00:00:30.420> front<00:00:30.869> pushing<00:00:31.710> muscles

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
pushing muscle front pushing muscles

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.590 
pushing muscle front pushing muscles
front<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.399> body<00:00:32.520> pushing<00:00:33.030> chains<00:00:33.360> so

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
front of the body pushing chains so

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.360 
front of the body pushing chains so
obviously<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.590> thing<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:34.890> really<00:00:34.920> need<00:00:35.280> to

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
obviously the thing we really need to

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.220 
obviously the thing we really need to
think<00:00:35.399> about<00:00:35.610> here<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.750> course<00:00:36.930> your<00:00:37.050> back

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
think about here is of course your back

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.950 
think about here is of course your back
your<00:00:38.160> back<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.090> key<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.480> making<00:00:39.660> all<00:00:39.930> of

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
your back is the key to making all of

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.229 
your back is the key to making all of
this<00:00:40.170> happen<00:00:40.230> because<00:00:40.890> where<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.910> get<00:00:42.210> your

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
this happen because where you get your

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.350 
this happen because where you get your
shoulders<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.469> your<00:00:44.100> shoulder<00:00:44.550> blades<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
shoulders and your shoulder blades and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.290 
shoulders and your shoulder blades and
everything<00:00:46.170> set<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:47.090> entirely<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
everything set is entirely the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.639 
everything set is entirely the
foundation<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.710> how<00:00:50.370> all<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:51.649> works

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
foundation for how all of this works

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.889 
foundation for how all of this works
okay<00:00:53.399> now<00:00:53.789> there's<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.180> couple<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.480> ways<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.780> can

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
okay now there's a couple of ways we can

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.990 
okay now there's a couple of ways we can
do<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.050> number<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.800> practice<00:00:56.579> against<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
do this number one is practice against a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.049 
do this number one is practice against a
wall<00:00:57.260> not<00:00:58.260> doing<00:00:58.649> push-ups<00:00:58.920> against<00:00:59.399> wall<00:00:59.579> but

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
wall not doing push-ups against wall but

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.689 
wall not doing push-ups against wall but
put<00:01:00.329> your<00:01:00.480> back<00:01:00.809> against<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> wall<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.100> do

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
put your back against the wall and do

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.090 
put your back against the wall and do
and<00:01:03.210> press<00:01:03.570> forward<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.320> if<00:01:04.500> you're<00:01:04.769> kind<00:01:04.979> of

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
and press forward as if you're kind of

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.789 
and press forward as if you're kind of
doing<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.430> shadow<00:01:05.670> push-up<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:07.439> will<00:01:07.619> tell

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
doing a shadow push-up this will tell

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:08.840 
doing a shadow push-up this will tell
you<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:07.979> you've<00:01:08.100> got<00:01:08.250> any<00:01:08.430> extraneous

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
you if you've got any extraneous

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
up all these sorts of things that's

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.260 
up all these sorts of things that's
ideally<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.890> got<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> flat<00:01:17.580> upper<00:01:18.090> back

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
against the wall throughout the full

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.190 
against the wall throughout the full
range<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.369> motion<00:01:20.490> from<00:01:21.180> there<00:01:21.390> get<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.960> down

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
range of motion from there get it down

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.679 
range of motion from there get it down
on<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.530> floor<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.950> again<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.369> recommend<00:01:23.689> start

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
shoulders down and back with your lats a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.609 
shoulders down and back with your lats a
lot<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.210> times<00:01:33.390> people<00:01:33.750> think<00:01:33.780> lats<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.500> they

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
lot of times people think lats and they

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.789 
lot of times people think lats and they
think<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.790> wide<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.780> spread<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
think like like wide like spread the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.530 
think like like wide like spread the
lats<00:01:38.070> are<00:01:38.280> actually<00:01:38.759> designed<00:01:39.119> at<00:01:39.240> getting

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
lats are actually designed at getting

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.810 
lats are actually designed at getting
things<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.829> down

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
things in and down

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.319 
things in and down
compact<00:01:42.720> its<00:01:43.500> height<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:44.880> not<00:01:45.060> about

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
compact its height so it's not about

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.899 
compact its height so it's not about
doing<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.320> because<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.770> do<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.520> kind<00:01:47.820> of

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
doing this because if I do this kind of

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.179 
doing this because if I do this kind of
thing<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.270> my<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.720> my<00:01:48.810> lats<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:49.710> all<00:01:49.950> up

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
