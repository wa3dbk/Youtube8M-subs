00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.330
 easy achievement I'm going to make the achievement of 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.850
 mine drive that is an achievement of 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.320
 missions of north ras is here that 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.270
 consists of suffering 10 explosions 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.480
 consecutive landmines in the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.900
 minefield in box spark plugs without 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.099
 to land 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.449
 and they want to build a mine to another 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.340
 chafas a mine throws you for the beings 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:37.900
 this achievement is north 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.610
 in the stormy peaks here in the 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.860
 south to the left of camp k 3 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.850
 that where missions give you 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:49.060
 Minefield coordinates are 3500 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.760
 87 50 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.180
 and it is an achievement that what consists is in 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.220
 have bad luck 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.820
 doing the mission that they give you is usually 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.410
 do 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.410
 unless you come with a lot 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.310
 Well, what I'm going to do for 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.120
 try to do achievement this is to get into 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.350
 the minefield 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.350
 the center that can 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.030
 and to see 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.530
 in principle with the flying mount is 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.880
 easier I do not understand why why not 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.680
 lets you fly once they throw you 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.730
 the air but good 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.730
 and I'm going to jump 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.190
 one that they take me out of the minefield 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.830
 has already sent us more please 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.670
 - another try 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.110
 runner 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.439
 you end up with a crazy guy like that 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.560
 look look at all the mines that 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.930
 they try to do it 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.310
 good after making this achievement 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.690
 here I do it again 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.560
 and in quotes - more thanks for 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.760
 to explode now that I did not want to 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.760
 do it they kept exploding 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.379
 I hope the achievement serves you have already 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.680
 seen that it has a technique used 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.680
 A technique 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.530
 that it is impossible to fail the jump in 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.010
 a mine we will see to see what happens if 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:51.000
 I start there are from which shades a 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.730
 extra mine feels like it has four seconds 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.190
 that is, with that achievement is made 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.070
 it is usually done alone but miami today 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.050
 I did not want to do it because I hope the 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.740
 video serve us like it and thank you very much 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.740
 for having seen it
