consistent all the time so we want to
set<00:00:44.930> one<00:00:44.960> jig<00:00:45.530> that<00:00:46.070> we<00:00:46.190> can<00:00:46.309> just<00:00:46.489> set<00:00:46.730> and<00:00:46.969> use

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
set one jig that we can just set and use

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.180 
set one jig that we can just set and use
it<00:00:47.420> now<00:00:47.629> I<00:00:47.899> have<00:00:48.050> used<00:00:48.320> all<00:00:48.590> sorts<00:00:48.620> of<00:00:49.010> things

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
finally came across this tapering jig

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.700 
finally came across this tapering jig
right<00:00:52.969> here<00:00:53.120> which<00:00:53.539> i<00:00:53.690> think<00:00:53.750> is<00:00:54.050> great<00:00:54.230> you

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
right here which i think is great you

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.470 
right here which i think is great you
know<00:00:54.829> it<00:00:55.010> looks<00:00:55.219> daunting<00:00:55.520> but<00:00:55.910> trust<00:00:56.149> me<00:00:56.239> it's

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
know it looks daunting but trust me it's

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.819 
know it looks daunting but trust me it's
really<00:00:56.989> really<00:00:57.379> simple

really really simple

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.799 
really really simple
now<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.219> way<00:00:58.489> this<00:00:58.670> jig<00:00:58.940> works<00:00:59.149> is<00:00:59.600> that<00:00:59.719> it

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
now the way this jig works is that it

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.560 
now the way this jig works is that it
has<00:00:59.899> a<00:00:59.930> pivot<00:01:00.199> point<00:01:00.559> here<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:01.070> right<00:01:01.430> here<00:01:01.670> we

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
has a pivot point here and right here we

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.389 
has a pivot point here and right here we
have<00:01:02.690> another<00:01:02.840> knob<00:01:03.079> that<00:01:03.620> makes<00:01:03.920> it<00:01:04.070> really

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
have another knob that makes it really

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.670 
have another knob that makes it really
easily<00:01:04.789> adjustable<00:01:05.570> now<00:01:05.960> another<00:01:06.350> cool<00:01:06.619> thing

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
easily adjustable now another cool thing

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.160 
easily adjustable now another cool thing
about<00:01:06.950> this<00:01:07.220> particular<00:01:07.460> piece<00:01:07.789> it<00:01:08.600> has<00:01:08.630> a<00:01:08.780> set

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
about this particular piece it has a set

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.230 
about this particular piece it has a set
of<00:01:09.289> numbers<00:01:09.619> that's<00:01:09.800> rise<00:01:10.160> and<00:01:10.429> run<00:01:10.550> all<00:01:10.970> you

I just have to loosen it up slide them
on<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:01.970> lock<00:02:02.810> her<00:02:02.929> down<00:02:03.489> since<00:02:04.489> it's<00:02:04.670> so<00:02:04.789> wide

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
on and lock her down since it's so wide

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.559 
on and lock her down since it's so wide
it<00:02:05.509> has<00:02:05.629> enough<00:02:05.959> room<00:02:06.050> for<00:02:06.349> two<00:02:07.129> of<00:02:07.429> these<00:02:08.000> push

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
it has enough room for two of these push

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.860 
it has enough room for two of these push
blocks<00:02:09.610> put<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.700> in<00:02:10.759> place<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.540> lock<00:02:11.720> them

blocks put it in place and lock them

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.430 
blocks put it in place and lock them
down<00:02:13.360> that's<00:02:14.360> cool<00:02:14.630> now<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:14.960> way<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.320> it

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
down that's cool now the way that it

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.260 
down that's cool now the way that it
works<00:02:15.650> is<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.190> as<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.400> hook<00:02:16.670> right<00:02:16.970> here<00:02:17.150> on

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
works is that as a hook right here on

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.450 
works is that as a hook right here on
the<00:02:17.360> back<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.920> hook<00:02:18.920> is

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
the back and that hook is

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.460 
the back and that hook is
a<00:02:19.490> hook<00:02:19.790> right<00:02:20.030> on<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.360> back<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.840> my<00:02:21.140> piece<00:02:21.320> of

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
a hook right on the back of my piece of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.350 
a hook right on the back of my piece of
plywood<00:02:23.500> right<00:02:24.500> like<00:02:24.710> so<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.090> last<00:02:26.240> thing

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
plywood right like so so the last thing
