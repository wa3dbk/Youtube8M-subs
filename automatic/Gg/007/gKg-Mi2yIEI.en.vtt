 breasts that already come clean if 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.420
 you want to have in the freezer that is 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.680

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.080
 a multitude of recipes with breasts 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.620
 so I put an end to them 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.650
 transparent you leave them whole 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.020
 after defrosting defrost with 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.270
 cool purchases and you're removing 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.670
 and you have them individualized is 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.010
 very comfortable you can feel it to the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.350
 iron and has them always sold in 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.260
 our fridge freezer 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.180
 these stops to cook if we have 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.690
 talked about the time of seeing to work or 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.550
 from the street and it turns out that as 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.870
 that you do not know thawed you can 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.880
 put a little microwave 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:19.930
 defrost and now let's see the 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.930
 ingredients are very few uncles 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.960
 and 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.720
 these are the breasts are you going to have 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.700
 use a can of liquid cream that 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.240
 we have commented previously is 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.330
 preferable that it be to ride in a 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.920
 about that seems to put the brand 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.370
 that you want valverde in all 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.230
 the parties supermarkets pop half 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.730
 that I think are juicier if not 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.540
 you tell the butcher if you want 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:57.760
 we try 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:59.890
 this makes it strong from oven you have to 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.330
 prepare in one because this is going 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:09.850
 directly as we can feed a 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.780
 little things we can take our 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.780
 nazca boat 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.659
 all right 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.610
 with this recipe you can do more 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.970
 amount not passionate and about if 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.970
 they can go back 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.680
 you can make a sandwich san luis for 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.680
 take to work 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:41.430
 and now we put on the onion 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.299
 for surface min 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.510
 Preheat the oven to full power 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.510
 250 degrees 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.400
 it will take approximately 12 to 15 minutes 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.130
 depends on the thickness of the breasts that 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.590
 it watches it is a little bit puts our 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.610
 watch us because if not always we 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.250
 we forget about the things we have 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.750
 inside the oven and it said recently 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.840
 We are going to check it if you see that 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.360
 golden state our top is 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.280
 for is to give him some more time and they are already 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.280
 lists as you see is super fast 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.800
 two 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.190
 and our plate 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.120
 then assigned the clock we turn off the 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.120
 oven because I think 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.820
 look 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.100
 what looks more magnificent than magnificent 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.720
 cooks or cooks be careful 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.990
 because the breasts and if you spend a 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.490
 little because they can be dry you know 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.660
 that all foods are determined 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.840
 for cooking a little more 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.310
 we have divided in half because it ends 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.130
 by 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.200
 neither can there be any doubt because a 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.290
 chicken you have to cook it well is 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.230
 important to cook the chicken well because 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.080
 they are meat says dangerous they can us 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.900
 induce to host salmonella 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.940
 so I think it 's ready after 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.510
 we have adorned it to present it in 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.510
 our table 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.890
 ah 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:37.529
 do not
