and kills you right away and I and it

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.430 
and kills you right away and I and it
runs<00:00:30.920> in<00:00:31.130> circles<00:00:31.460> and<00:00:32.029> it<00:00:32.629> kind<00:00:32.960> of<00:00:33.050> gets<00:00:33.260> you

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
runs in circles and it kind of gets you

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.660 
runs in circles and it kind of gets you
like<00:00:33.680> that<00:00:34.100> so<00:00:34.640> I<00:00:35.440> personally<00:00:36.440> I<00:00:36.680> think<00:00:36.950> and

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
like that so I personally I think and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.940 
like that so I personally I think and
the<00:00:37.940> Wolfman<00:00:38.270> is<00:00:38.420> take<00:00:38.600> off<00:00:38.810> camouflage

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
the Wolfman is take off camouflage

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
the Wolfman is take off camouflage
I<00:00:39.980> think<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:41.000> wolf<00:00:41.210> is<00:00:41.480> more<00:00:42.400> being<00:00:43.400> a<00:00:43.520> ranger

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
I think the wolf is more being a ranger

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.880 
I think the wolf is more being a ranger
cover<00:00:44.630> since<00:00:44.930> I<00:00:46.210> think<00:00:47.210> I<00:00:47.600> think<00:00:48.020> wolf<00:00:48.410> is<00:00:48.649> more

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
cover since I think I think wolf is more

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.620 
cover since I think I think wolf is more
dangerous<00:00:49.430> than<00:00:49.489> I<00:00:49.910> think<00:00:50.239> I'm<00:00:50.329> gonna<00:00:50.450> keep

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
dangerous than I think I'm gonna keep

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.240 
dangerous than I think I'm gonna keep
camouflage<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:51.290> take<00:00:51.440> off<00:00:51.590> cover<00:00:51.800> scent

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
camouflage and take off cover scent

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.220 
camouflage and take off cover scent
