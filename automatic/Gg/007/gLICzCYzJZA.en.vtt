you<00:03:04.190> can<00:03:04.310> raise<00:03:04.520> it<00:03:04.550> this<00:03:04.940> is<00:03:05.060> in<00:03:06.190> contrast<00:03:07.190> to

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
you can raise it this is in contrast to

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.729 
you can raise it this is in contrast to
some<00:03:07.489> of<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.640> earlier<00:03:07.940> editions<00:03:08.209> of<00:03:08.739> SimCity

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
some of the earlier editions of SimCity

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.290 
some of the earlier editions of SimCity
when<00:03:10.130> there<00:03:10.250> was<00:03:10.370> only<00:03:10.489> really<00:03:10.880> one<00:03:11.000> way<00:03:11.060> to

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
when there was only really one way to

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.270 
when there was only really one way to
raise<00:03:11.600> land<00:03:14.530> I'd<00:03:15.530> say<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.860> was<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:15.980> little<00:03:16.130> bit

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
raise land I'd say that was a little bit

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.300 
raise land I'd say that was a little bit
too<00:03:16.430> much<00:03:16.640> you<00:03:16.880> can<00:03:17.320> lower<00:03:18.320> it<00:03:18.530> like<00:03:18.709> that<00:03:18.920> oops

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
too much you can lower it like that oops

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.830 
too much you can lower it like that oops
I<00:03:19.580> made<00:03:19.700> alike

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
I made alike

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.250 
I made alike
right<00:03:21.910> now<00:03:22.910> what<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.090> wanted<00:03:23.269> to<00:03:23.360> do<00:03:23.480> is<00:03:23.720> make<00:03:23.750> a

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
right now what I wanted to do is make a

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:31.900 
right now what I wanted to do is make a
river<00:03:26.349> so<00:03:28.959> let<00:03:29.959> make<00:03:30.140> it<00:03:30.260> like<00:03:30.440> this<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:31.760> see

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
river so let make it like this you see

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.509 
river so let make it like this you see
how<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.150> makes<00:03:32.300> it<00:03:32.450> into<00:03:32.629> a<00:03:32.660> canyon<00:03:33.190> it's<00:03:34.190> very

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
how it makes it into a canyon it's very

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:45.820 
how it makes it into a canyon it's very
cool<00:03:38.709> yes<00:03:39.709> in<00:03:41.410> SimCity<00:03:42.430> 2000<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:43.629> 3000<00:03:44.830> there

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
cool yes in SimCity 2000 and 3000 there

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.050 
cool yes in SimCity 2000 and 3000 there
were<00:03:46.640> ways<00:03:46.879> to<00:03:48.310> have<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:49.340> river<00:03:49.730> put

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
were ways to have a river put

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.900 
were ways to have a river put
automatically<00:03:50.720> into<00:03:50.959> your<00:03:50.989> city<00:03:51.790> but<00:03:52.790> with

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
automatically into your city but with

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.460 
automatically into your city but with
this<00:03:53.030> game<00:03:53.269> you<00:03:53.299> have<00:03:53.569> to<00:03:53.630> do<00:03:53.810> it<00:03:53.930> yourself

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
this game you have to do it yourself

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.740 
this game you have to do it yourself
which<00:03:54.620> I<00:03:54.950> guess<00:03:55.610> is<00:03:55.760> both<00:03:55.880> good<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.269> bad<00:03:56.329> but<00:03:56.480> I

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
which I guess is both good and bad but I

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.479 
which I guess is both good and bad but I
think<00:03:56.870> it's<00:03:57.489> kind<00:03:58.489> of<00:03:58.519> good<00:04:00.099> also<00:04:01.099> this<00:04:01.250> game

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
think it's kind of good also this game

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.160 
think it's kind of good also this game
for<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.030> first<00:04:02.150> time<00:04:02.269> introduced<00:04:02.870> the

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
for the first time introduced the

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.360 
for the first time introduced the
feature<00:04:03.319> of<00:04:03.500> connected<00:04:04.340> cities<00:04:06.099> all<00:04:07.099> right

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
feature of connected cities all right

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.470 
feature of connected cities all right
let's<00:04:07.670> have<00:04:08.150> some<00:04:08.540> weathering<00:04:08.870> effects

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
let's have some weathering effects

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.369 
let's have some weathering effects
that's<00:04:11.480> an<00:04:11.629> erosion<00:04:13.900> makes<00:04:14.900> things<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.290> little

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
that's an erosion makes things a little

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.060 
that's an erosion makes things a little
less<00:04:15.530> jagged<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:18.380> now<00:04:18.530> what<00:04:18.680> we're<00:04:18.829> going<00:04:19.010> to

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
less jagged and now what we're going to

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:30.000 
less jagged and now what we're going to
do<00:04:19.930> is<00:04:20.930> put<00:04:21.260> on<00:04:21.410> some<00:04:21.440> trees

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.130 

there<00:04:30.610> we<00:04:30.790> go<00:04:30.970> and<00:04:31.930> you<00:04:32.130> can<00:04:33.130> even<00:04:33.490> produce

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
there we go and you can even produce

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.820 
there we go and you can even produce
animals<00:04:35.140> to<00:04:35.290> run<00:04:35.440> around

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
animals to run around

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.770 
animals to run around
Celes<00:04:36.250> let's<00:04:36.880> have<00:04:37.030> a<00:04:37.060> few<00:04:37.240> animals<00:04:37.390> here

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
there why not some wild horses would

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.230 
there why not some wild horses would
land<00:04:43.480> animals<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:45.490> you'll<00:04:45.610> see<00:04:45.790> them<00:04:45.940> as<00:04:46.060> we

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
land animals and you'll see them as we

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.710 
land animals and you'll see them as we
play<00:04:47.520> alright<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:48.610> think<00:04:48.640> that<00:04:49.000> satisfactory

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
like you can reconcile the edges but I

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.510 
like you can reconcile the edges but I
want<00:04:56.530> to<00:04:56.590> do<00:04:56.710> that<00:04:56.860> because<00:04:57.040> I<00:04:57.220> don't<00:04:57.280> want<00:04:57.460> to

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
want to do that because I don't want to

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.170 
want to do that because I don't want to
make<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.760> edges<00:04:58.120> flat<00:04:59.730> but<00:05:00.730> I've<00:05:00.940> showed<00:05:01.120> you

can raise the entire terrain raise the

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.640 
can raise the entire terrain raise the
entire<00:05:06.940> elevation<00:05:07.540> if<00:05:07.630> you<00:05:07.720> need<00:05:07.870> to<00:05:08.080> like

that and now look what I've done I've
limited<00:05:12.130> all<00:05:12.490> my<00:05:12.610> trees<00:05:13.560> that's<00:05:14.560> alright<00:05:14.950> it's

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190
