00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
month and this is the half a G pro by

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.640 
month and this is the half a G pro by
dementia<00:01:43.570> leave-in<00:01:43.780> conditioner<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.500> that's

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.749 
counteracting that by using that because
I've<00:02:02.740> seen<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:02.950> lot<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.250> reviews<00:02:03.490> with<00:02:03.640> that

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
I've seen a lot of reviews with that

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.330 
I've seen a lot of reviews with that
dried<00:02:04.060> out<00:02:04.210> people's<00:02:04.600> hair<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:04.810> lot<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:05.530> this

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
dried out people's hair a lot and this

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.060 
dried out people's hair a lot and this
this<00:02:07.300> bad<00:02:07.600> boy<00:02:07.780> right<00:02:07.810> here<00:02:08.259> it's<00:02:08.739> probably

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
this bad boy right here it's probably

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.499 
this bad boy right here it's probably
the<00:02:09.160> only<00:02:09.310> one<00:02:09.610> that<00:02:09.640> actually<00:02:09.850> used<00:02:10.300> very

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
the only one that actually used very

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.810 
the only one that actually used very
often<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:11.080> use<00:02:11.350> this<00:02:11.709> one<00:02:11.920> probably<00:02:12.310> on<00:02:12.580> about

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
often I use this one probably on about

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.940 
often I use this one probably on about
every<00:02:13.330> time<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.140> style<00:02:14.470> my<00:02:14.560> hair<00:02:14.800> I<00:02:14.860> just

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
every time I style my hair I just

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.780 
every time I style my hair I just
bridged<00:02:15.489> it<00:02:15.670> though<00:02:15.850> like<00:02:16.720> 1<00:02:17.440> 2<00:02:17.830> 3<00:02:17.860> maybe<00:02:18.550> about

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
bridged it though like 1 2 3 maybe about

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.590 
bridged it though like 1 2 3 maybe about
3<00:02:19.209> spritz<00:02:19.630> every<00:02:20.320> time<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.560> do<00:02:20.680> my<00:02:20.920> hair<00:02:21.480> which<00:02:22.480> I

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
3 spritz every time I do my hair which I

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.090 
3 spritz every time I do my hair which I
only<00:02:22.720> do<00:02:22.870> my<00:02:22.959> hair<00:02:23.110> like<00:02:23.140> twice<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.440> week<00:02:23.680> but<00:02:24.070> I

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
only do my hair like twice a week but I

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.320 
only do my hair like twice a week but I
do<00:02:24.190> about<00:02:24.459> 3<00:02:24.760> spritz<00:02:25.390> if<00:02:26.080> that<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:27.030> if<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.239> a

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
do about 3 spritz if that and if it's a

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.970 
do about 3 spritz if that and if it's a
nearby<00:02:28.600> but<00:02:28.900> sometimes<00:02:29.290> I'm<00:02:29.440> trying<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.769> just

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
nearby but sometimes I'm trying to just

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.550 
nearby but sometimes I'm trying to just
do<00:02:30.160> one<00:02:30.430> product<00:02:30.880> line<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.510> we<00:02:32.019> do<00:02:32.230> something

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
do one product line that we do something

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.890 
do one product line that we do something
like<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:32.920> but<00:02:33.400> for<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.670> most<00:02:33.700> part<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.360> may<00:02:34.840> be

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
like that but for the most part I may be

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.470 
like that but for the most part I may be
out<00:02:35.080> once<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.470> week<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.980> use<00:02:36.280> this<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.970> I<00:02:37.090> just<00:02:37.330> do

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
out once a week I use this and I just do

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.340 
out once a week I use this and I just do
about<00:02:38.110> three<00:02:38.440> or<00:02:38.620> four<00:02:38.799> spritz<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:41.019> figure

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
about three or four spritz and I figure

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.640 
about three or four spritz and I figure
that's<00:02:41.530> like<00:02:41.680> replenishing<00:02:42.430> protein<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.360> I

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
that's like replenishing protein so I

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.420 
that's like replenishing protein so I
know<00:02:44.650> you're<00:02:44.920> not<00:02:44.980> supposed<00:02:45.100> to<00:02:45.280> use<00:02:45.400> that

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
know you're not supposed to use that

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.030 
know you're not supposed to use that
much<00:02:45.730> protein<00:02:45.940> but<00:02:46.810> since<00:02:46.989> I've<00:02:47.170> never<00:02:47.440> really

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
much protein but since I've never really

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.590 
much protein but since I've never really
used<00:02:48.070> protein<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:48.880> didn't<00:02:49.180> think<00:02:49.269> it'd<00:02:49.450> be<00:02:49.480> a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
used protein I didn't think it'd be a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.420 
used protein I didn't think it'd be a
problem<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.200> hasn't<00:02:50.350> been<00:02:50.650> my<00:02:51.130> hair<00:02:51.310> is

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
problem and it hasn't been my hair is

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.479 
problem and it hasn't been my hair is
like<00:02:51.579> healthier<00:02:52.090> than<00:02:52.480> ever<00:02:53.049> like<00:02:53.950> healthier

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
like healthier than ever like healthier

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.650 
one other product that I did use that
had<00:02:59.769> protein<00:03:00.220> and

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
had protein and

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.680 
had protein and
and<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.170> was<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:04.310> shea<00:03:05.310> moisture

a milk or like a a more creamy
moisturizing<00:04:00.410> product<00:04:01.410> in<00:04:01.620> with<00:04:02.130> that<00:04:02.340> so

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
moisturizing product in with that so

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.630 
moisturizing product in with that so
that<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:03.330> would<00:04:03.510> kind<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.870> not<00:04:04.710> be<00:04:04.980> protein

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
that it would kind of not be protein

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.520 
that it would kind of not be protein
overload<00:04:06.270> but<00:04:06.750> if<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:06.900> do<00:04:07.020> have<00:04:07.170> protein

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
overload but if you do have protein

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.620 
overload but if you do have protein
overload<00:04:07.920> then<00:04:08.100> definitely<00:04:08.850> might<00:04:09.120> not<00:04:09.300> want

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
overload then definitely might not want

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.320 
overload then definitely might not want
to<00:04:09.900> use<00:04:10.260> these<00:04:10.470> products<00:04:10.950> very<00:04:11.130> often<00:04:11.520> at<00:04:12.120> all

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
to use these products very often at all

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.880
