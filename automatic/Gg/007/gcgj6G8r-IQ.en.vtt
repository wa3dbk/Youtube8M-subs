00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
I think I can analyze that as much as I

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.300

want<00:04:46.419> but<00:04:46.540> uh<00:04:46.720> I<00:04:47.229> know<00:04:47.560> that<00:04:47.830> it's<00:04:47.979> just<00:04:48.220> that

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
want but uh I know that it's just that

want but uh I know that it's just that
I'm<00:04:48.940> not<00:04:49.000> in<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.330> right<00:04:49.449> place<00:04:49.630> in<00:04:49.840> my<00:04:49.930> head

and<00:04:50.350> maybe<00:04:51.070> it<00:04:51.250> comes<00:04:51.490> from<00:04:52.350> no<00:04:53.350> needing<00:04:53.800> to

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
and maybe it comes from no needing to

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.879 
and maybe it comes from no needing to
have<00:04:55.330> this<00:04:55.539> fire<00:04:55.810> inside<00:04:56.020> you<00:04:56.350> that<00:04:56.560> really
