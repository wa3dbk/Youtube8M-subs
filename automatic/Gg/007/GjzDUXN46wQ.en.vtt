 goo 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.620
 Hi, I am Miyoshi of the Bunsho Music School representative 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:22.190
 Completely free 14-day guitar skill improvement course 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:27.080
 Today I would like to explain the attitude when playing the guitar 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:33.870
 Even if I practice a lot of guitars, I can not get much results 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:39.629
 Such a person may or may not attitude is wrong when playing the first place guitar just maybe 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.840
 Practice the guitar in the wrong form and remember to the wrong body 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.340
 You of the will to be written 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:53.140
 I get a strange habit and it will be very difficult to shoot later 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:58.630
 Rather than start a suddenly Gamushara to practice First of you 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:02.920
 Please check out such things if your home is correct 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:05.730
 Then I would like to start off with a happy lecture, so please keep it in mind. 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.730
 I will 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:26.320
 I would like to with the attitude to your description of when you play in the future guitar 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:33.360
 When playing the guitar, there are two main stances: standing and playing or sitting and playing 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:39.300
 Here I would like to explain the posture when sitting and playing 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.670
 It is recommended to play as if sitting and sitting on the ground even if you say sitting and playing 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:46.090
 not here 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:53.360
 Let's play using a chair as much as possible 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:57.440
 First is the choice of the chair, but please do choose the one that can only height adjustable 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:04.310
 It is a standard of adjustment of the height of the chair 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:09.569
 Set your knees to a 90 degree angle when you sit down 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:13.790
 Keep your knees open about your shoulders 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.790
 Please sit straight with your spine straight 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:25.550
 Hmm 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:31.610
 Yes , so I would like to explain how to hold the guitar right away 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:34.190
 Most of the guitars have been stripped of the lower part of the body like this, except for special guitars 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:39.630
 I think it looks like 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:44.180
 First, let's fit this part to the right thigh 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:48.859
 So lightly put it on your body 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:55.879
 I think that you can see if you look at this video 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:58.519
 Especially on the knees even with both hands released like this, unless you have a specially shaped guitar 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:04.220
 This guitar is 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:07.790
 I think that it will be in the form of keeping Please create this state first 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:12.350
 In the case of special guitars, the balance may be bad. 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.430
 As it may not be in such a state, it should be enough as a standard 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:20.580
 is 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:23.580
 At first I made a neck and I will put it a little lightly before. 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.200
 When referred to as why there is a need to issue before 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:35.380
 If you make the guitar parallel to your body like this 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:39.640
 In fact, I'm left hand It is a left hand to # more than Te right becomes very cramped feeling 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:44.110
 Depending on that issue this way the neck before a little 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:51.340
 Than easier also reach the left hand where the fret 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:55.100
 Bring the Mech in front and still put the neck in front of this guitar body by this child 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:04:00.920
 Because it feels like holding a little lightly 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:06.930
 The right arm will be usable Light the body of the guitar with the right arm 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:13.829
 You will feel more stable if you try to reduce the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:20.690
 How to prepare the guitar now was explained with this strat type guitar 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:20.690
 Will be the same way of thinking in a Les Paul type and Terekyasu type 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:34.849
 Yes I would like to touch briefly on the left hand form today 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:40.200
 Divided into three types, to say the rule of thumb is toward the left hand 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:43.900
 Do you show your thumb or just behind the neck without showing your thumb 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:48.250
 I will be divided into these two types of revival 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:51.340
 How to use both or before where I am allowed to talk about that in 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:56.710
 I want to do a simple experiment 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:05:05.140
 First of all, please try along with a thumb to the right in back of the neck 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:08.650
 Because it does not matter in a proper from the index finger to the little finger in a state that accompanied your thumbs on the neck of the true back in 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:12.560
 Please try to open it 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:16.849
 Is it possible? From this open state 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.580
 I think the thumb is a little bit of the neck 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:25.900
 I will try to put out towards the top 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.900
 Then what happened to the index finger to the little finger? 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:32.600
 Most people have fingers 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:42.950
 I think it feels contracted 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:45.050
 This experiment shows that when you put your thumb behind, it's a phrase like opening your finger. 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:52.819
 With thumb up 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:55.750
 Put out on went this time to the Cho King Toka when you need to keep your thumb a 6-string 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:06:01.230
 Sometimes I put my thumb up 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:04.620
 You can use various forms just by knowing such things 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:08.850
 If you do not know how to use this form 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:14.820
 For example , I'm troubled that my finger does not open with my thumb raised 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:22.170
 This because it is you may fall into the so kind of slump 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:24.680
 I think it will be very useful for the later guitar practice to know the principle, so remember by all means 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.680
 please 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:33.000
 Hmm 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.080
 Today's lecture was also up to you tired of 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.650
 Will the following stand 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:45.240
 Learning the correct form is directly linked to efficient guitar advancement 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:47.330
 Also that form is to gradually collapse while they do not know 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:52.000
 There are also times when 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:57.280
 So please check this video regularly 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.610
 Today's lecture is the end of it, so I am looking forward to tomorrow's meeting again 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.650
 Please give me 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.650
 Then thank you very much for today 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.150
 of 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.150
 me
