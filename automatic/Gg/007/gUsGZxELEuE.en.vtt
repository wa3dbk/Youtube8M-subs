psychology side and the finance side

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.800 
psychology side and the finance side
that<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.100> decided<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:39.239> would<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.660> best

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
that I decided this would be the best

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.139 
that I decided this would be the best
path<00:00:40.020> for<00:00:40.260> me<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.070> perfect<00:00:41.280> role<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
path for me it's the perfect role the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.880 
path for me it's the perfect role the
main<00:00:42.510> things<00:00:42.840> i<00:00:43.020> think<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.620> have

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
main things i think that that have

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.770 
main things i think that that have
caused<00:00:44.190> us<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.550> get<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.880> a<00:00:44.910> level<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.270> successes

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
caused us to get to a level of successes

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.510 
caused us to get to a level of successes
one<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.290> think<00:00:46.410> we've<00:00:46.770> started<00:00:47.130> to<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.489> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
one I think we've started to have a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.780 
one I think we've started to have a
belief<00:00:47.970> in<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.920> do<00:00:50.340> something<00:00:50.579> I

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
belief in that we can do something I

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.040 
belief in that we can do something I
mean<00:00:50.940> sometimes<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.360> belief<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.930> more

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
mean sometimes that belief can be more

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.660 
mean sometimes that belief can be more
powerful<00:00:52.260> than<00:00:52.500> people<00:00:52.800> realize<00:00:53.070> there's

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
powerful than people realize there's

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.930 
powerful than people realize there's
this<00:00:53.850> fear<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:55.309> failure<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.489> people<00:00:56.850> have

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
this fear of failure that people have

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.240 
this fear of failure that people have
but<00:00:57.059> there's<00:00:57.180> also<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.420> fear<00:00:57.630> success<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:59.070> so

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
but there's also a fear success and so

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.200 
but there's also a fear success and so
one<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> things<00:00:59.610> we've<00:00:59.940> had<00:01:00.090> is

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
one of the things we've had is

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.569 
one of the things we've had is
overcoming<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.750> fear<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:02.040> second<00:01:02.370> thing<00:01:02.489> I

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
overcoming that fear the second thing I

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.770 
overcoming that fear the second thing I
would<00:01:02.640> think<00:01:02.760> would<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.120> people<00:01:03.629> that

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
would think would be the people that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.629 
would think would be the people that
have<00:01:03.870> helped<00:01:04.290> us<00:01:04.500> get<00:01:05.039> there<00:01:05.219> I<00:01:05.249> mean<00:01:05.429> nobody

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:05.639 
have helped us get there I mean nobody

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:08.929 
have helped us get there I mean nobody
gets<00:01:06.359> there<00:01:06.600> alone<00:01:06.990> not<00:01:07.469> one<00:01:07.740> person<00:01:08.009> gets

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
gets there alone not one person gets

challenges you to reflect in words to be

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.759 
challenges you to reflect in words to be
better<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.390> do<00:03:21.540> better<00:03:21.750> when<00:03:22.170> I<00:03:22.230> reflect<00:03:22.560> back

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
better to do better when I reflect back

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.199 
better to do better when I reflect back
on<00:03:22.920> my<00:03:23.100> first<00:03:23.310> couple<00:03:23.519> years<00:03:23.579> I<00:03:23.790> think<00:03:23.850> what

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
on my first couple years I think what

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.759 
on my first couple years I think what
was<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.480> doing<00:03:24.600> because<00:03:25.530> I<00:03:25.560> was<00:03:25.890> basically<00:03:27.769> lazy

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
was I doing because I was basically lazy

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.440 
was I doing because I was basically lazy
so<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.579> one<00:03:29.730> thing<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:30.060> would<00:03:30.209> have<00:03:30.299> done

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
so the one thing I would have done

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.759 
so the one thing I would have done
differently<00:03:30.630> is<00:03:31.019> I<00:03:31.049> would<00:03:31.230> have<00:03:31.320> paid<00:03:31.530> more

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
differently is I would have paid more

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.319 
differently is I would have paid more
attention<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:32.340> some<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.880> advice<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.269> would

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
attention to some of the advice I would

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.030 
attention to some of the advice I would
have<00:03:33.450> gotten<00:03:33.600> 2009<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:34.709> going<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:34.920> be<00:03:35.010> a

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
have gotten 2009 is going to be a

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.830 
have gotten 2009 is going to be a
different<00:03:35.370> year<00:03:35.430> because<00:03:35.730> i<00:03:35.760> think<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.810> know

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
different year because i think you know

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.900 
different year because i think you know
people<00:03:37.500> always<00:03:37.620> believe<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.130> old<00:03:38.430> paradigms

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
people always believe the old paradigms

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.720 
people always believe the old paradigms
that<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.329> know<00:03:39.450> stress<00:03:39.750> is<00:03:39.930> bad<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.640> you<00:03:41.640> know

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
that you know stress is bad and you know

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.009 
that you know stress is bad and you know
you<00:03:41.790> got<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.000> manage<00:03:42.209> your<00:03:42.360> time<00:03:42.570> I<00:03:42.840> don't

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
you got to manage your time I don't

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.360 
you got to manage your time I don't
subscribe<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.410> those<00:03:43.650> paradigms<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.190> think

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
subscribe to those paradigms I think

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.810 
subscribe to those paradigms I think
stress<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.150> good<00:03:45.329> because<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.690> allows<00:03:46.350> us<00:03:46.560> to

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
stress is good because it allows us to

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.430 
stress is good because it allows us to
expand<00:03:47.820> our<00:03:47.970> emotional<00:03:48.570> flexibility<00:03:49.260> or

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
expand our emotional flexibility or

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.440 
expand our emotional flexibility or
emotional<00:03:49.950> resilience<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.610> don't<00:03:51.239> think<00:03:51.390> we

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
emotional resilience I don't think we

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.550 
emotional resilience I don't think we
need<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.660> manage<00:03:51.840> our<00:03:51.959> time<00:03:51.989> we<00:03:52.350> need<00:03:52.470> to

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
need to manage our time we need to

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.100 
need to manage our time we need to
measure<00:03:52.680> energy<00:03:53.040> so<00:03:54.030> 2008<00:03:54.750> was<00:03:54.900> quite<00:03:55.079> the

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
measure energy so 2008 was quite the

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.930 
measure energy so 2008 was quite the
sprint<00:03:55.530> 2009<00:03:56.160> we're<00:03:56.310> going<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.489> jog<00:03:56.700> for<00:03:56.910> a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
sprint 2009 we're going to jog for a

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.330 
sprint 2009 we're going to jog for a
little<00:03:57.090> bit<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:57.450> then<00:03:57.510> sort<00:03:58.380> of<00:03:58.500> get<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:59.220> the

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
little bit and then sort of get to the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.490 
little bit and then sort of get to the
level<00:03:59.579> we're<00:04:00.000> sprinting<00:04:00.299> for<00:04:00.780> 2,000<00:04:01.290> DNA

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
level we're sprinting for 2,000 DNA

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.550 
level we're sprinting for 2,000 DNA
2009-2010<00:04:02.489> so<00:04:03.060> 2009<00:04:03.660> maybe<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:04.049> little<00:04:04.290> bit<00:04:04.470> of

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
2009-2010 so 2009 maybe a little bit of

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.740 
2009-2010 so 2009 maybe a little bit of
a<00:04:04.650> light<00:04:05.370> jog<00:04:05.640> until<00:04:06.150> we<00:04:06.269> start<00:04:06.450> sprinting

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
a light jog until we start sprinting

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.380 
a light jog until we start sprinting
next<00:04:07.200> year
