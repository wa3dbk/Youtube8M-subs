we're at bruntingthorpe to test that
claim<00:00:27.590> and<00:00:28.130> to<00:00:28.580> also<00:00:28.730> investigate<00:00:29.330> if<00:00:29.510> there's

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660

a<00:00:29.689> way<00:00:29.810> of<00:00:29.840> making<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:30.380> Fiesta<00:00:30.740> ST<00:00:30.890> accelerate

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
a way of making the Fiesta ST accelerate

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.820 
a way of making the Fiesta ST accelerate
faster<00:00:32.059> without<00:00:32.510> touching<00:00:33.199> the<00:00:33.290> engine<00:00:33.680> at

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
faster without touching the engine at

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.229 
faster without touching the engine at
all<00:00:35.260> so<00:00:36.260> how<00:00:36.440> fast<00:00:36.769> will<00:00:37.129> a<00:00:37.190> standard<00:00:37.730> Fiesta

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
all so how fast will a standard Fiesta

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.810 
all so how fast will a standard Fiesta
ST<00:00:38.420> accelerate<00:00:39.199> anyway<00:00:39.590> we<00:00:40.190> have<00:00:40.340> one<00:00:40.580> here

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
ST accelerate anyway we have one here

kilograms<00:02:55.049> we<00:02:55.230> think<00:02:55.560> it's<00:02:56.159> a<00:02:56.370> lot<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:57.000> weight

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
kilograms we think it's a lot of weight

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.789 
kilograms we think it's a lot of weight
I'll<00:02:57.629> put<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.290> in<00:02:58.560> sport<00:02:59.129> and<00:03:00.319> we'll<00:03:01.319> see<00:03:01.590> what

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
I'll put it in sport and we'll see what

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:08.030 
I'll put it in sport and we'll see what
sort<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.159> numbers<00:03:02.700> we<00:03:02.879> get<00:03:03.120> shall<00:03:03.420> we<00:03:06.829> that<00:03:07.829> is

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
sort of numbers we get shall we that is

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.330 
sort of numbers we get shall we that is
absurd<00:03:08.480> nothing<00:03:09.480> towing<00:03:09.989> that<00:03:10.140> weight<00:03:10.379> should

absurd nothing towing that weight should

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.680 
absurd nothing towing that weight should
be<00:03:11.459> allowed<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:11.640> accelerate<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.450> quickly

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
as an indicator hunting by now look I'm

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.410 
as an indicator hunting by now look I'm
going<00:03:29.349> to<00:03:29.439> back<00:03:29.590> off<00:03:29.769> there<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.310> I'm<00:03:31.269> not

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
going to back off there and I'm not

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.459 
going to back off there and I'm not
going<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.599> describe<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.019> numbers<00:03:32.349> are

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:32.469 
going to describe the numbers are

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:35.610 
going to describe the numbers are
telling<00:03:32.709> why<00:03:33.689> because<00:03:34.689> sitting<00:03:35.140> here<00:03:35.319> right

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
telling why because sitting here right

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.890 
telling why because sitting here right
now<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:35.950> think<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.849> should<00:03:37.180> figure<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.719> from

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
now I think I should figure it from

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.209 
now I think I should figure it from
inside<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.200> Fiesta<00:03:38.709> this<00:03:38.829> is<00:03:38.950> about<00:03:39.099> the

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:39.219 
inside the Fiesta this is about the

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.890 
inside the Fiesta this is about the
fiesta<00:03:39.400> so<00:03:39.849> I<00:03:39.879> think<00:03:40.000> we'll<00:03:40.209> get<00:03:40.329> Neil<00:03:40.599> to

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
fiesta so I think we'll get Neil to

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.470 
fiesta so I think we'll get Neil to
drive<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.409> g-wagen<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.700> I'll<00:03:42.879> just<00:03:43.180> sit<00:03:43.359> in

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
drive the g-wagen and I'll just sit in

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.179 
the Fiesta with the vbox and I'll read
the<00:03:46.269> numbers<00:03:46.569> out<00:03:46.720> from<00:03:46.959> there<00:03:47.200> but<00:03:47.920> I<00:03:47.980> might

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:48.189 
the numbers out from there but I might

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:49.319 
the numbers out from there but I might
have<00:03:48.280> a<00:03:48.310> little<00:03:48.400> pink<00:03:48.670> now<00:03:48.819> and<00:03:49.000> see<00:03:49.120> what<00:03:49.239> it

have a little pink now and see what it

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:58.800 
have a little pink now and see what it
did<00:03:52.620> could<00:03:53.620> be<00:03:53.709> good<00:03:57.420> this<00:03:58.420> is<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.569> bit

my emails as I was going on this is
really<00:04:11.829> clever<00:04:12.069> because<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.489> vbox<00:04:12.819> is

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
really clever because the vbox is

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.810 
really clever because the vbox is
bluetooth<00:04:13.950> so<00:04:14.950> I<00:04:16.500> can<00:04:17.500> see<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:17.979> speed<00:04:18.310> readout
