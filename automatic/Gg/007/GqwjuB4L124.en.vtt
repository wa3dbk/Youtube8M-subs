a<00:00:12.509> new<00:00:12.660> video<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.259> PhD<00:00:13.710> flopper<00:00:14.210> returning<00:00:15.210> in

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
a new video of PhD flopper returning in

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.450 
a new video of PhD flopper returning in
either<00:00:15.509> map<00:00:15.780> pack<00:00:15.990> three<00:00:16.020> or<00:00:16.410> four<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.279> yeah

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
either map pack three or four so yeah

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.730 
either map pack three or four so yeah
this<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> really<00:00:18.630> plausible<00:00:18.930> theory<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:19.680> I

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
this is a really plausible theory so I

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.580 
this is a really plausible theory so I
hope<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:20.010> guys<00:00:20.100> enjoy<00:00:20.990> just<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.109> get<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.380> out

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
hope you guys enjoy just to get this out

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.019 
hope you guys enjoy just to get this out
of<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> way<00:00:22.830> I'm<00:00:23.160> not<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.490> founder<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.850> this

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
of the way I'm not the founder of this

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.009 
of the way I'm not the founder of this
theory<00:00:24.300> he<00:00:24.480> will<00:00:24.600> be<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> description

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
theory he will be in the description

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.109 
theory he will be in the description
make<00:00:25.590> sure<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.800> guys<00:00:25.890> go<00:00:26.039> check<00:00:26.310> them<00:00:26.400> out<00:00:26.550> so

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
make sure you guys go check them out so

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.060 
make sure you guys go check them out so
as<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.480> see<00:00:27.720> there's<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.140> three<00:00:28.500> map

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
as you can see there's the three map

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.859 
as you can see there's the three map
packs<00:00:29.340> we've<00:00:29.609> seen<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:29.970> far<00:00:30.000> will<00:00:30.390> green<00:00:30.630> runs

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
packs we've seen so far will green runs

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.260 
packs we've seen so far will green runs
not<00:00:31.080> including<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.619> map<00:00:31.800> pack<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:33.000> our

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
not including in a map pack but it's our

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.170 
not including in a map pack but it's our
basically<00:00:34.200> survival<00:00:34.980> map<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.760> came<00:00:35.969> with

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
basically survival map that it came with

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.139 
basically survival map that it came with
the<00:00:36.300> game<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.260> these<00:00:37.739> maps<00:00:38.129> include<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.910> four

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the game so these maps include the four

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.170 
the game so these maps include the four
main<00:00:39.329> body<00:00:39.570> perks<00:00:39.960> now<00:00:40.559> quick<00:00:41.010> revive<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.820> mean

theory i'm going to show you guys why I

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.389 
theory i'm going to show you guys why I
think<00:00:57.210> PhD<00:00:57.600> flopper<00:00:57.719> will<00:00:58.440> be<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.250> next

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
think PhD flopper will be in the next

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.729 
think PhD flopper will be in the next
map<00:00:59.640> pack<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.750> see<00:01:00.960> green<00:01:01.260> run<00:01:01.500> has

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
map pack so as you can see green run has

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.529 
map pack so as you can see green run has
a<00:01:01.770> new<00:01:02.160> perk<00:01:02.460> that's<00:01:02.670> featured<00:01:02.910> which<00:01:03.359> is

means that there's going to be a new
perk<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.369> next<00:01:47.640> map<00:01:47.790> pack<00:01:48.030> obviously<00:01:48.720> and

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
perk in the next map pack obviously and

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.440 
perk in the next map pack obviously and
then<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.710> featured<00:01:50.159> perk<00:01:50.430> which<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.329> to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
then a featured perk which is going to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.280 
then a featured perk which is going to
be<00:01:51.710> PhD<00:01:52.710> flopper<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.299> got<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.570> write<00:01:54.750> PhD

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
be PhD flopper so you got to write PhD

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.740 
be PhD flopper so you got to write PhD
flopper<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.920> mutt<00:01:56.250> might<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.390> next<00:01:57.540> map

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
flopper is mutt might be in the next map

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.499 
flopper is mutt might be in the next map
pack<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.619> theory<00:01:59.070> kind<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.060> confirms

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
pack and this theory kind of confirms

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.990 
pack and this theory kind of confirms
that<00:02:01.079> because<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.979> route<00:02:02.399> they're<00:02:02.610> going

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
that because of the route they're going

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.539 
that because of the route they're going
because<00:02:03.780> they<00:02:03.990> have<00:02:04.170> stamina<00:02:04.500> up<00:02:04.770> mule<00:02:05.310> kick

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
because they have stamina up mule kick

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.760 
because they have stamina up mule kick
and<00:02:05.790> Deadshot<00:02:06.360> dal<00:02:06.570> curry<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.619> only
