00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 In this video we want to give you the 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.819
 operating data of the rocco camera lures 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.450
 introduce and how to set this 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.910
 become 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.920
 in the first part we show you the host 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.049
 fashion and afterwards we will become the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.150
 handle the client mode function 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.330
 Finally, the locomotive is on the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.699
 Factory default reset 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.619
 ok we start with the houseboat in 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.750
 which also the lock is delivered 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.240
 In this mode you can deal with one 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.789
 wlan enabled terminal directly with the lok 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.579
 connect the video data will be from the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.420
 lok sent directly to the terminal 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.190
 the lok is controlled like others 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.070
 conventional loks via their digital 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.200
 Central after the lok on the train 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.219
 it is placed within 15 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.469
 seconds ready 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.010
 By the way, by the way, they keep that 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.109
 password label good on 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.850
 before we lure us with the camera 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.609
 we invite you to join us 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.140
 matching guide down to it 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.800
 But you still need to use the internet 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.800
 communicate 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.570
 now we connect 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.860
 the camera lok and switch to the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.170
 wireless settings 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.659
 This process can vary depending on the type and 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.090
 operating system is something different 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.060
 but in principle the same join 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.979
 to the wlan- which under ssid on 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.170
 the password label is to be found and 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.170
 enter the corresponding password 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.070
 switch back to the rock rap and 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.070
 go to the lok library 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.539
 There you choose the right one 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.500
 Leader for your lok out and load 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.500
 the presets 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.410
 then activate the video lock 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.950
 function now they can video image 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.950
 test 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.810
 yes it works when we are in the 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.150
 Change game mode, we also see the 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.500
 fruits of our work in which we open 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.500
 Tap the camera icon 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.180
 or even if you are in the driver's seat 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.420
 go 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.759
 also plays adapt 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.440
 in host mode, the fan is the app 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.010
 not possible 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.750
 So we come to the client mode in this 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.760
 Mode is the simultaneous control of the 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.280
 lok and look at the live video image it 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.440
 possible because the lok with the z21 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.720
 router connects and the video images 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.480
 then via this router to the tablet or 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.100
 smartphone sends the tax orders 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.320
 in turn are via the router 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.420
 currently 21 transmitted 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.310
 this gives the control commands over the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.560
 the lok continued to appear 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.530
 First and foremost, you have to make sure 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.840
 that they are connected to the z21 network 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.940
 are and the camera lok on the same 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.380
 is because she is with program online 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.380
 command programmed 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.320
 continue in the rock rap in the lok 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.320
 Library 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.620
 there we start with 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.620
 lok in client mode 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.280
 She first asked the ssid 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.200
 So the name of your z21 network 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.109
 typing 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.879
 this starts with z21 underline and the 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.879
 last four digits of the serial number 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.819
 after that, the password of the router must be 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.409
 be entered 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.130
 Finally, check again 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.440
 the values ​​entered 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.810
 after the program your process you have to 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.730
 wait at least 30 seconds until the 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.750
 lok has taken over the new settings 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.340
 and connects to the z21 router 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.840
 for a quick check that can 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.840
 video image display 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.130
 in game mode can now the video image 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.110
 be displayed and at the same time 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.850
 the locs as well as the whole plant like 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.850
 used to be controlled from the app 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.110
 The same applies to the driver's license 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.620
 here can also live with the lok 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.160
 being controlled 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.720
 if all 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.760
 to be undone 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.770
 or an error during programming 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.290
 the lok can go back in 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.540
 be set to the delivery state 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.610
 For this, the camera must be loose on the 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.130
 program you are waiting for her 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.920
 after the same 15 seconds to 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:27.450
 she is ready to lure 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:30.080
 First, you need cv 394 worth 12 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.080
 program 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.390
 second, you have to use the c v8 with the 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.340
 program value 97 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.170
 can be triggered by the reset 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.880
 high power consumption at the program you 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.710
 process can not be prevented 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.930
 This is what happens in most movies 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.150
 to an error message on the program 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.170
 your track will be reset anyway 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.410
 carried out 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.630
 if you see the successful reset 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.660
 the camera lure network back in the 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:04.910
 voter list of your devices is a lot 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.910
 fun with the rocco camera lures
