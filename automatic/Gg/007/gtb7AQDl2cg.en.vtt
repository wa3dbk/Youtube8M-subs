picked it up from my last video just
really<00:01:02.050> helps<00:01:02.319> with<00:01:02.409> the<00:01:02.469> run<00:01:02.739> speed

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
really helps with the run speed

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.070 
really helps with the run speed
otherwise<00:01:05.470> you<00:01:05.920> can<00:01:06.040> take<00:01:06.250> off<00:01:06.960> majority<00:01:07.960> of

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
otherwise you can take off majority of

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.100 
otherwise you can take off majority of
your<00:01:08.290> armor<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:08.950> I<00:01:09.460> get<00:01:09.700> that<00:01:09.880> fast<00:01:10.210> run<00:01:10.510> fast

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
roll and you can do this with that

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.649 
roll and you can do this with that
