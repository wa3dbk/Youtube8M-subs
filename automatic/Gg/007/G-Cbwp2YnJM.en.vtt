00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.379
 ladies and gentlemen hello welcome 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.890
 aboard the last centrifuges of 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.900
 porsche 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.700
 the 911 turbo s and to get in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:18.320
 appetite a little lunch check and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.320
 Believe me, this is a bad match 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:34.760
 little reminder of 300 flat-6 presences 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:38.570
 obviously 3,18 turbo 560 horsepower 4 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.210
 driving wheels and a 0 to 100 measurements and 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.550
 by us in 2.95 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.510
 I apologize for the least 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.769
 that it's a 911 waiting for a version 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.730
 gt2 the turbo s 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:56.030
 that's with 9 91 to more powerful the 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.660
 moment at risk the turbo s is the gear 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.030
 ideal to make the circuit not sure 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.250
 at this moment we continue to prefer him 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.050
 gt3 with its more radical side more 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.510
 athletic 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.020
 sincerely it's still the panard 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.020
 absolute 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.820
 two son the turbo s is equipped with the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.500
 pdk box 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.910
 paradoxically and unlike the gt3 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.700
 my porsche not found wise 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.100
 to bring leverage so I 'll go 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.380
 sporty with a downshift towards 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.650
 water and a rise of the reports to the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.900
 down we continue to have a place that gets 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.890
 mania in the wrong way 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.140
 but as we do mumuse with the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.450
 pallets we get along very very 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.760
 well in terms of equipment they did not 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.470
 not much when I said there the 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.619
 ceramic brakes with piloted suspension 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.520
 and novelty on this model offer is good 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.490
 we are entitled to rear wheels 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.979
 guidelines and therefore roughly speaking 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.729
 I arrive on a small bend 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.410
 slowly the rear wheels turn 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.800
 in the other direction to allow the 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.750
 car to happen more easily and 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.960
 as soon as we reach a speed of 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.520
 cruises beyond 50 km 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.350
 the Romanians who in the identical sense 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.360
 front wheels for virtually 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.030
 lengthened the wheelbase and we feel it 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.920
 the car is more stable 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.440
 necessarily with a passing car 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.700
 in turns very very strong then 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.680
 it's still a little bit sluggish 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.239
 before 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.180
 we feel indeed the AWD 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.120
 who tends to shoot straight 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.400
 and has and left the rope point 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.409
 there are so many couples that for 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.459
 have experienced 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:38.329
 and still not much 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.329
 done on stage a meteorite 60 meteorite
