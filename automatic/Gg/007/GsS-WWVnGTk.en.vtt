00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.859
 the writing area is not enough 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:23.499
 so that is not enough 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.939
 rohr 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.930
 this topic occupies a central space in the dialogue between Catholics and Protestants 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.860
 this is because the Catholic church does not go to all its practices beliefs 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.540
 and ritual customs have registered with an inspired in the sacred scriptures 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.740
 they affirm that the same divine value have the apostolic oral medication 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.739
 continues in time through non-infallible teaching 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.110
 he is 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.980
 oral presentation which serves as a foundation for many of its doctrines 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.730
 nonexistent in the bible is what Rome calls trapeze 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.270
 for this reason they reject outright the protestant statement of the single 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.530
 bear writing the bible as a complete word of God 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.200
 considering it insufficient 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.570
 let's see directly what a Catholic priest affirms on his page 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.840
 pineapple angles 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.790
 we agree with these brothers of ours in love and devotion to the sacred 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.890
 writing 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.970
 but we live when they say that only what is found in the 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.810
 sacred scriptures is worthy of being taken as a servant message of God 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.690
 for our salvation 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.440
 the tradition with capital letters of the church has its origin in Jesus Christ and 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.240
 the apostles and will be handed down generation after generation by means of 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.570
 the preaching and the celebration of the mysteries of salvation for Colombia 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.510
 the holy spirit 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.430
 we have it ready the Christians to cecilia evangelical slaves deny that 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.540
 we owe from the state and I do what I want to achieve the region that is not 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.630
 be in religion or write to meet the band 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.660
 the Catholic Church, on the other hand, maintains that they already like Barbara 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.339
 adding salvation teaching in delivering 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:15.799
 we want to maintain and preserve is wider than the sacred script 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:21.129
 if we are in a situation to share this topic with a friend 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.409
 Catholic we must be very clear about what the starting point of the 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.139
 conversation 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:31.539
 an essential prior definition to deal with it are writing 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.840
 when the posture arises 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.989
 about writing is not enough 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.800
 before starting our explanation, ask this simple question 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.939
 To reach the goal 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.499
 Although it seems too simple to be essential, keep in mind 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:53.029
 which is the Achilles heel of the Roman Catholic response 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:58.549
 because according to the answer of that question we can say that they are the 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.729
 bible achieve little that the bible does not reach 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:04.019
 I explain 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.890
 if we want to mean that the bible is the only necessary and sufficient source 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.900
 to reveal God's plan and his gospel of grace for eternal life 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.379
 then our response should be 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.560
 only measure achieved and there is still more glory to God 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.079
 see changes 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.349
 if we want to justify with the bible the need for the existence of 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.780
 the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church with all subscriptions with practices 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:31.689
 traditional customs 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.930
 loads imposed hierarchies of men in general then our response 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.409
 it must be like the Catholics repeat 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.919
 they have not yet given it 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:46.620
 It is for this reason that the Catholic Church repeats to the point of exhaustion that 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:48.819
 his writing does not work 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.949
 that really does not work 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.699
 but for your purposes 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.269
 and we could say that the president is against their interests 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.779
 that's why I also understood reiterative 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:04.869
 almost sickly will be engaged in trying to vilify this truth of God 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:09.159
 the words of Jesus have been very clear 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.099
 shake the world and preach the gospel teach it operated in all things to 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.989
 god of maradona 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.820
 now answering the following questions we will know if the bible 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:22.819
 reach it to know God's plan 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.729
 what is the gospel in which Jesus commanded us to preach 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.020
 two 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.770
 which is good news from God 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.879
 3 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.669
 which is excellent God wants us to want high losses so that 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.029
 can regain communion with the father and thus have eternal bliss 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:42.499
 happiness 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:46.550
 if the basis of current education is to transmit the gospel that they preached 

00:04:46.549 --> 00:04:48.409
 jesus and his apostles 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:52.830
 what was the good news is the gospel they announced preached 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.099
 jesus and his apostles 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.029
 if we can answer these simple questions only with the written in the 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:03.470
 bible then writing console reaches to know and transmit the 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.550
 God's complete plan 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.990
 It's that simple because God is not a god of confusion if you do not pay me 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.930
 in 1 Corinthians 14 33 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.510
 before concluding wish is to put another affirmation of the Catholic priest 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:23.010
 on the same subject which has caught my attention because of the inaccuracy 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:24.629
 Of the same 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.749
 I put it to your consideration 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:31.409
 said the same Catholic priest on his apologetic page 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.660
 no one can say based on any biblical text that the authors of the 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.660
 texts of the new testament wanted to imitate the teaching of Jesus or of the 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.660
 apostles to what they were writing 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:47.900
 We also consider that if anyone thinks that the only important thing 

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:52.749
 for us it is what was written that thought is neither biblical nor 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:56.759
 is nowhere in the bible even more insinuated to the 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:57.569
 contrary 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.999
 neither is it historical nor did anyone ever think so until the last centuries of 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:03.559
 our era 

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:08.209
 however written is also indicated at times many other signs of 

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:12.109
 stress tendency of disciples birds the waters are not written in this 

00:06:12.109 --> 00:06:12.949
 book 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:16.969
 but these had written so you can see that Jesus is the Christ the son 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:17.910
 of God 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.910
 and to require diego rosende to the common candidate 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:24.860
 and also on the other hand says 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.689
 if ever something else was even wiped out words of our 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:34.169
 Lord Jesus Christ and the doctrine that conform to reality is in the 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.689
 medicine, nothing is known 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:39.360
 cheapen roses 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.030
 it is clear that the healthy words of the Lord Jesus were written by work 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.580
 and grace of the holy spirit in the four gospels even gave 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.900
 assured in such a way that he commanded to write four versions of the gospel 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.960
 for security and sufficiency of your word 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.960
 then and we already have the answer to the words of our Lord Jesus Christ the 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.930
 verse stress says that the one who does not conform to these words nor to the 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:10.599
 doctrine a mystery of piety found in first timoteo 3 16 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:15.209
 the apostle says that such people are old and they know nothing and 

00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:19.449
 ended up saying in the verse systems apart from the parents because 

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:22.189
 are harmful to health 

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:25.919
 finally the other side said and to corroborate the locality 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:28.919
 aside their lives lent by the apostles 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.680
 when yesterday six foreigners and everything makes the kitchen look defeated does not have 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.349
 arrangement 

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:39.649
 the third was the first time he visited this extends to the rebellion 

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:45.499
 the girlfriend of another crime of money laundering in the bank has placed at 

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:46.429
 street 

00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:47.819
 and in the middle 

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:49.899
 forged the hemisphere and a half 

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:52.789
 he has not ratified his players 

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:54.729
 when analyzing the subject well 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:55.849
 rivers of ink 

00:07:55.849 --> 00:07:56.580
 until formed
