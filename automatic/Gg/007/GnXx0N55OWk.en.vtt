started
I<00:00:59.989> think<00:01:00.989> t-rex<00:01:01.500> would<00:01:01.680> save<00:01:01.949> his<00:01:02.160> first

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
I think t-rex would save his first

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.600 
I think t-rex would save his first
attack<00:01:03.260> he<00:01:04.260> wants<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:04.920> as<00:01:05.040> much<00:01:05.159> damage<00:01:05.400> as

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
attack he wants to do as much damage as

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.820 
attack he wants to do as much damage as
possible<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.270> not<00:01:06.479> right<00:01:06.659> now<00:01:06.689> he<00:01:07.409> can't<00:01:07.650> kill

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
possible but not right now he can't kill

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.280 
possible but not right now he can't kill
him<00:01:07.890> straight<00:01:08.159> away<00:01:08.510> now<00:01:09.510> with<00:01:09.570> Spinosaurus

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
him straight away now with Spinosaurus

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.929 
him straight away now with Spinosaurus
his<00:01:10.409> turn<00:01:10.650> he<00:01:10.860> was<00:01:11.100> pretty<00:01:11.310> ferocious<00:01:11.549> in

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
his turn he was pretty ferocious in

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.550 
his turn he was pretty ferocious in
dress<00:01:12.119> park<00:01:12.420> free<00:01:12.720> he<00:01:13.049> kept<00:01:13.260> attacking

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
dress park free he kept attacking

whatever<00:01:14.310> everyone<00:01:14.760> he<00:01:14.970> saw<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.630> thought<00:01:15.990> he

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
whatever everyone he saw so I thought he

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.800 
whatever everyone he saw so I thought he
would<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.710> damage<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.670> turn<00:01:17.939> dealing

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
would do to damage this turn dealing

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.539 
would do to damage this turn dealing
some<00:01:18.960> damage<00:01:19.320> for<00:01:19.500> not<00:01:19.619> killing<00:01:19.920> him<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.400> with

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
some damage for not killing him but with
