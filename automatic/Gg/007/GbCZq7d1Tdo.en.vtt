00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.270
 just finished after the earth 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:35.610
 after land to land the new movie of the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:41.160
 that call the protagonist im and has 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:51.110
 a very interesting concept to a 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:51.110
 great well worked through movie 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.829
 clichés there that will compete with the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.530
 throughout the film and who does not know the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.260
 work on the call and click here for 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.990
 to drive without sense that to me it's in the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.240
 Top 10 Best Movies I've Ever Seen 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.119
 after feeling the first film of the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.240
 his career has begun because from the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.369
 hence it was one of the films that 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.670
 so some disappointment for people 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.630
 that is not level 6 but which does not 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.970
 arrived on Monday and this is exactly 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.500
 This is a movie that is a good movie. 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.890
 It's a movie with a movie with him that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.360
 entertained moment works with the idea 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.979
 fear that is a recurring theme in a 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.079
 the work of the director of mexico with a 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.509
 work with fear study of a fear in 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.130
 human being in a very interesting way with 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.130
 a very interesting concept 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:02:00.540
 all of a sudden it's working out situations that 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:03.689
 would develop that concept is and spoke 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.310
 A little about the actors I need is 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.920
 theoretically the main character of the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.120
 film through the film would be the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.720
 a son of the same and the boy he 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.440
 the ngp subject but it did not lack as well 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.569
 Because you have a competence, it's for 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.600
 hold an entire movie like 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.160
 protagonist and was really sure 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.160
 will come after the movie will only have 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.750
 coined with smith, is that the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.100
 books is also another guy who is not a 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.959
 excellent actor but he is very 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.569
 charismatic and every time it appears in the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.340
 screen it calls this face of a pro the 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.290
 he character technically 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.239
 character has turned into sport is already 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.860
 something that is revealed in the first 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.580
 minutes of the movie he is a guy who does not 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.410
 afraid 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.420
 I want you not afraid of having 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.810
 characteristics is theoretically 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.819
 thing that is dehumanizing dehumanizing ia né 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.590
 the character was a guy who does not have 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.049
 Fear, it 's difficult, we grow. 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.850
 since your character because why 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.580
 Everyone is scared right? 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.220
 but I avoided the charismatic who neither 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.060
 creating characters come and go without 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:19.859
 fear he can be closer to the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:21.450
 people afraid of a yesterday's 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.820
 known for driving well in actors 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.750
 infantile snows of meaning he can 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:31.260
 work the kid that does not compromise 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.840
 the film but it can not load 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.840
 the team in the back and also in the film 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.970
 summing up or summary of the opera is a movie 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.470
 What the fuck is a good movie that causes 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.900
 entertainment has a concept 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:55.100
 interesting it could have been very 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:59.000
 better but it 's a movie that the 2 hours there 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.000
 two weeks ago 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:10.680
 the movie is good, good sense, not much 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.250
 good and excellent 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.250
 also not bad 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:26.610
 it's a very special movie are not 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:32.669
 spectacular but not enough 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:47.419
 So the movie looks like money or 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:47.419
 trembling that the director was the 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.970
 movie is a good movie 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:00.539
 another movie thing 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:02.430
 suddenly if you had passed you 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.080
 you want to see also you will not regret 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.590
 will not suffer in the movie does not have will 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:12.710
 to get out of having a good good football movie 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.710
 but I think it was almost
