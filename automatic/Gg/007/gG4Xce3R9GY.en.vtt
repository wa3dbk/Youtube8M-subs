00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 I have all together today for you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.600
 a simple and natural make-up 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.189
 tutorial I think it is therefore 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.929
 It is very good for the school so it is 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.240
 about the make-up that I used to 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.700
 I have always made make-up today 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.890
 the perfect medical skin like cream 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.300
 garnier and as you can see me too 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.369
 already used a lot of it 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.390
 I love this baby cream is mine 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.279
 darling from the drugstore 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.619
 The only disadvantage is the color selection 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.180
 There is no big one there 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.130
 namely only two colors and that is 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.170
 now the brighter it is 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.820
 admitted a chunk too dark for 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.960
 I'm sure if I'm with the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.390
 blindfolded 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.309
 that's why it takes time 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.660
 but when incorporated in the skin 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.550
 is you really nice 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.550
 moisture and I like it 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.140
 As a concealer I use the cut called 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.640
 camouflage concealer i think i have 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.830
 the longer time not mentioned but 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.240
 I still love that and I think so 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.440
 great that I suck the under on 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.460
 can wear and also on 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.160
 skin blemishes 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.170
 I believe in particularly dry skin 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.360
 is not so good among the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.420
 eyes but that's the case with my skin 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.550
 really quite well and dries the eyes 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.590
 does not happen that is all 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.860
 I use powder and I use it 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.760
 that's gonna be mineral powder that's the one 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.979
 color 0 1% and the brother is easy 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.720
 one of my absolute favorites so it 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.090
 covers such a small one again 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.100
 bit off it has a very nice 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.610
 consistency and by the way I carry that 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.470
 powder with the powder brush of patrice 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.869
 So all the drugstore products you like 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.160
 Look so that it stays nice then 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.830
 I know my eyebrows like this 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.660
 Just a little bit around her like that 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.670
 sort of newer next 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.470
 I use the food sybase partly set 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.420
 This is a great time for the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.979
 eyebrows are true because of course 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.229
 the colors are bright 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.300
 I also have the longer version of 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.820
 the brother and I hope always 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.360
 from the two colors so my boys so 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.360
 together 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.690
 and then we come to mine 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.060
 eyeshadow palette I am today 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.650
 I will never use the school 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.270
 worn a lot of eyeshadow 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.180
 just a little bit 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.770
 something about the songs a bit too 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.959
 to bring shine and I find nix 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.790
 palette is very good because 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.200
 which is not particularly limited 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.330
 and that will determine some people 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.070
 disturb if you are such a really 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.930
 but want to have strong eye make-up 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.209
 I think the class for the school so 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.750
 reads something like the news palette 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.060
 Katies then my very first 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.970
 kajalstift of all times that is the of 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.739
 in the color 008 teddy that is 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.420
 in my opinion, really beautiful 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.060
 brown with his light yes so 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.350
 thoroughly golden gloss maybe and 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.080
 I've always liked to so as 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.239
 channel as eyeliner as anything 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.920
 used as eyeshadow everything 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.200
 tried and I do not always come 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.180
 back to that color back then 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.950
 I bring my eyelashes with the 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.560
 eyelash curler by rossmann in shape like 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.630
 said all the drugstore products that is 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.050
 cheap and I think she fulfills her 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.030
 purpose as a mascara I use that 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.769
 cover by patrice she has a great 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.750
 great little brush I think that has one 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.380
 interesting shape and she works 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.900
 really good 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.060
 she is special again 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.769
 dramatically still completely natural 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.590
 just a nice everyday mascara and 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.269
 for 34 euros so I think that's real 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.980
 worth your money and she has the momentum 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.430
 because I use the waterproof formulation 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.320
 used 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.360
 next comes the eat city ​​touch 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.130
 meat allocated as in color 50 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.780
 that is really just a very bright one 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.180
 color and I think that's great for the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.799
 school because i used to go to school 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.170
 have worn and then only really so 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.940
 a very bright tone and for the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.670
 I use the lips in the parteilos 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.769
 the color strawberry party that is one 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.660
 beautiful colors relatively natural 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.370
 but still gives it a bit of color 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.200
 on the lips and it just tastes good 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.660
 I do not think that's really nice 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.739
 a bit sweet and I am us 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.430
 that's really scary at the moment 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.959
 with pleasure 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.910
 and last of course only if you 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.260
 I still have blue mascara 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.690
 not have the previously added to 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.100
 worn but I'm the idea quite cool 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.740
 and there are the make-up again 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.140
 something different 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.820
 Touch and so on sees the end of 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.430
 make-up look i hope so 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.640
 do you like it and it is not 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.640
 times
