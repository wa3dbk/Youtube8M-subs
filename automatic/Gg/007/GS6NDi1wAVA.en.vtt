00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.350
 farmer practice test 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.380
 easily quick triple combinations 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.450
 are in full swing 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.270
 They allow high impact force with 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.830
 manageable drive power 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.810
 pettinger offers two in this segment 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.700
 new butterflies with working widths 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.550
 up to eleven meters 20 at 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.720
 we have the small renova cat s 10 in 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.910
 tested in practice 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.520
 The manufacturer waives these 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.260
 consciously switch to a preparer 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.430
 the weight and the power requirement 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.590
 to keep low 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.269
 in the test we have the good nine meters 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.629
 Wide combination with tractors 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.979
 between 160 and 220 ps 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.510
 we are among them all 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.210
 conditions very good 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.129
 managed as a fitting front 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.299
 mower, pöttinger presented us with the nova 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.370
 cat 301 alpha motion available 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:57.799
 the bar presents itself flat and 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.320
 slim behind work eight slices 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.920
 on each side of the front mower are 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.839
 it's seven 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.519
 the sound can be over 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.330
 Quick change system very easy 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.460
 change 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.280
 A sturdy box on the right side 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.079
 provides space for reserve sound the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.990
 outer discs turn inwards 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.909
 everyone else in pairs to each other 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.880
 the grass is laid wide 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.740
 Four rotating discs guide the front 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.860
 the feed stream between the tractor 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.290
 bikes 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.930
 the stern more are hung in the middle and 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.370
 hydraulically relieved the pad 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.890
 weight can be adjusted for each side 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.780
 separate easy and comfortable with 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.410
 a double-acting control unit 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.630
 to adjust 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.210
 also working on insurance 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.280
 hydraulically a bar comes on 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.840
 obstacle waved back and will 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.270
 thereby slightly raised 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.990
 We were very happy with the quality 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.180
 satisfied 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.640
 the big commutes off allows one 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.950
 good soil adaptation even when wet 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.470
 conditions leaves the nowak at s 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.690
 10 no marks even better 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.280
 it made the front mower the alpha 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.410
 motion suspension allows one 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.880
 excellent ground adaptation in all 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.520
 directions even at high altitudes 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.160
 driving speed our test drivers 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.500
 were delighted the relief springs 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.120
 are integrated in the cultivation blog that 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.140
 Overlap weight is set by the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.660
 bias 1 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.840
 the system works independently of the 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.090
 tractor hydraulics the rear mowers 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.520
 can be individually or individually as needed 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.410
 Synchronous lifting with a toggle switch 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.080
 you choose the different works 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.700
 Mechanisms before lifting the will 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.280
 Bars with a stabilization 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.080
 Cylinder fixed due to the large 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.549
 Working width will be the two wings 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.739
 for roads rides backwards 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.110
 swung while the front flap 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.030
 Protection wipes automatically that high 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.360
 reduces the transport width to two 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.700
 meter 20 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.800
 but be careful to relieve the mower bars 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.380
 the front axle and protrude far 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.270
 in the back, in tight corners you should 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.220
 never forget that 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.220
 under the line leaves the nowak 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.720
 at s 10 a very good overall impression 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.880
 a light and yet very fast 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.250
 powerful combination with 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.020
 excellent floor accommodation these 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.710
 quality is good for böttinger 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.930
 pay 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.810

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.400
 is included at around 34,000 euros 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.480
