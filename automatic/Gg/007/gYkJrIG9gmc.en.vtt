tablets<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.410> part<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.950> bundle<00:00:14.370> it's<00:00:14.549> made

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
tablets this part is a bundle it's made

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.790 
tablets this part is a bundle it's made
up<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.030> five<00:00:15.269> different<00:00:15.570> sub<00:00:16.020> components<00:00:16.619> so

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
up of five different sub components so

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.650 
up of five different sub components so
when<00:00:17.009> you<00:00:17.279> receive<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:18.000> are<00:00:18.180> going<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.539> get

two holes already pre-drilled in to the

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.190 
two holes already pre-drilled in to the
top<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.700> also<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.420> steel<00:01:06.780> curved

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
top and you also have this steel curved

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.340 
top and you also have this steel curved
plate<00:01:07.590> you're<00:01:08.189> gonna<00:01:08.310> find<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.000> two<00:01:09.840> holes<00:01:10.080> on

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
plate you're gonna find the two holes on

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.830 
plate you're gonna find the two holes on
the<00:01:10.920> outer<00:01:11.159> part<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.090> plate<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.689> those

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.510 
the outer part of that plate so those
two<00:01:13.080> holes<00:01:13.260> right<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:13.590> those<00:01:14.310> are<00:01:14.430> gonna

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
two holes right there those are gonna

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.670 
two holes right there those are gonna
line<00:01:14.850> up<00:01:14.880> with<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> holes<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.110> top<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.560> the

it comes with nuts and bolts to attach

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.969 
it comes with nuts and bolts to attach
that<00:01:35.640> piece<00:01:35.970> as<00:01:36.210> well<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.869> that'll<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.590> go

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
that piece as well and that'll just go

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.649 
that piece as well and that'll just go
right<00:01:38.220> onto<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.640> top<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.119> steel<00:01:39.360> curved

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
right onto the top of the steel curved

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.590 
right onto the top of the steel curved
plate<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.290> once<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.250> finished

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
plate so that once you have finished

plate so that once you have finished
your<00:01:42.600> suction<00:01:43.020> cup<00:01:43.409> base<00:01:43.650> is<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.490> look

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
your suction cup base is going to look

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.880 
your suction cup base is going to look
like<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.740> preassembled<00:01:46.740> I

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
like this one that I have preassembled I

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.289 
like this one that I have preassembled I
have<00:01:47.130> those<00:01:47.280> two<00:01:47.490> suction<00:01:47.880> cups<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
bottom that curve plate is attached to

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.880 
bottom that curve plate is attached to
the<00:01:50.970> top<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.390> finally<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.110> round<00:01:52.380> plate<00:01:52.680> is

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
the top and finally that round plate is

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.179 
the top and finally that round plate is
on<00:01:53.130> there<00:01:53.399> as<00:01:53.549> well<00:01:53.610> at<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:55.680> other<00:01:55.829> end<00:01:56.100> you

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
on there as well at the other end you

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.520 
on there as well at the other end you
have<00:01:56.490> your<00:01:57.060> tablet<00:01:57.570> cradle<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.290> there's

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
have your tablet cradle and there's

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.050 
have your tablet cradle and there's
three<00:01:58.740> parts<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.280> one<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.880> this

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
three parts to this one you have this

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.660 
three parts to this one you have this
backing<00:02:00.750> which<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.140> called<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.530> spine<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.219> you

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
backing which is called a spine and you

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.700 
backing which is called a spine and you
have<00:02:02.820> these<00:02:03.030> two<00:02:03.570> end<00:02:03.810> pieces<00:02:04.079> which<00:02:04.560> are

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
have these two end pieces which are

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.340 
have these two end pieces which are
called<00:02:04.860> support<00:02:05.399> cups<00:02:05.700> these<00:02:06.689> support<00:02:07.110> cups

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
called support cups these support cups

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.520 
called support cups these support cups
fit<00:02:07.680> onto<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.160> top<00:02:08.519> and<00:02:08.820> bottom<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:10.110> spine

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
fit onto the top and bottom of the spine

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.199 
fit onto the top and bottom of the spine
so<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.009> once<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.700> them<00:02:11.910> attached

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
so that once you have them attached

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.610 
so that once you have them attached
they're<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.020> look<00:02:13.170> like<00:02:13.349> this<00:02:13.560> and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
they're going to look like this and
