just break it up a little bit and that's

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.460 
just break it up a little bit and that's
going<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.010> go<00:02:06.130> right<00:02:06.370> in<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:07.350> then<00:02:08.350> our

going to go right in and then our

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.010 
going to go right in and then our
cucumbers<00:02:09.100> I<00:02:09.310> like<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.000> slice<00:02:10.270> these<00:02:10.479> on<00:02:10.720> the

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
cucumbers I like to slice these on the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.130 
cucumbers I like to slice these on the
bias<00:02:11.230> which<00:02:11.590> just<00:02:11.860> means<00:02:12.040> sort<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:13.020> on<00:02:14.020> a

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
bias which just means sort of on a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.200 
bias which just means sort of on a
diagonal<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:14.980> get<00:02:15.130> like<00:02:15.310> nice<00:02:15.700> large

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
diagonal so you get like nice large

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.480 
diagonal so you get like nice large
chunks<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:16.930> your<00:02:17.230> cucumber<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:21.310> we're<00:02:21.430> going
