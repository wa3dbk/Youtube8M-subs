00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
sticks and styrofoam it's about a

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.429 
sticks and styrofoam it's about a
quarter<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.390> an<00:00:21.570> inch<00:00:21.660> maybe<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.020> little<00:00:22.199> less

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
quarter of an inch maybe a little less

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.470 
quarter of an inch maybe a little less
but<00:00:23.160> it's<00:00:23.369> actually<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> pretty<00:00:23.910> damn<00:00:24.180> solid

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
but it's actually a pretty damn solid

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.689 
but it's actually a pretty damn solid
the<00:00:25.320> popsicle<00:00:25.859> sticks<00:00:26.070> when<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.279> shoot<00:00:26.519> it

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
the popsicle sticks when you shoot it

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.370 
the popsicle sticks when you shoot it
barely<00:00:26.880> leave<00:00:27.210> at<00:00:27.359> them<00:00:27.510> which<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.869> very<00:00:28.080> good

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
barely leave at them which is very good

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.700 
barely leave at them which is very good
and<00:00:29.539> even<00:00:30.539> if<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.779> do<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.320> replace

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
and even if you do you can just replace

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.310 
and even if you do you can just replace
them<00:00:31.859> because<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.250> got<00:00:32.399> four<00:00:32.669> packs<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.450> only

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
them because I got four packs and only

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.979 
them because I got four packs and only
takes<00:00:34.559> two<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:35.040> only<00:00:35.370> use<00:00:35.579> 298<00:00:36.360> popsicle<00:00:36.780> sticks

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
takes two I only use 298 popsicle sticks

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.200 
takes two I only use 298 popsicle sticks
so<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.110> had<00:00:37.230> two<00:00:37.380> left<00:00:37.649> over<00:00:37.820> but<00:00:38.820> that's<00:00:38.969> all

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
so I had two left over but that's all

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.270 
so I had two left over but that's all
that's<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.290> exactly<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.920> same<00:00:41.040> way

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
that's if you do it exactly the same way

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.760 
that's if you do it exactly the same way
I<00:00:41.460> did<00:00:41.850> which<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.750> highly<00:00:42.899> doubt<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.469> you'll

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
be definitely the 290s maybe three

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.319 
be definitely the 290s maybe three
hundred<00:00:45.450> three<00:00:45.809> times<00:00:46.850> there's<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.910> dent<00:00:48.180> right

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
hundred three times there's a dent right

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.330 
hundred three times there's a dent right

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
only thing that can really break on this

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.020 
only thing that can really break on this
is<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.680> plastic<00:01:02.190> plates<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.670> bought<00:01:02.879> at

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
plexiglass so it's five plates thick

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.960 
plexiglass so it's five plates thick
which<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.020> about<00:01:10.409> half<00:01:10.710> an<00:01:10.860> inch<00:01:10.979> which<00:01:11.760> is

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
which is about half an inch which is

super<00:01:12.600> glued<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.430> won't<00:01:14.580> go<00:01:14.700> through<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
super glued and it won't go through the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.060 
super glued and it won't go through the
fifth<00:01:15.240> one<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.990> will<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.290> crack<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.560> but

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
fifth one it will just crack it but

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.420 
fifth one it will just crack it but
barely

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
barely

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.490 
barely
and<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.270> handle<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.689> about<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:18.960> allen<00:01:19.350> key

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
and that handle is about like allen key

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.170

wrench<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.070> super<00:01:20.400> glued<00:01:20.490> those<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.970> its

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
wrench is I super glued those to its

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.859 
wrench is I super glued those to its
tape<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.640> just<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.759> know<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.180> reinforce<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.840> so

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
tape so just you know to reinforce it so

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.070

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
it doesn't come out but it's pretty good

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.560 
it doesn't come out but it's pretty good
and<00:01:28.229> when<00:01:28.560> those<00:01:28.710> plates<00:01:28.950> break<00:01:29.299> you<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.390> just

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and when those plates break you can just

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.800
