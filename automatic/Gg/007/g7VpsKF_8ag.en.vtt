for<00:01:20.390> example<00:01:20.930> you<00:01:21.440> have<00:01:21.620> the<00:01:21.860> daylight<00:01:22.280> input

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
for example you have the daylight input

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.090 
for example you have the daylight input
which<00:01:23.660> will<00:01:23.810> be<00:01:23.960> on<00:01:24.140> when<00:01:24.410> it<00:01:24.530> is<00:01:24.680> daytime

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
which will be on when it is daytime

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.250 
which will be on when it is daytime

here we can see the locks on cloud
mailer<00:01:47.900> which<00:01:48.440> is<00:01:48.620> our<00:01:48.740> free<00:01:49.010> email<00:01:49.250> service

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
mailer which is our free email service

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.790 
mailer which is our free email service
so<00:01:50.330> you<00:01:50.390> can<00:01:50.600> send<00:01:50.750> emails<00:01:51.170> with<00:01:51.380> electricity

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
so you can send emails with electricity

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.000 
so you can send emails with electricity
consumption<00:01:52.430> for<00:01:52.790> example<00:01:53.680> finally<00:01:54.680> you<00:01:54.860> can
