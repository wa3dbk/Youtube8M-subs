 19 early 20th century were installed 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.579
 in our area they came with the imprint 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.039
 of tilling the earth with industry 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.620
 metalworking but foreign in their 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.930
 cultural patterns and delivery by the way 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.730
 the typical carneada that is performed 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.030
 still in many fields of our 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.770

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.210
 those emigrants and the grandchildren of 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.220
 those immigrants came up 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.659
 the town and they found in the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.229
 elaboration with 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:26.079
 same recipe from the grandfather this salami that 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.569
 ended up being an industry today 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.899
 important with 21 establishments that 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:33.729

 Argentina and this club is 36 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:42.969

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:46.000
 Allied force with work and with 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:49.060
 gastronomic culture in this party that 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.170
 ends up having as main dish the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.179
 typical salame field that sincerely 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.549
 It is good taste for many palates 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:00.099
 at least of those who can 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.469

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:04.479

 process the only thing that a healthy one is a 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.319
 meat much more girl the one that came 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.230
 you had previously slaughtered 30 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.750
 animals in these slaughter 25 animals and 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.700
 the product of this task ends up being 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.000
 what is going to corner 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.569
 the day of the party on the plate 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.660
 entrance and the salami that was slaughtered makes 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.569
 32 days ago, good, you will surely 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.300
 they will be able to see the images of the 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.239
 natural maturation process that 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.310
 realizes that it takes approximately 45 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.260
 days until they can be 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.569
 tasting and they are in the best 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.640
 conditions of bone maturation 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.890
 as the grandparents of the brand of the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.630
 piedmont this disarming the ass of the 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.880
 kun and the salame good but instead of being 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.180
 matured by the normal process of 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.390
 ripening that takes 45 days after 45 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.000
 days boil it and it ends up being good 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.980
 a product as good as the one 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.349
 surely you will be able to taste today in 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.319
 the grill because they are the same as 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:20.530
 they also grill and what good 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.970

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.110
 we found later for you to tell us 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.720
 of all the projects you have for 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.790
 this city that remain the center 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.410
 of attraction of all the companies that 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.940
 they are going through the country I throw a 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.850
 look and as creative as 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.240
 besides the salame that identifies it in 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.500
 the metalworking industry 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.750
 certainly the work culture has 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.540
 what to do with the genetics of the objectives 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.890
 and by the way we honor 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.380
