more teeth per inch you need it costs a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.530 
more teeth per inch you need it costs a
lot<00:01:12.290> better<00:01:12.530> if<00:01:12.860> you<00:01:12.950> have<00:01:13.070> more<00:01:13.250> teeth

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
lot better if you have more teeth

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
off getting a decent maker blade if you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.190 
off getting a decent maker blade if you
get<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.130> really<00:01:22.340> cheap<00:01:22.700> one<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:23.780> may<00:01:23.960> struggle

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
get a really cheap one you may struggle

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.860 
get a really cheap one you may struggle
cutting<00:01:24.860> your<00:01:25.040> material<00:01:25.550> so<00:01:26.300> before<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:26.720> can

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
cutting your material so before you can

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.150 
cutting your material so before you can
use<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.170> axe<00:01:27.320> are<00:01:27.530> you<00:01:27.680> need<00:01:27.800> to<00:01:27.830> put<00:01:28.070> the

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
use the axe are you need to put the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.700 
use the axe are you need to put the
blade<00:01:28.400> in<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.670> correct<00:01:29.270> way<00:01:29.330> around<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:30.620> we

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
blade in the correct way around so we

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.430 
blade in the correct way around so we
need<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:30.950> look<00:01:31.100> at<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.340> teeth<00:01:31.580> and<00:01:32.350> if<00:01:33.350> you

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
need to look at the teeth and if you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.170 
need to look at the teeth and if you
look<00:01:33.590> at<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.770> teeth<00:01:34.010> on<00:01:34.340> that<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:34.820> can<00:01:35.000> see

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
look at the teeth on that you can see

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.350 
look at the teeth on that you can see
that<00:01:35.390> they<00:01:35.480> are<00:01:35.510> pointing<00:01:36.110> forwards<00:01:37.240> so<00:01:38.240> when

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
that they are pointing forwards so when

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.870 
that they are pointing forwards so when
you<00:01:38.450> come<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:38.630> fit<00:01:38.900> a<00:01:38.930> new<00:01:39.290> blade<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:40.640> need<00:01:40.790> to

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
you come to fit a new blade you need to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.820 
you come to fit a new blade you need to
ensure<00:01:41.150> that<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.540> teeth<00:01:41.810> on<00:01:42.110> that<00:01:42.170> are<00:01:42.650> also

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
ensure that the teeth on that are also

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.050 
ensure that the teeth on that are also
pointing<00:01:43.580> forwards<00:01:45.070> because<00:01:46.070> an<00:01:46.700> axe<00:01:46.850> are

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
pointing forwards because an axe are

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.970 
pointing forwards because an axe are
only<00:01:47.300> actually<00:01:47.510> courts<00:01:48.020> on<00:01:48.230> the<00:01:48.590> file<00:01:48.830> which

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
only actually courts on the file which

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.360 
only actually courts on the file which
dog<00:01:49.310> it<00:01:49.580> doesn't<00:01:49.820> cut<00:01:50.030> on<00:01:50.300> the<00:01:50.390> backwards<00:01:50.750> dog

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.310 

you<00:02:07.060> can<00:02:07.210> then<00:02:07.390> lift<00:02:07.810> off<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.290> blade<00:02:09.990> and<00:02:10.990> you

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
you can then lift off the blade and you

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.160 
you can then lift off the blade and you
can<00:02:11.470> then<00:02:11.650> check<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.580> direction<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.600> the

can then check the direction of the
teeth<00:02:14.410> on<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.860> new<00:02:14.980> blade<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:16.720> can<00:02:16.900> fit

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
teeth on the new blade and you can fit

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.760 
teeth on the new blade and you can fit
your<00:02:17.830> new<00:02:18.070> blade<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.730> then<00:02:19.060> tension<00:02:19.780> the

your new blade and then tension the
blade<00:02:21.040> again<00:02:22.710> when<00:02:23.710> you<00:02:23.800> come<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.130> tension<00:02:24.520> it

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
blade again when you come to tension it

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.880 
blade again when you come to tension it
you<00:02:25.450> need<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:27.040> blade<00:02:27.340> tight<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:29.710> don't

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
you need the blade tight but you don't

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.740 
you need the blade tight but you don't
want<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.130> too<00:02:30.310> tight<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:30.970> snaps<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:34.510> I'm

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
want it too tight that it snaps so I'm

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.450 
want it too tight that it snaps so I'm
just<00:02:34.930> tightening<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.470> thumb<00:02:35.650> screw<00:02:35.950> now<00:02:36.160> and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
just tightening the thumb screw now and

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.530 
just tightening the thumb screw now and
that<00:02:37.030> blade<00:02:37.330> is<00:02:37.630> now<00:02:38.610> pretty<00:02:39.610> tight<00:02:39.970> in<00:02:40.180> there

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
that blade is now pretty tight in there

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.940 
that blade is now pretty tight in there
which<00:02:40.660> is<00:02:40.840> what<00:02:40.990> you<00:02:41.080> want<00:02:41.290> you're<00:02:41.590> going<00:02:41.800> to

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
which is what you want you're going to

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.480 
which is what you want you're going to
loose<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.610> can<00:02:42.820> correlate<00:02:43.120> with<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:44.490> once

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
loose you can correlate with it once

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.400 
loose you can correlate with it once
you've<00:02:45.670> finished<00:02:45.850> using<00:02:46.210> your<00:02:46.390> axe<00:02:46.660> are<00:02:46.930> it's

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
you've finished using your axe are it's

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.130 
you've finished using your axe are it's
a<00:02:47.500> good<00:02:47.650> idea<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:48.040> slacken<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:49.570> knot<00:02:49.840> off<00:02:50.110> a

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
a good idea to slacken that knot off a

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.530 
a good idea to slacken that knot off a
couple<00:02:50.560> of<00:02:50.710> turns<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.820> source<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.240> blade

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
couple of turns the source of the blade

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.900 
couple of turns the source of the blade
isn't<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:53.350> detention<00:02:53.710> when<00:02:54.100> you<00:02:54.160> put<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.430> away

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
isn't on detention when you put it away

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.180 
isn't on detention when you put it away
that<00:02:55.510> way<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.750> bleed<00:02:56.140> will<00:02:56.530> last<00:02:56.770> as<00:02:56.980> long<00:02:57.130> as

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
that way you bleed will last as long as

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.400 
that way you bleed will last as long as
possible<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:01.120> I'll<00:03:01.210> just<00:03:01.330> remove<00:03:01.630> that<00:03:02.200> this

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
possible so I'll just remove that this

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.340 
possible so I'll just remove that this
blade<00:03:03.060> I'll<00:03:04.060> just<00:03:04.240> show<00:03:04.450> you<00:03:04.510> something<00:03:05.290> else

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
blade I'll just show you something else

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.890 
blade I'll just show you something else
that<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:05.680> can<00:03:05.800> do<00:03:05.980> with<00:03:06.400> more<00:03:06.730> stacked<00:03:07.000> cells

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.600 

this<00:03:10.900> particular<00:03:11.260> one<00:03:11.620> has<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:11.980> screw<00:03:12.400> there<00:03:12.670> a

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
this particular one has a screw there a

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.310 
this particular one has a screw there a
lot<00:03:15.610> of<00:03:15.730> axles<00:03:16.480> don't<00:03:16.750> actually<00:03:17.050> up<00:03:17.170> this

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
lot of axles don't actually up this

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.290 
lot of axles don't actually up this
screw<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:17.739> can<00:03:17.920> just<00:03:18.070> lift<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.640> part<00:03:18.880> of<00:03:19.209> the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
screw you can just lift this part of the

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.070 
screw you can just lift this part of the
outside<00:03:19.660> straight<00:03:19.959> off

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.370 

so<00:03:26.080> I'll<00:03:26.140> lift<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.590> off<00:03:27.570> you<00:03:28.570> can<00:03:28.750> see<00:03:28.959> that

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
so I'll lift that off you can see that

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.210 
so I'll lift that off you can see that
I've<00:03:29.470> used<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.970> top<00:03:31.239> part<00:03:31.540> of<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.290> XR<00:03:32.709> to

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
I've used the top part of the XR to

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.060 
I've used the top part of the XR to
store<00:03:33.520> some<00:03:33.970> new<00:03:34.150> blade<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:35.620> way<00:03:35.800> if<00:03:35.950> you're

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
store some new blade that way if you're

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.660 
store some new blade that way if you're
going<00:03:36.220> anywhere

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
going anywhere

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.630 
going anywhere
you've<00:03:37.450> always<00:03:37.660> got<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:37.959> spur<00:03:38.320> blade<00:03:38.620> on<00:03:38.920> yet<00:03:39.130> so

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
you've always got a spur blade on yet so

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.550 
you've always got a spur blade on yet so
you<00:03:39.730> can<00:03:39.880> always<00:03:40.090> store<00:03:40.360> spur<00:03:40.870> blades<00:03:41.170> in<00:03:41.440> the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
you can always store spur blades in the

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.850 
you can always store spur blades in the
top<00:03:41.800> of<00:03:42.010> most<00:03:42.310> axles<00:03:43.200> if<00:03:44.200> you<00:03:44.380> look<00:03:44.560> on<00:03:44.739> this

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
top of most axles if you look on this

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.620 
top of most axles if you look on this
side<00:03:44.920> of<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.520> axe<00:03:45.670> are<00:03:45.910> you'll<00:03:46.300> see<00:03:46.360> that

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
side of the axe are you'll see that

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.130 
side of the axe are you'll see that
there<00:03:46.810> are<00:03:47.020> two<00:03:47.440> more<00:03:47.709> pins<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.870> we<00:03:49.900> can

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
there are two more pins and we can

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.620 
there are two more pins and we can
locate<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:51.070> blade<00:03:51.340> on<00:03:51.640> those<00:03:52.030> pins<00:03:52.330> if<00:03:52.510> we

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
locate the blade on those pins if we

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.050 
locate the blade on those pins if we
want<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.110> then<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:53.980> contention<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.820> blade

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
want and then the contention the blade

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.940 
want and then the contention the blade
again<00:03:58.140> fifth<00:03:59.140> in<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.350> blade<00:03:59.590> in<00:03:59.890> that

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
again fifth in the blade in that

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.220 
again fifth in the blade in that
position<00:04:00.519> is<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.760> good<00:04:00.880> idea<00:04:01.120> if<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:01.870> need<00:04:02.110> to

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
position is a good idea if you need to

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.530 
position is a good idea if you need to
cut<00:04:02.440> off<00:04:02.620> something<00:04:02.950> that's<00:04:03.580> close<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.209> wall

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
cut off something that's close to a wall

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.900 
cut off something that's close to a wall
or<00:04:04.810> an<00:04:05.019> object<00:04:05.440> if<00:04:06.220> you<00:04:06.400> fit<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:06.700> blade

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
or an object if you fit the blade

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.820 
or an object if you fit the blade
perfectly<00:04:07.540> straight<00:04:07.810> you<00:04:08.230> can<00:04:08.440> get<00:04:08.650> in

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
perfectly straight you can get in

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.270 
perfectly straight you can get in
because<00:04:09.250> of<00:04:09.489> your<00:04:09.640> actual<00:04:10.030> knuckles<00:04:11.160> but<00:04:12.160> if

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
because of your actual knuckles but if

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.370 
because of your actual knuckles but if
you<00:04:12.400> put<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.730> blade<00:04:12.940> in<00:04:13.210> the<00:04:14.080> other<00:04:14.230> position

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
you put the blade in the other position

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.420 
you put the blade in the other position
you<00:04:15.190> can

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
you can

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.699 
you can
getting<00:04:15.670> quite<00:04:16.150> lost<00:04:16.479> at<00:04:16.750> our<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.410> you<00:04:17.530> could

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
getting quite lost at our and you could

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.340 
getting quite lost at our and you could
actually<00:04:17.829> cut<00:04:18.280> that<00:04:18.430> off<00:04:18.639> and<00:04:18.989> your<00:04:19.989> knuckles

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
actually cut that off and your knuckles

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.260 
actually cut that off and your knuckles
are<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:21.009> considerable<00:04:21.639> distance<00:04:21.850> away<00:04:22.120> from

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
are a considerable distance away from

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.770 
are a considerable distance away from
the<00:04:22.539> actual<00:04:22.840> surface<00:04:24.270> so<00:04:25.270> that's<00:04:25.419> our<00:04:25.570> bunt

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
the actual surface so that's our bunt

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.810 
the actual surface so that's our bunt
edge<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.139> being<00:04:26.320> able<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.590> set<00:04:26.889> the<00:04:27.220> blade<00:04:27.520> in

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
edge of being able to set the blade in

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.240 
edge of being able to set the blade in
the<00:04:27.880> overt<00:04:28.389> position<00:04:28.930> we<00:04:29.830> are<00:04:29.860> now<00:04:30.009> going<00:04:30.190> to

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
the overt position we are now going to

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.210 
the overt position we are now going to
cut<00:04:30.490> this<00:04:30.850> piece<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.330> 20<00:04:31.990> millimeter<00:04:32.710> square

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
cut this piece of 20 millimeter square

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.020 
cut this piece of 20 millimeter square
steel<00:04:33.610> by<00:04:35.190> when<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.280> come<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:36.580> using<00:04:36.910> your

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
steel by when you come to using your

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.670 
steel by when you come to using your
back<00:04:37.150> so<00:04:37.360> it's<00:04:37.630> important<00:04:38.110> that<00:04:38.139> your<00:04:38.470> lit

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
back so it's important that your lit

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.330 
back so it's important that your lit
with<00:04:38.860> two<00:04:38.889> outs<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:41.740> importantly

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
with two outs and this importantly

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.010 
with two outs and this importantly
comfortable<00:04:43.000> when<00:04:43.210> you're<00:04:43.330> solving<00:04:43.539> as<00:04:43.840> well

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
comfortable when you're solving as well

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.560 
comfortable when you're solving as well
so<00:04:44.740> when<00:04:45.100> you're<00:04:45.250> sawing<00:04:45.460> it's<00:04:46.000> important

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
so when you're sawing it's important

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.629 
so when you're sawing it's important
that<00:04:46.600> you<00:04:46.780> get<00:04:46.930> big<00:04:47.259> long<00:04:47.800> strokes<00:04:48.250> you<00:04:48.490> don't

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
that you get big long strokes you don't

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.420 
that you get big long strokes you don't
want<00:04:48.789> to<00:04:48.849> be<00:04:48.970> doing<00:04:49.320> small<00:04:50.320> strokes<00:04:50.979> like<00:04:51.190> that

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
want to be doing small strokes like that

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.129 
want to be doing small strokes like that
just<00:04:51.699> using<00:04:52.030> a<00:04:52.120> portion<00:04:52.419> of<00:04:52.599> the<00:04:52.720> blade<00:04:52.960> it's

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
just using a portion of the blade it's

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.320 
just using a portion of the blade it's
important<00:04:53.560> that<00:04:53.590> you<00:04:53.740> use<00:04:53.800> as<00:04:54.669> much<00:04:54.940> of<00:04:55.210> the

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
important that you use as much of the

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.990 
important that you use as much of the
blade<00:04:55.570> as<00:04:55.840> possible<00:04:56.320> that<00:04:57.160> way<00:04:57.370> you'll<00:04:57.759> get

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
blade as possible that way you'll get

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.830 
blade as possible that way you'll get
the<00:04:58.330> most<00:04:58.599> value<00:04:59.349> I'll<00:04:59.530> see<00:04:59.680> you<00:04:59.800> blade<00:05:00.840> one

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
the most value I'll see you blade one

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.420 
the most value I'll see you blade one
thing<00:05:02.080> you'll<00:05:02.199> find<00:05:02.229> is<00:05:02.680> that<00:05:02.949> if<00:05:03.039> your<00:05:03.160> blade

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
thing you'll find is that if your blade

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.279 
thing you'll find is that if your blade
actually<00:05:03.849> snaps<00:05:04.180> and<00:05:04.509> you<00:05:04.570> come<00:05:05.020> to<00:05:05.139> put

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
actually snaps and you come to put

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.290 
actually snaps and you come to put
another<00:05:05.470> blade<00:05:05.770> it's<00:05:06.460> extremely<00:05:07.120> difficult

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
another blade it's extremely difficult

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.180 
another blade it's extremely difficult
getting<00:05:07.750> your<00:05:07.990> blade<00:05:08.380> down<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.979> existing

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
getting your blade down the existing

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.939 
getting your blade down the existing
course<00:05:09.699> that's<00:05:10.599> because<00:05:10.810> as<00:05:11.289> you<00:05:11.440> use<00:05:11.620> an<00:05:11.800> axe

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
course that's because as you use an axe

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.600 
course that's because as you use an axe
I'll<00:05:12.160> bleed<00:05:12.430> it<00:05:12.970> actually<00:05:13.360> was<00:05:13.720> thinner<00:05:14.580> so<00:05:15.580> I

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
I'll bleed it actually was thinner so I

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.040 
I'll bleed it actually was thinner so I
want<00:05:15.849> to<00:05:15.910> get<00:05:16.120> to<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.330> end<00:05:16.419> of<00:05:16.539> the<00:05:16.630> life<00:05:16.810> they

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
want to get to the end of the life they

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.990 
want to get to the end of the life they
do<00:05:17.199> tend<00:05:17.440> to<00:05:17.560> snap<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:18.190> then<00:05:18.310> you<00:05:18.400> need<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:18.639> fit

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
do tend to snap and then you need to fit

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.279 
do tend to snap and then you need to fit
a<00:05:19.210> new<00:05:19.270> blade<00:05:20.849> also<00:05:21.849> it's<00:05:22.449> important<00:05:22.990> to<00:05:23.139> get

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
a new blade also it's important to get

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.430 
a new blade also it's important to get
the<00:05:23.680> actual<00:05:24.039> cut<00:05:24.370> line<00:05:24.610> close<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:25.840> base<00:05:26.050> if

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
the actual cut line close to the base if

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.529 
the actual cut line close to the base if
you're<00:05:26.620> a<00:05:26.650> long<00:05:26.919> way<00:05:27.099> away<00:05:27.159> from<00:05:27.340> the<00:05:27.580> vise<00:05:27.880> you

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
you're a long way away from the vise you

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.600 
you're a long way away from the vise you
get<00:05:28.720> a<00:05:28.750> lot<00:05:28.960> of<00:05:29.080> vibration<00:05:29.800> and<00:05:29.830> you<00:05:30.130> can<00:05:30.340> call

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
get a lot of vibration and you can call

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.520 
get a lot of vibration and you can call
couplet<00:05:31.060> LLL<00:05:31.479> tell<00:05:31.780> you<00:05:31.810> forever

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
couplet LLL tell you forever

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.529 
couplet LLL tell you forever
so<00:05:32.889> I'll<00:05:32.949> actually<00:05:33.159> put<00:05:33.760> a<00:05:33.789> cut<00:05:34.030> line<00:05:34.210> unless

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
so I'll actually put a cut line unless

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.300 
so I'll actually put a cut line unless
I'm<00:05:34.659> just<00:05:34.840> going<00:05:34.990> to<00:05:35.050> sign<00:05:35.590> it<00:05:35.710> off<00:05:35.830> anywhere

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
I'm just going to sign it off anywhere

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.980 
I'm just going to sign it off anywhere
so<00:05:36.820> I'm<00:05:36.909> going<00:05:37.090> to<00:05:37.120> start<00:05:37.300> off<00:05:37.539> by<00:05:37.750> applying

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
so I'm going to start off by applying

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:45.270 
so I'm going to start off by applying
light<00:05:38.530> pressure<00:05:38.560> and<00:05:39.490> pushing<00:05:39.909> forwards<00:05:44.280> and

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
light pressure and pushing forwards and

00:05:45.280 --> 00:06:50.879 
light pressure and pushing forwards and
we've<00:05:45.460> now<00:05:45.639> started<00:05:46.000> at<00:05:46.539> course

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:53.290 

another<00:06:51.889> thing<00:06:52.430> you<00:06:52.550> can<00:06:52.669> do<00:06:52.759> with<00:06:52.879> an<00:06:52.969> axe<00:06:53.120> are

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300 
another thing you can do with an axe are

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.040 
another thing you can do with an axe are
is<00:06:53.569> to<00:06:53.719> turn<00:06:53.930> the<00:06:54.199> blade<00:06:54.439> upside<00:06:54.949> down<00:06:55.900> if<00:06:56.900> you

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
is to turn the blade upside down if you

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.260 
is to turn the blade upside down if you
imagine<00:06:57.259> this<00:06:57.500> piece<00:06:57.710> of<00:06:57.889> pipe<00:06:58.099> of<00:06:58.430> being<00:06:58.789> up

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
imagine this piece of pipe of being up

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.809 
imagine this piece of pipe of being up
close<00:06:59.330> to<00:07:00.020> the<00:07:00.110> ceiling<00:07:00.379> and<00:07:00.919> you<00:07:01.340> want<00:07:01.520> to<00:07:01.639> cut

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:01.819 
close to the ceiling and you want to cut

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:04.330 
close to the ceiling and you want to cut
it<00:07:02.000> if<00:07:02.270> you<00:07:02.810> cut<00:07:02.990> off<00:07:03.139> that<00:07:03.289> where<00:07:03.500> it's<00:07:04.069> a<00:07:04.159> bad

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340 
it if you cut off that where it's a bad

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.610 
it if you cut off that where it's a bad
idea<00:07:04.520> because<00:07:04.849> eventually<00:07:05.719> blade<00:07:06.199> will<00:07:06.469> get

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 
idea because eventually blade will get

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.040 
idea because eventually blade will get
trapped<00:07:06.919> Plus<00:07:07.759> you<00:07:07.939> actually<00:07:08.240> taking<00:07:08.930> the

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
trapped Plus you actually taking the

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.140 
trapped Plus you actually taking the
weight<00:07:09.229> of<00:07:09.560> the<00:07:09.680> axe<00:07:09.860> are<00:07:10.129> so<00:07:10.669> if<00:07:10.789> we<00:07:10.849> turn<00:07:11.030> the

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
weight of the axe are so if we turn the

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.700 
weight of the axe are so if we turn the
blade<00:07:11.389> upside<00:07:11.900> down<00:07:12.139> and<00:07:12.319> make<00:07:12.439> sure<00:07:12.590> the

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
blade upside down and make sure the

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:24.629 
blade upside down and make sure the
teeth<00:07:12.979> appointing<00:07:13.669> the<00:07:13.759> correct<00:07:14.060> way<00:07:14.210> and

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:28.980 

then<00:07:25.639> tension<00:07:26.120> the<00:07:26.240> blade<00:07:26.740> you<00:07:27.740> could<00:07:27.919> then

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:28.990 
then tension the blade you could then

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.379 
then tension the blade you could then
use<00:07:29.990> the<00:07:30.169> axe<00:07:30.319> all<00:07:30.560> like<00:07:31.099> that<00:07:31.400> and<00:07:32.120> in<00:07:32.270> that

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:32.389 
use the axe all like that and in that

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:33.519 
use the axe all like that and in that
position<00:07:32.539> you're<00:07:32.960> actually<00:07:33.259> cutting

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:33.529 
position you're actually cutting

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:35.499 
position you're actually cutting
downward<00:07:34.490> so<00:07:34.669> you're<00:07:34.789> not<00:07:34.879> taking<00:07:35.060> the<00:07:35.360> weight

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:35.509 
downward so you're not taking the weight

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:38.080 
downward so you're not taking the weight
of<00:07:35.810> the<00:07:35.960> axe<00:07:36.110> are<00:07:36.349> and<00:07:37.159> also<00:07:37.430> there's<00:07:37.969> less

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.090 
of the axe are and also there's less

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.820 
of the axe are and also there's less
chance<00:07:38.419> of<00:07:38.569> the<00:07:38.810> blade<00:07:39.080> actually<00:07:39.620> being

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:39.830 
chance of the blade actually being

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:45.309 
chance of the blade actually being
pinched<00:07:40.310> as<00:07:40.520> you<00:07:40.639> cut<00:07:40.819> through<00:07:44.229> when<00:07:45.229> you

00:07:45.309 --> 00:07:45.319 
pinched as you cut through when you

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:48.339 
pinched as you cut through when you
finish<00:07:45.590> using<00:07:45.770> your<00:07:46.009> exile<00:07:46.370> don't<00:07:46.789> forget<00:07:47.349> to

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:48.349 
finish using your exile don't forget to

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:52.330 
finish using your exile don't forget to
release<00:07:48.500> the<00:07:49.099> tension<00:07:49.340> on<00:07:49.789> the<00:07:49.879> blade
