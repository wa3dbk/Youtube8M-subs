between fury and chisora but both men
appear<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.119> focused<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.049> other<00:01:52.259> fights

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
instead and to be fair this makes sense

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.800 
instead and to be fair this makes sense
for<00:01:55.680> both<00:01:55.710> guys<00:01:56.130> neither<00:01:57.060> man<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.570> needs

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
to beat the other in order to prove

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.100 
to beat the other in order to prove
their<00:01:59.430> mettle<00:01:59.579> you<00:02:00.210> could<00:02:00.360> debate<00:02:00.600> over<00:02:00.899> who

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
their mettle you could debate over who

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.959 
their mettle you could debate over who
has<00:02:01.229> more<00:02:01.409> momentum<00:02:02.009> as<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> fighter<00:02:02.490> right<00:02:02.759> now

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
has more momentum as a fighter right now

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.789 
has more momentum as a fighter right now
but<00:02:03.240> regardless<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:04.140> would<00:02:04.259> appear<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.530> both

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
but regardless it would appear that both

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.410 
but regardless it would appear that both
men<00:02:05.009> are<00:02:05.040> pretty<00:02:05.340> much<00:02:05.520> finished<00:02:05.790> products

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
really worth the risk

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.640 
really worth the risk
that<00:02:13.030> he<00:02:13.150> himself<00:02:13.330> would<00:02:13.720> particularly<00:02:14.290> care

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
and for chisora he's kind of on his

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.290 
and for chisora he's kind of on his
third<00:02:17.590> rebirth<00:02:18.040> as<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.310> heavyweight<00:02:18.700> contender
