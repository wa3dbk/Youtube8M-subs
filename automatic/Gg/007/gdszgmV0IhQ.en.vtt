block<00:00:06.480> now<00:00:07.080> I'm<00:00:07.710> gonna<00:00:07.890> say<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.460> last

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
block now I'm gonna say this is the last

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.730 
block now I'm gonna say this is the last
update<00:00:08.910> before<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.420> final<00:00:09.719> update<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:10.260> am

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
update before the final update I am

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.589 
update before the final update I am
probably<00:00:11.040> 90%<00:00:11.940> done<00:00:12.059> with<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.420> rough

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
probably 90% done with the rough

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.079 
probably 90% done with the rough
exteriors<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.469> then<00:00:13.559> I'll<00:00:13.710> be<00:00:13.860> moving<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
exteriors and then I'll be moving to the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.640 
exteriors and then I'll be moving to the
interior<00:00:15.299> detail<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.699> the<00:00:17.699> exterior<00:00:18.090> detail

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
interior detail and the exterior detail

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.450 
interior detail and the exterior detail
so<00:00:19.650> yeah<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:21.180> five<00:00:21.689> floors<00:00:22.189> really<00:00:23.189> hard<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
so yeah it's five floors really hard to

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.269 
so yeah it's five floors really hard to
get<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.880> frame<00:00:24.740> where<00:00:25.740> I'm<00:00:25.830> recording

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
get this in frame where I'm recording

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.519 
get this in frame where I'm recording
this<00:00:26.369> right<00:00:26.490> now<00:00:26.730> am<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.630> my<00:00:27.779> Lego<00:00:28.080> building

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
this right now am I in my Lego building

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.089 
this right now am I in my Lego building
room<00:00:28.820> but<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.029> did<00:00:30.330> add<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.960> bar<00:00:31.289> between<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
room but I did add in a bar between the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.610 
room but I did add in a bar between the
fourth<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.610> fifth<00:00:32.700> floor<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:34.170> floor<00:00:34.410> with

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
fourth and fifth floor the floor with

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.040 
fourth and fifth floor the floor with
the<00:00:34.860> extended<00:00:35.430> platform<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.809> main

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the extended platform on it the main

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.510 
the extended platform on it the main
reason<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.410> did<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.890> not<00:00:38.040> technically

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
reason I did that it's not technically

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.670 
reason I did that it's not technically
needed<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.270> support<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.750> Quinjet<00:00:39.960> however<00:00:40.559> I

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
needed to support the Quinjet however I

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.200 
needed to support the Quinjet however I
wanted<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.219> little<00:00:41.370> bit<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.640> extra<00:00:41.879> peace<00:00:42.180> of

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
wanted a little bit of extra peace of

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.420 
wanted a little bit of extra peace of
mind<00:00:42.540> with<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> stability<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.950> tower<00:00:44.190> if

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
mind with the stability of the tower if

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.819 
mind with the stability of the tower if
I<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.640> gonna<00:00:44.760> leave<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.270> Quinn<00:00:45.660> Jet<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
I was gonna leave the Quinn Jet on the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.560 
I was gonna leave the Quinn Jet on the
platform<00:00:47.340> all<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> time<00:00:47.820> while<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.420> on

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
platform all the time while it's on

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.760 
platform all the time while it's on
display<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:49.020> my<00:00:49.110> city<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:50.070> that's<00:00:50.730> there<00:00:51.739> has<00:00:52.739> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
display in my city so that's there has a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.420 
display in my city so that's there has a
roof<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:54.000> roof<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:57.890> take<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.039> off<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
roof to the roof is take that off in a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.360 
roof to the roof is take that off in a
second<00:00:59.820> actually<00:01:00.109> but<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> has<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> little

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
second actually but it has a little

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.490 
second actually but it has a little
feature<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:03.960> gonna<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> lot

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
feature to it and it's gonna have a lot

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.820 
feature to it and it's gonna have a lot
more<00:01:04.530> detail<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.210> when<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.240> actually<00:01:06.570> get<00:01:07.560> time

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
more detail on when I actually get time

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.830 
more detail on when I actually get time
to<00:01:07.860> detail<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.549> out<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:10.680> Quinjet<00:01:11.840> that's

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
to detail it out so the Quinjet that's

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.090 
to detail it out so the Quinjet that's
sitting<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.320> platform<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
sitting on the platform is this a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.219 
sitting on the platform is this a
standard<00:01:14.520> Quinn<00:01:14.729> jet<00:01:14.939> from<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.630> current<00:01:16.049> age

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
standard Quinn jet from the current age

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:28.569 
standard Quinn jet from the current age
of<00:01:16.350> Ultron<00:01:16.850> twin<00:01:17.850> jet<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:21.770> yes<00:01:23.630> actually<00:01:24.799> the

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.170 

iron<00:01:29.579> Legion<00:01:30.619> launchers<00:01:31.619> there<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
iron Legion launchers there on the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.090 
iron Legion launchers there on the
fourth<00:01:33.420> floor<00:01:33.570> come<00:01:34.290> out<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> front<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.890> may

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
fourth floor come out the front I may

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.450 
fourth floor come out the front I may
expand<00:01:35.369> those<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.820> four<00:01:36.030> rows<00:01:36.299> instead<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> two

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
expand those to four rows instead of two

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.109 
expand those to four rows instead of two
too<00:01:38.460> deep<00:01:40.130> let's<00:01:41.130> slide<00:01:41.369> right<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.790> just<00:01:41.970> like

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
too deep let's slide right in just like

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:50.179 
too deep let's slide right in just like
a<00:01:42.180> normal<00:01:42.360> set<00:01:45.170> take<00:01:46.170> off<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.560> roof<00:01:46.770> here<00:01:49.189> so

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
a normal set take off the roof here so

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.359 
a normal set take off the roof here so
the<00:01:50.670> roof<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:53.329> drone<00:01:54.329> turret<00:01:54.659> as<00:01:54.780> well<00:01:55.530> as<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the roof the drone turret as well as the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.889 
the roof the drone turret as well as the
antennas<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:56.939> whatnot<00:01:57.329> are<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:57.689> there<00:01:57.869> for

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
antennas and whatnot are just there for

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.810 
antennas and whatnot are just there for
perspective<00:01:58.590> for<00:01:58.829> me<00:01:58.920> right<00:01:59.250> now<00:01:59.430> that's

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
perspective for me right now that's

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.130 
perspective for me right now that's
absolutely<00:02:00.240> not<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.840> final<00:02:01.170> design<00:02:03.110> got<00:02:04.110> a

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
absolutely not the final design got a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.070 
absolutely not the final design got a
reactor<00:02:05.040> type<00:02:05.579> thing<00:02:06.030> going<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.719> there<00:02:07.670> and

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
reactor type thing going on there and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.559 
reactor type thing going on there and
obviously<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.619> entire<00:02:10.890> buildings<00:02:11.340> modular

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
obviously the entire buildings modular

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.480 
obviously the entire buildings modular
maybe<00:02:13.110> I'll<00:02:13.260> just<00:02:13.349> take<00:02:13.560> off<00:02:13.709> two<00:02:14.040> little

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
maybe I'll just take off two little

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.330 
maybe I'll just take off two little
words<00:02:14.700> at<00:02:14.910> once<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:17.520> can<00:02:17.670> see<00:02:17.849> roughly<00:02:19.340> it's

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
words at once you can see roughly it's

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.809 
words at once you can see roughly it's
just<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.270> previous<00:02:22.200> three<00:02:22.680> floors<00:02:23.010> as

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
just like the previous three floors as

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.110 
just like the previous three floors as
far<00:02:24.090> as<00:02:24.270> how<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.630> seats<00:02:25.050> in<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:28.260> yeah<00:02:29.250> that's

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
far as how it seats in and yeah that's

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.750 
far as how it seats in and yeah that's
been<00:02:30.420> all<00:02:30.600> so<00:02:31.170> let<00:02:32.069> me<00:02:32.160> know<00:02:32.250> any<00:02:32.459> feedback<00:02:32.730> you

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
been all so let me know any feedback you
