deke and my overall opinion on the hits
i<00:00:28.680> know<00:00:28.740> some<00:00:29.010> people<00:00:29.039> they're<00:00:29.460> like<00:00:29.640> whoa

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.339 
i know some people they're like whoa
they<00:00:30.029> don't<00:00:30.179> look<00:00:30.300> very<00:00:30.359> good<00:00:30.660> cuz<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.170> legs

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
they don't look very good cuz the legs

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.600 
they don't look very good cuz the legs
like<00:00:31.500> falling<00:00:31.920> over<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> place<00:00:32.369> i<00:00:32.489> could

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
like falling over the place i could

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.170 
like falling over the place i could
agree<00:00:32.969> with<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:34.020> overall<00:00:34.440> like<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.280> think

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
agree with that but overall like I think

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.150 
agree with that but overall like I think
the<00:00:36.360> hits<00:00:36.540> look<00:00:36.780> very<00:00:37.170> good<00:00:37.469> like<00:00:37.770> right<00:00:37.980> there

the hits look very good like right there
that<00:00:38.520> looked<00:00:38.730> awesome<00:00:38.930> that<00:00:39.930> looked<00:00:40.140> really

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
as well I just overall think it looks so

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.060 
as well I just overall think it looks so
smooth<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.420> they<00:00:48.989> said<00:00:49.200> are<00:00:49.289> using<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> FIFA

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
smooth and they said are using the FIFA

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.200 
smooth and they said are using the FIFA
engine<00:00:50.489> with<00:00:51.090> hits<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.660> rag<00:00:52.559> doll<00:00:52.860> like

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
engine with hits and rag doll like

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.209 
engine with hits and rag doll like
physics<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.390> stuff<00:00:54.660> engine<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.920> think<00:00:56.129> it

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
physics and stuff engine and I think it

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.549 
physics and stuff engine and I think it
looks<00:00:56.370> awesome<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.059> hopefully<00:00:57.750> I'm<00:00:57.960> really

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
looks awesome and I hopefully I'm really

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.619 
looks awesome and I hopefully I'm really
hoping<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.129> turns<00:00:59.370> out<00:00:59.609> good<00:00:59.789> honestly<00:01:00.449> it

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
hoping it turns out good honestly it

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.439 
hoping it turns out good honestly it
looks<00:01:00.840> great<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.670> need<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.030> see<00:01:03.270> like

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
looks great here but I need to see like

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.140 
looks great here but I need to see like
flan<00:01:03.840> gameplay<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.530> an<00:01:04.890> in-game<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.549> they

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
flan gameplay of an in-game like they

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.450 
flan gameplay of an in-game like they
show<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.900> believe<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> few

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
show that I believe in like a few

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.179 
show that I believe in like a few
seconds<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:10.080> not<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.619> best<00:01:10.770> especially

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
seconds but it's not the best especially

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.020 
seconds but it's not the best especially
with<00:01:11.520> their<00:01:11.700> camera<00:01:12.240> quality<00:01:12.479> phone<00:01:14.030> you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
with their camera quality phone you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.359 
with their camera quality phone you
would<00:01:15.150> think<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.420> would<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:16.340> you<00:01:17.340> would

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
would think they would have you would

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.219 
would think they would have you would
think<00:01:17.580> they<00:01:17.759> could<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:18.060> get<00:01:18.270> clips<00:01:18.900> from<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
think they could like get clips from the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.660 
think they could like get clips from the
computer<00:01:19.710> like<00:01:19.890> they<00:01:20.130> could<00:01:20.280> play<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.610> it

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
computer like they could play it on it

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.649 
computer like they could play it on it
because<00:01:20.790> they<00:01:20.939> make<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.570> computer

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
because they make this on the computer

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.149 
because they make this on the computer
and<00:01:21.990> stuff<00:01:22.170> you're<00:01:22.290> getting<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.799> from<00:01:22.950> there

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
and stuff you're getting it from there

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.980 
and stuff you're getting it from there
but<00:01:23.400> they're<00:01:24.119> taking<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.450> with<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:24.720> phone

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
but they're taking it with like phone

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.149 
but they're taking it with like phone
quality<00:01:25.350> like<00:01:26.159> right<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.580> makes<00:01:26.939> no<00:01:27.150> sense<00:01:27.450> I

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
quality like right here makes no sense I

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.140 
quality like right here makes no sense I
don't<00:01:29.159> know<00:01:29.250> there's<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.939> lot<00:01:30.119> of

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
don't know there's like a lot of

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.730 
don't know there's like a lot of
programs<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.840> record<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> screen<00:01:31.380> with

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
programs you can record the screen with

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.280 
programs you can record the screen with
but<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.100> know<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.250> guess<00:01:32.460> they<00:01:32.610> can't<00:01:32.670> do<00:01:32.970> that

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
but you know I guess they can't do that

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.780 
but you know I guess they can't do that
but<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.320> mean<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.680> looks<00:01:34.829> good<00:01:35.040> here<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
but I mean it looks good here but you

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.539 
but I mean it looks good here but you
know<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.360> little<00:01:36.659> bit<00:01:36.810> blurry<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:38.369> looks

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
know it's a little bit blurry it looks

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.810 
know it's a little bit blurry it looks
really<00:01:38.759> good<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.030> my<00:01:39.180> opinion<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.840> I'm<00:01:40.079> hoping

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
really good in my opinion and I'm hoping

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.340 
really good in my opinion and I'm hoping
hoping<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.119> turns<00:01:42.240> out<00:01:42.420> great<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.170> I'm

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
hoping it turns out great and I just I'm
