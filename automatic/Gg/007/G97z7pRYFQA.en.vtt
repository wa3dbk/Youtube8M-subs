throughout the lifespan of black ops 2
that'd<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.259> kind<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.530> cool<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.920> we've

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
that'd be kind of cool you know we've

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.330 
that'd be kind of cool you know we've
never<00:02:02.520> seen<00:02:02.939> them<00:02:03.299> add<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.899> gun<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.860> multiplayer

never seen them add a gun in multiplayer

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.180 
never seen them add a gun in multiplayer
before<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.270> they<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.259> they<00:02:07.320> want<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.829> so

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
before but they can if they want to so

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.619 
before but they can if they want to so
that's<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.520> idea<00:02:08.819> there's<00:02:09.330> we're<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.569> to

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
that's the idea there's we're going to

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.210 
that's the idea there's we're going to
be<00:02:09.720> better<00:02:09.899> lobby<00:02:10.289> leaderboards<00:02:11.039> better

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
be better lobby leaderboards better

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.340 
be better lobby leaderboards better
scoreboards<00:02:12.000> most<00:02:12.270> likely<00:02:12.750> we

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
scoreboards most likely we

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.260 
scoreboards most likely we
also<00:02:13.530> know<00:02:13.650> there's<00:02:13.860> going<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.220> be<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.340> 4v4

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
also know there's going to be a 4v4

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.540 
also know there's going to be a 4v4
zombie<00:02:16.020> game<00:02:16.350> mode<00:02:16.650> which<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.190> really<00:02:17.460> fun

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
zombie game mode which is really fun

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.270 
zombie game mode which is really fun
really<00:02:17.910> cool<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.240> think<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:22.280> personally

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
really cool to think of and I personally

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.640 
really cool to think of and I personally
after<00:02:23.600> hearing<00:02:24.600> all<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:24.900> information<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.620> was

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
after hearing all this information I was

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.440 
after hearing all this information I was
wondering<00:02:26.310> if<00:02:26.460> there<00:02:26.670> was<00:02:26.760> going<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.060> a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
wondering if there was going to be a

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.630 
wondering if there was going to be a
ranking<00:02:28.290> system<00:02:28.500> where<00:02:28.860> maybe<00:02:29.040> they<00:02:29.310> match

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
ranking system where maybe they match

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.390 
ranking system where maybe they match
you<00:02:29.910> up<00:02:29.940> like<00:02:30.420> 44<00:02:31.080> against<00:02:31.500> players<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:32.100> equal

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
you up like 44 against players of equal

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.740 
you up like 44 against players of equal
skill<00:02:32.550> because<00:02:32.850> we<00:02:33.000> know<00:02:33.120> there's<00:02:33.300> going<00:02:33.600> to

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
skill because we know there's going to

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.920 
skill because we know there's going to
be<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:34.590> eSports<00:02:35.400> ranking<00:02:35.910> system<00:02:36.360> as<00:02:36.540> well

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
be that eSports ranking system as well

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.140 
be that eSports ranking system as well
as<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.350> normal<00:02:37.740> ranking<00:02:38.070> system<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:38.940> that's

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
as just normal ranking system but that's

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.270 
as just normal ranking system but that's
that<00:02:39.540> brings<00:02:40.320> up<00:02:40.470> something<00:02:40.680> maybe<00:02:41.010> there's

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
that brings up something maybe there's

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.100 
that brings up something maybe there's
gonna<00:02:41.400> be<00:02:41.610> in<00:02:41.730> ranking<00:02:42.030> system<00:02:42.360> in<00:02:42.510> zombies<00:02:42.930> so

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
gonna be in ranking system in zombies so

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.390 
gonna be in ranking system in zombies so
I<00:02:43.140> was<00:02:43.350> just<00:02:43.410> kind<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.740> wondering<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.340> I

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
I was just kind of wondering that and I

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.070 
I was just kind of wondering that and I
was<00:02:44.520> in<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.700> back<00:02:44.850> of<00:02:44.880> my<00:02:45.060> head<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.660> know<00:02:45.690> it's

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
was in the back of my head you know it's

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.020 
was in the back of my head you know it's
a<00:02:46.260> non<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> multiplayer<00:02:47.130> system<00:02:47.760> there's<00:02:47.940> gonna

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
a non a multiplayer system there's gonna

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.630 
a non a multiplayer system there's gonna
be<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.270> 4v4<00:02:48.930> game<00:02:49.230> type<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.950> maybe<00:02:50.310> there's

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
be a 4v4 game type so maybe there's

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.600 
be a 4v4 game type so maybe there's
going<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.820> be<00:02:50.880> zombie<00:02:51.540> ranking<00:02:52.410> system<00:02:52.860> just

here<00:03:04.230> now<00:03:05.100> if<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.340> ask<00:03:05.520> me<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.790> looks<00:03:06.240> a<00:03:06.390> hell

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
here now if you ask me that looks a hell

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.440 
here now if you ask me that looks a hell
of<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.930> lot<00:03:07.080> like<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.590> zombie<00:03:08.460> prestige<00:03:08.940> emblem

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
of a lot like a zombie prestige emblem

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.630 
of a lot like a zombie prestige emblem
let<00:03:09.960> me<00:03:10.050> know<00:03:10.140> what<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.470> guys<00:03:10.650> think<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.190> think

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
let me know what you guys think I think

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.340 
let me know what you guys think I think
it<00:03:11.820> definitely<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.480> looks<00:03:12.720> like<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.900> prestige

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
it definitely that looks like a prestige

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.770 
it definitely that looks like a prestige
emblem<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.580> obviously<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.150> zombie<00:03:15.570> there

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
emblem and it's obviously a zombie there

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.900 
emblem and it's obviously a zombie there
so<00:03:16.050> this<00:03:16.500> might<00:03:16.950> suggest<00:03:17.160> this<00:03:17.550> is<00:03:17.730> just

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
so this might suggest this is just

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.400 
so this might suggest this is just
speculation<00:03:18.000> mind<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:18.960> might<00:03:19.200> suggest

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
speculation mind you this might suggest

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.800 
speculation mind you this might suggest
that<00:03:20.250> there<00:03:20.460> is<00:03:20.580> going<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.910> be<00:03:20.970> prestigious<00:03:21.630> in

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
that there is going to be prestigious in

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.540 
that there is going to be prestigious in
zombies<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.680> would<00:03:22.830> be<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:22.980> ranking<00:03:23.370> system

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
zombies that would be a ranking system

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.460 
zombies that would be a ranking system
obviously<00:03:24.210> we<00:03:24.360> don't<00:03:24.450> know<00:03:24.600> how<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:25.410> would

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470

going to be really cool and I truly
believe<00:03:53.490> there<00:03:53.910> will<00:03:54.060> be<00:03:54.240> a<00:03:54.480> ranking<00:03:54.840> system

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
believe there will be a ranking system

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.590 
believe there will be a ranking system
in<00:03:56.040> zombies<00:03:56.580> of<00:03:56.790> course<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.150> could<00:03:57.300> just<00:03:57.390> be<00:03:57.510> a

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
in zombies of course it could just be a

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.300 
in zombies of course it could just be a
cool<00:03:57.900> cool<00:03:58.470> little<00:03:58.710> picture<00:03:59.070> that<00:03:59.220> they

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
cool cool little picture that they

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.710 
cool cool little picture that they
wanted<00:03:59.550> to<00:03:59.610> put<00:03:59.790> on<00:03:59.880> their<00:04:00.030> twitter<00:04:00.240> page<00:04:00.300> or

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
wanted to put on their twitter page or

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.380 
wanted to put on their twitter page or
it<00:04:00.990> could<00:04:01.170> be<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.820> kind<00:04:02.820> of<00:04:02.910> shout<00:04:03.090> out<00:04:03.240> to<00:04:03.360> the

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
it could be a kind of shout out to the

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.120 
it could be a kind of shout out to the
zombies<00:04:03.780> fans<00:04:04.050> and<00:04:04.320> have<00:04:04.500> it<00:04:04.620> just<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.890> normal

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
zombies fans and have it just a normal

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.070 
zombies fans and have it just a normal
procedure<00:04:05.460> emblem<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.120> multiplayer<00:04:06.630> ranking

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
procedure emblem and multiplayer ranking

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.140 
procedure emblem and multiplayer ranking
but<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:07.590> think<00:04:08.040> it's<00:04:08.160> going<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.460> be<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.640> ranking

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
but I think it's going to be a ranking

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.670 
but I think it's going to be a ranking
system<00:04:09.330> in<00:04:09.660> zombies<00:04:10.050> where<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.380> can<00:04:10.500> actually

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
system in zombies where you can actually

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.560 
system in zombies where you can actually
prestige<00:04:11.220> so<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.760> was<00:04:12.000> really<00:04:12.120> cool<00:04:12.330> to<00:04:12.390> think

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
prestige so I was really cool to think

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.500 
prestige so I was really cool to think
of<00:04:13.520> one<00:04:14.520> last<00:04:14.730> thing<00:04:14.880> I<00:04:15.000> want<00:04:15.210> to<00:04:15.270> say<00:04:15.360> before

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
of one last thing I want to say before

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.990 
of one last thing I want to say before
this<00:04:15.930> wraps<00:04:16.200> up<00:04:16.489> actually<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.609> two<00:04:17.850> more

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
this wraps up actually to two more

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.930 
this wraps up actually to two more
