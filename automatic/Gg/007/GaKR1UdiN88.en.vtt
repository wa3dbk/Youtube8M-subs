my<00:03:17.610> idea<00:03:17.880> is<00:03:17.940> it's<00:03:18.180> going<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.360> be<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.570> kind<00:03:18.810> of

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
my idea is it's going to be that kind of

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.009 
my idea is it's going to be that kind of
story<00:03:19.700> but<00:03:20.700> his<00:03:21.120> goal<00:03:21.360> is<00:03:21.480> essentially<00:03:21.930> to

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
story but his goal is essentially to

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.240 
story but his goal is essentially to
become<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.950> Duke<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.310> New<00:03:23.430> York<00:03:23.640> in<00:03:24.000> Gotham

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
he's basically going to take oh he's

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.470 
he's basically going to take oh he's
going<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.430> try<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.700> take<00:03:29.790> over<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.239> be<00:03:30.330> like
