teens on the old Buick Century I
recently<00:00:07.980> bought<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:09.300> just<00:00:09.599> wanted<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.580> show

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
recently bought and just wanted to show

recently bought and just wanted to show
a<00:00:11.610> couple<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:12.030> things<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.509> found<00:00:14.269> first<00:00:15.269> off

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
a couple of things I found first off

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.939 
a couple of things I found first off
looking<00:00:17.550> at<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.789> hose<00:00:18.060> here<00:00:18.260> and<00:00:19.260> despite

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
looking at this hose here and despite

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.140 
looking at this hose here and despite
the<00:00:20.070> fact<00:00:20.100> looks<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> little<00:00:20.789> moist

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
the fact looks like is a little moist

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.480 
the fact looks like is a little moist
but<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:22.350> can<00:00:22.500> see<00:00:22.740> if<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.920> look<00:00:23.070> close<00:00:23.340> it

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
but you can see if you look close it

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.000 
but you can see if you look close it
looks<00:00:23.640> like<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.000> clamps<00:00:24.420> been<00:00:24.660> moved<00:00:25.010> from

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
looks like that clamps been moved from

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.419 
looks like that clamps been moved from
where<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.310> normally<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:28.099> that<00:00:29.099> clamp

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
where it normally is and that clamp

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.080 
where it normally is and that clamp
there<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.269> little<00:00:30.570> plastic<00:00:30.990> clip<00:00:31.140> loom<00:00:31.679> clip

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
there the little plastic clip loom clip

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.660 
there the little plastic clip loom clip
was<00:00:33.090> undone<00:00:33.649> so<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.680> put<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.010> back<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.370> was

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
was undone so I put it back like it was

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.360 
was undone so I put it back like it was
supposed<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.210> be<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:37.020> what<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.860> tells<00:00:38.040> me<00:00:38.219> is

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
supposed to be and what that tells me is

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.280 
supposed to be and what that tells me is
this<00:00:38.760> engine<00:00:39.120> has<00:00:39.270> had<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.719> lower<00:00:39.899> intake

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
this engine has had the lower intake

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.549 
this engine has had the lower intake
gaskets<00:00:40.800> replaced<00:00:41.280> aren't<00:00:41.640> already<00:00:42.559> that's

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
gaskets replaced aren't already that's

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.450 
gaskets replaced aren't already that's
good<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.950> don't<00:00:44.370> want<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.850> job<00:00:45.559> but<00:00:46.559> I'm

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
gonna have the coolant flush on anyway

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:59.720 
gonna have the coolant flush on anyway
because<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.730> got<00:00:50.910> some<00:00:51.800> look<00:00:52.800> at<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:58.730> see

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
because it's got some look at this see

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.790 
because it's got some look at this see
that

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
that

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.600 
that
that<00:01:01.579> is<00:01:01.940> what<00:01:02.210> happens<00:01:02.629> when<00:01:02.809> you<00:01:03.020> leave

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
that is what happens when you leave

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.250 
that is what happens when you leave
Dexcool<00:01:04.610> coolant<00:01:05.239> in<00:01:05.390> one<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:05.780> these<00:01:05.900> cars

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
Dexcool coolant in one of these cars

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.700 
Dexcool coolant in one of these cars
that<00:01:06.909> 400,000<00:01:07.909> miles<00:01:08.060> of<00:01:08.300> GM<00:01:08.710> wrongly

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
that 400,000 miles of GM wrongly

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:19.120 
that 400,000 miles of GM wrongly
recommended<00:01:10.580> you<00:01:10.700> do<00:01:13.990> look<00:01:14.990> at<00:01:15.140> that<00:01:18.130> that's

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
recommended you do look at that that's

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.170 
recommended you do look at that that's
why<00:01:19.310> they<00:01:19.460> call<00:01:19.700> it<00:01:19.790> death<00:01:20.060> cool<00:01:22.180> see

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
why they call it death cool see

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.100 
why they call it death cool see
everybody<00:01:23.720> has<00:01:24.670> gotten<00:01:25.670> mad<00:01:25.940> at<00:01:26.119> GM<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.690> said

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
everybody has gotten mad at GM and said

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.130 
everybody has gotten mad at GM and said
these<00:01:27.320> engines<00:01:27.710> are<00:01:27.770> crap<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.720> junk<00:01:29.720> and

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
these engines are crap and junk and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.749 
these engines are crap and junk and
everything<00:01:30.530> like<00:01:30.680> that<00:01:30.710> because<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:31.430> many<00:01:31.580> of

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
everything like that because so many of

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.760 
everything like that because so many of
them<00:01:31.909> loses<00:01:32.300> lower<00:01:32.509> intake<00:01:32.930> gaskets<00:01:33.440> or<00:01:33.619> head

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
them loses lower intake gaskets or head

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.380 
them loses lower intake gaskets or head
gaskets<00:01:34.250> or<00:01:34.369> whatever<00:01:34.729> have<00:01:35.090> all<00:01:35.240> these

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
gaskets or whatever have all these

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.029 
gaskets or whatever have all these
problems<00:01:35.660> well<00:01:35.930> it's<00:01:36.170> not<00:01:36.259> GM's<00:01:36.710> fault

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
problems well it's not GM's fault

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.790 
problems well it's not GM's fault
necessarily<00:01:37.220> except<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:38.210> they<00:01:38.649> didn't<00:01:39.649> know

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
necessarily except that they didn't know

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.340 
necessarily except that they didn't know
that<00:01:40.070> this<00:01:40.190> coolant<00:01:40.640> was<00:01:40.850> acidic<00:01:41.420> if<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.140> left

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
that this coolant was acidic if you left

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.870 
that this coolant was acidic if you left
it<00:01:42.470> in<00:01:42.560> there<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:42.770> long<00:01:42.890> time<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.520> eats<00:01:43.700> all

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
it in there a long time and it eats all

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.080 
it in there a long time and it eats all
the<00:01:44.030> gaskets<00:01:44.479> up<00:01:44.690> so<00:01:45.220> you<00:01:46.220> know<00:01:46.369> I<00:01:46.399> guess<00:01:46.910> like

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
the gaskets up so you know I guess like

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.240 
the gaskets up so you know I guess like
you<00:01:47.119> shared<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.570> blame

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
you shared the blame

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.330 
you shared the blame
the<00:01:49.550> makers<00:01:49.910> next<00:01:50.330> tool<00:01:50.539> I<00:01:50.950> won't<00:01:51.950> say<00:01:52.160> their

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
the makers next tool I won't say their

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.510 
the makers next tool I won't say their
name<00:01:52.580> cause<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.119> liability<00:01:53.420> but<00:01:54.399> like<00:01:57.520> the

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
name cause a liability but like the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.840 
name cause a liability but like the
search<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.060> find<00:01:59.240> out<00:01:59.479> that<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:01.159> emam<00:02:01.520> GM

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
search and find out that the emam GM

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.490 
search and find out that the emam GM
both<00:02:02.090> probably<00:02:02.479> deserve<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.960> blame<00:02:03.170> on<00:02:03.350> that

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
both probably deserve the blame on that

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.979 
both probably deserve the blame on that
one<00:02:03.619> but<00:02:03.800> anyway<00:02:04.610> off<00:02:04.910> that<00:02:05.149> little<00:02:05.450> rant<00:02:05.660> I

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:05.989 
one but anyway off that little rant I

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:08.850 
one but anyway off that little rant I
was<00:02:06.619> changing<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.039> air<00:02:07.190> filter<00:02:07.610> which<00:02:07.789> really

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
was changing the air filter which really

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.940 
was changing the air filter which really
yeah<00:02:09.860> we're<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.280> only<00:02:11.530> didn't<00:02:12.530> let<00:02:12.680> step

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
yeah we're is only didn't let step

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.180 
yeah we're is only didn't let step
recite<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:14.260> did<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.380> anyway<00:02:15.739> since<00:02:16.040> I

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
recite it it did it anyway since I

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.500 
recite it it did it anyway since I
bought<00:02:16.400> one<00:02:16.700> that's<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.630> move<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.209> might<00:02:23.480> a

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
bought one that's the move but I might a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.089 
bought one that's the move but I might a
little<00:02:23.599> interesting<00:02:24.200> discovery<00:02:24.739> hope<00:02:24.980> you

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
little interesting discovery hope you

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:31.150 
little interesting discovery hope you
can<00:02:25.250> see<00:02:25.459> it<00:02:27.550> there's<00:02:28.550> I<00:02:29.410> guess<00:02:30.410> that's<00:02:30.860> dog

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
can see it there's I guess that's dog

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.619 
can see it there's I guess that's dog
food<00:02:31.520> in<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.120> air<00:02:32.270> cleaner<00:02:34.209> now<00:02:35.209> you<00:02:35.270> might

it runs good and drives fine except that

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
it pulls a little bit it's because it's

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.940 
it pulls a little bit it's because it's
got<00:04:02.420> two<00:04:02.570> wrong<00:04:02.810> size<00:04:03.080> tires<00:04:03.410> on<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:03.680> they're

got two wrong size tires on it they're

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.390 
got two wrong size tires on it they're
supposed<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.220> have<00:04:04.340> 205<00:04:05.000> 70<00:04:05.450> 15<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.709> this<00:04:07.190> one

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
supposed to have 205 70 15 and this one

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.990 
supposed to have 205 70 15 and this one
is<00:04:07.489> a<00:04:07.580> 205<00:04:08.680> 75<00:04:09.680> 15<00:04:10.190> and<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.489> think<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.820> one<00:04:10.970> on

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
is a 205 75 15 and I think the one on

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.130 
is a 205 75 15 and I think the one on
the<00:04:11.269> left<00:04:11.480> sides<00:04:11.720> of<00:04:11.930> 215<00:04:12.769> 70<00:04:13.340> 15<00:04:16.930> stops<00:04:17.930> I'm

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
the left sides of 215 70 15 stops I'm

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.460 
the left sides of 215 70 15 stops I'm
making<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.530> low<00:04:18.709> tire<00:04:19.010> indicator<00:04:19.580> come<00:04:19.850> on

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
making a low tire indicator come on

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.200 
making a low tire indicator come on
you<00:04:21.470> ever<00:04:21.560> wonder<00:04:21.739> how<00:04:22.280> these<00:04:22.490> things<00:04:22.790> these

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
you ever wonder how these things these

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.570 
you ever wonder how these things these
GM<00:04:23.660> cars<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.260> figure<00:04:24.979> out<00:04:25.100> if<00:04:25.190> you<00:04:25.280> got<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.430> low

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
GM cars you figure out if you got a low

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.560 
GM cars you figure out if you got a low
tire<00:04:25.870> that's<00:04:26.870> because<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.500> computer<00:04:28.570> reads

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
tire that's because the computer reads

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.750 
tire that's because the computer reads
this<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:30.290> wheel<00:04:30.500> speeds<00:04:30.860> on<00:04:31.100> each<00:04:31.250> of<00:04:31.640> the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
this the wheel speeds on each of the

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.240 
this the wheel speeds on each of the
four<00:04:31.970> wheels<00:04:32.290> and<00:04:33.290> it<00:04:33.590> compares<00:04:33.979> it

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
four wheels and it compares it

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.909 
four wheels and it compares it
continuously<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:36.050> when<00:04:36.260> you<00:04:36.350> get<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.500> low<00:04:36.650> tire

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
continuously and when you get a low tire

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.560 
continuously and when you get a low tire
of<00:04:37.070> course<00:04:37.310> your<00:04:37.430> wheels<00:04:37.640> speed<00:04:40.330> you<00:04:41.330> know<00:04:41.450> it

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
of course your wheels speed you know it

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.659 
of course your wheels speed you know it
changes<00:04:42.050> so<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.560> computer<00:04:42.890> sees<00:04:43.100> that<00:04:43.280> and<00:04:43.550> it

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
changes so the computer sees that and it

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.310 
changes so the computer sees that and it
turns<00:04:44.390> on<00:04:44.570> that<00:04:44.750> light<00:04:44.990> I<00:04:46.720> think<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.870> reset

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
turns on that light I think the reset

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:55.400 
turns on that light I think the reset
button<00:04:48.350> on<00:04:49.100> these

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.520 

fix<00:04:56.410> that<00:04:56.590> finger<00:04:56.950> up<00:04:56.980> there<00:04:57.250> oh<00:04:58.080> yeah<00:04:59.080> look<00:04:59.470> at

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
fix that finger up there oh yeah look at

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.320 
fix that finger up there oh yeah look at
that

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
that
