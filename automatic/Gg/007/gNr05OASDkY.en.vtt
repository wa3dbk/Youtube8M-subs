something else if it's an older cube pry
out<00:00:38.740> that<00:00:38.920> piece<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:39.400> you<00:00:39.910> can<00:00:39.940> take<00:00:40.300> out<00:00:40.330> all

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
out that piece and you can take out all

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
nearly as impressive as actually solving

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.360

solve<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:55.359> you<00:01:55.509> have<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.810> learn<00:01:55.960> what<00:01:56.320> are

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
solve it you have to learn what are

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.499 
solve it you have to learn what are

color<00:03:20.670> it's<00:03:21.240> easy<00:03:21.480> just<00:03:21.720> look<00:03:22.140> at<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.320> center

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
color it's easy just look at the center

color it's easy just look at the center
piece<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.820> side<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.690> green<00:03:24.900> side

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
piece this side is the green side

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.190 
piece this side is the green side
because<00:03:25.740> the<00:03:26.040> center<00:03:26.340> piece<00:03:26.550> is<00:03:26.820> green<00:03:27.060> no<00:03:27.930> way

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
because the center piece is green no way

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.850 
because the center piece is green no way
that<00:03:28.770> you<00:03:28.920> move<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.130> cube<00:03:29.520> can<00:03:30.510> change<00:03:30.870> that

that you move the cube can change that

this Green Cross in doing this we have

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.090 
this Green Cross in doing this we have
to<00:03:39.960> look<00:03:40.170> for<00:03:40.770> these<00:03:41.010> four<00:03:41.610> green<00:03:42.300> pieces<00:03:43.100> one

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
to look for these four green pieces one

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.020 
to look for these four green pieces one
at<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.280> time<00:03:44.490> let's<00:03:45.450> look<00:03:45.600> for<00:03:45.780> one<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:46.020> them

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
at a time let's look for one of them

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.590 
at a time let's look for one of them
here's<00:03:48.030> one<00:03:48.210> of<00:03:48.330> them

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
here's one of them

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.720 
here's one of them
before<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.530> can<00:03:49.680> get<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.950> piece<00:03:50.190> where<00:03:50.640> it

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
before you can get the piece where it

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.460 
before you can get the piece where it
needs<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:50.970> be<00:03:51.030> up<00:03:51.300> here<00:03:51.600> you<00:03:51.990> have<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.260> get<00:03:52.380> it

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
needs to be up here you have to get it

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.200 
needs to be up here you have to get it
directly<00:03:53.040> underneath<00:03:53.430> where<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:53.880> needs<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.120> be

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
directly underneath where it needs to be

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.240 
directly underneath where it needs to be
so<00:03:54.870> we're<00:03:54.960> gonna<00:03:55.050> get<00:03:55.260> this<00:03:55.440> in<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.040> bottom

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
so we're gonna get this in the bottom

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.120 
so we're gonna get this in the bottom
layer<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:56.820> then<00:03:57.630> swing<00:03:57.990> this<00:03:58.080> around<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:59.040> the

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
layer and then swing this around to the

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.640 
layer and then swing this around to the
white<00:03:59.310> side<00:03:59.610> right<00:03:59.880> there<00:04:00.260> once<00:04:01.260> we<00:04:01.380> have<00:04:01.500> it

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
white side right there once we have it

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.390 
white side right there once we have it
there<00:04:01.830> if<00:04:02.010> we<00:04:02.190> rotate<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.700> front<00:04:02.970> side<00:04:03.180> twice

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
there if we rotate the front side twice

you'll have it lined up it's important

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.860 
you'll have it lined up it's important
not<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.680> just<00:04:07.890> get<00:04:08.220> this<00:04:08.370> cross<00:04:08.670> but<00:04:09.420> to<00:04:09.540> also

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
not to just get this cross but to also

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.780 
not to just get this cross but to also
worry<00:04:10.080> about<00:04:10.170> this<00:04:10.560> lining<00:04:11.010> up<00:04:11.130> that's<00:04:11.430> just

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
worry about this lining up that's just

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.970 
worry about this lining up that's just
as<00:04:11.910> important<00:04:12.740> occasionally<00:04:13.740> you'll<00:04:13.950> find

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
as important occasionally you'll find

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.610

yourself<00:04:14.580> in<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.820> position<00:04:14.940> like<00:04:15.240> this<00:04:15.630> you

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
yourself in a position like this you

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.500 
yourself in a position like this you

and<00:04:18.660> right<00:04:18.810> line<00:04:19.020> up<00:04:19.260> you<00:04:19.410> get<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.680> underneath

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
solved this top Green Cross you're ready

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.830 
solved this top Green Cross you're ready
to<00:04:49.710> start<00:04:49.890> filling<00:04:50.160> in<00:04:50.370> these<00:04:50.700> four<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:51.600> green

to start filling in these four and green

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.740 
to start filling in these four and green
corners<00:04:52.530> now<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.850> first<00:04:54.120> part<00:04:54.300> of<00:04:54.450> this<00:04:54.570> is

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
corners now the first part of this is

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.360

very<00:04:54.960> similar<00:04:55.320> to<00:04:55.500> when<00:04:55.770> you're<00:04:55.890> solving<00:04:56.130> the

very similar to when you're solving the
Green<00:04:56.580> Cross<00:04:56.820> before<00:04:57.360> you<00:04:57.750> get<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:57.900> piece<00:04:58.169> up
