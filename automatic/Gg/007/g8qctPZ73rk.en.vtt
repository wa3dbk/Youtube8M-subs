shenron<00:00:24.770> sound<00:00:25.640> rather<00:00:25.880> standard<00:00:26.480> at<00:00:26.599> this

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720

point<00:00:27.020> but<00:00:27.529> as<00:00:27.619> soon<00:00:27.770> as<00:00:27.890> you<00:00:28.010> go<00:00:28.130> to<00:00:28.189> the<00:00:28.279> first

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
point but as soon as you go to the first

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.429 
point but as soon as you go to the first
level<00:00:28.939> you<00:00:29.090> will<00:00:29.330> notice<00:00:29.630> just<00:00:29.840> how<00:00:29.960> different

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
level you will notice just how different

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.880 
level you will notice just how different
it<00:00:30.500> is

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
it is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.369 
it is
along<00:00:31.700> with<00:00:31.849> levels<00:00:32.210> of<00:00:32.360> fighting<00:00:32.809> there<00:00:33.230> are

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
along with levels of fighting there are

mixed in other minigame levels there are

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.840 
mixed in other minigame levels there are
a<00:00:35.809> decent<00:00:36.020> number<00:00:36.350> of<00:00:36.530> them<00:00:36.739> as<00:00:36.920> well<00:00:37.129> for<00:00:37.760> the

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
a decent number of them as well for the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.939 
a decent number of them as well for the
most<00:00:38.030> part<00:00:38.330> they<00:00:38.570> are<00:00:38.600> broken<00:00:39.050> up<00:00:39.170> into<00:00:39.350> travel

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
most part they are broken up into travel

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.070 
most part they are broken up into travel
and<00:00:40.190> training<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:41.239> travel<00:00:41.660> works<00:00:41.840> like<00:00:42.050> a

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
and training the travel works like a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.960 
and training the travel works like a
platformer<00:00:42.739> for<00:00:42.949> the<00:00:43.010> most<00:00:43.190> part<00:00:43.489> while<00:00:43.940> the

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
platformer for the most part while the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.060 
platformer for the most part while the
training<00:00:44.300> can<00:00:44.540> take<00:00:44.750> on<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:45.199> few<00:00:45.650> different

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
training can take on a few different

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.420 
training can take on a few different
forms<00:00:47.080> these<00:00:48.080> levels<00:00:48.530> help<00:00:48.769> to<00:00:48.920> break<00:00:49.100> up<00:00:49.280> the

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
forms these levels help to break up the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.250 
forms these levels help to break up the
constant<00:00:49.850> string<00:00:50.089> of<00:00:50.239> fights<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:50.600> help<00:00:51.080> make

working through the story one more time
much<00:00:53.570> less<00:00:53.809> tedious<00:00:54.370> for<00:00:55.370> certain<00:00:55.729> fights<00:00:56.000> you

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
much less tedious for certain fights you

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.939 
much less tedious for certain fights you

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
more like burst and the character models

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.449 
more like burst and the character models
can<00:03:07.270> be<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.390> bit<00:03:07.630> stiff<00:03:07.989> at<00:03:08.140> times<00:03:08.380> on<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:09.280> plus
