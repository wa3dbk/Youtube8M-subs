00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.550
 you who are watching the three 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.630
 words that you can see 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.509
 pronounce must reach the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.809
 conclusion in how many seconds in a 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.809
 minute 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:30.359
 we change and start guessing july is 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.969
 the law we're going to start now 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.270
 minute to not say the word to be 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.270
 onscreen 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.270
 To anybody 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.010

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.780
 silvina let's organize what is not heard 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.739
 colorful such as chopped 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.739
 the little one 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.210
 big halloween 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.920
 while 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.710
 rich with theory 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.000
 for the throat 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.000
 of July 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.310
 if nothing 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.700
 typical of baby that you put the baby in those 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:50.420
 trees that are tropical and that I hope 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.420
 that that is correct last 10 seconds 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.350
 no no 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.350
 5 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:23.150
 from now on a minute can be 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.150
 accompany while you eat 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:34.130
 that can not miss what the 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.130
 doctor who can not miss 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.950
 for carrot rabbits 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.180
 half the time we're going 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.640
 gangster 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.540
 when you cut 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.610
 but one last days seconds 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:22.780
 when you eat it later when you pee 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.780
 and a color comes out time 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.360
 s 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.730
 was the description of the success was 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.360
 very difficult as of opportunity so 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.360
 guess 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.069
 It is a small fruit 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.549
 Six calls needed 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.110
 fattening like the one that is not what to cheer 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.480
 I eat what you eat when you diet 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:24.050
 you do not eat that that is eaten with flours 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.910
 it does not have all this what the 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.910
 sugar type chocolates 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.849
 30 seconds 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.070
 that they give you when you put down the 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.070
 pressure down the tongue 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:50.400
 why 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.400
 we are going to have a lot of heat 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.210
 39 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.850
 okay for a minute 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.780
 to be at the sweet table 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.910
 and now we wait 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.450
 there is in the other 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.460
 and what is it puts you at night 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.460
 10 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.340
 last 18 seconds that can not miss 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.340
 all friends on Sundays 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:17.860
 last nine seconds 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.860
 it's something sweet sweet 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.930
 at the end of time 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:34.240
 good to see three in total
