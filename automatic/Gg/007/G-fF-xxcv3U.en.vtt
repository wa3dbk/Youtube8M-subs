 Lords of miracles where everything 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.970

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.100
 procession the habits are consumed everything 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.140

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.320
 nothing good the saying all this without more 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.930
 preamble this is a very simple dish 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.840
 and we will make it simpler even more 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.910
 simple thanks to nature and in america 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.650
 import 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.180
 because we're going to lay it down because 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.660
 Normally, if you have to boil the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.000
 purple corn and that's not going to be removed 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.500
 from above because we already have 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.979
 we have a very rich chicha morada 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.180
 made of natural purple corn and then 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.729
 Let's go a bit to get rid of that 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.229
 boiled the purple corn not even good 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.390
 let's see what are the ingredients for 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.280
 prepare the basic purple mazamorra in 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.229
 our country what we use is my 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.330
 purple but here we have the chicha 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.130
 abode prepared for nothing is worth then 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.810
 that more of the little cinnamon stick that already 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.670
 has the purple chicha but we are going to 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.580
 add reinforce since it will be for the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.210
 dessert and to return then 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.020
 we have to throw the dream flour 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.360
 ok and then we have guindones the 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.280
 you pass the dried apricots as it says here in 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.509
 Spain we will reinforce a little more 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.509
 with cinnamon and 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.230
 and the clove that also has the 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.850
 that already has everything both cinnamon and 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.880
 clove but we will reinforce it 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.190
 since it's going to be a dessert to reinforce 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.350
 enhance the flavor is worth and then we have 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.990
 to take a little bit of lemon juice 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.480
 I think they are all the ingredients 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.880

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.350
