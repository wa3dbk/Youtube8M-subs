have a child with the biological father
the<00:01:00.359> biological<00:01:00.930> father<00:01:01.020> could<00:01:01.410> be<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.739> worst

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.950 
the biological father could be the worst
person<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.609> world<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:03.420> doesn't<00:01:03.780> matter

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
person in the world it doesn't matter

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.260 
person in the world it doesn't matter
you<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.260> intellectualize<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.640> your

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
you can intellectualize that but your

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.080 
you can intellectualize that but your
primal<00:01:07.010> instinct<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.280> keep<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.850> together

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
