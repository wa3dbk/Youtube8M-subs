heating them up in olive oil there's
just<00:01:49.920> something<00:01:50.220> about<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.430> slickness<00:01:50.880> I

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
just something about that slickness I

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.690 
just something about that slickness I
really<00:01:52.009> shouldn't<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.070> taken<00:01:53.189> off<00:01:53.369> my<00:01:53.430> pan

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
really shouldn't have taken off my pan

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.130 
really shouldn't have taken off my pan
control<00:01:54.030> your<00:01:54.180> lights<00:01:54.360> your<00:01:54.659> heater<00:01:54.899> I

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
control your lights your heater I

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.060 
control your lights your heater I
already<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.500> my<00:01:55.619> own<00:01:55.649> method<00:01:56.040> of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
already have my own method of

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.260 
already have my own method of
controlling<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.610> heat<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:56.909> far<00:01:57.090> they've

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
controlling the heat so far they've

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.999 
controlling the heat so far they've
unveiled<00:01:57.630> some<00:01:57.780> crazy<00:01:58.049> stuff<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.710> fork

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
unveiled some crazy stuff like this fork

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.620 
unveiled some crazy stuff like this fork
that<00:01:59.159> will<00:01:59.310> track<00:01:59.549> your<00:01:59.700> eating<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.270> tell<00:02:00.479> you

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that will track your eating and tell you

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.789 
that will track your eating and tell you
if<00:02:00.810> you're<00:02:00.960> eating<00:02:01.079> too<00:02:01.290> fast<00:02:01.320> thereby

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
if you're eating too fast thereby

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.200 
if you're eating too fast thereby
allowing<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.280> slow<00:02:02.520> down<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:03.000> full

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
allowing you to slow down and get full

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.609 
allowing you to slow down and get full
so<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.540> don't<00:02:03.719> eat<00:02:03.899> too<00:02:03.930> much<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.469> is

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
so you don't eat too much so this is

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.020 
so you don't eat too much so this is
pretty<00:02:04.799> good<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.189> not<00:02:05.310> good<00:02:05.579> enough<00:02:05.610> which<00:02:06.000> is

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
pretty good but not good enough which is

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.459 
pretty good but not good enough which is
why<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.240> came<00:02:06.420> up<00:02:06.540> with<00:02:06.689> my<00:02:06.810> own<00:02:06.840> product<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
why I came up with my own product the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.529 
why I came up with my own product the
super<00:02:07.770> wheezy<00:02:07.979> spoon<00:02:08.369> or<00:02:08.580> swoon<00:02:09.090> not<00:02:09.360> only

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
super wheezy spoon or swoon not only

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.490 
super wheezy spoon or swoon not only
does<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.690> keep<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.989> from<00:02:10.110> eating<00:02:10.259> too<00:02:10.470> fast

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
does it keep you from eating too fast

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.960 
does it keep you from eating too fast

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
observe it's all in the technique you

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.030 
observe it's all in the technique you
take<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> bite<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.430> then<00:02:15.300> Oh<00:02:18.080> see<00:02:19.080> exercise
