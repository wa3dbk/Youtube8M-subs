00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.870
 I'll go up, and I will not. 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.069
 Let this be cast out, and that's more doeja 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.069
 I guess I'm chasing after that. 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.689
 It's a lot like this, but it looks like we have a strange back yesterday. 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:29.010
 It's like a frog or something like a green alien creature. 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:33.780
 Pigs. Pigs . The name of this map is the giant robot p. 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.770
 The slime block and redstone circuit that were added a while ago, 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.360
 In technique. 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.129
 How do you operate a robot after it works? 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.010
 I'll show it in Java. 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.059
 It's infinite power would be very Wick 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.539
 By using the slime block, even if the energy source is not separately supplied, 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:56.100
 Wasnt moving Muan moving itdeoragu 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:59.699
 And I brought it to you for a review on the international forum. 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:05.369
 There's a Redstone block in here like this . 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:10.260
 I've got a bunch of slime blocks . 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.920
 I'll try to get it working. First, there's this one big book. 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.909
 You have to. 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.220
 If you remove this thing in front of you and put a light on the top of this lighter, 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.820
 The pig will move. 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.060
 I'm going to rock it. 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.930
 There are many who are curious about how it works. 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.810
 It 's not just moving the body like this. It 's not about it. 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.380
 This pig is walking to the end now. 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.500
 I 'll show you right away . 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.310
 I'll go up again. 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.090
 And let's be plugged as soon as I see I see are made using the 2nd Circuit 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.140
 It is. 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.590
 Slime red tone block and the piston have to do this, 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.939
 Show me what's right for you, so help me 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.090
 I will not stop. Move to the end of the bay. This will fly to the end of the earth. 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:02.149
 Day're just trashing his miraculous 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:05.299
 I made the boot, but in the future , 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.119
 I think there will be a lot of different maps that I used. 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:12.200
 And what's great about it too 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:16.700
 Once you see that the installation yeogida a break and not experience the same pumpkin ppyo pobak 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.500
 An automation tongue to take off with no one 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.620
 Take a closer look 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.920
 Bright hasyeo I just said 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:30.680
 Ia Tak Ya I say good Ken da black and white 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:34.400
 The discomfort is so loud as pigs pass by. 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.690
 Because the machine so loud whistle What'm reading 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.690
 How are you doing, Shoka? 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.030
 I've foundation's Market here Nova 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:50.150
 Traveler yiguna yeoginga 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.109
 Store ohpik armor taken me rather Oya Oya Oya night watermelon booth machines 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.910
 Hey 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:58.210
 It's amazing. I can not break the blocks that I can break. 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.160
 You can also break a block. 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:05.580
 Hey, where are you going? Until I stop, 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.260
 To the end of the earth 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.520
 On the fifth day, the third-person children are going to see each other. The earth is round. I am . 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.960
 It's pumpkin. 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:19.920
 If you want to stop doing doedeoraguyo to install other block 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:23.670
 You know what this spruce wood is yireongeo yireongeo Sore not division 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:30.000
 I'll try this just once, when I stop to look fear atmosphere once haebolkka 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:34.620
 Give Bar doeja measures the feet, then kicked it ah Oh I do this picture is good. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.480
 Picture Digest Picture Good Good Good Good Good Good Mode Even more people 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.190
 In the real world 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:45.990
 I think there are a lot of people who can do anything with MineCraft . 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:50.010
 Well, I like this circuit and that strange things Bangui production is something I do not have the ability to 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:53.910
 I still have the ability to introduce nail care to me. 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:59.190
 I'll introduce you a lot of things if you have any strange things . 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:03.420
 If you want to stop this machine, please install it on your way. 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:07.440
 Then stop it . 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:13.800
 I will not break it at all. I'll try. Stop. 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:18.959
 The timing of the pause is a little ambiguous. 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:21.030
 Oh my face is m Fire 4 Giant robot figure for you 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.020
 That's a device like that . 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.600
 If you guys are interested in slime blocks or redstone circuits, 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:32.070
 Make a lot of different things. 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:35.790
 It's made by the users. The users do not think there's a manual anywhere. 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:39.750
 Do not do like that than trying to do so, putting rattling like that stick yogeo 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:43.170
 I do not think this would work, so I would not have made foreign producers. 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.950
 If there are a lot of people who do a lot of such miracles in Korea 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.330
 It's good for you 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.040
 I'm so not drills introduce foreign maps created by those users Republic of Korea 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.850
 I wish I could. 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:58.140
 Now, how did you have fun? 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:02.490
 It was such a map using a slime block added in the future . 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.180
 If you have any questions I will try to give direct drive bateusyeoseo download to your description 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.880
 wish 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.880
 So now coming twenty training
