00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760 
I use it to get a certain effect as I

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.030 
I use it to get a certain effect as I
like<00:00:12.940> my<00:00:13.150> image<00:00:13.630> to<00:00:13.750> be<00:00:13.840> flattened<00:00:14.290> I<00:00:14.470> like<00:00:14.830> my

like my image to be flattened I like my

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.730 
like my image to be flattened I like my
background<00:00:15.519> to<00:00:15.700> blow<00:00:15.880> out<00:00:16.029> of<00:00:16.180> focus<00:00:16.390> and<00:00:16.740> to

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
background to blow out of focus and to

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.410 
background to blow out of focus and to
compress<00:00:18.310> the<00:00:18.460> whole<00:00:18.610> image<00:00:18.910> and<00:00:19.090> I<00:00:19.119> keep<00:00:19.300> the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
compress the whole image and I keep the

compress the whole image and I keep the
foreground<00:00:19.869> and<00:00:20.050> the<00:00:20.140> background<00:00:20.170> kind<00:00:20.920> of<00:00:21.040> on

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
foreground and the background kind of on

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.620 
foreground and the background kind of on
the<00:00:21.279> same<00:00:21.430> plane<00:00:21.760> but<00:00:22.060> the<00:00:22.210> background<00:00:22.390> is

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
the same plane but the background is

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.909 
the same plane but the background is
totally<00:00:22.810> thrown<00:00:23.200> out<00:00:23.290> of<00:00:23.320> focus<00:00:23.560> in<00:00:23.829> my

totally thrown out of focus in my
foreground<00:00:24.310> really<00:00:24.640> stands<00:00:25.000> out<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.270> is

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
foreground really stands out and is

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.479 
foreground really stands out and is
really<00:00:25.840> punchy<00:00:26.230> with<00:00:26.590> the<00:00:26.650> wide-angle<00:00:26.860> lens

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:27.489 
really punchy with the wide-angle lens

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.540 
really punchy with the wide-angle lens
everything<00:00:28.419> is<00:00:28.599> in<00:00:29.200> focus<00:00:29.470> you<00:00:30.279> get<00:00:30.430> this

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
everything is in focus you get this

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.639 
everything is in focus you get this
broad<00:00:30.970> feeling<00:00:31.419> but<00:00:31.599> this<00:00:31.810> 300<00:00:32.380> millimeter

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
broad feeling but this 300 millimeter

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.410 
broad feeling but this 300 millimeter
lens<00:00:32.860> gives<00:00:33.160> you<00:00:33.310> the<00:00:33.430> compressed<00:00:33.910> feeling<00:00:34.300> I

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
lens gives you the compressed feeling I

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.210 
lens gives you the compressed feeling I
give<00:00:34.600> background<00:00:34.840> and<00:00:35.320> your<00:00:35.559> subject<00:00:35.829> kind<00:00:36.130> of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
give background and your subject kind of

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.220 
give background and your subject kind of
like<00:00:36.340> I've<00:00:36.550> smashed<00:00:37.180> together<00:00:37.360> I<00:00:37.750> use<00:00:38.110> the

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
like I've smashed together I use the

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.050 
like I've smashed together I use the
autofocus<00:00:38.560> the<00:00:38.860> autofocus<00:00:39.190> is<00:00:39.400> incredible

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
autofocus the autofocus is incredible

autofocus the autofocus is incredible
the<00:00:40.300> motor<00:00:40.480> in<00:00:40.660> this<00:00:40.750> 300<00:00:41.380> millimeter<00:00:41.680> is

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
the motor in this 300 millimeter is

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.900 
the motor in this 300 millimeter is
really<00:00:42.520> fast<00:00:42.790> so<00:00:43.210> for<00:00:43.690> action<00:00:44.140> sports

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
really fast so for action sports

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.950 
really fast so for action sports
milliseconds<00:00:45.910> it's<00:00:46.090> locking<00:00:46.510> in<00:00:46.750> on<00:00:46.870> the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
milliseconds it's locking in on the

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.380 
milliseconds it's locking in on the
focus<00:00:47.320> unless<00:00:47.560> you're<00:00:47.860> in<00:00:47.950> a<00:00:48.430> situation<00:00:48.760> where

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
focus unless you're in a situation where

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.380 
focus unless you're in a situation where

if the subjects to black or to white

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.970 
if the subjects to black or to white
then<00:00:52.600> it<00:00:52.660> doesn't<00:00:52.960> have<00:00:53.050> contrast<00:00:53.560> for<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:53.890> to

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
then it doesn't have contrast for it to

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.980 
then it doesn't have contrast for it to
focus<00:00:54.160> on<00:00:54.460> that's<00:00:54.970> why<00:00:55.150> the<00:00:55.210> only<00:00:55.420> time<00:00:55.810> you'd

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990 
focus on that's why the only time you'd

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.810 
focus on that's why the only time you'd
ever<00:00:56.080> want<00:00:56.380> to<00:00:56.470> use<00:00:56.680> in<00:00:56.890> any<00:00:57.010> focus<00:00:57.430> for<00:00:57.730> the

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
ever want to use in any focus for the

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.000 
ever want to use in any focus for the
most<00:00:58.000> part<00:00:58.270> you<00:00:58.750> don't<00:00:59.410> really<00:00:59.770> want<00:00:59.950> to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
most part you don't really want to

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.310 
most part you don't really want to
handhold<00:01:00.400> this<00:01:00.610> this<00:01:00.820> is<00:01:00.970> a<00:01:01.210> really<00:01:02.079> beefy

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
handhold this this is a really beefy

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.740 
handhold this this is a really beefy
lens<00:01:02.650> and<00:01:02.980> you<00:01:03.100> notice<00:01:03.400> the<00:01:04.030> camera<00:01:04.360> mount<00:01:04.540> is

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
lens and you notice the camera mount is

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.020 
lens and you notice the camera mount is
on<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.799> lens<00:01:06.009> and<00:01:06.280> out<00:01:06.460> on<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.640> body<00:01:06.790> because

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
on the lens and out on the body because

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.910 
on the lens and out on the body because
this<00:01:07.450> could<00:01:07.630> potentially<00:01:08.110> you<00:01:08.409> know<00:01:08.439> rip<00:01:08.740> off

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
this could potentially you know rip off

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.789 
this could potentially you know rip off
the<00:01:09.159> lens<00:01:09.610> mount<00:01:09.880> but<00:01:10.119> it's<00:01:10.299> pretty<00:01:11.049> beefy<00:01:11.319> and

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
the lens mount but it's pretty beefy and

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.590 
the lens mount but it's pretty beefy and
it<00:01:11.890> centers<00:01:12.280> it<00:01:12.429> but<00:01:13.030> yeah<00:01:13.149> you<00:01:13.210> would<00:01:13.390> usually

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
it centers it but yeah you would usually

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.200 
it centers it but yeah you would usually
want<00:01:13.869> to<00:01:13.929> keep<00:01:14.049> this<00:01:14.140> on<00:01:14.259> a<00:01:14.289> tripod<00:01:14.439> or<00:01:14.710> monopod

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
want to keep this on a tripod or monopod

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.639 
want to keep this on a tripod or monopod
monopod<00:01:16.210> is<00:01:16.240> is<00:01:16.719> more<00:01:17.079> like<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.380> sports

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
monopod is is more like the sports

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.889 
monopod is is more like the sports
photographer<00:01:18.189> style<00:01:18.479> fashion<00:01:19.479> photographer

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
photographer style fashion photographer

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.249 
photographer style fashion photographer
would<00:01:20.049> have<00:01:20.170> it<00:01:20.350> on<00:01:20.829> a<00:01:20.890> tripod<00:01:21.240> um<00:01:22.240> I<00:01:22.329> think

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
would have it on a tripod um I think

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.020 
would have it on a tripod um I think
it's<00:01:23.409> kind<00:01:23.530> of<00:01:23.560> cool<00:01:23.740> to<00:01:23.770> handhold<00:01:24.159> looks<00:01:24.909> like

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
it's kind of cool to handhold looks like

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.469 
it's kind of cool to handhold looks like
a<00:01:25.060> weapon

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
a weapon

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.980 
a weapon
this<00:01:25.899> lens<00:01:26.139> hood<00:01:26.759> comes<00:01:27.759> off<00:01:27.969> and<00:01:28.270> then<00:01:28.359> fold

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
this lens hood comes off and then fold

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.749 
this lens hood comes off and then fold
onto<00:01:29.319> itself<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:32.170> I<00:01:32.649> just<00:01:33.009> really<00:01:33.490> good<00:01:33.609> for

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
onto itself and I just really good for

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:34.080 
onto itself and I just really good for
luck

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
luck

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.039 
luck
you<00:01:34.359> know<00:01:34.509> keeping<00:01:35.139> out<00:01:35.289> the<00:01:35.439> unwanted<00:01:36.030> light

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
you know keeping out the unwanted light

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.679 
you know keeping out the unwanted light
but<00:01:38.049> I<00:01:38.319> actually<00:01:38.799> like<00:01:39.399> not<00:01:39.670> having<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.479> lens

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
but I actually like not having to lens

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.620 
but I actually like not having to lens
it<00:01:40.869> on<00:01:41.020> sometimes<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:42.100> get<00:01:42.280> some<00:01:42.459> Flair<00:01:42.789> to

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
it on sometimes to get some Flair to

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.569 
it on sometimes to get some Flair to
give<00:01:43.780> it<00:01:43.929> kind<00:01:44.229> of<00:01:44.319> like<00:01:44.439> a<00:01:44.469> 70s<00:01:44.950> feelings<00:01:45.310> its

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
give it kind of like a 70s feelings its

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:46.679 
give it kind of like a 70s feelings its
softens<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.149> image<00:01:46.359> a<00:01:46.479> bit<00:01:46.509> because

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
softens the image a bit because

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.959 
softens the image a bit because
sometimes<00:01:46.929> digital<00:01:47.619> images<00:01:47.920> can<00:01:48.280> appear<00:01:48.939> a

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
sometimes digital images can appear a

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.179 
sometimes digital images can appear a
bit<00:01:49.179> heavy<00:01:49.509> and<00:01:49.840> contrast<00:01:50.439> II<00:01:50.619> and<00:01:50.829> I<00:01:50.920> like<00:01:51.100> to
