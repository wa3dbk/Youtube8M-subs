00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.990
 hello friends plane dna today 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.240
 I will tell you how to buy bees but they do not 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.660
 ask those who bought me hives 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.359
 here they will buy in the spring to buy 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.960
 can from vodka or whole families does not have 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.269
 the values ​​of this need to be prepared 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.529
 it is natural to paint your evidence 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.599
 then the hull roof 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.540
 even under the lid and here you can put up 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.120
 danuska frame do not take cover 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.550
 it is necessary it is possible even to connect under 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.969
 they need gauze to wrap up this whole thing 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.700
 here is such a mesh then the bees don't 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.129
 worn out you will carry a large 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.149
 distance here you can put family 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.750
 or layouts than and comfortable this evidence they 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.960
 small car can be 5 to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.079
 download live family drivers to spend 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.170
 no problems still on top of the trunk . 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.320
 Petrik means a couple of simple tools 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.869
 with you take the smoker you beekeeper board 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.640
 I think the net can be gloves if you 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.750
 afraid not to regret 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.310
 so here you have a family suppose 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.460
 whole means tail take away 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.030
 little bees to raise and carefully 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.390
 need to look usually means family in 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.090
 April must be at least 8 frames but 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.850
 my there is already completely 12 maybe 14 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.520
 addiction which hive you should pick up 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.400
 the whole economy is in this evidence 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.840
 that is , your frames, but this one is no longer 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.860
 fit more than nine frames why 10 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.960
 but with difficulty 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.600
 with tension if the frames are new and 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.060
 standard there are such problems yet 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.420
 take a small file with your teeth 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.049
 The fact is that these frames can 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.119
 not fit 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.680
 bullet here they are longer for example y 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:08.160
 grandfathers 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:11.120
 there was a frame with long here see 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.040
 it does not fit but it will have to 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.430
 open the tips well or put under 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.580
 by the corner 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.230
 if you have enough layouts so 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.700
 put you can not cut that is 4 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:28.160
 framework but generally everything is desirable already 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.820
 to do so then do not bend means 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.700
 note 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.910
 it is better to train yourself to transplant 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.730
 people storm when buying I had a case 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.410
 that there was no uterus how to determine that 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.900
 have you take the middle take out 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.000
 some of the frames and look at this 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.750
 period should be the uterus in general on 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.080
 medium frames if not for one this is 2 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:55.470
 uterus you won't see but you see an egg and 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.320
 sat down that is if the larvae are young not 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.550
 sealed brood means uterus here 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.350
 present but people do not behave 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.070
 aggressively usually when the uterus is gone they 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.790
 very excited and and frames needed 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.400
 stopped 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.430
 rearrange from here to the same 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.489
 sequences as they stand here 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.950
 only extreme can leave a few 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:24.470
 pieces of it with honey then shake off where 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:27.239
 bees in this house and all the middle 9 pieces 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.390
 take it because here it can 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.470
 be an influx and 9 won't fit just in 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.500
 This Turik just rearranged it all here 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.959
 a little here for 2 miles then covered 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.940
 so here to start and go to 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.030
 the next clue if you still take 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.010
 Jolie the rest will be gathered here 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.350
 this hive 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.239
 pull aside even with bees 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.700
 shake out but if you neatly everything 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.230
 stop then they even practically here 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.400
 will not stay on although on the walls 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.040
 will stay a bit and if by the rules 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.350
 so that all you need to move that drag 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.720
 side flip it shake them out on 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.600
 land and here is this evidence put on his 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.070
 place and the bees will all fly into what if 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.430
 you take all the bees 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.849
 absolutely 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:21.820
 if you make a slice, then the owner 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:30.130
 You have to put here the waters 4 frames 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:34.389
 in this clue it is a standard layoff 4 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.270
 frames 2 brood perga honey 1 and 1 then 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:41.710
 there is honey rand 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:45.039
 if here from 2 from here 2 3 frames of bees 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.560
 still give you a mate or show or in 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.630
 box 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.570
 nail everything up to come up when posting 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.539
 did not move further cover even 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:59.680
 can about opening without this find grid 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:02.440
 enough space which is not a finger here 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.930
 the whole purchase is well and see the proximity puzzle 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:11.740
 if the lap and you started them 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:15.310
 attack better is to start a family not 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.970
 take it because it is a bee unknown 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.159
 Breed well host ask people in 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.919
 april 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:27.880
 peace-loving they have not gained strength yet 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:30.699
 they are cold they can be transplanted quietly 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.690
 here even without regret biysk 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:38.650
 any problems but if they are any there 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.419
 a cross between then they will fry you all up 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.340
