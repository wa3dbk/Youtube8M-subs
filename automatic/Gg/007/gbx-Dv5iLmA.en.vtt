00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
my bread tin down here

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.410 
my bread tin down here
this<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.180> mouth<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.399> floor<00:02:02.420> as

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
this is mouth to the floor as

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.510 
this is mouth to the floor as
old-fashioned<00:02:03.990> wooden<00:02:04.229> floor<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.399> weight

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
old-fashioned wooden floor so the weight

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.039 
old-fashioned wooden floor so the weight
should<00:02:05.700> come<00:02:05.909> there<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.360> above<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> top

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
should come there just above the top

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.339 
should come there just above the top
here<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:08.300> varnish<00:02:09.300> full<00:02:09.539> which<00:02:10.200> will

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
here is the varnish full which will

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.750 
here is the varnish full which will
filter<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> wax<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.250> you've<00:02:11.340> got<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> brood

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
filter the wax then you've got the brood

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.640 
filter the wax then you've got the brood
box<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.810> you've<00:02:12.900> got<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.050> old<00:02:13.140> full<00:02:13.410> turned

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
box and you've got the old full turned

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.140 
box and you've got the old full turned
upside<00:02:13.950> down<00:02:13.980> which<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.459> put<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.730> sponge<00:02:14.940> in

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
upside down which I put the sponge in

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.640 
upside down which I put the sponge in
there<00:02:15.300> because<00:02:15.810> that's<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.230> old<00:02:16.349> entrance

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650

steamer yep you're careful it does come

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.780 
steamer yep you're careful it does come
down<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:24.270> see<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.540> steaming<00:02:24.840> steam<00:02:25.790> yes

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
down you you see it steaming steam yes

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.839 
down you you see it steaming steam yes
no<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.629> can<00:02:27.810> hear<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.140> anyway<00:02:28.349> so<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:29.520> put<00:02:29.790> this

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
no you can hear it anyway so I put this

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.699 
no you can hear it anyway so I put this
thing<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.150> there<00:02:31.489> just<00:02:32.489> going<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.849> go<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.090> there

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
thing in there just going to go in there

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.250 
thing in there just going to go in there
that's<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.160> steam<00:02:35.489> will<00:02:35.640> build<00:02:35.879> up<00:02:36.260> and

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
that's it that steam will build up and

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.750 
that's it that steam will build up and
I've<00:02:37.379> got<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:37.920> dit<00:02:38.069> close<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.550> can<00:02:38.730> see

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
I've got you to dit close you can see

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.540 
I've got you to dit close you can see
it's<00:02:39.569> all<00:02:39.720> nicely<00:02:39.900> sealed<00:02:40.319> you<00:02:40.980> get<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.190> tweeny

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
it's all nicely sealed you get a tweeny

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.800 
it's all nicely sealed you get a tweeny
bit<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:41.910> escape<00:02:42.180> from<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.390> side<00:02:42.569> but<00:02:42.750> this

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
bit of escape from the side but this

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.530 
bit of escape from the side but this
works<00:02:43.110> really<00:02:43.290> well<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:44.340> done<00:02:44.819> maybe

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
works really well I have done maybe

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.830 
works really well I have done maybe
fifty<00:02:46.349> brood<00:02:46.709> boxes<00:02:47.160> using<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.420> current

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
fifty brood boxes using the current

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.170 
fifty brood boxes using the current
equipment<00:02:49.099> so<00:02:50.099> it's<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.280> really<00:02:50.640> efficient<00:02:51.060> way

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
equipment so it's a really efficient way

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.540 
equipment so it's a really efficient way
it<00:02:51.330> cost<00:02:51.569> me<00:02:51.750> nothing<00:02:51.780> at<00:02:52.379> all<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:53.400> other

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
it cost me nothing at all and the other

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.190 
it cost me nothing at all and the other
benefit<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.150> have<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.599> completely

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
benefit you have is it completely

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.740 
benefit you have is it completely
sterilizes<00:02:56.129> so<00:02:56.819> I'll<00:02:57.120> hold<00:02:57.269> it<00:02:57.360> there<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.629> may

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
sterilizes so I'll hold it there you may

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.540 
sterilizes so I'll hold it there you may
have<00:02:57.900> awesome<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.379> I<00:02:58.409> think<00:02:59.099> it<00:02:59.310> does<00:02:59.400> it

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
have awesome so I think it does it

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.160 
have awesome so I think it does it
sterilizes<00:02:59.909> the<00:03:00.150> box<00:03:00.330> from<00:03:00.420> inside<00:03:00.810> as<00:03:01.019> well

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
sterilizes the box from inside as well

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.440 
sterilizes the box from inside as well
and<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.069> melts<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.430> wax<00:03:02.610> completely<00:03:03.330> enough

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
and it melts the wax completely enough

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.910 
and it melts the wax completely enough
that<00:03:03.569> I<00:03:03.629> say<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.930> efficiency<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.560> probably<00:03:04.800> up

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
that I say the efficiency is probably up

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.250 
that I say the efficiency is probably up
to<00:03:05.159> nineteen<00:03:06.030> ninety-five<00:03:06.540> percent<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:07.019> wax

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
to nineteen ninety-five percent of wax

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.920 
to nineteen ninety-five percent of wax
melting<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.760> if<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.150> want<00:03:09.300> sterilization

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
melting and so if you want sterilization

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.320 
melting and so if you want sterilization
and<00:03:10.050> white<00:03:10.170> muslin<00:03:10.349> -<00:03:10.560> brilliant<00:03:10.769> system

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
and white muslin - brilliant system

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.280 
and white muslin - brilliant system

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
anyway I'll show you the results in a

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.610 
anyway I'll show you the results in a
second<00:03:13.650> okay<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.430> can<00:03:14.670> see<00:03:14.909> now<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.590> Jabu

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
second okay you can see now that Jabu

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.830 
second okay you can see now that Jabu
racks<00:03:17.129> is<00:03:17.370> starting<00:03:17.849> to<00:03:18.000> really<00:03:18.150> drip<00:03:18.540> through

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840
