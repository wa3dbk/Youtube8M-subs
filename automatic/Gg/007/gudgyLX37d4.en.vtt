00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.949
 The colors of nature are many if they are beautiful 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:21.230
 but how can we learn to organize these villagers 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.350
 and mixing our partner 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.169
 if we confuse 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.749
 let's see 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:30.129
 when the sunlight goes through the tiny raindrops 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.769
 Each drop of water acts as 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.740
 iron before lanús in the colors of the spectrum 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.260
 and a rainbow forms 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.830
 at one end of doing legal 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.050
 you can see the theft 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.360
 and at the other end it becomes 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.000
 under ordinary conditions 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.870
 Infrared and ultraviolet rays 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.060
 they can not be seen 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.060
 for the purpose of creating color systems 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.520
 we join the ends of this rainbow 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.520
 to form 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.110
 the two most known color systems are the trial 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.800
 and the monsoon 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.270
 the trial system and therefore the most famous 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.500
 and it consists of a wheel 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.480
 includes three original colors 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.880
 called 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.880
 primary 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.550
 the blue 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.070
 and the yellow 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.130
 these colors are mixed together 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.409
 to achieve the three nuances 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.640
 according to the law 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.030
 the theft mixes with the yellow 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.520
 to achieve a nuance 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.620
 the yellow 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.610
 mixes with blue 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.610
 to achieve a nuance 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.350
 yesterday to the south it is mixed with the robbery 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.350
 to get violet mathis 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.070
 we mix the secondary nuances 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.890
 with the primary ones there before 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.369
 to get tertiary nuances 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.669
 if we mix red and orange 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.669
 we get an orange hue 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.439
 or what is the same thing an impetus 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.249
 the orange is mixed with the yellow 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:27.299
 and it comes out 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.579
 a nuance 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.579
 yellow 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:34.619
 the yellow with the Medellin 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.619
 to get a yellow with green hues 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:40.849
 the green with the subject 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.439
 it's over 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.170
 at your level 2 or 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.639
 lose to your side 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.409
 so 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.549
 with blue and violet holds 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.549
 a nuance asur rape 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.219
 violet and theft form a theft nuance 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.999
 the colors that directly oppose 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:06.999
 the wheel is called blue colors 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:12.969
 the red and the green 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.969
 the violet and the yellow 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.729
 it is important to note 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:24.299
 that the results of the mixtures 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.499
 depend on the propulsion of the amount of pigna 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.439
 if they are included every month 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.009
 the result will also depend 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.590
 of the brand and the color grade that you buy 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.009
 while in the engraving museum 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:44.599
 stronger will be 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.819
 the color pigmentation 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.299
 at the beginning of the 20th century 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.689
 when the first attempts at color printing were made 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.299
 it was discovered 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.299
 that all the colors could not be printed 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.499
 with the primary 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:05.799
 red yellow and blue a more advanced color system hegel created by 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.959
 Alberto Monsalvo in the year 1900 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.779
 and later used by Portuguese 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:15.919
 with the 1920 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.840
 the system of colors 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.840
 the follow was used 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.099
 river 2 oct 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.069
 the yellow 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.069
 i the mayan theater a rape robbery 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:34.029
 this same matisse are used in modern printers 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:37.379
 that are used with computers 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:39.129
 the rue ramón sáenz 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.659
 set nuances that look the same distance 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.949
 one of others 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.620
 unlike the triad system 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.240
 where you can notice that nuances give unequal jumps 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.749
 one of others 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:59.949
 and there is no smooth transition 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.770
 between shades 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.800
 Another advantage of the system is that the complementary colors are more 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.860
 exact the orange 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.749
 with the blue 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:13.419
 the yellow 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.509
 with the blue rape the theft with him will go away 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.180
 or its greenish 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.529
 the violet 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.659
 with yellowish green 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.789
 and the robinson violet 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.159
 with the green 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:31.159
 a complementary color is a visual phenomenon 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.569
 that's when a color looks at you 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.499
 for 30 seconds or more 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:42.759
 and then look towards a surface 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.339
 of another color 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:48.620
 and there you will see the complementary 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.069
 with relative clarity 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.439
 let's see 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:57.419
 if you observe this said marino for 30 seconds games 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.360
 will occur the induction to which I refer 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:04.279
 do not change your look 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.939
 keep looking at the yellow 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:08.389
 the yellow color 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.330
 Complements the color violet on its side 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.460
 and when you look at it with some care 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.460
 start throwing on your neighbor 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:21.949
 this color 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.900
 if disk life persists 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.240
 will begin to see its complementary 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.550
 the violet color by his side 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.129
 in some places vibrating around the disc marín 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:38.339
 now look at this white screen 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:42.580
 here you will see the complementary color of yellow 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:44.699
 josé a 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:46.589
 the bluish violet 

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:48.499
 with more clarity 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:50.509
 for a few seconds 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:53.899
 this phenomenon is called successive image 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:57.610
 a colour 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.139
 induces on the neighboring maquis 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:02.339
 your own complementary 

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.050
 if the surface had been of another color 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.199
 if I had optically mixed the violet blue 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.499
 with that color 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:12.849
 during French impressionism 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:16.309
 in the second half of the 19th century 

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:19.629
 this phenomenon of migration was used extensively 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:22.809
 especially in pointillism 

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:25.199
 the color has three properties 

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:26.749
 the mathis 

00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:28.749
 the value or tone 

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:32.129
 and the intensity little more 

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:36.189
 So far we have talked about color as if it had only one property 

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:39.139
 a theft 

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:42.069
 a greenish yellow 

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:44.110
 unasur 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.229
 Be the color shade 

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:49.749
 but the color also has 

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:52.749
 rated as tone 

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:56.019
 little more intensity
