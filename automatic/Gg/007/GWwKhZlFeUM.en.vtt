the<00:00:34.350> afternoon<00:00:34.730> so<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.760> break<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.780> up<00:00:36.899> into

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the afternoon so I break it up into

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.830 
the afternoon so I break it up into
three<00:00:37.410> sessions<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.950> figure<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:39.480> way<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.690> works

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
three sessions I figure the way it works

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.450 
three sessions I figure the way it works
for<00:00:39.989> me<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.320> anything<00:00:40.829> more<00:00:40.980> an<00:00:41.129> hour<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
for me is anything more an hour and a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.139 
for me is anything more an hour and a
half<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.790> start<00:00:42.030> losing<00:00:42.300> focus<00:00:42.510> i<00:00:42.809> start<00:00:43.050> losing

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
half I start losing focus i start losing

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.610 
half I start losing focus i start losing
really<00:00:45.149> what<00:00:45.329> what<00:00:45.510> I'm<00:00:45.629> there<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.289> feel

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
really what what I'm there to do I feel

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.020 
really what what I'm there to do I feel
like<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> session<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.520> becomes<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
like that the session just becomes a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.139 
like that the session just becomes a
little<00:00:48.570> too<00:00:48.809> stale<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:50.370> I'm<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:50.910> just

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
little too stale and I'm just just

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.080 
little too stale and I'm just just
wasting<00:00:51.510> time<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:52.170> my<00:00:52.350> sessions<00:00:52.860> to

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
wasting time I like my sessions to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.049 
wasting time I like my sessions to
really<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.210> efficient<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.960> into<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.820> use<00:00:56.820> that

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
really be efficient and into to use that

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.160 
really be efficient and into to use that
time<00:00:57.329> as<00:00:58.170> efficiently<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:58.859> possible<00:00:59.989> but<00:01:00.989> then

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
time as efficiently as possible but then

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.229 
time as efficiently as possible but then
I<00:01:01.410> meet<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:01.980> my<00:01:02.070> coach<00:01:02.340> probably<00:01:02.940> once<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
I meet with my coach probably once a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.760 
I meet with my coach probably once a
month<00:01:03.390> who<00:01:03.690> will<00:01:03.899> probably<00:01:04.049> gather<00:01:06.650> once<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
month who will probably gather once a

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.310 
month who will probably gather once a
month<00:01:07.890> 12<00:01:08.189> times<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.610> year<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.320> get

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
month 12 times in a year and get

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.370 
month 12 times in a year and get
something<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.740> work<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.750> typically<00:01:12.750> what<00:01:13.200> what

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
something to work on typically what what

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.190 
something to work on typically what what
he's<00:01:13.590> giving<00:01:13.950> me<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.659> making<00:01:15.659> me<00:01:15.750> better<00:01:15.930> it's

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
he's giving me is making me better it's

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.810 
he's giving me is making me better it's
not<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> setback<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:17.189> certainly<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.490> different

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
not a setback it's certainly a different

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.160 
not a setback it's certainly a different
feel<00:01:18.000> every<00:01:18.330> time<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.600> change<00:01:18.750> your<00:01:18.960> swing

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
feel every time you change your swing

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.550 
feel every time you change your swing
it's<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.710> different<00:01:20.040> feeling<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:21.320> may<00:01:22.320> take<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
it's a different feeling it may take a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.109 
it's a different feeling it may take a
while<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.830> get<00:01:22.890> comfortable<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.670> it's

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
while to get comfortable but it's

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.490 
while to get comfortable but it's
something<00:01:24.420> that's<00:01:24.689> going<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.140> make<00:01:25.229> me<00:01:25.290> better

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
something that's going to make me better

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.260 
something that's going to make me better
so<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.830> start<00:01:26.130> seeing<00:01:26.369> better<00:01:26.549> results<00:01:27.090> and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
so I start seeing better results and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.450 
so I start seeing better results and
it's<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.540> lot<00:01:27.689> easier<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:28.350> put<00:01:29.070> something<00:01:29.280> in

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
it's a lot easier to put something in

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.969 
it's a lot easier to put something in
play<00:01:29.670> when<00:01:29.909> even<00:01:30.720> if<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.900> feels<00:01:31.079> funny<00:01:31.409> if<00:01:31.560> it's

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
play when even if it feels funny if it's

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.469 
play when even if it feels funny if it's
producing<00:01:32.490> better<00:01:32.640> shots<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.299> better

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
producing better shots and better

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.350 
producing better shots and better
results<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.409> easy<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.829> put<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.490> we're

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
results is it's easy to put in so we're

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.700 
results is it's easy to put in so we're
kind<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.600> once<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.930> month<00:01:37.280> together<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:39.710> then

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
kind of once a month together and then

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.620 
kind of once a month together and then
when<00:01:40.860> I'm<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.100> road<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.729> schedule<00:01:42.540> a
