00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
die together to make a negative so

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.010 
die together to make a negative so
that's<00:01:35.490> kind<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.850> cool<00:01:36.000> little<00:01:36.180> fact<00:01:36.450> about

how they did these things so you put the
thing<00:01:41.790> back<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.240> after<00:01:42.780> you've

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
thing back in after you've

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.620 
thing back in after you've
ground<00:01:45.850> all<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.090> letters<00:01:46.570> off<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.260> then<00:01:48.630> pin
