I<00:02:26.870> say<00:02:27.110> all<00:02:27.140> out<00:02:27.530> loud<00:02:27.799> in<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.250> video<00:02:28.519> of<00:02:28.760> people

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
I say all out loud in a video of people

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.220 
I say all out loud in a video of people
forget<00:02:30.190> but<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.430> wanted<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.850> demonstrate<00:02:32.230> how

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
forget but I wanted to demonstrate how

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.180 
forget but I wanted to demonstrate how
this<00:02:33.560> wax<00:02:33.890> in<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.370> locks<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.470> you'll<00:02:36.470> feel<00:02:36.920> a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
this wax in the locks so you'll feel a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.660 
this wax in the locks so you'll feel a
lump<00:02:37.430> look<00:02:37.940> at<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.480> really<00:02:38.870> hard<00:02:39.170> spot<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.489> it's

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
lump look at a really hard spot and it's

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.660 
lump look at a really hard spot and it's
a<00:02:40.760> live<00:02:41.000> residue<00:02:41.570> inside<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:43.130> this<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.489> why<00:02:43.640> I

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
a live residue inside so this is why I

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.710 
a live residue inside so this is why I
do<00:02:43.820> I<00:02:44.000> just<00:02:44.269> twist<00:02:44.810> them<00:02:44.989> out<00:02:46.209> or<00:02:47.209> we<00:02:47.420> get<00:02:47.600> is

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
do I just twist them out or we get is

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.229 
do I just twist them out or we get is
you<00:02:47.870> can<00:02:48.019> comb<00:02:48.980> out<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.130> dreadlock<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:49.910> try

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
you can comb out the dreadlock and try

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.819 
you can comb out the dreadlock and try
kick<00:02:50.450> out<00:02:50.600> them<00:02:50.810> there<00:02:51.130> but<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:54.470> know<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.620> use<00:02:54.799> a

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
kick out them there but you know I use a

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:03.660 
kick out them there but you know I use a
towel<00:02:55.190> like<00:02:56.079> this<00:02:59.320> you<00:03:00.320> can<00:03:00.500> see<00:03:00.650> he's<00:03:00.769> yellow

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.190 

and<00:03:04.670> that's<00:03:04.850> probably<00:03:05.209> all<00:03:05.450> from<00:03:05.600> the<00:03:05.810> scalp

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
and that's probably all from the scalp

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.710 
and that's probably all from the scalp
that<00:03:06.709> got<00:03:07.430> collected<00:03:08.299> along<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.260> locks<00:03:10.720> and

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720
