00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.490
 what is welcome to the new master 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.250
 tutorial and a very special one 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:19.470
 and indeed this is the hairstyle of marco 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:25.410
 almost forgot the name and reus 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:30.289
 principle also okay as you 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.289
 See, I had a time here or here 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:37.399
 almost to the middle of my forehead and me 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.290
 I have another extra with one 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.829
 razor again a small box 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.980
 so that everything looks a bit clear and 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.480
 yes that's all very much, of course 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.890
 dynamic ok then you can just the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.899
 hair in the opposite direction 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.430
 from the kath and yes just between hot 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.070
 and always change a bit 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.920
 then he gets a bit voluminous horny 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.049
 horny bears so then he takes again the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.080
 fight and camp just the hair still 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.490
 just for a moment it's easy 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.670
 again the volume and your hair 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.729
 will have 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.729
 ok then we take that 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.550
 you just get if now 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.570
 it's pretty cold it wants to be 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.130
 matt keeps really well and your hair 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.650
 do not even look at it from Dubai 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.090
 other styling is and yes you are doing it 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.869
 just a little bit in yours 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.340
 stroking hair 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.460
 and since I'm doing the hair short 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.910
 i have cut at the time 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:00.200
 two millimeters short and when it's high 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.420
 the sand millimeter comes in the upper part 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.490
 I have four millimeters at the side 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.570
 and at the bottom part from the side 2 mm 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:12.500
 and above are the hairs 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.750
 maybe always opposite of 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.390
 kart and then always nice the hair 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.530
 at the bottom also has down 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.770
 just delete the cut clearly 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:28.690
 of course always mind that 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:33.370
 everything is well distributed and all the best 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.370
 and it looks very good 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.570
 because honestly that is 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.650
 I think almost my dearest rules 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.140
 had ever shared 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.590
 and I had the last two three 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.290
 years certainly 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.110
 15 to 20 different manufacturers is 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.860
 okay then we'll see that from now on 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.019
 the side 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.150
 here it looks particularly good because 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.300
 the cut and here I still have 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:06.330
 do something gag live think this 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:11.330
 just go away but relatively easy 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.330
 out soon because I would even say ok
