00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 yo guys hello everyone since the last 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.720
 time there are a lot of rumors 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.179
 Regarding gta 6, I decided a little 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.040
 turn on your fantasy and share with 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.830
 by your thoughts about how I see 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.480
 gta 6 how would i like to see it and which one 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.090
 she must be to impress me 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.730
 I want to start with the fact that in gta 6 I would 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.740
 I wanted to see the opportunity 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.380
 interactions with the whole dad that is 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.640
 now in gta 5 we can almost not with 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.039
 we can interact with it 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.330
 move through the streets before perform 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.250
 some messi, etc. etc. 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.649
 but interact map and we basically 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.290
 we would not want to in gta 6 can 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.360
 had to go into any house i think every 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.489
 who ever ran into a cat dreams of 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.399
 this so that you can enter the house 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.100
 explore something inside lies maybe 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.899
 who lives there kill someone take 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.660
 some telly let's say for your house 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.219
 drain it drag it to the warehouse there 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.719
 get money for this telly to 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.379
 exactly could interact with 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.840
 items 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.370
 and not just look at them would be 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.469
 very cool there is the same 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.280
 possibility like the same d3 zing 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.110
 make stick and stones hatchet that is 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.880
 so that we can literally with everyone 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.799
 objects that are under our feet yes there 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.200
 lying around the bottle took something from the bottle 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.090
 did there and could constantly something 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.070
 create in gta they only use 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.590
 the fact that we have already created and come up with 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.729
 that is, now a year and what can we do 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.560
 do only what is already obvious 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.689
 we can go we can kill someone 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.439
 can crash by flying planes 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.360
 etc. etc. 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.189
 but I would like something more 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.140
 would be able to come up with something 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.579
 understand it would be very cool 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.320
 especially in the gta world 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.470
 that the opportunity to create 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.420
 some mechanisms have the opportunity 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.490
 create let's say your house of course this 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.290
 it's hard to imagine a year but let's say 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.360
 let's say we won't talk about what 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.310
 exactly this should be on some 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.259
 the city let's say you can take 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.840
 go to a certain place in 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.030
 the forest where emptiness take there to break 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.640
 wood let's say make of wood 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.520
 boards and churn out some little house it was 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.509
 It would be awesome, that is, this is really what 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.969
 not enough in gta 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.369
 so that you can interact 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.789
 absolutely completely and create something of your own 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.129
 thereby 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.870
 Generally gta representation is completely 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.209
 will change introduce yourself you can take 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.730
 and you create what you would like for a long time 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.890
 do in gta and in the same gta 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.450
 online up to call there your buddy and 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.629
 with him let's start start making your 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.390
 lodge and then take there go for no 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:31.450
 I know with someone to go to war there 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.760
 airplanes on cars and then arrive 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.030
 take there again don't know get there 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.950
 tree make wood plank and make 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.519
 finish your house again it would be a 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.530
 bowden 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.359
 I would also like to see the scale in 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.250
 gta increased further 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.870
 It's clear that in gta 5 now 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.409
 quite large mapo but I would like to 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.209
 more 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.579
 especially when you consider the fact that 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.840
 recently in the official twitter of the company 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.419
 wrote about what they dream 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.819
 combine all parts of gta v 1 new game 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:03:00.189
 let's take all the cities that were before 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.250
 this in all parts of gta and make of 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.780
 it is one big state and at the same time very 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.180
 greatly increase the scale of gta 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.849
 imagine if you combine 7 cities that 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.760
 and were in gta it will turn out very big 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.669
 Mapo and study and take a lot 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.459
 time now go crazy on gta 5 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:21.190
 you can say in 60 minutes, I would like to 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.349
 so that mom really becomes more people 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.299
 she also became more of course in gta 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.389
 online i'm talking about real people because 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.790
 what now in gta online runs only 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.109
 only 30 people on next-gen consoles 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.569
 ps4 and xbox one 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.780
 30 people quite a few so big 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.760
 map and because well 30 people what is it 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.530
 if we have big state 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.720
 I would like not for a thousand people 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.940
 then you were really densely populated 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.829
 that is a lot of people would you run 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.530
 constantly with someone met someone 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.870
 you were constantly killing there with someone you 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.609
 I do not know constantly rode cars 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.959
 before the stage 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.909
 there was just some kind of interaction not 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.650
 just like i said to everyone 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.109
 items that will lie with you 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.579
 underfoot but also with people now in 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.040
 gta 5 in principle of such interaction 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.620
 I donâ€™t have that at all if you are with 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.780
 your friend go to gta 5 then you 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.049
 get in the car and drive away from 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.849
 of all 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.229
 and like no one sees you with anyone 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.730
 not dating I would not want to 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:18.000
 life was exactly 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.859
 I also wanted people to constantly 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.840
 there were at least at some contact is 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.810
 have you ever met someone 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.150
 someone in the form of whether they are so you drive 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.520
 alone in the house gta online yes on this highway 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.680
 and in principle, nothing with you is not 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.710
 happens also would like to point out 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.600
 such a separate part of this easter eggs in gta 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.490
 5 there were a lot of easter eggs and me 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.949
 I would like them to become in gta 6 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.470
 only more because it's Easter eggs 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:47.889
 awesome thing that makes you 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.139
 really think about something to ponder 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.630
 remember there may be some references to 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.340
 previous parts of gta 5 it was very 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.169
 much and it delivered real 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.240
 pleasure is not the same easter eggs 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.370
 let some animals sometime 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.710
 again came on a new generation of consoles 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.090
 Easter eggs appeared animals could 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.780
 become an animal that was full 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.060
 awesome 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.979
 and of course I want to gta 6 such 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.900
 Easter eggs just got bigger and 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.090
 more basically on this my fantasies 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.729
 end i expressed my opinion 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.710
