00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
wingman being worked on this project is

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.940 
wingman being worked on this project is
most<00:00:09.090> likely<00:00:09.570> yeah<00:00:10.110> it's<00:00:10.349> not<00:00:10.620> gonna<00:00:10.769> be

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
most likely yeah it's not gonna be

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.100 
most likely yeah it's not gonna be
finished<00:00:11.309> like<00:00:11.460> this<00:00:11.630> since<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.900> discovery

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
finished like this since the discovery

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.289 
finished like this since the discovery
of<00:00:13.469> being<00:00:13.830> able<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.070> load<00:00:14.250> games<00:00:14.549> from<00:00:14.910> an<00:00:15.150> SD

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
of being able to load games from an SD

of being able to load games from an SD
card<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:16.080> case<00:00:16.470> just<00:00:16.800> isn't<00:00:17.039> really

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
card this case just isn't really

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.120 
card this case just isn't really
necessary<00:00:17.730> anymore<00:00:18.180> it's<00:00:18.779> very<00:00:19.410> square<00:00:19.949> and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
necessary anymore it's very square and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.609 
necessary anymore it's very square and
bulky<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.119> do<00:00:21.570> like<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.990> controller<00:00:22.320> flank

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
bulky and I do like the controller flank

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.200 
bulky and I do like the controller flank
I<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:22.830> because<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.369> really<00:00:23.490> like<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> comfort

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
I do because I really like the comfort

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.050 
I do because I really like the comfort
of<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.720> GameCube<00:00:25.590> controllers<00:00:26.099> but<00:00:26.430> it's<00:00:26.849> not

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
of the GameCube controllers but it's not

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.429 
of the GameCube controllers but it's not
worth<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.390> for<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.630> small<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.960> could<00:00:28.199> make<00:00:28.320> it

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
worth it for a small I could make it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.980 
worth it for a small I could make it
portable<00:00:28.609> without<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> DVD<00:00:30.119> drive<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.599> very

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
portable without a DVD drive it's very

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.089 
portable without a DVD drive it's very
small<00:00:31.380> that's<00:00:31.529> really<00:00:31.800> all<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.070> need

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
small that's really all you need

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.620

actually<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.820> only<00:00:32.910> need<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.570> this

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
actually you only need this and this

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
right now I have an adapter like this

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.670 
right now I have an adapter like this
one<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:36.809> big<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.170> bulky<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.500> I'm

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
one but it's big and bulky and I'm

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.410 
one but it's big and bulky and I'm
working<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.040> smaller<00:00:38.399> one<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.820> just<00:00:38.969> made

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
working on a smaller one I just made

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.750 
working on a smaller one I just made
this<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.050> try<00:00:40.530> out<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.100> wiki<00:00:41.250> fusion

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
this one to try out the wiki fusion

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.549 
this one to try out the wiki fusion
months<00:00:42.030> if<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.450> get<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.690> work<00:00:42.840> myself<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.530> I

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
months if I can get to work myself and I

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.590 
months if I can get to work myself and I
could<00:00:43.770> thanks<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.460> handy<00:00:45.149> guides<00:00:45.329> of

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
could thanks to the handy guides of

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.740 
could thanks to the handy guides of
ashen<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.430> hit<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.610> very<00:00:48.030> nice<00:00:48.300> discovery

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
ashen and hit this very nice discovery

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.869 
ashen and hit this very nice discovery
that<00:00:48.870> he's<00:00:48.989> made<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.590> chip<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.670> we

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
that he's made it for this chip so we

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.790 
that he's made it for this chip so we
just<00:00:51.030> turn<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.660> without<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.500> disk<00:00:52.739> drive

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
just turn this on without a disk drive

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.700 
just turn this on without a disk drive
it<00:00:53.250> loads<00:00:53.579> into<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.539> BIOS<00:00:55.050> screen<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
it loads into the BIOS screen of the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.580 
it loads into the BIOS screen of the
Gamecube<00:00:56.870> all<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.170> do<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.410> go<00:00:58.559> up

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
Gamecube all you have to do is go up

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.020 
Gamecube all you have to do is go up
here<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.930> say<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.640> adapter

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
here I say on that and then this adapter

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.460 
here I say on that and then this adapter
is<00:01:03.090> actually<00:01:03.300> very<00:01:03.359> fidgety<00:01:03.690> right<00:01:04.080> now<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.439> I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
is actually very fidgety right now so I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.780 
is actually very fidgety right now so I
hold<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.180> it<00:01:06.180> does<00:01:06.420> load<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:07.700> sometimes<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
hold that it does load up sometimes the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.109 
hold that it does load up sometimes the
taker

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
taker

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.120 
taker
takes<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.570> couple<00:01:09.689> buttons<00:01:10.020> button<00:01:10.830> presses

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
takes a couple buttons button presses

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.490 
takes a couple buttons button presses
for<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.400> adaptor<00:01:11.790> specifically<00:01:12.500> mostly

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
for this adaptor specifically mostly

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.920 
for this adaptor specifically mostly
because<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> 36<00:01:14.820> pin<00:01:15.150> adapter<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
because this is a 36 pin adapter and

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.789 
because this is a 36 pin adapter and
it's<00:01:16.020> only<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.259> 32<00:01:16.740> pin<00:01:16.920> cable<00:01:17.540> but<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:19.530> works

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
it's only a 32 pin cable but it works

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.460 
it's only a 32 pin cable but it works
for<00:01:19.950> now<00:01:20.960> here<00:01:21.960> we<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.680> load<00:01:23.009> up<00:01:23.040> Mario<00:01:23.549> Kart

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
for now here we can load up Mario Kart
