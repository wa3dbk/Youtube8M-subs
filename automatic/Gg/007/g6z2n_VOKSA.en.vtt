we get it open we find out there's a
picture<00:05:28.300> of<00:05:28.450> Obama<00:05:28.540> in<00:05:29.020> there<00:05:29.770> this<00:05:30.550> I<00:05:30.790> don't

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
picture of Obama in there this I don't

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.220 
picture of Obama in there this I don't
know<00:05:31.000> what<00:05:31.120> this<00:05:31.270> appears<00:05:31.630> to<00:05:31.690> be<00:05:31.900> but<00:05:32.080> it's

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
know what this appears to be but it's

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.010 
know what this appears to be but it's
like<00:05:32.320> some<00:05:32.650> type<00:05:32.860> of<00:05:33.150> maybe<00:05:34.150> ID<00:05:34.570> chip

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
like some type of maybe ID chip

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.130 
like some type of maybe ID chip
RFID<00:05:35.740> chip<00:05:36.190> maybe<00:05:37.030> a<00:05:37.120> speaker<00:05:37.600> may<00:05:37.810> be<00:05:37.870> a<00:05:37.930> way

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
RFID chip maybe a speaker may be a way

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.320 
RFID chip maybe a speaker may be a way
of<00:05:38.170> tracking<00:05:38.530> device<00:05:38.920> or<00:05:39.100> something<00:05:39.310> as<00:05:39.580> you

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
of tracking device or something as you

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.410 
of tracking device or something as you
can<00:05:40.480> also<00:05:40.690> look<00:05:41.110> inside<00:05:41.500> as<00:05:42.430> we<00:05:42.700> get<00:05:42.910> it<00:05:43.920> open

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
can also look inside as we get it open

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.620 
can also look inside as we get it open
you<00:05:46.420> can<00:05:46.600> see<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:47.290> inner<00:05:47.470> workings<00:05:48.300> are<00:05:49.300> not

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
you can see the inner workings are not

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.210 
you can see the inner workings are not
very<00:05:51.540> technical<00:05:52.540> at<00:05:52.960> all<00:05:53.110> looks<00:05:53.920> like<00:05:54.010> we<00:05:54.190> just

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
very technical at all looks like we just

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.770 
very technical at all looks like we just
got<00:05:54.430> some<00:05:54.760> little<00:05:55.450> wires<00:05:55.660> right<00:05:55.990> here

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
got some little wires right here

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.230 
got some little wires right here
actually<00:05:58.780> we<00:05:58.990> do<00:05:59.110> not<00:05:59.260> know<00:06:00.930> where<00:06:01.930> the<00:06:02.140> minion

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
actually we do not know where the minion

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.060 
actually we do not know where the minion
it's<00:06:04.240> his<00:06:04.870> voice<00:06:05.020> from<00:06:05.260> because<00:06:05.650> as<00:06:05.800> you<00:06:05.920> can

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
it's his voice from because as you can

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.910 
it's his voice from because as you can
see<00:06:06.220> there<00:06:06.430> is<00:06:06.520> no<00:06:06.700> battery<00:06:07.090> inside<00:06:07.620> it<00:06:08.620> looks

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920 
see there is no battery inside it looks

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.940 
see there is no battery inside it looks
like<00:06:09.070> it's<00:06:09.250> from<00:06:09.340> Obama<00:06:09.760> I<00:06:09.880> think<00:06:09.940> Obama<00:06:10.450> was

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
like it's from Obama I think Obama was

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.260 
like it's from Obama I think Obama was
doing<00:06:11.950> he<00:06:12.130> wasn't<00:06:12.460> speaking<00:06:12.670> through<00:06:13.120> the

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
doing he wasn't speaking through the

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.900 
doing he wasn't speaking through the
minion<00:06:13.660> because<00:06:13.990> as<00:06:14.140> we've<00:06:14.440> seen<00:06:14.550> it<00:06:15.550> was<00:06:15.700> all

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
minion because as we've seen it was all

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.150 
minion because as we've seen it was all
put<00:06:16.180> together<00:06:16.300> so<00:06:16.840> the<00:06:17.140> Illuminati<00:06:17.650> eye<00:06:17.740> right

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
put together so the Illuminati eye right

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.580 
put together so the Illuminati eye right
there<00:06:18.190> with<00:06:18.850> the<00:06:18.940> Illuminati<00:06:19.360> eye<00:06:19.510> and<00:06:20.290> that's

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
there with the Illuminati eye and that's

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.070 
there with the Illuminati eye and that's
it<00:06:20.830> for<00:06:20.980> this<00:06:21.070> edition<00:06:21.460> of<00:06:21.520> father<00:06:21.760> and<00:06:21.970> son<00:06:22.080> as

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
it for this edition of father and son as

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.570 
it for this edition of father and son as
you<00:06:23.260> can<00:06:23.410> see<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.680> menu<00:06:23.890> still<00:06:24.250> look<00:06:24.430> the<00:06:24.460> same

you can see the menu still look the same

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.880 
you can see the menu still look the same
because<00:06:25.120> for<00:06:25.360> some<00:06:25.510> reason<00:06:25.540> they<00:06:26.260> regenerate

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
because for some reason they regenerate

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.680 
because for some reason they regenerate
even<00:06:27.250> after<00:06:27.550> being<00:06:27.760> boiled<00:06:28.140> broiled<00:06:29.140> and

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
even after being boiled broiled and

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.580 
even after being boiled broiled and
microwaved<00:06:31.690> and<00:06:32.850> then<00:06:33.850> kilt<00:06:34.180> bashed<00:06:35.080> and

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
microwaved and then kilt bashed and

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:48.239 
microwaved and then kilt bashed and
bashed<00:06:36.160> with<00:06:36.640> butter<00:06:37.150> hammer<00:06:37.390> right

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:48.249
