00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.619

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.869
 I did not pay attention I am 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.729
 sorry when you approach a passage 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.869
 pedestrian you have to slow down 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.569

 the other side welcome it's okay no 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.160
 why do you stop at once 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.660
 I expect it to what you're 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.819

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.860

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.239

 I was about to double 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.430

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.829

 [Music] 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.620

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.710

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:22.730

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.210
 [Music] 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.720
 in bed 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:39.080

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.730
 two you do not have anything kevin doug you do not 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.220
 never have to cross the street running 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.810
 even when the fire is green but I 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.270
 thought we could go there when 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.870
 the fire was green yes me too when the 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.790
 fire is green 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.070
 we have permission to cross but 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.140
 not yet as you did be 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.600
 cautious cars may not see 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.460
 the passage to the red light is braked too much 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.360
 late 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.520
 so how should we do for 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.950
 cross the busy road of life dre 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.959
 Stolen goods to daddy I have a method 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.220
 there are just three points to remember and 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.510
 who could cross the street without 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.000
 take no risk 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.740
 only three points first point 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.090
 always stop on the edge of the 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.860
 sidewalk before committing to the 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.810
 pedestrian crossing and wait for the fire 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.290
 for pedestrians to be green even though the 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.769
 fire is green 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.330
 you have to stop and look at your side 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.350
 second point make sure that all 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.510
 the cars stop before 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.190
 cross to watch the drivers 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.570
 in the eyes and say and whoever all 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.860
 the cars are stopped crossing 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.960
 the third point 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.300
 do not leave cars with eyes 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.950
 going through good checks you see 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.950
 all cars and that all 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.260
 drivers sees you 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.729
 [Music] 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.590
 then you will remember yes 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.270
 what is important is not 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.470
 to cross quickly but it is to cross 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:57.710
 safely 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:05:00.840
 good price it's pretty thank you guys 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:04.380
 nice gift for you then we 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:08.040

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:15.320
