I'm<00:03:35.569> primarily<00:03:36.260> known<00:03:36.439> for<00:03:36.500> print<00:03:37.340> in<00:03:37.549> color

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
I'm primarily known for print in color

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.910 
I'm primarily known for print in color
so<00:03:38.360> for<00:03:38.930> this<00:03:39.079> particular<00:03:39.379> collection<00:03:39.769> I

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
so for this particular collection I

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.559 
so for this particular collection I
decided<00:03:40.280> that<00:03:40.430> of<00:03:40.670> our<00:03:40.790> neutral<00:03:41.239> palette

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
decided that of our neutral palette

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.059 
decided that of our neutral palette
would<00:03:41.780> be<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:41.959> little<00:03:42.319> bit<00:03:42.379> more<00:03:42.500> radical<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:43.040> a

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
would be a little bit more radical and a

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.770 
would be a little bit more radical and a
bit<00:03:43.219> of<00:03:43.310> departure<00:03:43.939> because<00:03:44.060> also<00:03:44.450> there's<00:03:44.659> so

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
bit of departure because also there's so

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.209 
bit of departure because also there's so
much<00:03:44.900> color<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.379> print<00:03:45.650> around<00:03:45.950> at<00:03:46.129> the

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:46.219 
much color and print around at the

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:47.949 
much color and print around at the
moment<00:03:46.250> so<00:03:46.760> I<00:03:47.030> think<00:03:47.120> it's<00:03:47.390> really<00:03:47.599> nice<00:03:47.750> way

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
moment so I think it's really nice way

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.170 
moment so I think it's really nice way
for<00:03:48.200> me<00:03:48.319> to<00:03:48.349> just<00:03:48.709> focus<00:03:49.400> on<00:03:49.519> technique<00:03:49.969> you

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
for me to just focus on technique you

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.979
