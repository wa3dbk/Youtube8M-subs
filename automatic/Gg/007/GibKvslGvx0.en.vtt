cable<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.979> batteries<00:02:03.399> LG<00:02:04.119> was<00:02:04.479> advertising<00:02:05.470> a

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
cable to batteries LG was advertising a

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.100 
cable to batteries LG was advertising a
lot<00:02:05.950> on<00:02:06.160> giving<00:02:06.849> out<00:02:06.970> two<00:02:07.209> batteries<00:02:07.660> the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
lot on giving out two batteries the

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.529 
lot on giving out two batteries the
probably<00:02:08.800> because<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:10.060> competitor

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
probably because the the competitor

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.780 
probably because the the competitor
galaxy<00:02:10.840> s6<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.470> s6<00:02:11.560> edge<00:02:11.920> doesn't<00:02:12.550> have<00:02:12.760> a

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
galaxy s6 and the s6 edge doesn't have a

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.780 
galaxy s6 and the s6 edge doesn't have a
replaceable<00:02:13.360> battery<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.860> it's<00:02:15.040> two<00:02:15.489> three

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
replaceable battery so it's two three

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.130 
replaceable battery so it's two three
thousand<00:02:16.209> milliamps<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.630> battery<00:02:16.959> and

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
thousand milliamps of battery and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.350 
thousand milliamps of battery and
there's<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.440> better<00:02:17.830> charging<00:02:18.400> dock<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:21.360> a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
there's a better charging dock and a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.940 
there's a better charging dock and a
little<00:02:22.720> carrying<00:02:22.989> case<00:02:23.050> if<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.709> want<00:02:23.860> to
