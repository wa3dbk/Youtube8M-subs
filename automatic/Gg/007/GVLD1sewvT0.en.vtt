do<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.739> skip<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.100> tab<00:00:35.610> jump<00:00:35.940> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
do I have to skip this tab jump to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.670 
do I have to skip this tab jump to
collect<00:00:36.329> bubbles<00:00:36.660> alright<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.500> he

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
collect bubbles alright so he

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.950 
collect bubbles alright so he
automatically<00:00:38.280> runs<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.120> because

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
automatically runs for you because

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.709 
automatically runs for you because
that's<00:00:40.379> what<00:00:40.739> he<00:00:40.980> does<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.309> guess<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.760> hold

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
that's what he does I guess and hold

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.080 
that's what he does I guess and hold

course they had the entire series so

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.830 
course they had the entire series so
this<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.710> basically<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:09.270> an<00:01:09.420> iPhone

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
this is basically just a like an iPhone

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.179

kind<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.200> game<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.470> guess<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.890> why<00:01:11.040> they
