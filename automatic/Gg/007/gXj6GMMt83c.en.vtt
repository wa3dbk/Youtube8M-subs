little<00:02:29.890> slot<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.690> when<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:31.870> break<00:02:32.680> them<00:02:32.860> up<00:02:33.040> when

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
little slot so when I break them up when

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.309 
little slot so when I break them up when
I<00:02:33.280> broke<00:02:33.489> them<00:02:33.700> out<00:02:33.819> break<00:02:34.390> them<00:02:34.480> apart<00:02:34.569> to

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
I broke them out break them apart to

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.119 
I broke them out break them apart to
plant<00:02:35.590> them<00:02:35.769> they<00:02:36.400> propyl<00:02:37.030> probably<00:02:37.599> got

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
plant them they propyl probably got

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.059 
plant them they propyl probably got
which<00:02:39.129> shocked<00:02:39.909> the<00:02:40.209> pocket<00:02:40.540> shocked<00:02:40.750> and

which shocked the pocket shocked and

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.589 
which shocked the pocket shocked and
stunned<00:02:42.069> for<00:02:42.370> probably<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.730> week<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.209> they<00:02:43.450> did

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
stunned for probably a week and they did

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.080 
stunned for probably a week and they did
not<00:02:43.810> grow<00:02:44.500> very<00:02:44.739> well<00:02:44.799> compared<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.849> the<00:02:45.940> rest

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
not grow very well compared to the rest

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.009 
not grow very well compared to the rest
of<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.500> neighbors<00:02:47.500> here<00:02:48.629> so<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:49.720> rest<00:02:49.870> of

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
of the neighbors here so the rest of

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.130 
of the neighbors here so the rest of
neighbor<00:02:50.200> grow<00:02:50.950> extremely<00:02:51.250> well<00:02:51.849> fast<00:02:52.810> and

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
neighbor grow extremely well fast and

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.720 
neighbor grow extremely well fast and

base oh very big and the Leafs of green
and<00:03:12.730> plants<00:03:13.389> is<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:13.750> healthy<00:03:13.989> you<00:03:14.260> can<00:03:14.410> tell

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
and plants is so healthy you can tell

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.379 
and plants is so healthy you can tell
and<00:03:15.190> compared<00:03:15.549> to<00:03:15.609> this<00:03:15.700> guy<00:03:15.940> right<00:03:16.329> there

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
and compared to this guy right there

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.710 
and compared to this guy right there
look<00:03:16.930> at<00:03:16.989> this<00:03:17.819> so<00:03:18.819> this<00:03:18.849> is<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.090> lesson<00:03:19.299> for<00:03:19.480> me

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
look at this so this is a lesson for me

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.559 
look at this so this is a lesson for me
from<00:03:20.470> my<00:03:20.620> experience<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.430> this<00:03:21.940> is<00:03:22.000> for<00:03:22.239> for

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
from my experience and this is for for

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.059 
from my experience and this is for for
my<00:03:22.690> experience<00:03:23.019> I<00:03:23.230> think<00:03:23.290> it's<00:03:23.650> not<00:03:23.829> worth

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
my experience I think it's not worth

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.990 
my experience I think it's not worth
doing<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.760> I<00:03:25.000> think<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:26.290> should<00:03:26.470> if<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:26.680> buy

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
doing that I think you should if you buy

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.830 
doing that I think you should if you buy
plant<00:03:28.000> 6<00:03:28.510> plant<00:03:28.780> 6<00:03:29.500> pack<00:03:29.819> just<00:03:30.819> choose<00:03:31.180> 6<00:03:31.569> of<00:03:31.750> a

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
plant 6 plant 6 pack just choose 6 of a

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.990 
plant 6 plant 6 pack just choose 6 of a
plant<00:03:32.169> that's<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.500> most<00:03:32.650> healthy<00:03:33.099> so<00:03:33.880> when

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
plant that's the most healthy so when

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.220 
plant that's the most healthy so when
you<00:03:34.090> transplant<00:03:34.510> them<00:03:34.630> over<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:34.989> ground

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
you transplant them over to the ground

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.080 
you transplant them over to the ground
you<00:03:36.069> don't<00:03:36.099> get<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:37.299> plant<00:03:37.840> into<00:03:38.049> shock

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
you don't get the plant into shock

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.080 
you don't get the plant into shock
breaking<00:03:40.090> up<00:03:40.209> a<00:03:40.329> cloud<00:03:41.099> so<00:03:42.099> this<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.400> one<00:03:42.790> of<00:03:42.910> my

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
breaking up a cloud so this is one of my

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.750 
breaking up a cloud so this is one of my
learning<00:03:43.750> lesson<00:03:44.200> next<00:03:44.349> and<00:03:44.650> experience<00:03:45.099> and

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
learning lesson next and experience and

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.780 
learning lesson next and experience and
I<00:03:45.819> think<00:03:45.849> it's<00:03:46.660> worth<00:03:47.139> noting<00:03:47.709> in<00:03:48.130> my<00:03:48.370> for<00:03:48.700> my

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
I think it's worth noting in my for my

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.099 
I think it's worth noting in my for my
record<00:03:50.190> okay<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.549> that's<00:03:51.760> my<00:03:52.060> my<00:03:52.810> latest

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109

Persian<00:03:56.079> cucumber<00:03:56.590> beautiful<00:03:57.489> cucumber<00:03:57.970> I

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
Persian cucumber beautiful cucumber I

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.580 
Persian cucumber beautiful cucumber I
just<00:03:58.299> planted<00:03:58.629> over<00:03:58.720> like<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:58.930> say<00:03:59.169> over<00:03:59.379> a<00:03:59.410> week

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
just planted over like I say over a week

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.059 
just planted over like I say over a week
ago<00:03:59.889> and<00:04:00.549> I<00:04:00.879> also<00:04:01.000> back<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.480> this<00:04:01.720> trellis<00:04:02.200> this

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
ago and I also back to this trellis this

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.240 
ago and I also back to this trellis this
is<00:04:03.220> over<00:04:03.459> 7<00:04:03.849> a<00:04:03.879> half<00:04:04.060> feet<00:04:04.239> tall<00:04:04.620> trellis<00:04:05.620> like

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
is over 7 a half feet tall trellis like

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.220 
is over 7 a half feet tall trellis like
that<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:07.090> fence<00:04:07.299> is<00:04:07.389> six<00:04:07.720> feet<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.109> then

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
that the fence is six feet and then

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.590 
that the fence is six feet and then
above<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.680> almost<00:04:09.459> two<00:04:09.760> feet<00:04:10.000> above<00:04:10.299> that

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
above that almost two feet above that

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.470 
above that almost two feet above that
so<00:04:10.720> live<00:04:11.230> it<00:04:11.260> over<00:04:11.560> seven<00:04:11.830> half<00:04:12.010> feet<00:04:12.220> tall

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
so live it over seven half feet tall

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.550 
so live it over seven half feet tall
there's<00:04:13.480> plenty<00:04:13.780> of<00:04:13.810> room<00:04:13.960> for<00:04:14.020> them<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:14.350> climb
