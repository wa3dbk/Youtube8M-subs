00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
 here supported reports one freezes the EU just for financial aid 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.180
 Countered that Rolfes 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.630
 Ideally, the federal government has found a way to implement radical reform 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.470
 or to turn to German customers they are not allowed to simply 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.429
 Greece 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.939
 yes the Greeks have kept a golden rule people differ 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.269
 then right 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.630
 and now a Greek bankruptcy supposedly does not change it 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.390
 Of course, this is only possible if the Greeks initiate a radical career 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.260
 if not then let it be in a Greek bankruptcy on the one hand 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.460
 squint and all because of the much too loose entrance examination at the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.470
 EU so for the next candidate then please take care of the 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.460
 Mountaineer 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.770
 After all, some of the tattoo artists hush up as the Greeks 5 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.200
 namely when they change their customers' skin from past to present 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.030
 Make love disappear or at least clear with the new tattoo 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.030
 make the very big love is extinguished 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.220
 but that with the Greeks also has its good now can finally put pressure on them 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.780
 Exercise any at Rehhagel 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.060
 although the contract renewal by Michael Ballack is more likely 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.810
 has become 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.399
 in even mountains goes to distance to part of it the DFB yes in their fitness 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.560
 For example, washing machines are buying to promote youth 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.729
 this concept you can even play football in the washing drum or 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.509
 Just jog and jersey wash and incidentally power and time 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:29.280
 reduce 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.680
 These two guys are sure to find something good for their needs 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.260
 Star Trek movie t-shirt what's up with 122 t-shirts? 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.119
 worn and have certainly been strong in a sweat 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.130
 m in the attempt to their opposite but one time to wipe out one but 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.069
 Of course, the worst thing is that the equipment was hard to get 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:48.170
 go out again 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.640
 although successively anti-Muslim boring I now have 20 t-shirt 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.740
 but dressed at the same time 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.520
 yes unfortunately the saleswoman has and monitor 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.210
 My advice was not that it is so cold outside and that they are 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.350
 ultimately do not turn 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.240
 but for freezing skyscrapers 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.649
 everything but the spectators than those yet 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.950
 okay the opponents I do not really synonymous warming but the 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.659
 Beautification with these solar cells equipped Milan can be old 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.090
 ugly skyscrapers namely the wind arises its cost 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.190
 Turning skyscrapers we really loved that 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.079
 probably the fire department when it burns 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.239
 In the name of high-rise he's actually a bit presumptuous dollar me 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.699
 my measured by the universe is not my unevenness 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:34.280
 you can see that again very nice mostly lower of the Universe 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.620
 A coin interactive animations that take the viewer from the big whole over 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.690
 away from the people 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.949
 is in Lower Franconia size leads 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:45.919
 By the way, the biggest differences in the straight are similarly remarkable 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.659
 Berthold explained more to Adriani, who left everything outstanding 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.759
 Ski but from a small town in the wild west popular with the locals 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:56.379
 loved by his heart lady 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.179
 and with himself and the world in pure he has one day in the city 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:04.179
 first woman on 80's actually grown 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:08.839
 that he was finally in Erlangen 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.689
 you can do it on the left
