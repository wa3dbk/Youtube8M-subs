00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.780
 this new trailer just came out of 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.460
 gta 5 where I will show the three characters 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.490
 that we can use in the history of this 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.100
 highly anticipated game that will come out more or 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.460
 less around mid-September 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.119
 I leave you with the trailer we feel after a 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.119
 beautiful girl 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.750
 or the sappe is affected 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.950
 we are a small idea 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.860
 when you did crazy feet echoed immediately 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.860
 exhibition 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.240
 sweet 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.170
 6 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.650
 that's enough 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.490
 Reggio Emilia 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:02:08.550
 they are the first to be asked to come 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:08.550
 not so much to talk about thousands 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.180
 haga the file 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.000
 it's not undressing 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.570
 rather 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.230
 it helps 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.170
 hey joe joe too 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.079
 old people 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.840
 Msgr 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.230
 sarmi 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.610
 well guys this was the trailer for 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.030
 gt5 the trailer of the three characters that 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.819
 we can use in the countryside no one knows 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.609
 again, in other words, we don't know if it will be there 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.769
 one of our relight follow or 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.600
 the character will have to be chosen 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.389
 continue with that this 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.070
 we'll find out later and go to 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:32.110
 analyze the three characters 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:36.690
 the first is michael an adult let's say a 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:39.310
 forty year old full of money 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:43.300
 surely with this character yes 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.639
 will go to robbery like that can 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.550
 also say a great second character 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.100
 I should see September when 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.340
 the game came out as it will be according to e 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.280
 Franklin the Negro from San Ghetto 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.120
 Andreas War Sicari is definitely 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.010
 what struck me most is that 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.990
 I will choose first if I ever have to 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.810
 choose a character 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.450
 the third and last and trevor I find the 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.520
 old drugged or alcoholic country 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.289
 no one knows well 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.020
 a freak out who combines it with 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.590
 all the colors in my opinion is also him 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.080
 will be a great character well 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.060
 trailer of the three characters that we can 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.830
 use su gta 5 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.510
 I hope you hit the bus and video 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.080

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.080
