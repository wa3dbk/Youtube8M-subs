00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
was pretty cool but the one thing I'd

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
hundred-plus fail and a lot of people

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.450 
hundred-plus fail and a lot of people
say<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:21.900> 100<00:00:22.470> plus<00:00:22.590> available<00:00:22.949> Allah<00:00:23.279> but

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
say that 100 plus available Allah but

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.980 
say that 100 plus available Allah but
this<00:00:23.670> one<00:00:24.180> hundred<00:00:24.420> percent<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.810> fail

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
this one hundred percent is a fail

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.279 
this one hundred percent is a fail
because<00:00:25.340> in<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.910> end<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.210> game<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.689> was<00:00:28.080> in

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
because in the end of the game I was in

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.960 
because in the end of the game I was in
an<00:00:28.470> osprey<00:00:28.769> gunner<00:00:28.980> as<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.400> game<00:00:29.550> ended<00:00:29.849> i

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
an osprey gunner as the game ended i

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.429 
an osprey gunner as the game ended i
just<00:00:30.359> called<00:00:30.570> an<00:00:30.660> osprey<00:00:30.900> owner<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.230> game

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
just called an osprey owner in the game

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.799 
just called an osprey owner in the game
ended<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:31.949> i<00:00:32.790> couldn't<00:00:33.239> guarantee<00:00:33.390> you

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
ended and that i couldn't guarantee you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.389 
ended and that i couldn't guarantee you
would<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.050> easily<00:00:34.290> got<00:00:34.559> me<00:00:34.710> six<00:00:34.920> kills<00:00:35.160> more

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
would have easily got me six kills more

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.040 
would have easily got me six kills more
likely<00:00:35.730> would<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:35.880> got<00:00:36.030> me<00:00:36.149> around<00:00:36.329> 10<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.660> 15

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
likely would have got me around 10 to 15

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.410 
likely would have got me around 10 to 15
so<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.890> could<00:00:37.980> have<00:00:38.010> been<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> 105<00:00:38.850> 110

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
so it could have been like a 105 110

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.080 
so it could have been like a 105 110
kill<00:00:40.260> flawless<00:00:40.710> gameplay<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.280> regardless

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
kill flawless gameplay but regardless

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.630 
kill flawless gameplay but regardless
this<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.390> still<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> really<00:00:43.050> cool<00:00:43.200> gameplay<00:00:43.640> 94

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
this is still a really cool gameplay 94

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.920 
this is still a really cool gameplay 94
and<00:00:44.760> 0<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.390> definitely<00:00:45.539> one<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
and 0 and this is definitely one of the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.119 
and 0 and this is definitely one of the
higher<00:00:46.050> flawless<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.680> modern<00:00:46.860> warfare<00:00:47.010> 3

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
higher flawless is in modern warfare 3

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.459 
higher flawless is in modern warfare 3
i'm<00:00:47.340> pretty<00:00:47.520> sure<00:00:47.700> definitely<00:00:47.910> top<00:00:48.180> 10<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.660> i

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
i'm pretty sure definitely top 10 and i

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.410 
i'm pretty sure definitely top 10 and i
think<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.129> highest<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> lmg

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
think this is the highest with a lmg

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.330 
think this is the highest with a lmg
because<00:00:52.260> i<00:00:52.320> know<00:00:52.379> most<00:00:52.649> le<00:00:52.860> ones<00:00:53.039> are<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
because i know most le ones are with the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.240 
because i know most le ones are with the
ACR<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> mp7<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:54.719> something<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.920> i'm

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
ACR like a mp7 or something and so i'm

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.650 
ACR like a mp7 or something and so i'm
using<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.760> definitely<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> weaker<00:00:57.390> gun<00:00:57.539> than

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
using a definitely a weaker gun than

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.060 
using a definitely a weaker gun than
those<00:00:57.780> two<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.469> still<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.680> pretty<00:00:58.920> good

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
those two so this is still a pretty good

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.430 
those two so this is still a pretty good

getting another Reaper and that's the
amazing<00:02:18.040> part<00:02:18.220> always<00:02:18.550> once<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:18.880> get<00:02:19.030> that

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
amazing part always once you get that

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.300

first<00:02:19.330> Reaper<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.290> next<00:02:20.500> Reaper<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:21.010> get<00:02:21.250> it

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
first Reaper the next Reaper you get it

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.650 
first Reaper the next Reaper you get it
will<00:02:21.430> only<00:02:21.520> take<00:02:21.640> like<00:02:21.820> two<00:02:22.120> or<00:02:22.240> three<00:02:22.270> kills

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
will only take like two or three kills

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.720 
will only take like two or three kills
and<00:02:22.930> then<00:02:23.830> every<00:02:24.130> reprieve<00:02:24.400> for<00:02:24.520> that<00:02:24.640> it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
and then every reprieve for that it

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.560 
and then every reprieve for that it
should<00:02:24.880> be<00:02:24.940> less<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.270> less<00:02:25.330> skilled

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
should be less and less skilled

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.140 
should be less and less skilled
eventually<00:02:26.050> so<00:02:26.770> you<00:02:27.280> just<00:02:27.490> you<00:02:27.790> just<00:02:27.820> keep

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
eventually so you just you just keep

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.430 
eventually so you just you just keep
going<00:02:28.300> on<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.510> cycle<00:02:28.870> with<00:02:28.960> kill<00:02:29.140> streaks<00:02:29.350> and

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
going on a cycle with kill streaks and

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.720 
going on a cycle with kill streaks and
kill<00:02:29.590> streaks<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:29.950> it's<00:02:30.100> just<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:30.400> works<00:02:30.580> out

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
kill streaks and it's just it works out

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.830 
kill streaks and it's just it works out
really<00:02:30.910> really<00:02:31.030> well<00:02:31.210> as<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.570> can<00:02:31.660> see<00:02:31.720> right
