00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.759
 when I'm putting the strings now 

00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:06.500
 as I have disassembled the tremolo as there 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.610
 to be careful not to overdo it when 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.410
 ropes when d 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.869
 of removing the springs I removed for 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.000
 be able to remove the tremolo then now 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.529
 As you can see I have put two strings and one 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 furniture as before had three springs and 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.800
 if it is sane the rule of three is fine 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 easy to follow is worth then I'm going to 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.980
 keep putting strings and putting a 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.829
 springs until it is more or less 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.419
 stability until all the 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.759
 tests I want you to see how it works 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.480
 put a rope because there are many people 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.520
 that not 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.720
 has not held well in fact if you 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.400
 you remember at the beginning of video we have 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.110
 said that the guitar scratched the 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.610
 serious strings a little bit like that and here is 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.379
 I had very few laps in general 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.989
 two laps is recommended here 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.280
 put maybe too many but I 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.350
 I prefer to spend to stay short 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.699
 because if you put little spin what 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.840
 can happen is that the rope at the end 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.450
 this 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.320
 slip and finish tune that 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.680
 etc 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.140
 Also, if you notice that this rope is 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.840
 coming from under the stem of the 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.610
 tuner that is posts to go around 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.650
 in this case on this string would give me 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.180
 same but in this one that does not have this 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.610
 plate to maintain an adequate angle 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.650
 with respect to the c it is important 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.180
 that these strings come from below is 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.479
 say go winding down 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.040
 as I go around the shank that 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.330
 they are opining themselves downwards not 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.530
 up because if they pull up 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.930
 they are too horizontal with 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.670
 Regarding the c valella we are going to 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.160
 put now this rope that is nothing and 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.869
 let's see how it is done there are thousand 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.420
 techniques to wind up without any 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.090
 it's better to teach us one if it 's okay if 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.240
 I like it because you have internet 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.630
 very low 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.930
 I leave that the scion has the 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:46.050
 hole looking over there I remember 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.510
 I put the rope through the hole 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.920
 these are tuners they do not have 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.420
 blocking with the blocks is much more 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.520
 easy to lock the rope at this point 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.500
 it is already that the returns are worth 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.600
 important in the part of the bridge pull 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.640
 to make sure that you have arrived 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.080
 the fund is worth 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.260
 here without the cave being tense 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.179
 more or less up here for centimeters 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.959
 or three is worth and here in doubles 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.959
 into the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.810
 ok with this double she goes alone 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.069
 hit is worth then to see the trick 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.730
 is to make it happen is first by 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.620
 below this one 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.450
 we are loose below the end 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.680
 that is going to stay and then do that 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.940
 the end that only remains pass through 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 below the loose end in such a way 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.080
 that way a knot is made and caught 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.700
 with himself is worth then first is 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.349
 above because we want that in the end 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.349
 that below is above this one 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.819
 and has gone around 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.160
 and now we're going to make him do what 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.520
 opposite that happens below we pass 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.520
 from above 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.319
 and this one that we keep pulling and we're going to 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.319
 force her to go down 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.200
 in between 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.340
 I also cut this end 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.709
 and I'm putting two ropes and a dock 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.659
 two ropes and a dock but put a 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.250
 government facilitated then you do not have to 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.870
 do try to remove them is easy 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.180
 remove them by hand pulling here is already 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.159
 but to put them and if you are here at 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.060
 final it turns out that you leave your fingers and 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.099
 it is very complicated that it is a 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.980
 flat blade screwdriver like this 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.430
 It's worth more for the little hole you do here 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.430
 lever 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.230
 While 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.749
 previously just in case I was 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.549
 I've put vicuÃ±ita here so that 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:52.579
 the density itself is not very is it was 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.799
 too high will not make the bridge 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.300
 timber 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.340
 if you are getting fat 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.260
 he has already put the six strings of 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.820
 I thought the agreement still 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.090
 tuning tension I honestly was 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:08.660
 a little more or less tense are already 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.990
 pretty laxas I've put here my my 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.150
 dear cunita not to scratch worth then 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.120
 our are already very exposed then 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.540
 when you look here there are many guitars 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.810
 they have these things here that 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.940
 defender is called string trio tree of 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.370
 ropes and they simply serve to 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.540
 give enough exit angle from 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.430
 the nut 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.040
 from the eyebrow then it is worth the 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.180
 rope loosely from the whole then that of 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.550
 down to catch a little more of 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.070
 tension and there are already some guitars 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:44.030
 fender that have two of these of these 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.430
 Rope trees for the sun ropes 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.260
 and king also also came from here and 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.310
 there are some people have one worth and 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.720
 there are some that do not have any 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.990
 simply this obeys the need 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.240
 what to defend does not do to the incline 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.580
 if he made them during the 270 and still 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.830
 they sell it is in reissues install 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.390
 200 models of stratocaster so you 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.139
 you find everything but there are many 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.819
 guitars 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.129
 and apart from the guitars on which 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.629
 this comes out with an angle then this from 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:10.400
 here it is not necessary because the angle of 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:12.409
 exit from health schools to the 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.330
 own shape of the guitar head 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.379
 central I suppose that in his day he decided 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.990
 that's how it was a lot more 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:19.729
 economic use of wood and 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.729
 do them because the people who do 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.529
 inclined heads has or that 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.680
 use a much fatter piece of 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:29.210
 wood or they take out the wood 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.889
 making an angle and gluing which 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.990
 it is also a point of failure then 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.120
 this is a very elegant solution but 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.669
 that yes tried to assure you if you have 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.129
 this kind of head that bobby knight 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.409
 the strings down the stem of the 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:44.210
 founder in such a way that you give him a 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.150
 little bit of angle in general they will 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:51.229
 they say that the ideal is to have between 5 and 12 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.120
 degrees of exit from school to the 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.740
 accelerator with which you can make a 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.150
 picture and see if you are and surely not 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.879
 you can be for example this rope the 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.080
 I do not think I have that inclination anymore 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:04.129
 lack 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:08.889
 greater has always that they are dominating 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:08.889
 down you have the guitar quite 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.310
 well I put all the strings and 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.590
 I have tuned I used the tuner 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.060
 and how I put the strings that were 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.440
 of the same caliber as the tests that 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.510
 there was more or less the bridge was not 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.130
 has moved vale were from another brand and it's 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.240
 true that the bridge is a tad low 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.160
 it is not in all those specifications 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.950
 that told you that you have to be between 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.230
 2.4 and 3.2 is a little bit lower but 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.790
 Well maybe I leave it like this because if 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.160
 they gave it to me and if I return it because 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.650
 As the owner liked there is a trick 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.060
 very important that you know the day that 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.600
 You want to change the caliber of 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.100
 ropes 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.420
 when you change the caliber of the strings 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.430
 changes the tension of the strings and by 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.500
 so much you have to touch the springs if you 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.630
 you put to touch the springs before a tuna 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.510
 reacting with the clue is then the 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:55.120
 trick is to get a wooden board 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.620
 that will not damage the finish and Talita 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.660
 wood that has the thickness that you 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.160
 you want for the bottom of the bridge if you 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.070
 you want very down because because you just 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.660
 use the tremolo 24 if you want it 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.580
 very high because you want the tremolo 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.850
 give you at least as much my peak when 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:12.070
 you have of him then 32 you are 2.8 that is 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.110
 one thing in between 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.030
 does not fit well , the first one does not enter 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.760
 the bridge is too low imagine 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.120
 that if it did enter then it is worth what 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.120
 we would do it 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.680
 go here to the screws tighten them 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.560
 as they are a couple and we want them to continue 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.330
 parallel we are going squeezing 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.090
 we are always squeezing it equally 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.950
 say it's gone and half a turn is worth it 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.110
 here I would also turn around I'm going 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.000
 squeezing in such a way that is 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.620
 prisoner this right now is 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.560
 pain prison the way to leave it 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:47.050
 well adjusted would be loosening the 

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.910
 screws little by little half turn half 

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:52.060
 turn half a turn half a turn until 

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:54.220
