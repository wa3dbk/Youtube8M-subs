00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.140
 hi friends sometimes arises 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.540
 need for mapping some 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.389
 large design elements in one 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.849
 picture or for example in the view 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.480
 one composition and at the same time from different 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.230
 angles in this case, I suggest 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.810
 resort to such a technique as a collage 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.090
 for clarity, we will analyze the simplest 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.930
 collage option but which we end 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.109
 the result 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.050
 we will see several works of one 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.750
 topics and so for a start I chose 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.829
 matching subject photo background 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.899
 our collage and our own open it 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.969
 through photoshop version of my 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.039
 programs cs5 background we will not carry 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.030
 no global information therefore 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.250
 blur it in a gauss blur 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.930
 the filter in my opinion is the most 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.090
 optimal solution 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.550
 especially for serious collages if 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.530
 let's say you will make a gift 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.680
 photo collage for your friends and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.680
 relatives 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.280
 therefore I recommend using it 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.869
 This filter can of course 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.619
 experiment filter let's say 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.150
 put a wave distortion but then the background 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.000
 will be 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:27.210
 variegated quite flashy let's say so 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.659
 here you can amplitude wavelength 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.930
 change of course it all depends on the situation 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:39.030
 but the main thing is not to overdo it with creativity 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:42.450
 we have a creative collage so you can 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.110
 Of course a little on figachit but not so 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.100
 strongly set distortion 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:53.119
 filter ripple example 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.720
 yes I think it will be good also 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:01.670
 bit subtract background brightness new layer 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.259
 fill white blurred it 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:10.289
 opacity is about 30 percent 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:16.050
 and finally proceed to download 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:19.770
 photos in our file open select 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.650
 a group of pictures we need and just 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:27.170
 drag them with our mouse to our work 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:32.489
 Enter the zone using the enter key 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:37.590
 enter here they appear enter next 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.830
 enter photos uploaded as a smart object 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.380
 and 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.630
 and now we need to rasterize 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.400
 layers so that there are no problems with 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.530
 using any functions whether 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:52.200
 filter right button rasterize 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:54.840
 Here we go to the next layer. 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.299
 displacement and proper 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:06.299
 we scatter our photos on the background 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:09.380
 layer at that distance on those places which 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.380
 you liked 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.980
 via 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.540
 i-shift change the size of the chef is needed in order 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.120
 so that we keep the proportions and 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.700
 lest we jump from the window every time 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.800
 It became with layers in our work area 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.550
 you can simply use the key 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.330
 control 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.390
 we hover the control and 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:41.150
 layer is activated using Shift 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.150
 increase control shift 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.640
 double click control here 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:56.010
 activated your five control 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:04:07.519
 activated shift increased aiming 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:07.519
 Marafet raise increase 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:24.250
 as with a handful of them they are a little more fun together 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.240
 beauty can of course endlessly 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:42.110
 it turned out to add general chaos 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.200
 slightly rotate photos to tilt 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.860
 them as a soul wish what is called 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.560
 but my soul told me it was better 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.100
 leave here and vertically in this 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.100
 case 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:06.920
 also add text new text layer 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:15.530
 tool flowers and baskets and another one 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:27.290
 layer with our visa and advertisement for 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:27.950
 Krasnoyarsk city customers and triple site 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:35.169
 w 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:35.169
 a and slave point ru so edit 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:47.630
 Now let's give the photos some such 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:51.070
 let's say 3d effect to create 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.270
 the illusion that they are floating in the air 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.180
 choose one with the right button 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.900
 photo right click on the layer 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:05.150
 click overlay settings 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:14.110
 shadow shade expose parameters we 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:18.200
 immediately shown changing the angle and also a 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:21.289
 also add a stroke style immediately 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:25.070
 change the stroke color more lightly 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:29.900
 some put not such a mourning not 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:32.270
 so that the position must be put 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.910
 inward and because if we leave 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.780
 position outside then look what have 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.270
 us going 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.550
 The edges are rounded so 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:45.200
 way you need to change the position inside 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:47.680
 and the size is approximately put 67 pixels on 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:51.640
 my opinion is optimal of course you can 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:55.610
 experiment in this plan 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:07:00.410
 copy the layer style and put it on everything 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:03.130
 the rest of the photos as well as our layers with 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:08.870
 text flowers basket city krasnoyarsk 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:12.800
 right button and paste the layer style well 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.520
 everything is great, we have everything 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.490
 happened 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.370
 the lesson is over don't be afraid to experiment 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.410
 they develop imagination well in our 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.160
 air creativity is only a plus 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.160
 good luck
