always<00:00:06.930> there<00:00:07.730> my<00:00:08.730> family<00:00:09.179> opened<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.570> ice

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
always there my family opened the ice

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.860 
always there my family opened the ice
rink<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.290> our<00:00:10.410> teacher<00:00:10.679> California<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.870> I'm

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
rink in our teacher California and I'm

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.420 
rink in our teacher California and I'm
on<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.559> ice<00:00:13.590> fairly<00:00:15.680> quite<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> lot<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.340> know

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
on the ice fairly quite a lot you know

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.730 
on the ice fairly quite a lot you know
nothing<00:00:17.880> much<00:00:18.060> Asia<00:00:18.359> they<00:00:19.170> gave<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.560> key
