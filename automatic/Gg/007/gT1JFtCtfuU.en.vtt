00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.590
 so we figured out the setting 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.719
 the appearance of the operating system dos 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.730
 learned how to customize the desktop and 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.800
 taskbar and now go ahead and 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.650
 consider another context item 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.570
 desktop menu which is called 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.910
 permit the game for this let's 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.590
 First, call the context menu for 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.070
 this my free working area 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.680
 of the table 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.360
 right click will appear 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.279
 context menu and 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.670
 from this context menu, let's 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.040
 Select the screen resolution option will appear 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.730
 eponymous window screen resolution 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.920
 what is the screen resolution remember 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.620
 we just found out that the screen has 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.690
 the size so here is the screen resolution it 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.440
 the number of points of which will be 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.170
 to form 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.570
 image on the screen of your monitor you 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.270
 You can ask the size of the screen size and 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.120
 permission is not the same no no 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.610
 quite so remember the example of the leaflet in 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.430
 cage and drawing so imagine 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.100
 imagine that you are drawing a similar picture 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.430
 that is, painting over the cells in order 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.440
 to form a pixel but in your 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.060
 case you will paint over not one 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.570
 cell and immediately four 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.170
 that is, you will shape your 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.440
 picture 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.170
 also seems to be from points but each your 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.650
 the dot will contain 4 cells 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.190
 in the same way on the monitor you can 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.070
 be screen size 1600 by 1200 pixels 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.590
 and the resolution you set to 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.680
 your monitor will be 800 by 600 pixels 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.440
 and accordingly all the images that 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.280
 will be displayed on your screen will 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.310
 to form 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.409
 by the principle which I described 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.420
 just that is according to our principle 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.030
 picture in which. 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.100
 formed by four cells but on 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.990
 in fact this is all theory and mine 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.490
 recommendations here will be very simple 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.860
 always try to install 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.619
 screen resolution which is equal to the size 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.409
 your screen size monitor screen 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.750
 You can learn from the instructions which 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.599
 attached as usually applied to 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.160
 monitor when buying it in this case 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.770
 when the screen resolution and 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.810
 monitor size monitor screen size 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.960
 matches you will not have any 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.450
 problems usually do so in order 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.060
 to change the screen resolution you 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.710
 you need to click here on the data 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.020
 this black arrow will appear 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.110
 drop down list from this list you 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.090
 can choose size 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.070
 more precisely the resolution you want 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.800
 permission should not be set 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.630
 which is more your screen resolution 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.580
 Well, accordingly, there is no 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.230
 meaning set the resolution that is 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.720
 less case if you install 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.060
 resolution which is less resolution 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.310
 your screen size you can 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.500
 there are certain problems with 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.810
 display such as fonts from your 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.540
 fonts may not be displayed clearly. 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.920
 specifically related to some other 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.420
 moments about which I do not want now 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.260
 speak because it's already clean 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.780
 theory and just memorize one simple 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.250
 screen resolution rule right here 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.850
 must fit your size 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.070
 monitor which is indicated by the instructions if 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.920
 it is not so choose here and click 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.820
 ok button after that no problems 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.820
 you won't have
