00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
as they see this monster they all go

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:23.830 
as they see this monster they all go
after<00:01:21.439> them<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.969> diamond<00:01:23.359> this<00:01:23.509> tier

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
after them and the the diamond this tier

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.859 
after them and the the diamond this tier
two<00:01:24.189> nite<00:01:25.189> is<00:01:25.399> stronger<00:01:26.149> and<00:01:26.329> he<00:01:26.420> also<00:01:26.659> does

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
two nite is stronger and he also does

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.440 
two nite is stronger and he also does
more<00:01:27.049> damage<00:01:27.079> because<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.859> the<00:01:28.149> other<00:01:29.149> diamond

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
more damage because of the other diamond

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.599 
more damage because of the other diamond
sword<00:01:29.749> and<00:01:29.990> that<00:01:30.499> is<00:01:30.619> it<00:01:30.799> for<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:31.189> end<00:01:31.369> nights

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
sword and that is it for the end nights

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.879 
sword and that is it for the end nights
now<00:01:31.969> we<00:01:32.029> have<00:01:32.270> tier<00:01:32.569> 1<00:01:32.840> and<00:01:32.869> tier<00:01:33.079> two<00:01:33.439> archers

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:33.889 
now we have tier 1 and tier two archers

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:36.669 
now we have tier 1 and tier two archers
and<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.880> theory<00:01:35.149> two<00:01:35.600> is<00:01:35.899> better<00:01:36.350> because

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
and the theory two is better because

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.639 
and the theory two is better because
he'll<00:01:37.130> fire<00:01:37.459> quicker<00:01:37.939> and<00:01:38.270> I'll<00:01:39.170> go<00:01:39.469> and

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
he'll fire quicker and I'll go and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.139 
he'll fire quicker and I'll go and
demonstrate<00:01:40.159> him<00:01:40.340> right<00:01:40.490> now<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:40.999> it's

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
demonstrate him right now so it's

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.199 
demonstrate him right now so it's
spawned<00:01:41.420> some<00:01:41.630> more<00:01:41.810> zombies<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:43.090> then<00:01:44.090> as

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
spawned some more zombies and then as

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.449 
spawned some more zombies and then as
you<00:01:44.299> can<00:01:44.329> see<00:01:44.599> here<00:01:44.810> this<00:01:45.259> one<00:01:45.560> shows<00:01:45.859> about<00:01:46.009> 3

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:46.459 
you can see here this one shows about 3

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.510 
you can see here this one shows about 3
for<00:01:46.759> everyone<00:01:47.299> that<00:01:47.929> the<00:01:48.259> tier<00:01:48.770> 1<00:01:48.799> shoots<00:01:49.340> so

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
for everyone that the tier 1 shoots so

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.489 
for everyone that the tier 1 shoots so
that's<00:01:50.029> why<00:01:50.209> he's<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:50.719> know<00:01:50.779> better<00:01:51.049> with
