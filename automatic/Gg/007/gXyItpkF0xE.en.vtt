00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
works so basically just put the the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.039 
works so basically just put the the
corners<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.189> all<00:01:05.400> right<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.479> then<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.869> pull

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
corners in all right and then just pull

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.260 
corners in all right and then just pull
it<00:01:07.170> over<00:01:09.260> and<00:01:10.549> there<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.640> go<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.060> nice<00:01:12.240> and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it over and there we go so it's nice and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.030 
it over and there we go so it's nice and
pretty<00:01:12.840> secure<00:01:13.170> their<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.470> never<00:01:13.710> felt

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
pretty secure their you I never felt

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.039 
pretty secure their you I never felt
like<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.369> was<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.640> go<00:01:14.850> anywhere<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.960> it

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
like it was going to go anywhere so it

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.899 
like it was going to go anywhere so it
seems<00:01:16.170> would<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> nice<00:01:16.830> secure<00:01:17.310> fit<00:01:17.369> and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
seems would be a nice secure fit and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.670 
seems would be a nice secure fit and
with<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.900> really<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.229> doesn't<00:01:19.409> obstruct

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
with that you really it doesn't obstruct

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.620 
with that you really it doesn't obstruct
the<00:01:19.979> iPad<00:01:20.400> at<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.030> down<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> bomb<00:01:21.420> you

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the iPad at all so down the bomb you

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.149 
the iPad at all so down the bomb you
could<00:01:21.780> see<00:01:21.960> all<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> ports<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.560> controls<00:01:22.740> are

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
could see all the ports and controls are

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.740 
could see all the ports and controls are
open<00:01:23.490> usually<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.030> run<00:01:24.240> through<00:01:24.270> here<00:01:24.600> but

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
open usually I do a run through here but

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.630 
open usually I do a run through here but
I<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.080> can<00:01:25.200> see<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.430> quick
