Aqualung I'm at Catalina Island for
today<00:00:18.300> I've<00:00:18.600> observed<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.350> lot<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.920> divers

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
today I've observed a lot of divers

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.460 
today I've observed a lot of divers
getting<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.880> out<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.180> water<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:22.320> one

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
getting in and out of the water and one

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.170 
getting in and out of the water and one
thing<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.769> noticed<00:00:23.189> there's<00:00:23.550> way<00:00:23.789> too<00:00:23.850> many

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
thing I noticed there's way too many

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.359 
thing I noticed there's way too many
divers<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:24.810> are<00:00:25.199> diving<00:00:25.410> with<00:00:25.710> ill-fitted

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
divers that are diving with ill-fitted

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.720 
divers that are diving with ill-fitted
BC's<00:00:26.880> or<00:00:27.920> some<00:00:28.920> divers<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.429> may<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
BC's or some divers that may have the

BC's or some divers that may have the
right-sized<00:00:30.240> BC<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.470> BC<00:00:31.920> tends<00:00:32.189> to

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
right-sized BC but the BC tends to

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.270 
right-sized BC but the BC tends to

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
someone diving the raptor is going to be

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.069 
someone diving the raptor is going to be
amazed<00:00:53.579> how<00:00:53.850> light<00:00:54.090> their<00:00:54.329> cylinder<00:00:54.780> feels

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079

and<00:00:55.379> how<00:00:55.829> they're<00:00:55.980> able<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.190> stand<00:00:56.579> up

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
and how they're able to stand up

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.490 
and how they're able to stand up
straight<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> cylinder<00:00:57.899> drawn<00:00:58.289> in

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
straight and have the cylinder drawn in

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.770 
straight and have the cylinder drawn in
close<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.980> their<00:00:59.129> center<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.460> gravity<00:00:59.940> to

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.149 

demonstrate<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.140> features<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> Raptor

demonstrate the features of the Raptor
harness<00:01:05.519> system<00:01:05.670> we've<00:01:06.420> taken<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:06.990> our

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
harness system we've taken one of our

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.710 
harness system we've taken one of our
BCS<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.040> removed<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> air<00:01:08.670> cell<00:01:09.030> so

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
BCS and have removed the air cell so

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.719 
BCS and have removed the air cell so
that<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> Raptor<00:01:10.320> harness<00:01:10.740> system<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.280> in

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
that the Raptor harness system is in

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.380 
that the Raptor harness system is in
plain<00:01:12.000> view<00:01:13.130> we<00:01:14.130> start<00:01:14.460> by<00:01:14.939> talking<00:01:15.000> about

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
plain view we start by talking about

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.890 
plain view we start by talking about
this<00:01:15.720> custom<00:01:16.500> ultra<00:01:17.189> thin<00:01:17.460> backplate<00:01:18.299> it's

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
this custom ultra thin backplate it's

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.170 
this custom ultra thin backplate it's
thin<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> cylinder<00:01:20.009> will<00:01:20.220> be<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.549> close<00:01:20.909> to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
thin so the cylinder will be in close to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.330 
thin so the cylinder will be in close to
the<00:01:21.270> divers<00:01:21.600> center<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.960> gravity<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.189> may

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
the divers center of gravity but you may

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.910 
the divers center of gravity but you may
also<00:01:23.490> notice<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.180> small<00:01:24.479> backplate<00:01:25.049> lowers

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
also notice the small backplate lowers

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.190 
also notice the small backplate lowers
the<00:01:26.100> tank<00:01:26.369> band<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.880> integrates<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.600> into<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the tank band and integrates it into the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.160 
the tank band and integrates it into the
BC's<00:01:28.619> waistband<00:01:29.299> this<00:01:30.299> places<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.780> load<00:01:31.049> of

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
BC's waistband this places the load of

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.760 
BC's waistband this places the load of
the<00:01:31.259> cylinder<00:01:31.799> securely<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> divers<00:01:33.150> hips

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
the cylinder securely on the divers hips

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.770 
the cylinder securely on the divers hips
also<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> valve<00:01:35.790> retention<00:01:36.450> strap

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
also we have a valve retention strap

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.420 
also we have a valve retention strap
that<00:01:37.049> pulls<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.380> top<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> cylinder<00:01:38.189> in

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
that pulls the top of the cylinder in

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.819 
that pulls the top of the cylinder in
close<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.150> diver<00:01:39.390> keeping<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> cylinder

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
close to the diver keeping the cylinder

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.399 
close to the diver keeping the cylinder
perfectly<00:01:41.520> vertical<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:43.079> may<00:01:43.229> notice

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
perfectly vertical and you may notice

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.770 
perfectly vertical and you may notice
the<00:01:43.680> diver<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.250> stand<00:01:44.579> up<00:01:44.759> straight<00:01:45.149> because

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the diver can stand up straight because

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.600 
the diver can stand up straight because
the<00:01:46.079> cylinder<00:01:46.439> feels<00:01:46.710> lighter<00:01:47.100> than<00:01:47.430> what

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
the cylinder feels lighter than what

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.569 
the cylinder feels lighter than what
they're<00:01:47.790> used<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.829> to<00:01:49.829> demonstrate<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
they're used to to demonstrate the

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.920 
they're used to to demonstrate the
importance<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.329> valve<00:01:51.570> or<00:01:51.720> tension

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930

the<00:01:57.750> first<00:01:58.110> reaction<00:01:58.380> from<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> diver<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
the first reaction from the diver is to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.359 
the first reaction from the diver is to
move<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.540> head<00:02:00.810> neck<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.649> upper<00:02:02.159> body

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
move the head neck and upper body

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.240 
move the head neck and upper body
forward<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.869> try<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.140> support<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.009> weight<00:02:05.219> of
