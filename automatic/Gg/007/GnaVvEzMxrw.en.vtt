 reviews go up and daily express is 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.439
 he asked but a lay state can 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.439
 have public policies based on 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.420
 moral and religion in the same line 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.350

 ecuavisa 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.180
 when the state tries to tell me the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.059
 official moral goes on this side the moral 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.890

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.680

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.960
 active and with these features 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.219
 it would also be an interference of the state 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.899
 and under the pompous name of caricature 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.239
 daily trade points out that the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.480

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.430
 example because there is talk of abstinence 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.650
