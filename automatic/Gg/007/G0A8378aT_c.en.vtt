nightmare we thought about buying a
dishwasher<00:00:27.060> but<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.390> very<00:00:27.539> expensive<00:00:27.930> and

my son is have told me that it's not
really<00:00:30.119> effective<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:31.199> got<00:00:31.439> me<00:00:31.590> thinking

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
really effective this got me thinking

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.889 
really effective this got me thinking
about<00:00:32.250> another<00:00:32.610> convenient<00:00:33.120> way<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.600> doing

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
about another convenient way of doing

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.930 
about another convenient way of doing
this<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.320> there<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.100> got<00:00:35.370> an<00:00:35.489> idea<00:00:35.880> of

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
this and there I got an idea of

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.510 
this and there I got an idea of
something<00:00:36.239> like<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> scrubber<00:00:37.340> maybe<00:00:38.340> an

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
something like a scrubber maybe an

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.639 
something like a scrubber maybe an
electrical<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:39.149> well<00:00:39.809> fine<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.079> really<00:00:40.500> knew

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
electrical one well fine I really knew

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.709 
electrical one well fine I really knew
this<00:00:40.829> idea<00:00:41.190> would<00:00:41.340> work<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.760> had<00:00:42.030> not<00:00:42.210> imagined

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
this idea would work I had not imagined

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.690 
this idea would work I had not imagined
how<00:00:42.870> much<00:00:43.020> effort<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.680> time<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.250> would<00:00:44.670> take

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
how much effort and time it would take

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.029 
how much effort and time it would take
till<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.690> Whitworth<00:00:46.020> steam<00:00:46.350> started<00:00:46.739> working

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
till the Whitworth steam started working

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.100 
till the Whitworth steam started working
on<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.879> sat<00:00:48.090> down<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.420> do<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> expert

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
on it we sat down to do the expert

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.869 
on it we sat down to do the expert
evaluation<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:49.860> Scrabble<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.370> figure<00:00:50.850> out

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
evaluation for Scrabble and figure out

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.760 
evaluation for Scrabble and figure out
the<00:00:51.059> practical<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.809> economic<00:00:52.230> viability<00:00:52.410> of

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the practical and economic viability of

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.560 
the practical and economic viability of
making<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.699> developed<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.149> very<00:00:54.270> basic

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
making it we developed a very basic

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.600 
making it we developed a very basic
prototype<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.680> moment<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.100> tried<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
prototype and the moment we tried it to

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.610 
prototype and the moment we tried it to
wash<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> couple<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.329> dishes<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:58.170> knew<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.500> we

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
wash a couple of dishes we knew that we

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.810 
wash a couple of dishes we knew that we
had<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.800> make<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:58.980> for<00:00:59.219> everyone

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
had to make it for everyone

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.029 
had to make it for everyone
skur<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.690> had<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.989> be<00:01:01.109> able<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.379> clean<00:01:01.710> utensils

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
skur we had to be able to clean utensils

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.369 
skur we had to be able to clean utensils
of<00:01:02.430> different<00:01:02.850> shapes<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.210> sizes<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.899> know

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
of different shapes and sizes I know

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.469 
of different shapes and sizes I know
this<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:04.949> not<00:01:05.100> an<00:01:05.250> easy<00:01:05.460> task<00:01:05.760> considering

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
this was not an easy task considering

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.240 
this was not an easy task considering
that<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.960> had<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.229> clean<00:01:07.409> utensils<00:01:07.740> without

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that you had to clean utensils without

that you had to clean utensils without
damaging<00:01:08.700> them<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.270> studied<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.689> devices

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200
