00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello everyone on the other side and the teeth of cranes 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.140
 This is droid rus exhibition computers 2014 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.450
 0 day asus company one of the headliners 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.820
 exhibition presented a bunch of all sorts 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.780
 devices but one device combines in 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.710
 myself five full twosters by the way 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.140
 device asus transformer book in the sense of you 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.750
 this is 5 probably no tracks and let's go 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.260
 take turns the first device is android 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.930
 smartphone 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.000
 that's how it looks thick enough 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.489
 inside there is a battery not so much 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.880
 big two thousand 500 milliampere hours 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.340
 or 550 screen we have permission here with 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.079
 them especially yet or become cranes 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.420
 it is impossible because all the same it is the dough I 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.129
 model then everything works through time therefore 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.129
 We will not verify the performance and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.329
 there is a connector micro beaten as usual 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.329
 spirit there is a 2 megapixel camera 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.129
 rear 8 megapixel camera logo 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.350
 speaker basically nothing special 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.390
 below there are special connectors from odes 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.190
 who just connect here to this 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.629
 docking stations well, just about 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.600
 implemented as a device under the background 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:09.600
 Now we divide these devices by 2 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.000
 and now we have a tablet with a screen of 12 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.549
 line go and but the resolution on this screen 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.250
 also expect as well as on the phone 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.840
 apparently here in general all the components were 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.490
 used to cheapen 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.470
 here is this all universal 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.900
 design so that all this does not cost as 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.150
 worth its weight in gold as you see now we have 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.570
 the screen is not android this operating system 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.610
 windows 8 1 here there is a button 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.560
 logo windows when insert 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.930
 a smartphone appears on the screen like this 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.329
 small little phone and here we are 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.430
 we can run some stuff now 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.720
 there was especially nothing to click pressed 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.880
 on the house because everything can peek 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.619
 by pressing this button here we 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.899
 switch to android and now we have 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.009
 the OS is also displayed on the screen 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.110
 like on the smartphone 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.149
 it was just you and the device phone 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.680
 android tablet and 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.630
 windows tablet well besides 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.090
 naturally and from windows laptop and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.100
 android smartbook well, just all of these 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.630
 five devices i listed let's 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.320
 let's see what's interesting here 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.060
 there is a usb port and one more 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.099
 usb port 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.510
 in principle, there is nothing else on 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.489
 docking station inside costs only 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.110
 processor battery is not there and in 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.050
 basically no more stuffing 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.260
 the processor stands in the smartphone itself 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.060
 intel atom some of the last and 2 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.040
 the processor stands directly in 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.690
 tablet so basically wednesday like me 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.620
 already showed you can work when you 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.390
 disconnects 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.860
 device itself which processor again is not 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.599
 says but most likely it will be 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.910
 intel core that concerns RAM in 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.430
 the phone costs 2 gigabytes of tablet 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.870
 worth four more gigabytes but i'm so 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.600
 I understand that he can not use 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.670
 immediately 6 gigabytes he can use 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.230
 only for these four or these two in 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.120
 depending on which mode 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.660
 device is used 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.390
 the canopy is all this together is enough 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.140
 weighty thing if you fold rather 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.450
 where to devour such a complex 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.280
 state it looks like that I do not 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.500
 would say it looks compact and 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.440
 but he is very very strange 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.750
 may surprise people around what kind of 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.760
 the device you really are holding 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.739
 cool what asus keeps doing 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.170
 These are the strange experiments so far. 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.549
 it is not clear what audience is designed 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.709
 this device is likely geeks 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.950
 who love all universal kitchen 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.950
 combine harvester 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.890
 the price of the device is still unknown but 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.380
 most likely it will be inexpensive 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.079
 will be on sale somewhere in the fourth 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.680
 quarter of this year but when will it appear 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.769
 in Russia 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.239
 This, too, is still a mystery review 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.450
 prepared the seas all boris veden 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.680
 swastika computer 2014 subscribe 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.680
 there will be many more interesting videos
