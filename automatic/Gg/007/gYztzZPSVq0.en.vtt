00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.490
 present to your attention moonshine 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.530
 Magarych master moonshine master 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.719
 the device is made entirely of food 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.350
 of stainless steel 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:19.740
 all seams at the apparatus are made of argon 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.080
 welding that ensures reliable 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.220
 connection and ensures safe 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.240
 food use 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.740
 moonshine consists of the following 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:37.530
 Often it is directly the tank tank 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.790
 reinforced ribs further this 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.640
 removable thermometer to measure 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.570
 temperature inside the tank is removable 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.350
 jug tank cap and fridge with 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.510
 built-in serpentine now we collect 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.510
 the device and prepare it for use 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:03.870
 for this thermometer tank installed you 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.309
 can you recover by 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.830
 threaded connection 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.830
 who are you fashionable enough 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:18.890
 set the tank cover provided 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.890
 that our bank is already on ice 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:39.520
 set the cover cretin cover 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:45.850
 sukhoparnik further attach the soup guy 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:56.940
 bu refrigerator everything is fixed by rice 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:02:03.400
 we installed a fridge pulled up 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:05.190
 connection in this way our apparatus 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.440
 assembled and ready to go 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:12.550
 as you can be sure of nothing complicated 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.780
 assembly is not all simple enough and 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.780
 clear should not cause any 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.780
 of questions 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:33.090
 all connections we realize tight and 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.090
 allow leaks when brewing 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.720
 I will note that moonshine series 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.519
 master us are represented by several 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.650
 executions 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.989
 both with a thermometer and without a thermometer 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.810
 on in my opinion the performance of 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:53.319
 thermometer is more practical so 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.590
 like maintaining and controlling temperature in 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:00.959
 home brewing process is very important 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:03.900
 component is for beginners it can 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:10.950
 the lack of a thermometer can cause 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:13.500
 serious difficulties unlike 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.910
 standard series 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.660
 This unit is completely 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.030
 collapsible which increases its practicality 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.030
 when using that is you can 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.170
 rinse separately and bork and sucker and 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.389
 the fridge itself all the devices 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.720
 presented on our site are checked 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:37.810
 being tested is subjected to typical 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:43.209
 impact and we can safely guarantee 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:46.209
 that during the moonshine making process 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.690
 heating apparatus does not warp it does not lead 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:56.139
 the seams don't crack all done pretty 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:58.440
 high-quality and reliable disassembly of the apparatus 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:00.370
 performed in the same mediocrity 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.560
 the only thing not to forget is that 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.760
 brewing process 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:11.220
 heats up and all its tube elements 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:14.889
 the tank itself is very hot so neat 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:19.709
 on this review of the devices Magarych master 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.709
 Good luck to you brewing
