00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.820
 Hi girls, how are you 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.250
 I'm going to record a video for you today . 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.140
 how to do a homemade skin cleansing and 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.250
 I have a message for you too. 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.770
 every time you are the 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.779
 dermatologist 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.939
 any doctor will fill these 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.279
 questions of professional series 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.650
 That's the truth, that's how I learned 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.450
 things that teaches you how to nail 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.399
 and I always like that the doctors 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.680
 usually they give medicines and 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:35.440
 buy at the pharmacy and such but so 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.900
 You can ask me, kisses. What? 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.770
 it would be good day and natural means means 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.970
 home to you doing but he returned in 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.370
 my skin 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.050
 the consultation is over but I'm here either 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.610
 sun or just consult 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.850
 so girls you watch the first 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.940
 step in this process now so girls 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.640
 You will get a liquid soap and 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.290
 Let's put in a little enough to 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:12.520
 washing your face is two tablespoons of 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:18.609
 sugar needs to be full and so we 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:21.219
 go get work well go little do not open 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:24.869
 We're just going to get some 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.869
 egg white 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:35.859
 Then I'll learn my fringe here. 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:41.319
 and that mix the first is you will 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:44.100
 get the hair back and will apply 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.100
 in the face're 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.549
 I usually do this in the shower. 

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:53.920
 bathroom nÃ© of the cliff but like a video 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.609
 demonstration I'm going to do it right here 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:02.700
 for you ok 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:02.700
 done it but here on earth too 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.190
 to pass on the whole face and with a mixture 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.420
 It is great if you can 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.360
 sugar 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.670
 it will not hurt the skin because it 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.570
 as people make moves 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:24.410
 circular it will melting with the floor 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.070
 with soap and the clear clear 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.170
 people 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.320
 in fact the egg it should be the best friend 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.240
 because the bark has calcium 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.620
 that helps nails 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.500
 the clear has the collagen and the gem has 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.480
 many vitamins as even finish 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.940
 and that is good for the skin 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.030
 Okay, we 'll deny it. 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:54.640
 circular motion if you have 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:59.300
 cni delivery more at the local is then 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:02.750
 you will here or nose also in 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.110
 nope on the forehead always movements 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:14.420
 It is generally circular for low 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:18.280
 Up never from top to bottom, then 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.280
 done that now you wash your face 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.660
 then the first wash you're going to do 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.390
 if your skin is too oily 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.180
 if leftovers are a little bit of the recipe you 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:33.130
 you can do it again, no problem 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.959
 You know that first gives lap with loss is 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.700
 our sensation on the skin is to have 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.030
 after he passed 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.670
 but it gives a certain twist on account 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.310
 the clear collagen're the second there 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.329
 mix you learn now there you go 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.600
 need 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:04:00.320
 two tablespoons of honey a vitamin being 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:03.730
 and the gem of that or else by 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.440
 What are we going to do in two spoons? 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:11.100
 in vitamin c 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.320
 recent we will try to write her 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.320
 or until less until a little bit 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:30.000
 so that little bit of sudden thinking 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:34.910
 it all afterwards to melt the whole 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.480
 It will stay like this, the agent turns out 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:44.490
 go get the egg yolk goes japura in the 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:55.640
 peel it and go here o spill a little 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:05:00.900
 To take advantage of the fact to throw away 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:02.310
 And then you'll mix like that. 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.560
 mixture 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.510
 so she is not very fragrant I have to 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.540
 tell you about the gem 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:13.950
 but it was very effective as I already told 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:19.919
 you that the function of it besides moisturizing 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:21.570
 is to give the replacement of vitamins to the 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:27.320
 our skin that we are taking a 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:32.610
 astringent're removing the makeup and 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:36.590
 effervescent vitamin c it clears the 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.900
 skin is even good for you that have 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.810
 dust 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:47.330
 so if you have a look here, it's already 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.330
 plus a moisturizing mask are the people 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:58.190
 and let it dry 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:58.190
 I think it's a matter of 5 to 10 minutes 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:05.340
 your face is already dry and here you are 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:09.539
 wash the face can pass the protector 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:12.090
 solar or you can also pass the moisturizer 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.370
 you will wash your face 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.819
 can only be washed with water if you 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.729
 have a moisturizer for a soap 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:23.340
 For the face that does not strike I did not 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:24.919
 message is very soft or soap 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.380
 of baby 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:31.069
 Can you guys pass by, okay? 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.069
