00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.859
 further why the pokémon xy wav aiff 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.710
 begs videos again today with one 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.000
 fight fighting mode and yes that 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.670
 is actually more of a spontaneous 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.470
 videoshow togo today no metal 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.050
 Upload 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.460
 But then majority is a faux pas 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.109
 actually happens in today 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.910
 drive from ex places but me 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.010
 I noticed that I am extra two 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.410
 hdmi cable need and accordingly 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.059
 it was then so that I am now around 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.770
 plan to do it in white today 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.090
 vest video tomorrow maybe even if 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.930
 the cabinet tomorrow still not there 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.520
 is and yes how it goes then look 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.719
 So are we first see 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.059
 continue today, first now 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.469
 spontaneous fight not just out 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.480
 have worn and as you can see it is 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.579
 almost the same team as last time 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.949
 is the same as last time I have 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.820
 only rotor from the team now again 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.980
 naturpark ever taken the 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.039
 mole and my surprise I have 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.239
 realize that I have one first 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.559
 I made small mistakes 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.630
 actually the mangrove first 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.880
 have and then comes a second one though 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.310
 Anyway, I do not want to 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.340
 a lot of betrayed start and even without 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.090
 First of all, the mighty power is 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.560
 dekkers peas or of the brain 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.650
 German I do not know anything on such 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.350
 also have the mighty hasen power 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.240
 see in this video 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.710
 I wanted to say that because I was 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.869
 but nobody promised 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.619
 and how to get started with campaigns 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.540
 klöckner recognizes the red card on the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:42.220
 probably that's why I first thought red 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.500
 card i can with my yes with mine 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.000
 equal bockhorn anyway not so much 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.649
 make therefore with immediate 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.939
 States stages activate the red card 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.920
 and change depending on us again 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.560
 his poor on the not immediately sugar 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.810
 or red, if the choice ultimately comes up 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.310
 red deposited are last on 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.920
 then travel with the same train 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.229
 thanks donna donna paralyzed god 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.740
 not and I'm able to pump 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:16.930
 steppi group 180 then only in the future 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:18.430
 160 previous year 165 165 ago because poverty 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.720
 So far have been downgraded in 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:26.440
 for example , he is the same 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.769
 the one of the eurogroup firestorm 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.690
 Thunder and something so proud and so on 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.190
 a bit annoyed to hurt a few 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.400
 I was able to do so much but that's enough 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.170
 only some coffee with the opponent 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.840
 make out 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.129
 but be that as it may 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.349
 we always had to burn small at first 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.360
 the gas already to my opponent as 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.459
 difficult dance that's why it's hard 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.620
 book is actually being equalized 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.129
 and I miss a misfortune now 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.510
 The hill pump and I thought maybe 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.819
 Do you want to save the photo but 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.560
 Looking at his team or me 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.590
 back to his team neppl preview 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.319
 reminded me that I'm brave 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.319
 be brave because yes 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.970
 hp does not spend all that much 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.280
 team had everything he had in it 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.079
 the preview would have my rotor with 34 ps 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.459
 Anyway , red can destroy it sooner 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.120
 defensively aligned means I would have 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.489
 anyway China does not have one 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.220
 very strong offensive opportunity 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.810
 change back to the park in munich is in 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.010
 the situation first funny to recognize 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.049
 which is pretty good now 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.069
 impossible is because you get it from the café 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:40.890
 lost and yes I thought so 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.170
 that if he last 1 in his left 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.989
 changed were globex or in its 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.819
 I 'm still doing it and he 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.130
 then actually changes in his cuba 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.040
 and changes in the following 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.440
 was buying directly into his mega bonus 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.620
 more the optics that was a very 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.200
 favorable situation because this mega only 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.060
 appropriately used while in the 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.150
 location we would indeed my entire team 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.370
 to smile, yes, and the only one 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.380
 possibility like this mega truck 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.000
 nor can save something that is 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.630
 I now as much as possible with full shot 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.040
 possible out on the practice then but in 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.370
 flame 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.380
 fight only times I could have messy 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.170
 but is possibly or survived 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.960
 jan grapple but what i expect there 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.760
 so yes megawatt is already too hospitable to 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.560
 I'm standing with the dog chair or 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.930
 less able my area rhine 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.860
 and main area has the ability to work 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:41.520
 colossus and wearing that shines since then 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.020
 So choice band and synonymous first step 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.990
 profi needs and i would not have 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.380
 thought that I am two megawatts like that 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.030
 that the physical stake again 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.410
 very good book gets and it was then 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.550
 Actually, so you can 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:59.760
 I would never have been too bloody for sonja 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.710
 possible that I held so much the 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.380
 me on this more I am with the 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.520
 but you can still expand your reputation 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.770
 you definitely see this 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.810
 pokémon brad pitt should not be underestimated 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.990
 Credit is a very strong book by 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.140
 meant the dictator's frustration is 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.580
 a strangest worst look what 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.020
 the pokémon has seen with you in with 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.080
 the values ​​she actually has it 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:26.270
 is not useful why full 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:29.340
 Attack so a great turn around 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.730
 What's the name in German ? 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.280
 in German 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:36.600
 picture picture image loading aisle no eight 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.760
 Anyway, one thing I can see is what I see 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.710
 you can only recommend but it should 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.270
 just have power course because without power 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.320
 Colossus is the thing in my opinion 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.000
 useless 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.330
 therefore my friends many 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.110
 temptations skin type optics and means 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.110
 be credit with you
