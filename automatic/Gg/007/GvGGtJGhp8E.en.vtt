finishing<00:01:02.760> before<00:01:03.710> but<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:04.860> think

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
finishing before but I just think

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.580 
finishing before but I just think
Chelsea<00:01:05.640> too<00:01:05.820> strong<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.180> everybody<00:01:06.590> it

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
Chelsea too strong for everybody it

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.719 
Chelsea too strong for everybody it
appears<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> little<00:01:08.280> bit<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
appears to be a little bit of a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.969 
appears to be a little bit of a
disharmony<00:01:09.630> within<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> Camden<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.680> in

now<00:03:15.180> he'd<00:03:16.080> be<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.320> first<00:03:16.350> person<00:03:16.770> he<00:03:16.860> goes<00:03:16.890> to

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
now he'd be the first person he goes to

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.350
