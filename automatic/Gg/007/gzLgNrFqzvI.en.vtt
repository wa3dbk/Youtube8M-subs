00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.090 
platform out there and the matter what
order<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.900> stack<00:01:52.110> them<00:01:52.260> in<00:01:52.410> or<00:01:52.560> they'll<00:01:52.800> order

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
order you stack them in or they'll order

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.590 
order you stack them in or they'll order
order<00:01:53.520> agnostic<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.120> that's<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.480> big

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
order agnostic so that's one of the big

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.760 
order agnostic so that's one of the big
things<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.870> wanted<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.200> make<00:01:55.320> sure<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.680> this

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
things we wanted to make sure that this

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.950 
things we wanted to make sure that this
was<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.640> easy<00:01:56.910> and<00:01:57.270> intuitive<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:57.840> our

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
was this is easy and intuitive for our

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.900 
was this is easy and intuitive for our
customers<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:58.950> doesn't<00:01:59.250> matter<00:01:59.369> which<00:01:59.580> way

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
customers so it doesn't matter which way

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.570 
customers so it doesn't matter which way
you<00:01:59.940> stack<00:02:00.270> them<00:02:00.420> they'll<00:02:00.900> all<00:02:01.080> work<00:02:01.260> and<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
you stack them they'll all work and the

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.210 
you stack them they'll all work and the
power<00:02:02.760> bank<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.920> can<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:04.950> fire<00:02:05.160> your

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
power bank is it can you fire your

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.070 
power bank is it can you fire your
laptop<00:02:05.610> off<00:02:05.790> food<00:02:05.970> or<00:02:06.300> differently<00:02:06.660> covering

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
laptop off food or differently covering

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.690 
laptop off food or differently covering
so<00:02:07.320> similar<00:02:07.650> device<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.160> not<00:02:08.310> mobile

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
so similar device it's not mobile

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.910 
so similar device it's not mobile
devices<00:02:09.060> traditional<00:02:09.660> tablets<00:02:10.080> tablets

phones<00:02:11.630> cameras<00:02:12.630> smaller<00:02:13.230> devices<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:14.220> it

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
phones cameras smaller devices so it

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.440 
phones cameras smaller devices so it
does<00:02:14.430> give<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.670> bit<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:14.880> extra<00:02:15.090> power<00:02:15.209> on

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
does give you a bit of extra power on

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.300 
does give you a bit of extra power on
the<00:02:15.600> go<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.110> don't<00:02:16.350> want<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.830> have<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.040> use

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the go if you don't want to have to use

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.590 
the go if you don't want to have to use
up<00:02:17.430> your<00:02:17.459> laptop's<00:02:17.910> battery<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.300> charge<00:02:18.330> your

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
up your laptop's battery to charge your

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.680 
up your laptop's battery to charge your

so<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.750> can<00:02:21.900> use<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.050> bluetooth<00:02:22.200> speaker

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
so you can use the bluetooth speaker

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.310 
so you can use the bluetooth speaker
whether<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:22.950> plugged<00:02:23.100> in<00:02:23.280> or<00:02:23.400> not<00:02:24.320> so

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
whether it's plugged in or not so

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.750 
whether it's plugged in or not so
certainly<00:02:25.830> like<00:02:26.070> Bluetooth<00:02:26.340> speakers<00:02:26.610> aren't
