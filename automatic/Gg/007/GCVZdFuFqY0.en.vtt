step 1 add cream actually there really

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.340 
step 1 add cream actually there really
only<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.219> step<00:00:32.640> 1<00:00:32.910> basically<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.050> going

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
only is step 1 basically this is going

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.810 
only is step 1 basically this is going
to<00:00:34.410> go<00:00:34.590> through<00:00:36.260> three<00:00:37.260> different<00:00:37.380> steps<00:00:37.820> this

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
to go through three different steps this

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.880 
to go through three different steps this
is<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.210> heavy<00:00:39.420> cream<00:00:39.750> we're<00:00:40.440> gonna<00:00:40.620> whip<00:00:40.860> it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
is the heavy cream we're gonna whip it

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.549 
is the heavy cream we're gonna whip it
for<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> while<00:00:41.460> probably<00:00:41.820> 5<00:00:42.510> or<00:00:42.540> 7<00:00:42.870> 10<00:00:43.230> minutes

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
for a while probably 5 or 7 10 minutes

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.200 
for a while probably 5 or 7 10 minutes
maybe<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.070> then<00:00:44.550> we're<00:00:44.700> gonna<00:00:44.789> end<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:45.149> with

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
maybe and then we're gonna end up with

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.750 
maybe and then we're gonna end up with
our<00:00:45.420> whipping<00:00:45.960> cream<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.129> add<00:00:47.280> sugar<00:00:47.309> to

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
our whipping cream if you add sugar to

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.850 
our whipping cream if you add sugar to
that<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.210> it'd<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.629> cool<00:00:48.899> whip<00:00:49.110> we're

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
that then it'd be like cool whip we're

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.350 
that then it'd be like cool whip we're
gonna<00:00:49.950> take<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.309> beyond<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.059> where<00:00:51.210> we

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
gonna take it beyond that to where we

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.850 
gonna take it beyond that to where we
break<00:00:51.600> all<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> buttermilk<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.680> and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
break all the buttermilk out of it and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.889 
break all the buttermilk out of it and
end<00:00:53.039> up<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.610> butter<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.270> we're

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
end up with just the butter so we're

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.779 
end up with just the butter so we're
gonna<00:00:55.020> start<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.559> guy<00:00:55.920> off<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.399> where<00:00:56.579> it's

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
gonna start this guy off to where it's

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:05.130 
gonna start this guy off to where it's
just<00:00:57.030> barely<00:00:57.390> splashing

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:21.070 

I<00:01:05.229> think<00:01:05.680> that's<00:01:05.860> more<00:01:06.220> than

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.050 

we've<00:01:21.320> been<00:01:21.530> going<00:01:21.710> for<00:01:22.130> less<00:01:23.060> than<00:01:23.360> you<00:01:23.570> know

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
we've been going for less than you know

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.420 

very

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.399 

to<00:01:37.430> work

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
to work

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:59.760 
to work
break<00:01:38.979> it<00:01:39.130> up<00:01:39.219> all<00:01:39.429> the<00:01:39.460> way

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
maybe five minutes looks like it's

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.140 
maybe five minutes looks like it's
starting<00:02:27.409> to<00:02:27.530> separate<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.010> little<00:02:28.220> bit<00:02:28.340> at

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
starting to separate a little bit at

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.030 
starting to separate a little bit at
this<00:02:29.390> point<00:02:29.890> I'm<00:02:30.890> gonna<00:02:32.019> shake<00:02:33.019> it<00:02:33.049> kind<00:02:34.010> of

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
this point I'm gonna shake it kind of

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.699 
this point I'm gonna shake it kind of
like<00:02:34.189> the<00:02:34.340> old<00:02:34.430> Turner's<00:02:34.879> used<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.180> use

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.679 

amazing<00:02:40.390> really<00:02:41.390> how<00:02:41.569> cream<00:02:42.939> so<00:02:43.939> see<00:02:44.390> if<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.569> can

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
amazing really how cream so see if I can

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:55.770 
amazing really how cream so see if I can
get<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:44.959> in<00:02:45.140> this<00:02:45.230> bowl<00:02:45.500> here<00:02:45.769> in<00:02:46.370> this<00:02:46.670> jar

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.750 

you<00:02:56.780> still<00:02:57.079> have<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.440> get<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.769> buttermilk<00:02:58.370> out

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
you still have to get the buttermilk out

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:07.089 
you still have to get the buttermilk out
of<00:02:58.909> it<00:02:59.060> so<00:03:03.459> what<00:03:04.459> that<00:03:04.579> technique<00:03:05.980> lift<00:03:06.980> you

back you put it in the jar I'm gonna add

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.449 
back you put it in the jar I'm gonna add
a<00:03:18.439> little<00:03:18.829> bit<00:03:18.980> of<00:03:19.010> this<00:03:19.189> iced<00:03:19.370> water<00:03:19.609> here

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
a little bit of this iced water here

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.770 
a little bit of this iced water here
just<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.549> little<00:03:22.670> bit<00:03:22.819> of<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.150> into<00:03:23.329> there

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
just a little bit of it into there

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.420 
just a little bit of it into there
that's<00:03:24.139> gonna<00:03:24.290> help<00:03:24.530> cool<00:03:24.889> it<00:03:24.919> down<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.250> little

stuffs the butter the other stuff is the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.850 
stuffs the butter the other stuff is the
buttermilk<00:04:18.300> which<00:04:19.200> I<00:04:19.350> will<00:04:19.500> use<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.830> make

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
buttermilk which I will use to make

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.430 
buttermilk which I will use to make
bread<00:04:20.100> so<00:04:20.700> I<00:04:20.970> give<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:21.959> few<00:04:22.110> more<00:04:22.290> minutes

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
bread so I give that a few more minutes

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:39.740 
bread so I give that a few more minutes
to<00:04:22.650> shake<00:04:29.600> all<00:04:30.600> right<00:04:31.260> I<00:04:32.480> think<00:04:38.600> there's<00:04:39.600> the
