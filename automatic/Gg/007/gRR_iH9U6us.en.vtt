most your time driving around town they

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.299 
most your time driving around town they
do<00:00:42.690> get<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.200> speed<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.770> motorway<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
do get up to speed on the motorway and

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.590 
do get up to speed on the motorway and
are<00:00:44.370> quite<00:00:44.460> happy<00:00:44.760> once<00:00:44.940> they've<00:00:45.120> got<00:00:45.360> there

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
are quite happy once they've got there

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.900 
are quite happy once they've got there
but<00:00:45.960> getting<00:00:46.379> there<00:00:46.620> does<00:00:46.860> take<00:00:47.160> quite<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> bit

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
but getting there does take quite a bit

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.600 
but getting there does take quite a bit
of<00:00:48.030> time<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.420> effort<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.160> if<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.250> want<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.489> go

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
of time and effort so if you want to go

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.220 
of time and effort so if you want to go
at<00:00:50.850> higher<00:00:51.120> speeds<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.510> little<00:00:51.809> bit<00:00:51.899> more<00:00:52.050> often

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
at higher speeds a little bit more often

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.930 
at higher speeds a little bit more often
then<00:00:52.920> you're<00:00:53.129> better<00:00:53.190> off<00:00:53.340> with<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.670> engine

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
then you're better off with the engine

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.299 
then you're better off with the engine

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
this car and I've lowered the suspension

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.260 
this car and I've lowered the suspension
by<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.590> few<00:01:28.890> millimeters<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.700> that's

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
by a few millimeters in it that's

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.700 
by a few millimeters in it that's
actually<00:01:30.659> helped<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.079> bit<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.409> made<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
actually helped a bit it's made it a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.289 
actually helped a bit it's made it a
little<00:01:31.860> bit<00:01:32.040> more<00:01:32.189> composed<00:01:32.759> going<00:01:33.119> around

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
little bit more composed going around

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.960 
little bit more composed going around
corners<00:01:34.100> unfortunately<00:01:35.100> when<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.759> lower

on<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.060> ride<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.079> what's<00:01:40.350> happened

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
on the ride and that is what's happened

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.140 
on the ride and that is what's happened
here<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.400> little<00:01:41.670> bit<00:01:41.939> more

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
here it's just that little bit more

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.600 
here it's just that little bit more
jittery<00:01:42.420> than<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.930> was<00:01:43.079> before<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:44.189> any<00:01:44.369> case

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
jittery than it was before in any case

jittery than it was before in any case
the<00:01:44.759> steering<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.299> still<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> little<00:01:46.170> bit<00:01:46.409> vague

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the steering is still a little bit vague

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.639 
the steering is still a little bit vague
to<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.700> honest<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> bit<00:01:48.240> numb<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.470> never

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
to be honest a bit numb so it's never
