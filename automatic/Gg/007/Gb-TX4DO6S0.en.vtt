brother's<00:01:01.870> wife<00:01:02.020> did<00:01:02.260> this<00:01:02.320> film<00:01:02.620> after

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
brother's wife did this film after

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.619 
brother's wife did this film after
downloading<00:01:03.340> a<00:01:03.430> multiplayer<00:01:04.180> beta<00:01:04.390> of

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
downloading a multiplayer beta of

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.960 
downloading a multiplayer beta of
battlefield<00:01:04.780> 3<00:01:05.520> we<00:01:06.520> were<00:01:06.640> playing<00:01:06.820> around

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
battlefield 3 we were playing around

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.630 
battlefield 3 we were playing around
with<00:01:07.240> some<00:01:07.299> of<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:07.570> c-4<00:01:07.960> explosions<00:01:08.500> and<00:01:08.680> they

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
with some of the c-4 explosions and they

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.609 
with some of the c-4 explosions and they
were<00:01:09.700> pretty<00:01:09.909> big<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.420> we're<00:01:11.110> kind<00:01:11.350> of<00:01:11.380> cool

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
were pretty big and we're kind of cool

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.740 
were pretty big and we're kind of cool
so<00:01:12.070> we'd<00:01:12.189> start<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:12.580> base<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:13.090> film<00:01:13.390> around<00:01:13.600> them

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
so we'd start to base a film around them

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.420 
so we'd start to base a film around them
we<00:01:14.110> recorded<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.650> Sam<00:01:14.830> straight<00:01:15.130> from<00:01:15.250> better

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
we recorded the Sam straight from better

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.429 
we recorded the Sam straight from better
food<00:01:15.640> three<00:01:15.909> onto<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.600> computer<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:17.020> then<00:01:17.320> we

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
food three onto the computer and then we

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.710 
food three onto the computer and then we
just<00:01:17.560> cut<00:01:17.770> it<00:01:17.860> all<00:01:17.979> in<00:01:18.189> Sony<00:01:18.520> Vegas<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:19.060> put<00:01:19.630> it

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
just cut it all in Sony Vegas and put it

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.600 
just cut it all in Sony Vegas and put it
into<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.990> main<00:01:20.189> maintenance<00:01:21.189> early<00:01:21.310> ladies

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
into the main maintenance early ladies

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.880 
into the main maintenance early ladies
five<00:01:21.820> so<00:01:22.420> for<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.689> c-4<00:01:23.020> explosions<00:01:23.500> we<00:01:23.650> needed

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
five so for the c-4 explosions we needed

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.380 
five so for the c-4 explosions we needed
to<00:01:23.979> do<00:01:24.100> a<00:01:24.130> few<00:01:24.520> things<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.790> make<00:01:24.970> it<00:01:25.030> look<00:01:25.210> good

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
to do a few things to make it look good

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.260 
to do a few things to make it look good
the<00:01:26.049> first<00:01:26.619> thing<00:01:26.799> we<00:01:26.920> did<00:01:27.070> was<00:01:27.280> duplicate

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
the first thing we did was duplicate

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.810 
the first thing we did was duplicate
this<00:01:28.570> c4<00:01:28.960> here<00:01:29.409> because<00:01:30.040> we<00:01:30.280> actually<00:01:30.400> placed

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
this c4 here because we actually placed

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.910 
this c4 here because we actually placed
for<00:01:31.119> down<00:01:31.299> so<00:01:31.780> we<00:01:32.020> needed<00:01:32.259> to<00:01:32.320> add<00:01:32.530> in<00:01:32.680> three

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
for down so we needed to add in three

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.219 
for down so we needed to add in three
more<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.640> second<00:01:34.150> thing<00:01:34.240> we<00:01:34.390> did<00:01:34.570> was<00:01:34.780> for<00:01:35.140> the

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
more the second thing we did was for the

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.539 
more the second thing we did was for the
actual<00:01:35.439> explosion<00:01:35.829> we<00:01:36.040> added<00:01:36.280> in<00:01:36.369> these

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
actual explosion we added in these

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.700 
actual explosion we added in these
flares<00:01:37.000> here<00:01:37.270> that<00:01:37.479> fill<00:01:37.689> the<00:01:37.840> screen<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.530> give

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
flares here that fill the screen to give

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.210 
flares here that fill the screen to give
it<00:01:38.799> more<00:01:39.009> of<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.340> big<00:01:40.030> effect<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:42.009> comes

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
it more of a big effect and it comes

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.039 
it more of a big effect and it comes
back<00:01:42.310> down<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.820> then<00:01:42.880> we<00:01:43.000> get<00:01:43.149> the<00:01:43.329> explosion

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
back down and then we get the explosion

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.810 
back down and then we get the explosion
and<00:01:44.200> this<00:01:44.799> is<00:01:45.009> optical<00:01:45.460> flares<00:01:45.610> from

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
and this is optical flares from

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.870 
and this is optical flares from
videocopilot<00:01:46.360> net<00:01:47.290> and<00:01:47.530> it's<00:01:47.860> a<00:01:48.040> great<00:01:48.579> plugin

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
videocopilot net and it's a great plugin

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.389 
videocopilot net and it's a great plugin
for<00:01:49.149> after<00:01:49.540> effects<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:50.259> last<00:01:50.920> thing<00:01:51.100> we<00:01:51.250> did

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
for after effects the last thing we did

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.100 
for after effects the last thing we did
was<00:01:51.670> after<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.210> explosion<00:01:52.659> we<00:01:52.780> had<00:01:52.930> this<00:01:53.049> big

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
was after the explosion we had this big

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.389 
was after the explosion we had this big
camera<00:01:54.040> shake<00:01:54.250> here<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.729> we<00:01:55.360> added<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:56.710> motion

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
camera shake here and we added a motion

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.429 
camera shake here and we added a motion
blur<00:01:57.610> on<00:01:57.790> here<00:01:58.360> so<00:01:58.600> as<00:01:58.719> you<00:01:58.810> can<00:01:58.899> tell<00:01:58.960> it<00:01:59.290> looks

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
blur on here so as you can tell it looks

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.010 
blur on here so as you can tell it looks
