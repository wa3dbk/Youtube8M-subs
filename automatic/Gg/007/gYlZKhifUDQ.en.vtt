00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
then we'll take the temperature

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.720 
then we'll take the temperature
okay<00:01:46.510> so<00:01:46.570> we've<00:01:47.560> cooked<00:01:47.860> it<00:01:48.100> for<00:01:48.130> four<00:01:48.520> minutes

and I've got a tip sensitive digital
thermometer<00:01:57.610> in<00:01:57.790> here<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:59.380> all<00:01:59.590> over

the place now the instructions say it
has<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.320> get<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.940> 165<00:02:04.380> for<00:02:05.380> safety<00:02:05.740> that'll

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
has to get to 165 for safety that'll

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.830 
has to get to 165 for safety that'll
kill<00:02:06.160> off<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.460> Salmonella<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.300> to<00:02:07.390> take<00:02:07.600> the

kill off the Salmonella and to take the

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.040 
kill off the Salmonella and to take the
temperature<00:02:08.050> in<00:02:08.410> several<00:02:08.770> different<00:02:08.920> spots

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
temperature in several different spots

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.360 
temperature in several different spots
after<00:02:11.050> this<00:02:11.230> amount<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.680> cooking<00:02:12.070> this<00:02:12.310> thing

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
after this amount of cooking this thing

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.400 
after this amount of cooking this thing
is<00:02:12.730> only<00:02:12.910> at<00:02:13.350> 60<00:02:14.350> Fahrenheit<00:02:15.870> 80<00:02:16.870> in<00:02:17.140> some

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
is only at 60 Fahrenheit 80 in some

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.840 
is only at 60 Fahrenheit 80 in some
places<00:02:17.710> 60<00:02:18.340> certainly<00:02:19.120> nowhere<00:02:19.480> near<00:02:20.490> 165<00:02:21.490> and

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
places 60 certainly nowhere near 165 and

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.510 
places 60 certainly nowhere near 165 and
yeah<00:02:22.630> maybe<00:02:22.930> this<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.380> crappy<00:02:23.920> microwave

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
yeah maybe this is a crappy microwave

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.660 
yeah maybe this is a crappy microwave
but<00:02:25.240> I<00:02:25.540> don't<00:02:26.230> know<00:02:26.380> what<00:02:26.710> Americans<00:02:27.280> have<00:02:27.490> in

but I don't know what Americans have in
their<00:02:27.850> homes<00:02:28.030> maybe<00:02:28.420> they<00:02:28.660> all<00:02:28.840> have<00:02:29.050> crappy

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
their homes maybe they all have crappy

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.470 
their homes maybe they all have crappy
microwaves<00:02:30.040> we<00:02:30.220> don't<00:02:30.400> all<00:02:30.580> have<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.910> best<00:02:31.150> so

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
microwaves we don't all have the best so

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.210 
microwaves we don't all have the best so
this<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.660> worrisome<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.590> know<00:02:35.680> here<00:02:36.070> we<00:02:36.190> are

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
this is worrisome you know here we are

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.880 
this is worrisome you know here we are
it's<00:02:36.580> at<00:02:36.700> 120<00:02:37.360> in<00:02:37.450> this<00:02:37.630> place<00:02:37.930> now<00:02:38.880> 130<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:41.590> in

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
it's at 120 in this place now 130 but in

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.290 
it's at 120 in this place now 130 but in
other<00:02:42.100> places<00:02:42.370> it's<00:02:43.030> not<00:02:43.330> even<00:02:43.660> close<00:02:45.300> yeah

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
other places it's not even close yeah

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.970 
other places it's not even close yeah
it's<00:02:46.510> going<00:02:46.720> down<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.820> 197<00:02:48.820> so<00:02:49.650> before<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.680> would

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
it's going down to 197 so before I would

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.590 
it's going down to 197 so before I would
eat<00:02:51.130> this<00:02:51.340> I'm<00:02:51.550> certainly<00:02:51.970> gonna<00:02:52.150> microwave

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
eat this I'm certainly gonna microwave

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.949 
eat this I'm certainly gonna microwave
it<00:02:52.900> for<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.140> few<00:02:53.380> more<00:02:53.530> minutes<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:54.720> I'm<00:02:55.720> gonna

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
it for a few more minutes and I'm gonna

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.890 
it for a few more minutes and I'm gonna
use<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.260> meat<00:02:56.530> thermometer<00:02:57.180> every<00:02:58.180> time<00:02:58.510> if<00:02:58.750> I

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
use a meat thermometer every time if I

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.610 
use a meat thermometer every time if I
ate<00:02:59.410> these<00:02:59.680> things<00:03:00.040> which<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.580> don't<00:03:00.970> but<00:03:01.720> the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
ate these things which I don't but the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.350 
ate these things which I don't but the
people<00:03:02.950> out<00:03:03.100> there<00:03:03.370> I'm<00:03:03.670> not<00:03:03.730> sure<00:03:03.910> how<00:03:04.300> you

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
people out there I'm not sure how you

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.660 
people out there I'm not sure how you
can<00:03:04.660> be<00:03:04.780> sure<00:03:05.020> other<00:03:05.950> than<00:03:06.280> using<00:03:06.610> a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
can be sure other than using a

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.600 
can be sure other than using a
thermometer<00:03:07.620> I'd<00:03:08.620> like<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:09.040> know<00:03:09.220> if<00:03:09.459> the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
thermometer I'd like to know if the

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.750 
thermometer I'd like to know if the
company<00:03:10.120> did<00:03:10.540> consumer<00:03:11.410> research<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.190> tested

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
company did consumer research and tested

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.610 
company did consumer research and tested
this<00:03:12.910> on<00:03:13.120> people<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.630> stuff<00:03:13.840> what<00:03:14.260> do<00:03:14.410> people

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
this on people and stuff what do people

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.050 
this on people and stuff what do people
do<00:03:14.890> are<00:03:15.040> they<00:03:15.160> actually<00:03:15.610> using<00:03:15.640> the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
do are they actually using the

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.180 
do are they actually using the
thermometer<00:03:16.410> because<00:03:17.410> this<00:03:17.590> certainly<00:03:17.980> is

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
thermometer because this certainly is

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.440 
thermometer because this certainly is
not<00:03:18.400> warm<00:03:20.220> okay<00:03:21.220> so<00:03:21.280> we<00:03:21.640> cooked<00:03:21.910> it<00:03:22.090> for<00:03:22.120> an

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
not warm okay so we cooked it for an

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.060 
not warm okay so we cooked it for an
additional<00:03:22.989> two<00:03:23.230> minutes<00:03:23.440> in<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:23.920> microwave

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
additional two minutes in the microwave

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.699 
additional two minutes in the microwave
so<00:03:24.550> that's<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.760> total<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.180> six<00:03:25.930> minutes<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:26.590> an

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
so that's a total of six minutes and an

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.140 
so that's a total of six minutes and an
eleven<00:03:27.100> hundred<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.459> fifty<00:03:27.760> watt<00:03:27.940> microwave

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
eleven hundred and fifty watt microwave

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.520 
eleven hundred and fifty watt microwave
plus<00:03:29.080> three<00:03:29.500> minutes<00:03:29.800> of<00:03:29.980> rest<00:03:31.230> for<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.290> most

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
plus three minutes of rest for the most

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.840 
plus three minutes of rest for the most
part<00:03:32.890> it's<00:03:33.220> well<00:03:33.760> above<00:03:33.910> 160

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
part it's well above 160

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.120 
part it's well above 160
five<00:03:35.060> but<00:03:35.540> there<00:03:35.720> are<00:03:35.840> still<00:03:36.140> regions<00:03:36.890> in

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
five but there are still regions in

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.510 
five but there are still regions in
certain<00:03:37.610> pockets<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.290> pop<00:03:39.500> high<00:03:39.800> that<00:03:40.400> are

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
certain pockets of the pop high that are

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.810 
certain pockets of the pop high that are
below<00:03:40.790> 165<00:03:41.660> now<00:03:41.960> I'm<00:03:42.500> confident<00:03:43.070> that<00:03:43.190> give<00:03:43.700> it

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
below 165 now I'm confident that give it

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.070 
below 165 now I'm confident that give it
a<00:03:43.880> couple<00:03:44.060> minutes<00:03:44.300> and<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.630> whole<00:03:44.780> signal

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
a couple minutes and the whole signal

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.710 
a couple minutes and the whole signal
heat<00:03:45.350> up<00:03:45.530> but<00:03:46.400> this<00:03:47.330> is<00:03:47.390> not<00:03:47.750> an<00:03:47.930> exact<00:03:48.320> science

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
heat up but this is not an exact science

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.350 
heat up but this is not an exact science
there<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:50.750> variability<00:03:51.350> and<00:03:51.950> for<00:03:52.880> something

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
there is variability and for something

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.330 
there is variability and for something
that's<00:03:53.540> supposed<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:54.020> be<00:03:54.110> microwavable<00:03:55.100> and

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
that's supposed to be microwavable and

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.510 
that's supposed to be microwavable and
convenient<00:03:56.330> I<00:03:56.540> would<00:03:57.470> say<00:03:57.710> that<00:03:58.040> all<00:03:58.250> of<00:03:58.280> the

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
convenient I would say that all of the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.400 
convenient I would say that all of the
ingredients<00:03:59.240> better<00:03:59.510> be<00:03:59.750> cooked<00:04:00.080> because

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
ingredients better be cooked because

ingredients better be cooked because

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
one of these in the microwave they're

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.880 
one of these in the microwave they're
gonna<00:04:14.600> sit<00:04:14.870> there<00:04:15.050> with<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.320> meat<00:04:15.680> thermometer

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
gonna sit there with a meat thermometer

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.220 
gonna sit there with a meat thermometer
and<00:04:16.370> take<00:04:16.580> the<00:04:16.730> temperature<00:04:16.910> 10<00:04:17.360> times<00:04:17.630> it's

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
and take the temperature 10 times it's

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.870 
and take the temperature 10 times it's
not<00:04:18.380> gonna<00:04:18.620> happen<00:04:18.860> they<00:04:19.130> have<00:04:19.280> to<00:04:19.460> be<00:04:19.550> using

not gonna happen they have to be using

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.270 
not gonna happen they have to be using
fully<00:04:20.120> cooked<00:04:20.450> ingredients<00:04:21.190> for<00:04:22.190> the
