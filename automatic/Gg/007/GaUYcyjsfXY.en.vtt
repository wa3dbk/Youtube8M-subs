career mode last night and I got a few
matches<00:03:53.090> done<00:03:53.510> but<00:03:54.440> I<00:03:54.769> think<00:03:55.519> you<00:03:55.700> can<00:03:55.880> you

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
matches done but I think you can you

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.430

don't<00:03:56.239> even<00:03:56.360> have<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.630> leave<00:03:56.870> your<00:03:56.930> club

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440

position to play to manage

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.920 
position to play to manage
internationally<00:04:00.769> I<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:02.030> think<00:04:02.660> though

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
internationally I I think though

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.990 
internationally I I think though
possibly<00:04:03.380> and<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:05.510> might<00:04:05.780> have<00:04:06.049> to<00:04:07.000> manage

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
possibly and you might have to manage

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.990 
possibly and you might have to manage
your<00:04:08.180> home<00:04:08.900> nation<00:04:09.790> i'm<00:04:10.790> not<00:04:11.060> sure<00:04:11.650> but<00:04:12.730> i<00:04:13.730> have

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
your home nation i'm not sure but i have

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.789 
your home nation i'm not sure but i have
seen<00:04:14.299> that<00:04:14.450> mentioned<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:14.930> few<00:04:15.049> times<00:04:15.110> you<00:04:15.590> have

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
seen that mentioned a few times you have

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.300 
seen that mentioned a few times you have
to<00:04:15.829> have<00:04:16.070> manager<00:04:16.549> on<00:04:16.669> your

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
to have manager on your

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.060 
to have manager on your
nation<00:04:17.790> so<00:04:17.970> if<00:04:18.209> if<00:04:18.480> you<00:04:18.630> do<00:04:18.870> i'd<00:04:19.590> recommend

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
nation so if if you do i'd recommend

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.530 
nation so if if you do i'd recommend
putting<00:04:20.280> your<00:04:20.489> nationality<00:04:20.910> as<00:04:21.209> your<00:04:21.359> manager

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
putting your nationality as your manager

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.010 
putting your nationality as your manager
to<00:04:22.109> whatever<00:04:23.040> country<00:04:23.639> hope<00:04:24.030> to<00:04:24.180> manage<00:04:24.450> but

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
to whatever country hope to manage but

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.240 
to whatever country hope to manage but
as<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.200> can<00:04:25.290> see<00:04:25.410> there<00:04:25.590> it's<00:04:25.710> locked<00:04:26.010> at<00:04:26.160> the

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
as you can see there it's locked at the

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.560 
as you can see there it's locked at the
moment<00:04:26.520> because<00:04:26.580> i<00:04:26.760> think<00:04:26.970> there<00:04:27.150> isn't<00:04:27.300> a

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
moment because i think there isn't a

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.800 
moment because i think there isn't a
you're<00:04:27.870> a<00:04:28.040> global<00:04:29.040> tournament<00:04:29.669> on<00:04:29.850> we<00:04:30.540> can<00:04:30.690> see

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
you're a global tournament on we can see

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.870 
you're a global tournament on we can see
their<00:04:30.960> international<00:04:31.560> management<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:32.190> you

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
their international management and you

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.720 
their international management and you
can<00:04:33.030> eventually<00:04:33.240> unlock<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:34.130> so<00:04:35.130> i<00:04:35.490> think

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
can eventually unlock that so i think

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.159 
can eventually unlock that so i think
another<00:04:36.240> improvement<00:04:36.570> is<00:04:36.810> you<00:04:36.930> have<00:04:37.020> your

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
another improvement is you have your

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.350 
another improvement is you have your
youth<00:04:37.440> academy<00:04:37.980> and<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:38.880> can<00:04:39.030> have<00:04:39.120> scouting

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
youth academy and you can have scouting

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.300 
youth academy and you can have scouting
network<00:04:39.840> which<00:04:40.050> is<00:04:40.169> their<00:04:40.320> last<00:04:40.530> year<00:04:40.800> we<00:04:41.220> have

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
network which is their last year we have

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.860 
network which is their last year we have
a<00:04:41.370> youth<00:04:41.580> squad<00:04:41.880> there's<00:04:42.150> nobody<00:04:42.480> in<00:04:42.690> the

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
a youth squad there's nobody in the

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.330 
a youth squad there's nobody in the
youth<00:04:43.020> squad<00:04:43.290> but<00:04:43.500> i<00:04:43.560> think<00:04:43.800> if<00:04:43.980> you<00:04:44.010> go<00:04:44.220> out

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
youth squad but i think if you go out

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.310 
youth squad but i think if you go out
and<00:04:44.520> scout<00:04:44.730> people<00:04:45.180> you<00:04:45.660> can<00:04:45.780> put<00:04:46.020> them<00:04:46.200> in

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
and scout people you can put them in

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.510 
and scout people you can put them in
your<00:04:46.350> youth<00:04:46.620> squad<00:04:46.919> and<00:04:47.100> they'll<00:04:47.250> develop

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
your youth squad and they'll develop

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.000 
your youth squad and they'll develop
their<00:04:47.910> which<00:04:48.330> is<00:04:48.570> I've<00:04:49.350> been<00:04:49.560> hoping<00:04:49.740> that

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
their which is I've been hoping that

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.409 
their which is I've been hoping that
they've<00:04:50.130> actually<00:04:50.310> put<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:50.910> reserves<00:04:51.240> from

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
they've actually put the reserves from

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.360 
they've actually put the reserves from

transfers the transfer that negotiation

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.230 
transfers the transfer that negotiation
I<00:05:36.990> suppose<00:05:37.260> does<00:05:37.950> look<00:05:38.190> a<00:05:38.220> tiny<00:05:38.610> bit<00:05:38.850> different

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
I suppose does look a tiny bit different

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.920 
I suppose does look a tiny bit different
but<00:05:39.690> there<00:05:41.090> it's<00:05:42.090> more<00:05:42.300> or<00:05:42.360> less<00:05:42.419> the<00:05:42.600> same<00:05:42.630> but

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
but there it's more or less the same but

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
but there it's more or less the same but
I<00:05:42.990> think<00:05:43.789> the<00:05:45.380> difficulty<00:05:46.380> that<00:05:46.410> you<00:05:46.740> have

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
I think the difficulty that you have

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.629 
I think the difficulty that you have
acquiring<00:05:47.669> different<00:05:48.150> players<00:05:48.330> at<00:05:49.160> it<00:05:50.160> is<00:05:50.610> a

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
acquiring different players at it is a

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.270 
acquiring different players at it is a
bit<00:05:50.910> it's<00:05:51.539> changed<00:05:52.080> a<00:05:52.139> bit<00:05:52.260> let's<00:05:52.710> see<00:05:52.800> inquire

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
bit it's changed a bit let's see inquire
