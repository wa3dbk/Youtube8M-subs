controls<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.960> spaceship<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> screen<00:00:25.890> you

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
controls the spaceship on the screen you

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.189 
controls the spaceship on the screen you
can<00:00:26.310> shake<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.880> activate<00:00:27.449> mega<00:00:27.660> bombs<00:00:27.900> and

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
can shake it to activate mega bombs and

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.830 
can shake it to activate mega bombs and
we<00:00:28.590> chose<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.949> ball<00:00:29.099> because<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
we chose the ball because it's it's a

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.020 
we chose the ball because it's it's a
blank<00:00:31.080> slate<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:32.189> could<00:00:32.309> be<00:00:32.399> anything<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.000> you

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
blank slate it could be anything so you

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.940 
blank slate it could be anything so you
can<00:00:33.210> play<00:00:33.390> racing<00:00:34.050> games<00:00:34.440> with<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.920> can

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
can play racing games with it you can

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.549 
can play racing games with it you can
play<00:00:35.280> games<00:00:35.940> like<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.420> tag<00:00:36.719> game<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.469> have

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
play games like this tag game we have

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.799 
play games like this tag game we have
about<00:00:37.800> 15<00:00:38.370> games<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.000> apps<00:00:39.149> out<00:00:39.360> for<00:00:39.600> Stroh

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
about 15 games and apps out for Stroh

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.510 
about 15 games and apps out for Stroh
right<00:00:40.110> now<00:00:40.290> we're<00:00:40.829> doing<00:00:41.309> all<00:00:41.430> these

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
right now we're doing all these

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.850 
right now we're doing all these
hackathons<00:00:41.760> around<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> u.s.<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
hackathons around the u.s. so out of

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.380 
hackathons around the u.s. so out of
those<00:00:44.070> hackathons<00:00:44.670> we'll<00:00:44.969> probably<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
those hackathons we'll probably have a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.940 
those hackathons we'll probably have a
lot<00:00:45.629> more<00:00:45.750> apps<00:00:45.960> coming<00:00:46.170> out<00:00:46.350> as<00:00:46.469> well<00:00:46.620> soon

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
lot more apps coming out as well soon

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.420 
lot more apps coming out as well soon
and<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:48.000> also<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.239> an<00:00:48.420> open<00:00:48.690> SDK<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:50.190> anybody

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and we also have an open SDK so anybody

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.850 
and we also have an open SDK so anybody
can<00:00:50.730> build<00:00:50.969> iOS<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.719> Android<00:00:52.079> apps<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.559> shrill

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
can build iOS or Android apps for shrill

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.910 
can build iOS or Android apps for shrill
in<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.610> ball<00:00:53.760> itself<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.590> gyro<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
in the ball itself we have gyro and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.060 
in the ball itself we have gyro and
accelerometer<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.969> processor<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> RGB

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
accelerometer a processor we have a RGB

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.360 
accelerometer a processor we have a RGB
LED<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.820> couple<00:01:00.480> motors<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:02.129> very

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
LED a couple motors so it's it's very

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.280 
LED a couple motors so it's it's very
simple<00:01:02.670> from<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> outside<00:01:03.449> it's<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.080> ball

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
simple from the outside it's just a ball

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.710 
simple from the outside it's just a ball
but<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.920> inside<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.610> turned<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.420> be

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
but on the inside it turned out to be

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.350 
but on the inside it turned out to be
far<00:01:07.260> more<00:01:07.560> complicated<00:01:08.100> than<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:08.580> thought<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
far more complicated than we thought the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.950 
far more complicated than we thought the
first<00:01:09.689> one<00:01:09.869> was<00:01:11.090> kind<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.479> couple<00:01:12.689> days

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
first one was kind of just a couple days

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.469 
first one was kind of just a couple days
but<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.590> went<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.280> hobby<00:01:14.490> lobby<00:01:14.640> actually<00:01:15.360> and

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
but I went to hobby lobby actually and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.440 
but I went to hobby lobby actually and
bought<00:01:15.659> these<00:01:16.939> Christmas<00:01:17.939> ornaments<00:01:18.420> that

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
bought these Christmas ornaments that

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.210 
bought these Christmas ornaments that
you<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.810> buy<00:01:18.990> they<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.439> these<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.830> clear

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
you can buy they have these like clear

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.920 
you can buy they have these like clear
shells<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.939> cut<00:01:21.150> off<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.330> little<00:01:21.600> tab<00:01:21.900> that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
shells and I cut off the little tab that

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.170 
shells and I cut off the little tab that
you<00:01:22.200> hang<00:01:22.409> hang<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.970> was<00:01:24.090> our

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
you hang hang it on and that was our

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.289 
you hang hang it on and that was our
initial<00:01:24.390> shell<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:26.670> rest<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.150> was

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
initial shell and the rest of it was

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.569 
initial shell and the rest of it was
like<00:01:27.540> paper<00:01:28.290> clip<00:01:28.680> together<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.400> totally

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
like paper clip together and totally

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.700 
like paper clip together and totally
like<00:01:29.970> hand<00:01:30.240> soldered<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.840> stuff<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.590> was

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
like hand soldered and stuff so it was

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.219 
like hand soldered and stuff so it was
pretty<00:01:31.920> crude<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.700> barely<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.840> slow

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
pretty crude and it barely like so slow

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.109 
pretty crude and it barely like so slow
and<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.500> barely<00:01:34.710> moved<00:01:35.009> but<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.820> was<00:01:35.970> our

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
and it barely moved but that was our

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.569 
and it barely moved but that was our
first<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.650> most<00:01:37.650> components<00:01:38.040> will<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.460> from

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
first one most components will get from

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.760 
first one most components will get from
digi-key<00:01:39.090> motors<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.380> things<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.710> that

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
digi-key motors and things like that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.240

years<00:01:55.140> old<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.680> remember<00:01:56.040> having<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.520> this

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
years old I remember having like this

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.240 
years old I remember having like this
box<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.540> random<00:01:58.259> parts<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.860> i<00:01:59.009> never

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
box of just random parts that i never

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.160 
box of just random parts that i never
did<00:01:59.490> inouye<00:01:59.880> any<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.299> them<00:02:00.450> were<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.840> just

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
did inouye any of them were but just

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.499 
did inouye any of them were but just
taking<00:02:01.500> apart<00:02:01.770> cameras<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.520> Walkmans<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
taking apart cameras and Walkmans and

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.510 
taking apart cameras and Walkmans and
things<00:02:04.259> like<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.680> when<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.100> started<00:02:05.399> in

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
things like that so when I started in

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.730 
things like that so when I started in
the<00:02:05.579> robotic<00:02:06.000> stuff<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.630> think<00:02:07.020> my<00:02:07.140> dad<00:02:07.350> took<00:02:07.560> me

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
the robotic stuff I think my dad took me

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.040 
the robotic stuff I think my dad took me
around<00:02:07.829> all<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:08.869> electronics<00:02:09.869> repair

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
around all the like electronics repair

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.350 
around all the like electronics repair
shops<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.830> we<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:11.099> like<00:02:11.280> filled<00:02:11.790> up<00:02:12.000> my<00:02:12.150> room

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
shops and we just like filled up my room

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.340 
shops and we just like filled up my room
with

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
with

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.230 
with
tvs<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.980> all<00:02:14.040> kinds<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.460> crazy<00:02:14.640> stuff<00:02:14.820> that<00:02:15.060> i

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
tvs and all kinds of crazy stuff that i

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.450 
tvs and all kinds of crazy stuff that i
would<00:02:15.390> take<00:02:15.540> apart<00:02:15.840> i<00:02:16.130> started<00:02:17.130> building

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
would take apart i started building

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.570 
would take apart i started building
robots<00:02:17.820> when<00:02:18.120> i<00:02:18.150> was<00:02:18.530> 12<00:02:19.530> actually<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:20.370> it's

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
robots when i was 12 actually so it's

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.090 
robots when i was 12 actually so it's
i've<00:02:21.000> been<00:02:21.210> building<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.530> creating<00:02:22.680> things

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
i've been building and creating things

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.640 
i've been building and creating things
for<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.460> long<00:02:23.640> time<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.780> i<00:02:24.810> got<00:02:25.020> in<00:02:25.170> through<00:02:25.380> this

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
for a long time so i got in through this

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.500 
for a long time so i got in through this
this<00:02:26.010> beam<00:02:26.340> robotics<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.210> sort<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
this beam robotics and sort of the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.970 
this beam robotics and sort of the
philosophy<00:02:28.140> behind<00:02:28.170> beam<00:02:29.040> robotics<00:02:30.740> is<00:02:31.740> that

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
philosophy behind beam robotics is that

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.220 
philosophy behind beam robotics is that
it's<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.910> sort<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.180> use<00:02:33.420> like<00:02:33.720> hacked

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
it's you sort of use like hacked

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.530 
it's you sort of use like hacked
materials<00:02:34.860> you're<00:02:35.190> pulling<00:02:35.520> apart<00:02:35.610> cassette

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
materials you're pulling apart cassette

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.870 
materials you're pulling apart cassette
players<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:38.190> they<00:02:38.250> also<00:02:38.400> have<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.670> very

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
players and but they also have a very

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.600 
players and but they also have a very
aesthetic<00:02:39.330> sense<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.810> them<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.350> they're<00:02:40.610> if

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
aesthetic sense to them so they're if

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.740 
aesthetic sense to them so they're if
they<00:02:41.820> look<00:02:42.000> good<00:02:42.210> they're<00:02:42.420> supposed<00:02:42.690> to

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
they look good they're supposed to

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.050 
they look good they're supposed to
function<00:02:42.990> good<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.590> they<00:02:43.680> mimic<00:02:44.070> biological

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
function good and they mimic biological

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.110 
function good and they mimic biological
things<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:45.720> like<00:02:46.560> some<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.580> robots<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.030> I

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
things so like some of the robots that I

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.900 
things so like some of the robots that I
built<00:02:48.330> early<00:02:49.050> on<00:02:49.080> we<00:02:49.200> r<00:02:49.410> legged<00:02:49.740> robots<00:02:50.310> solar

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
built early on we r legged robots solar

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.050 
built early on we r legged robots solar
powered<00:02:51.330> robots<00:02:52.160> that<00:02:53.160> looked<00:02:53.370> like<00:02:53.460> insects

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
powered robots that looked like insects

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.780 
powered robots that looked like insects
and<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.660> don't<00:02:55.650> know<00:02:55.710> I<00:02:55.890> liked<00:02:56.370> sort<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.700> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
and I don't know I liked sort of the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.510 
and I don't know I liked sort of the
creative<00:02:57.180> aspect<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.870> but<00:02:58.860> also<00:02:58.890> the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
creative aspect of it but also the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.920 
creative aspect of it but also the
problem<00:02:59.850> solving<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.630> engineering

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
problem solving in the engineering

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.090 
problem solving in the engineering
aspect<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.710> I<00:03:02.670> like<00:03:03.270> solving<00:03:03.660> problems<00:03:04.260> I

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
aspect of it I like solving problems I

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.960 
aspect of it I like solving problems I
think<00:03:05.610> it's<00:03:05.760> it's<00:03:06.120> fun<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.960> enjoy<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.970> mean

think it's it's fun I I enjoy it I mean

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.560 
think it's it's fun I I enjoy it I mean
we<00:03:09.510> build<00:03:09.780> robot<00:03:10.230> gaming<00:03:11.070> systems<00:03:11.580> like<00:03:11.880> how

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
we build robot gaming systems like how

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:21.430 
we build robot gaming systems like how
much<00:03:12.750> better<00:03:12.990> could<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.320> get
