we have this image in front of us with

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.440 
we have this image in front of us with
the<00:00:13.500> word<00:00:13.650> hello<00:00:13.889> we're<00:00:14.670> gonna<00:00:14.790> use<00:00:15.089> this<00:00:15.269> as

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
the word hello we're gonna use this as

and we're gonna place it onto our bottom
layer<00:00:28.730> which<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.760> called<00:00:29.910> good<00:00:30.240> goodbye<00:00:30.949> so

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
layer which is called good goodbye so

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.370 
layer which is called good goodbye so
now<00:00:32.099> these<00:00:32.610> are<00:00:32.820> all<00:00:32.940> layers<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.570> Photoshop

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
now these are all layers in Photoshop

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.530 
now these are all layers in Photoshop
and<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.309> layers<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.790> cake<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
and just like the layers of a cake the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.900 
and just like the layers of a cake the
top<00:00:36.750> layer<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.410> one<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.010> see<00:00:38.280> though

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
top layer is the one that you see though

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.670 
top layer is the one that you see though
it's<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> one<00:00:39.420> that's<00:00:39.629> visible<00:00:39.809> unless<00:00:40.379> you

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
it's the one that's visible unless you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.900 
it's the one that's visible unless you
make<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.890> invisible<00:00:41.250> with<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.760> eye<00:00:42.000> here<00:00:42.710> now

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
make it invisible with this eye here now

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.779 
make it invisible with this eye here now
in<00:00:44.910> Photoshop<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.170> an<00:00:46.350> eraser<00:00:46.680> tool<00:00:47.070> here

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
in Photoshop we have an eraser tool here

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.979 
in Photoshop we have an eraser tool here
and<00:00:48.000> if<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.809> choose<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.250> erase<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.780> top

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
and if we choose it we can erase the top

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.650 
and if we choose it we can erase the top
layer<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.530> layer<00:00:52.770> that's<00:00:53.039> selected<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.480> we

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
layer the layer that's selected and we

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.660 
layer the layer that's selected and we
can<00:00:54.809> bring<00:00:55.050> through<00:00:55.260> some<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.890> layer

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
can bring through some of the layer

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.330 
can bring through some of the layer
below<00:00:56.930> now<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.260> great<00:00:58.530> but

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
below now this is great but

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.209 
below now this is great but
unfortunately<00:00:59.489> its<00:01:00.390> destructive<00:01:01.070> for<00:01:02.070> your

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
unfortunately its destructive for your

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.030 
unfortunately its destructive for your
workflow<00:01:02.789> because<00:01:03.390> maybe<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.530> five<00:01:04.710> or<00:01:04.739> ten

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
workflow because maybe it's five or ten

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.469 
workflow because maybe it's five or ten
minutes<00:01:05.309> down<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.670> line<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.030> might<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.330> doing

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
minutes down the line you might be doing

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.300 
minutes down the line you might be doing
different<00:01:06.960> adjustments<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.650> you'll<00:01:08.040> realize

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
different adjustments and you'll realize

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.609 
different adjustments and you'll realize
that<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.820> made<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> mistake<00:01:09.150> when<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.140> use<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
that you made a mistake when you use the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.649 
that you made a mistake when you use the
eraser<00:01:10.860> tool<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:11.729> there's<00:01:11.939> no<00:01:12.150> way<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.479> going

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
eraser tool but there's no way of going

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.710 
eraser tool but there's no way of going
back<00:01:13.080> we<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.250> go<00:01:14.369> back<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:14.790> because<00:01:15.570> we've

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
back we can go back now because we've

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.990 
back we can go back now because we've
only<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:15.960> made<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.590> change<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.520> later<00:01:17.790> down

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
only just made the change but later down

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.820 
only just made the change but later down
the<00:01:18.150> line<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.540> would<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.900> impossible<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.710> go

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the line it would be impossible to go

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.670 
the line it would be impossible to go
back<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:21.240> Photoshop<00:01:21.990> decided<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.500> come<00:01:22.650> up

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
back so Photoshop decided to come up

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.770 
back so Photoshop decided to come up
with<00:01:22.799> an<00:01:23.040> alternative<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.850> which<00:01:24.600> is

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
with an alternative to this which is

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.929 
with an alternative to this which is
much<00:01:25.409> more<00:01:25.650> well<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.729> completely

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
much more well it's completely

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.929 
much more well it's completely
non-destructive<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.439> every<00:01:29.220> good<00:01:29.400> workflow

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
non-destructive and every good workflow

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.649 
non-destructive and every good workflow
uses<00:01:30.720> masking<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.409> some<00:01:31.680> degree<00:01:32.150> so<00:01:33.150> what<00:01:33.540> is

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
uses masking to some degree so what is

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.010 
uses masking to some degree so what is
masking<00:01:34.170> well<00:01:34.950> essentially<00:01:35.869> masking<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
masking well essentially masking is a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.440 
masking well essentially masking is a
way<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.409> making<00:01:37.650> some<00:01:38.040> an<00:01:38.250> area<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:39.030> an<00:01:39.360> image

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
way of making some an area of an image

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.399 
way of making some an area of an image
invisible<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.280> can<00:01:41.430> also<00:01:41.840> unmask<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.049> to

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
invisible but you can also unmask it to

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.429 
invisible but you can also unmask it to
make<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.770> visible<00:01:44.159> again<00:01:44.990> let<00:01:45.990> me<00:01:46.079> give<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.350> an

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
make it visible again let me give you an

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.490 
make it visible again let me give you an
example<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.750> always<00:01:48.960> must<00:01:49.229> select

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
example if you you always must select

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.960 
example if you you always must select
the<00:01:49.710> main<00:01:49.920> layer<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.310> you're<00:01:50.460> going<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.700> work

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
the main layer that you're going to work

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.139 
the main layer that you're going to work
on<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:52.170> case<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.619> hello<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:54.000> go

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
on in this case it's hello if you go

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.789 
on in this case it's hello if you go
down<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.630> little<00:01:54.810> square<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
down to this little square here and

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.429 
down to this little square here and
click<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.759> you'll<00:01:57.299> see<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.689> white<00:01:58.049> square

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
click it you'll see a white square

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.179 
click it you'll see a white square
appears<00:01:58.890> next<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.520> your<00:02:00.149> layer<00:02:00.500> this<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.829> your

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
appears next to your layer this is your

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.510 
appears next to your layer this is your
layer<00:02:02.399> mask<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.969> it's<00:02:03.899> white<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.530> in

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
layer mask and it's white and in

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.180 
layer mask and it's white and in
Photoshop<00:02:06.450> from<00:02:06.990> asking<00:02:07.469> white<00:02:07.890> means

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
Photoshop from asking white means

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.080 
Photoshop from asking white means
visible<00:02:08.789> black<00:02:09.420> means<00:02:09.810> invisible<00:02:10.560> well<00:02:11.129> it

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
visible black means invisible well it

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.760 
visible black means invisible well it
doesn't<00:02:12.390> seem<00:02:12.599> logical<00:02:12.810> that

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
doesn't seem logical that

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.710 
doesn't seem logical that
those<00:02:13.860> two<00:02:14.070> colors<00:02:14.370> are<00:02:14.760> related<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.570> each

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
those two colors are related to each

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.480 
those two colors are related to each
other<00:02:15.900> or<00:02:16.170> related<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.100> idea<00:02:17.430> of

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
other or related to the idea of

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.180 
other or related to the idea of
invisibility<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.930> visibility<00:02:19.320> so<00:02:19.950> we<00:02:20.070> have

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
invisibility and visibility so we have

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.700 
invisibility and visibility so we have
to<00:02:20.340> suspend<00:02:20.730> our<00:02:20.910> logic<00:02:21.270> slightly<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.900> just

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
to suspend our logic slightly and just

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.910 
to suspend our logic slightly and just
go<00:02:22.920> with<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.100> flow<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.660> if<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.500> choose<00:02:25.740> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
go with the flow so if I choose the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.510 
go with the flow so if I choose the
paintbrush<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:27.740> these<00:02:28.740> are<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.040> are<00:02:29.190> colors

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
paintbrush and these are the are colors

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.010 
paintbrush and these are the are colors
this<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.970> foreground<00:02:30.360> color<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:30.990> the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
this is the foreground color this is the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.320 
this is the foreground color this is the
black<00:02:31.320> background<00:02:31.980> color<00:02:32.220> now<00:02:32.940> I'm<00:02:33.150> gonna

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
black background color now I'm gonna

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.230 
black background color now I'm gonna
switch<00:02:33.720> those<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:34.740> have<00:02:35.010> my<00:02:35.220> paper<00:02:35.520> set<00:02:36.030> to

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
switch those so I have my paper set to

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.980 
switch those so I have my paper set to
black<00:02:36.860> now<00:02:37.860> I'm<00:02:38.250> gonna<00:02:38.490> make<00:02:38.700> my<00:02:38.990> paintbrush

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
black now I'm gonna make my paintbrush

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.410 
black now I'm gonna make my paintbrush
much<00:02:40.560> smaller<00:02:41.100> cuz<00:02:41.460> that's<00:02:41.670> huge

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
much smaller cuz that's huge

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.470 
much smaller cuz that's huge
if<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:43.680> give<00:02:43.890> me<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.040> mood<00:02:45.560> okay<00:02:46.670> now<00:02:47.670> like

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
if you just give me a mood okay now like

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.050 
if you just give me a mood okay now like
I<00:02:48.660> said<00:02:48.900> before<00:02:49.050> black<00:02:49.770> means<00:02:50.100> invisible<00:02:50.880> in

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
I said before black means invisible in

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.620 
I said before black means invisible in
masking<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.670> when<00:02:53.670> your<00:02:53.820> about<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.180> mask<00:02:54.420> you

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
masking so when your about the mask you

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.720 
masking so when your about the mask you
have<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.870> select<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.380> layer<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.700> want

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
have to select the layer that you want

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.730 
have to select the layer that you want
the<00:02:57.030> mask<00:02:57.240> over<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.840> make<00:02:58.080> sure<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.410> the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
the mask over and make sure this the

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.100 
the mask over and make sure this the
layer<00:02:58.950> mask<00:02:59.220> here<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.820> selected<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.690> not<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
layer mask here is selected and not the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.100 
layer mask here is selected and not the
thumbnail<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.710> image<00:03:02.150> now<00:03:03.150> with<00:03:03.810> black

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
thumbnail of the image now with black

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.630 
thumbnail of the image now with black
selected<00:03:04.710> we<00:03:05.220> can<00:03:05.750> mask<00:03:06.750> out<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.400> top<00:03:08.400> layer

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
selected we can mask out the top layer

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.520 
selected we can mask out the top layer
we're<00:03:09.000> making<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:09.390> invisible<00:03:09.630> just<00:03:10.200> like<00:03:10.380> we

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
we're making it invisible just like we

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.160 
we're making it invisible just like we
did<00:03:10.680> with<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.890> eraser<00:03:11.250> tool<00:03:11.990> however<00:03:12.990> the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
did with the eraser tool however the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.550 
did with the eraser tool however the
benefit<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.710> this<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.010> see<00:03:14.880> in<00:03:15.230> you<00:03:16.230> know<00:03:16.350> five

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
benefit of this is see in you know five

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.930 
benefit of this is see in you know five
or<00:03:16.740> ten<00:03:16.920> minutes<00:03:17.250> you've<00:03:17.400> done<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.610> lot<00:03:17.820> of

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
or ten minutes you've done a lot of

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.390 
or ten minutes you've done a lot of
adjustment<00:03:18.480> layers<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.380> realize<00:03:19.770> you

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
adjustment layers and you realize you

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.640 
adjustment layers and you realize you
have<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.640> go<00:03:20.790> back<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.240> made<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.450> mistake<00:03:21.650> all

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
have to go back you made a mistake all

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.199 
have to go back you made a mistake all
you<00:03:22.920> need<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.190> do<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.520> to<00:03:23.610> choose<00:03:23.820> that<00:03:24.000> layer

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
you need to do is to choose that layer

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.230 
you need to do is to choose that layer
mask<00:03:24.300> again<00:03:25.310> choose<00:03:26.310> your<00:03:26.550> foreground<00:03:27.060> color

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
mask again choose your foreground color

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.170 
mask again choose your foreground color
as<00:03:27.690> white<00:03:27.990> and<00:03:28.340> simply<00:03:29.340> paint<00:03:29.580> over<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.030> again

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
as white and simply paint over it again

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.410 
as white and simply paint over it again
and<00:03:30.480> you'll<00:03:31.260> make<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.680> layer<00:03:31.920> visible<00:03:32.880> once

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
and you'll make that layer visible once

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.980 
and you'll make that layer visible once
more<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.580> all<00:03:35.880> layer<00:03:36.150> masking<00:03:36.630> is

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
more and that is all layer masking is

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.310 
more and that is all layer masking is
it's<00:03:37.650> essentially<00:03:38.280> removing<00:03:39.110> parts<00:03:40.110> of<00:03:40.200> an

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
it's essentially removing parts of an

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.370 
it's essentially removing parts of an
image<00:03:40.640> but<00:03:41.640> having<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.090> option<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.900> restore

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
image but having the option to restore

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.790 
image but having the option to restore
those<00:03:43.590> parts<00:03:44.040> if<00:03:44.160> you<00:03:44.220> want<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:44.970> in<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.209> future

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
those parts if you want to in the future

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.860 
those parts if you want to in the future
the<00:03:46.800> great<00:03:47.100> thing<00:03:47.340> about<00:03:47.370> layer<00:03:48.300> masks<00:03:48.750> is

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
the great thing about layer masks is

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.750 
the great thing about layer masks is
that<00:03:49.020> all<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.230> these<00:03:49.470> adjustment<00:03:50.010> layers<00:03:50.220> that

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
that all of these adjustment layers that

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.699 
that all of these adjustment layers that
we've<00:03:50.910> just<00:03:51.150> created<00:03:51.330> all<00:03:51.690> come<00:03:52.350> with<00:03:52.530> layer

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
we've just created all come with layer

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.970 
we've just created all come with layer
masks<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:53.880> whenever<00:03:54.810> we<00:03:55.080> make<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.320> change<00:03:55.709> like

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
masks so whenever we make a change like

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.550 
masks so whenever we make a change like
a<00:03:56.510> curves<00:03:57.510> adjustments<00:03:58.110> layer<00:03:58.290> for<00:03:58.530> example

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
a curves adjustments layer for example

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.520 
a curves adjustments layer for example
and<00:03:59.480> we<00:04:00.480> don't<00:04:00.660> want<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.959> affect<00:04:01.080> certain

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
and we don't want it to affect certain

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.310 
and we don't want it to affect certain
parts<00:04:01.980> of<00:04:02.070> our<00:04:02.190> image<00:04:02.520> we<00:04:03.180> can<00:04:03.330> just<00:04:03.600> go<00:04:04.260> to

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
parts of our image we can just go to

that's<00:04:15.690> telling<00:04:16.109> us<00:04:16.200> what<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.500> mask<00:04:16.739> looks

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
that's telling us what the mask looks

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.610 
that's telling us what the mask looks
like<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.640> if<00:04:18.000> we<00:04:18.150> press<00:04:18.299> alt<00:04:18.660> or<00:04:18.870> option<00:04:18.959> on<00:04:19.590> a

Mac and left mouse button you can see

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.650 
Mac and left mouse button you can see
the<00:04:22.890> mask<00:04:23.130> you<00:04:23.850> can<00:04:24.030> see<00:04:24.210> what<00:04:24.479> you've<00:04:24.630> just

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
the mask you can see what you've just

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.010 
the mask you can see what you've just
created

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
created

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.320 
created
and<00:04:26.110> that's<00:04:26.979> it<00:04:27.160> it's<00:04:27.370> really<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:27.940> simple

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
and that's it it's really a simple

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.700 
and that's it it's really a simple
concept<00:04:28.750> I<00:04:28.930> know<00:04:29.020> it's<00:04:29.259> difficult<00:04:29.440> to

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
concept I know it's difficult to

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.469 
concept I know it's difficult to
understand<00:04:30.220> at<00:04:30.340> first<00:04:30.610> this<00:04:30.819> idea<00:04:31.180> that<00:04:31.360> black

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
understand at first this idea that black

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.390 
understand at first this idea that black
equals<00:04:31.930> invisible<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.560> y<00:04:32.650> equals<00:04:32.979> visible

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
equals invisible and y equals visible

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.399 
equals invisible and y equals visible
but<00:04:33.550> it's<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.090> very<00:04:34.270> powerful<00:04:34.360> tool<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.169> I<00:04:35.229> hope

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:35.409 
but it's a very powerful tool and I hope

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:36.659 
but it's a very powerful tool and I hope
you<00:04:35.560> start<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:35.919> use<00:04:36.069> it<00:04:36.099> more<00:04:36.430> in<00:04:36.610> your

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
you start to use it more in your

you start to use it more in your
