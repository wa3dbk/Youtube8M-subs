second before we move on and I'm sure
you<00:04:18.489> can<00:04:18.610> all<00:04:18.700> guess<00:04:18.910> what<00:04:19.060> we're<00:04:19.150> going<00:04:19.270> to<00:04:19.360> do

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
you can all guess what we're going to do

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.540 
you can all guess what we're going to do
next<00:04:19.660> going<00:04:20.230> to<00:04:20.290> be<00:04:20.350> down<00:04:20.560> up<00:04:20.770> down<00:04:20.800> up<00:04:21.040> again

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.550 
next going to be down up down up again

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
next going to be down up down up again
this<00:04:21.670> is<00:04:21.790> going<00:04:21.910> to<00:04:21.970> be<00:04:22.060> trickier<00:04:22.450> the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
this is going to be trickier the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.940 
this is going to be trickier the
transition<00:04:23.020> between<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.350> cause<00:04:23.620> it's<00:04:23.860> going

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
transition between the cause it's going

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.970 
transition between the cause it's going
to<00:04:24.010> be<00:04:24.100> quicker<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:25.380> I'll<00:04:26.380> try<00:04:26.560> not<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.830> play

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
to be quicker and I'll try not to play

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.430 
to be quicker and I'll try not to play
too<00:04:27.040> fast<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:27.900> see<00:04:28.900> how<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.050> get<00:04:29.170> on<00:04:29.230> with<00:04:29.380> it

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.170 

down<00:04:51.010> up<00:04:51.190> down<00:04:51.220> because<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:51.670> trendy<00:04:52.000> gives

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
down up down because the trendy gives

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.550 
down up down because the trendy gives

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
you a space therebetween the cord for

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.320 
you a space therebetween the cord for
the<00:04:53.620> transition<00:04:54.010> but<00:04:54.640> this<00:04:54.760> is<00:04:54.910> just<00:04:54.940> to<00:04:55.210> give

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
the transition but this is just to give

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.250 
the transition but this is just to give
you<00:04:55.420> that<00:04:55.540> down<00:04:55.810> up<00:04:55.990> down<00:04:56.020> up<00:04:56.580> practice<00:04:57.580> okay

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
you that down up down up practice okay

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
after 4 1 2 3 4 okay and that's it gcd

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.220 
after 4 1 2 3 4 okay and that's it gcd
and<00:05:35.790> down<00:05:36.790> and<00:05:37.000> up<00:05:37.090> strokes<00:05:37.480> okay<00:05:37.990> good
