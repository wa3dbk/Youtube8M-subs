controller you can fill the camera like

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.440 
controller you can fill the camera like
that<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.619> three<00:01:56.069> different<00:01:56.280> speeds<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.240> can

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
that in three different speeds you can

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.120 
that in three different speeds you can
move<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.959> complete<00:01:58.259> flight<00:01:58.590> system<00:01:58.979> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
move the complete flight system and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.010 
move the complete flight system and
that's<00:01:59.429> the<00:01:59.549> camera<00:01:59.909> also<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.539> three

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
that's the camera also in three

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.319 
that's the camera also in three
different<00:02:01.259> speeds<00:02:01.649> can<00:02:02.310> zoom<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.880> almost

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
different speeds can zoom in almost

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.260 
different speeds can zoom in almost
proportionally<00:02:04.109> even<00:02:04.859> adjust<00:02:05.670> shutter<00:02:05.939> speed

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
proportionally even adjust shutter speed

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.749 
proportionally even adjust shutter speed
