we're using cold energy and we found
that<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.730> cold<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.390> more<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.380> fat<00:00:28.619> cells<00:00:28.920> are

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
that the cold is more the fat cells are

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.550 
that the cold is more the fat cells are
more<00:00:29.250> susceptible<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:30.000> damage<00:00:30.240> than<00:00:30.660> cold<00:00:30.960> by

we're<00:02:46.360> using<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.750> device<00:02:46.870> called<00:02:47.050> lifeless

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
we're using a device called lifeless

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.250 
we're using a device called lifeless
onyx<00:02:48.310> which<00:02:48.489> uses<00:02:48.880> ultrasound<00:02:49.480> energy<00:02:49.840> which

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
onyx which uses ultrasound energy which

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.290 
onyx which uses ultrasound energy which
is<00:02:50.410> very<00:02:50.650> safe<00:02:50.980> they<00:02:51.160> use<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.489> image<00:02:51.820> babies

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
is very safe they use it to image babies

is very safe they use it to image babies
you<00:02:52.750> see<00:02:52.989> I'm<00:02:53.140> examining<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.980> patient<00:02:54.190> and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
you see I'm examining the patient and

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.970 
you see I'm examining the patient and
now<00:02:55.180> I'm<00:02:55.390> putting<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.840> template<00:02:56.320> on<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.650> skin

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
now I'm putting the template on the skin

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.770 
now I'm putting the template on the skin
and<00:02:57.190> we're<00:02:57.730> going<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:57.910> use<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.209> ultrasound

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
and we're going to use the ultrasound

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.370 
and we're going to use the ultrasound
energy<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.650> heat<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.100> fats
