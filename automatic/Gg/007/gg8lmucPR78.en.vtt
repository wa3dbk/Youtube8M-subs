00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.400

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.439
 my name is ruth natur and today gives 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.189
 it again a quicktipp today's topic 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.050
 Sugar is like an addiction 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.009
 There are different forms of sugar 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.829
 we're talking unhealthy here 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:38.070
 plain sugar simple sugar leaves you 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.250
 to take on fat and he is one of the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.460
 main reasons for obesity 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.470
 This world sugar has an extreme 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.720
 potential it causes high and low to 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.600
 similar to a drug 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.520
 if you have a slim sexy shaped 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.160
 want to have the body I have, I find 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.340
 a great message if you 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.670
 Simply sugar from the meal plan away 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.979
 sweeps gets then you come to your 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.259
 aim a lot closer 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.869
 when you stop to you sugar 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.020
 This addiction will also take fast 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.579
 disappear again 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.740
 people who are dependent on sugar 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.560
 sugar really want the whole thing 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.350
 take time on the other 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.109
 side do not miss him people 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:34.460
 Do not take sugar too 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:37.079
 Unfortunately, many people are attacking 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.319
 want to relax 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:45.090
 as a substitute for artificial sweeteners 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.700
 but that is not necessarily the best 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.100
 solution as well as great thing rinast suit 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.409
 Loose are even more harmful than 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.249
 sugar sugar itself artificial 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.420
 make sweeteners by then 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:59.639
 confuse hormone balance 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.009
 So it's just as important to you 

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:05.069
 sweeteners such as sugar omit 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.690
 even if you absolutely have something sweet 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:10.890
 you may want to sweeten too 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.270
 natural honey grad 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.209
 In addition to natural honey is in a certain way 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.640
 frame still ok 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.180
