00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 we realized that he was cooking the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.140
 snow 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.549
 cauliflower and broccoli or broccoli 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.459
 but what was also cooking 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:13.500
 were the onions and the carrots that 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.540
 I stole a little bit of color to overtake and 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.849
 that we can make this cake together and 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.700
 calm, look at something particular 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:23.430
 lizard on the one hand I have the leaves that 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.099
 we generally do not use the leaves and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.450
 the broccoli sides that also 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.550
 they are cooked cooking on 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.220
 microwave as we explained several 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.290
 Sometimes they are rich they are delicious too 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.630
 can cook them steamed or else 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.730
 You can cook directly in the method 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.580
 traditional water we will leave 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.130
 here we are going to add two two or three 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.700
 eggs in this case are three we are going to 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.230
 include along with these these 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.480
 ingredients that many times like you 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.880
 he said we do not take advantage of them well and we are going to 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.800
 begin to process them, see how 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.020
 let's go and when that can be done 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.450
 in a blender also in the case of 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.210
 that do not have a mixer or if 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.250
 they do not have any of those implements 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.450
 technological we can perfectly 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.630
 do 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.579
 with the help of a sharp knife 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.640
 we chop them until there are 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.259
 small enough, look how 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.990
 is started to process if we already have 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.789
 a base that tastes great and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.740
 we take advantage of one of the parts of the 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.110
 broccoli that are often not used 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.170
 let's add milk in this way 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.509
 lizard let's prove we could 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.159
 say that you can take advantage 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.840
 absolutely all the vegetable and that what 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.030
 that many times we throw is 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.360
 absolutely edible side we should 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.520
 throw it because it would be like eating half 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.679
 one potato and the other half throw it 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.390
 exactly the same then we have 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.399
 that try to take advantage of all this 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.740
 I'll plant to liquefy a little more 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.299
 so that it is somewhat thinner and 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.000
 I'll tell you how we continue with the 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.530
 recipe there is then already with that 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.989
 let's go well 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.090
 let's move on to the next step that others 

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:02.759
 ingredients let's go adding 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.920
 to add the ricotta the rich clear that I 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.140
 with the help of a fork I went 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.239
 stepping on like a lizard puree 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.370
 Yesterday is light skim ricotta 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.610
 exactly ricotta is obtained 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.560
 skim 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.600
 quality ever again because I 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.520
 asked me to look for the non-skim 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.810
 it's going to cost nothing to get it because 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.280
 you can get in any 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.590
 supermarket lizard you will not have 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.500
 no problem we return to process a 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.900
 little and in addition is very rich lagartona is 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.520
 excellent and the other way if it's not doing 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.160
 rich is at home lizard that someone 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.860
 I do not know, it's very easy to make ricotta 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.230
 because it is let's say a game that 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.630
 gets from the milk that can in fact 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.760
 be 100% skim milk which 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.700
 comes 0% for example we can use 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.490
 this milk we add some acid that 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.830
 it can be vinegar or lemon juice and 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.930
 that way it's going to be cut and then with 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.910
 the help of a canvas we put together if we have 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.890
 the ricotta on the one hand and on the other hand the 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.290
 Ameno serum and thus can 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.870
 get the ricotta that is very very simple 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.820
 and it's very liberating here I have something of 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.270
 cheese we're going to add too 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.180
 in here we are going to put a bit of 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.709
 salt but very little is another because 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.320
 we are using ricotta that usually has 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.940
 some salt and also the cheese a nice 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.930
 amount of pepper to give it good 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.880
 taste to our plate 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.730
 we are mixing again 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.410
 and we are almost nothing left for 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.350
 this recipe is only left for us 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.840
 add onions and carrots what 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.460
 I doubt I'm frying, we're going towards 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.250
 in this is so that it has a flavor 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.530
 a little softer but many times the 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.960
 Raw onions can leave us a little 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.000
 bitter the preparation then the 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.630
 I prefer in this case slightly 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.250
 cook now I know and look what good color 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.960
 the carrots also that we're going 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.610
 realizing that we have a recipe 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.010
 really very interesting 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.810
 this is ham ham cooked ham that 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.970
 is cut into dice let's add a 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.700
 little everything can not be replaced 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.710
 can you skip the two things lizard 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.810
 It can be replaced by any other 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.820
 cold or even for example by 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.280
 chicken for chicken there grandma even if 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.860
 more mature in cooked chicken breast 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.200
 Steamed or boiled perfectly 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.030
 would come very well this recipe also what 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.989
 can use for example raw ham if 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.450
 they want and now here I have leavening flour 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.070
 with a little bit of bran quite saved 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.690
 it's actually a teaspoon and for 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.810
 show nothing more and not forget that he 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.400
 I had added and told you 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.540
 but I will have put 5 or 6 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.040
 spoonfuls of generous generous and 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.110
 that can be bought at any 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.700
 dietetics and we can have it 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.070
 available at home for when 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.020
 let's train then flour 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.210
 let's add one more pinch of powder 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.790
 of baking so it gets up a little 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.669
 there this island we begin to mix of 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.830
 new and we already have the base of this 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:53.100
 broccoli cake that we are going to make without 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.260
 But I leave aside the 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.000
 saplings we could say the part of 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.940
 up the broccoli because I'm going to put together 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.740
 a base with this cake and on the base 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.240
 we are going to put the saplings so that 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.710
 stay up and brown I need to 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.840
 oven twice are you preparing to 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.820
 first oven is cooked and I'm going to put it 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.220
 in a tray as if to make 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.810
 a sponge cake a cake is as is 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.520
 in the same way we are going to do it 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.500
 together anyway and then what 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.840
 let's bake to know or you will stay 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.139
 like a cake in the next term I 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:26.120
 I leave so we can observe and do it 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.120
 together, well, I come in a little while, then
