principles<00:01:54.400> for<00:01:54.729> for<00:01:55.150> all<00:01:55.479> of<00:01:55.659> these<00:01:55.780> once<00:01:56.049> you

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
principles for for all of these once you

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.020 
principles for for all of these once you
dig<00:01:56.350> them<00:01:56.439> up<00:01:56.590> is<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:57.250> same<00:01:57.430> so<00:01:57.700> you<00:01:57.759> want<00:01:57.970> to

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
dig them up is the same so you want to

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.580 
dig them up is the same so you want to
go<00:01:58.119> out<00:01:58.240> to<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.509> drip<00:01:58.750> line<00:01:58.780> which<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.320> really

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
go out to the drip line which is really

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.590 
go out to the drip line which is really
just<00:01:59.829> where<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.369> edge<00:02:00.579> of<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.939> leaves<00:02:01.149> are<00:02:01.390> to

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
just where the edge of the leaves are to

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.999 
just where the edge of the leaves are to
dig<00:02:01.810> down<00:02:01.990> which<00:02:02.229> is<00:02:02.380> what<00:02:02.530> you've<00:02:02.710> done<00:02:02.829> with

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
dig down which is what you've done with

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.240 
dig down which is what you've done with
this<00:02:03.159> one<00:02:03.460> correct<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.420> has<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.600> very<00:02:05.250> spreading

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
this one correct it has a very spreading

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.130 
this one correct it has a very spreading
root<00:02:06.460> structure<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.270> does<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:07.869> you<00:02:07.960> obviously

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
root structure it does and you obviously

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.109 
root structure it does and you obviously
washed<00:02:08.679> yours<00:02:08.889> very<00:02:08.979> clean<00:02:09.399> these<00:02:09.549> prettiest

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
washed yours very clean these prettiest

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.599 
washed yours very clean these prettiest
roots<00:02:10.299> I've<00:02:10.450> ever<00:02:10.599> seen<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.499> and<00:02:12.129> we<00:02:12.279> cut<00:02:12.459> the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:12.609 
roots I've ever seen and and we cut the

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.160 
roots I've ever seen and and we cut the
foliage<00:02:12.909> off<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.359> it<00:02:13.480> doesn't<00:02:13.779> get<00:02:13.900> in

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
foliage off so it doesn't get in

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.290 
foliage off so it doesn't get in
way<00:02:14.410> but<00:02:14.470> we<00:02:14.770> left<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.130> stems<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.910> help<00:02:16.120> us

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
way but we left the stems on to help us

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.420 
way but we left the stems on to help us
with<00:02:16.930> moving<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.380> plant<00:02:17.650> around<00:02:17.830> while<00:02:18.250> we're

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
with moving the plant around while we're

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.630 
with moving the plant around while we're
working<00:02:18.610> with<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:20.310> these<00:02:21.310> are<00:02:21.520> the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
working with it and these are the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.720 
working with it and these are the
growing<00:02:21.910> eyes<00:02:22.319> they<00:02:23.319> made<00:02:23.560> this<00:02:23.800> year's<00:02:24.340> stem

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
growing eyes they made this year's stem

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.780 
growing eyes they made this year's stem
and<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:26.200> next<00:02:26.770> growing<00:02:27.010> eyes<00:02:27.250> grew<00:02:27.580> on<00:02:27.730> the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
and the next growing eyes grew on the

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.850 
and the next growing eyes grew on the
sides<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.300> this<00:02:28.420> stem<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:28.990> next<00:02:29.260> year<00:02:29.590> instead

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
sides of this stem so next year instead

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.470 
sides of this stem so next year instead
of<00:02:29.950> having<00:02:30.100> one<00:02:30.370> stem<00:02:30.730> you'll<00:02:30.970> have<00:02:31.150> three

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
of having one stem you'll have three

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.830 
of having one stem you'll have three
here<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.500> your<00:02:32.680> plant<00:02:32.980> will<00:02:33.040> be<00:02:33.160> bigger<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.840> so

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
here so your plant will be bigger and so

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.540 
here so your plant will be bigger and so
we<00:02:35.020> can<00:02:35.170> start<00:02:35.470> by<00:02:35.620> cutting<00:02:36.130> some<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.459> these

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
we can start by cutting some of these

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.630 
we can start by cutting some of these
stems<00:02:36.880> off<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:38.850> go<00:02:39.850> in<00:02:40.060> here<00:02:41.070> usually<00:02:42.070> a<00:02:42.310> three

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
stems off and go in here usually a three

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.760 
stems off and go in here usually a three
to<00:02:42.760> five<00:02:42.970> wide<00:02:43.209> division<00:02:43.840> has<00:02:43.989> what's<00:02:44.680> called

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
to five wide division has what's called

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.600 
to five wide division has what's called
the<00:02:45.100> number<00:02:45.280> one<00:02:45.610> division<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:48.100> we'll<00:02:48.250> see<00:02:48.520> if

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
the number one division and we'll see if

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.050 
the number one division and we'll see if
we<00:02:48.670> can<00:02:48.850> get<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.000> nice<00:02:49.209> one<00:02:49.510> off<00:02:49.660> of<00:02:49.690> here<00:02:51.060> of

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
we can get a nice one off of here of

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.210 
we can get a nice one off of here of
course<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.750> look<00:02:52.930> at<00:02:55.320> their<00:02:56.320> current<00:02:56.530> kind<00:02:57.010> of

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
course to look at their current kind of

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.390 
course to look at their current kind of
the<00:02:57.690> texture<00:02:58.690> of<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:59.050> carrot<00:02:59.440> mm-hmm<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.340> you

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
the texture of a carrot mm-hmm so you

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.250 
the texture of a carrot mm-hmm so you
can<00:03:00.730> use<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:00.910> knife<00:03:01.239> or<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.750> snips<00:03:02.620> on<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.720> or<00:03:04.720> as

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
can use a knife or a snips on it or as

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.960 
can use a knife or a snips on it or as
in<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.040> said<00:03:06.280> before<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:06.580> bandsaw<00:03:07.090> at<00:03:07.330> times

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
in you said before a bandsaw at times

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.430 
in you said before a bandsaw at times
the<00:03:09.970> tree<00:03:10.269> peonies<00:03:10.720> are<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.989> ones<00:03:11.170> that<00:03:11.260> are

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
the tree peonies are the ones that are

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.220 
the tree peonies are the ones that are
real<00:03:11.590> woody<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.100> bush<00:03:12.310> peonies<00:03:12.820> aren't

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
real woody the bush peonies aren't

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.970 
real woody the bush peonies aren't
aren't<00:03:14.550> quite<00:03:15.550> like<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:17.170> again<00:03:17.590> as<00:03:17.800> you

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
aren't quite like that and again as you

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.979 
aren't quite like that and again as you
said<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.489> eyes<00:03:18.670> are<00:03:19.150> these<00:03:19.299> little<00:03:19.570> pink

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
said the eyes are these little pink

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.620 
said the eyes are these little pink
things<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.680> are<00:03:20.769> coming<00:03:20.950> out<00:03:21.190> right<00:03:21.549> and<00:03:22.510> I

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
things that are coming out right and I

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.960 
things that are coming out right and I
kind<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:22.900> broke<00:03:23.079> that<00:03:23.320> so<00:03:26.459> so<00:03:27.459> this<00:03:27.670> will<00:03:27.820> make

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
kind of broke that so so this will make

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.020 
kind of broke that so so this will make
a<00:03:28.000> nice<00:03:28.780> replant<00:03:29.410> it's<00:03:29.769> got<00:03:30.040> four<00:03:30.370> nice<00:03:30.790> eyes

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
a nice replant it's got four nice eyes

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.580 
a nice replant it's got four nice eyes
on<00:03:31.329> there<00:03:31.570> so<00:03:31.780> next<00:03:31.989> year<00:03:32.170> you<00:03:32.260> should<00:03:32.410> have

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
on there so next year you should have

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.220 
on there so next year you should have
four<00:03:32.890> nice<00:03:33.100> stems<00:03:33.459> coming<00:03:33.820> up<00:03:34.120> this<00:03:34.989> is<00:03:35.049> a

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
four nice stems coming up this is a

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.110 
four nice stems coming up this is a
cross<00:03:35.530> between<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:36.010> tree<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.400> Bush<00:03:36.700> peony

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
cross between the tree and Bush peony

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.110 
cross between the tree and Bush peony
and<00:03:37.329> so<00:03:38.170> it's<00:03:38.709> just<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:39.310> little<00:03:39.459> bit<00:03:39.640> different

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
and so it's just a little bit different

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.319 
and so it's just a little bit different
but<00:03:40.840> what<00:03:41.079> we<00:03:41.620> found<00:03:41.829> here<00:03:42.220> is<00:03:42.280> here's<00:03:42.700> some

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
but what we found here is here's some

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.870 
but what we found here is here's some
stems<00:03:43.630> with<00:03:43.930> eyes<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.950> here's<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.310> nice<00:03:45.519> root

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
stems with eyes and here's a nice root

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.000 
stems with eyes and here's a nice root
piece<00:03:46.120> right<00:03:46.840> here<00:03:47.170> that<00:03:47.410> we<00:03:47.500> should<00:03:47.709> be<00:03:47.860> able

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
piece right here that we should be able

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.190 
piece right here that we should be able
to<00:03:48.160> detach<00:03:49.920> it's<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:51.160> little<00:03:51.489> bit<00:03:52.200> harder

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
to detach it's a little bit harder

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.990 
to detach it's a little bit harder
because<00:03:53.410> it's<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:54.040> little<00:03:54.220> more<00:03:54.340> woody<00:03:54.730> like

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
because it's a little more woody like

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.140 
because it's a little more woody like
it's<00:03:55.180> tree<00:03:55.450> peony<00:03:55.810> parent<00:03:56.230> so<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.370> stem<00:03:57.940> is

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
it's tree peony parent so the stem is

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150 
it's tree peony parent so the stem is
only<00:03:58.329> one<00:03:58.630> but<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:58.989> eyes<00:03:59.170> of<00:03:59.650> what's<00:03:59.920> coming

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
only one but the eyes of what's coming

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.940 
only one but the eyes of what's coming
out<00:04:00.310> eyes<00:04:00.850> will<00:04:01.120> make<00:04:01.329> new<00:04:01.570> new<00:04:02.049> stems<00:04:02.410> next

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
out eyes will make new new stems next

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.400 
out eyes will make new new stems next
year<00:04:03.160> so<00:04:03.370> it'll<00:04:03.579> have<00:04:03.700> more<00:04:03.970> stems<00:04:04.360> and<00:04:04.959> that's

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
year so it'll have more stems and that's

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.140 
year so it'll have more stems and that's
the<00:04:05.590> most<00:04:05.739> pronounced<00:04:06.340> eye<00:04:06.459> so<00:04:06.850> we'll<00:04:06.940> cut

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
the most pronounced eye so we'll cut

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.509 
the most pronounced eye so we'll cut
that<00:04:07.299> off<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.930> then<00:04:08.170> we<00:04:08.350> could<00:04:08.530> trim<00:04:09.310> this

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
that off and then we could trim this

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.180 
that off and then we could trim this
down<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:09.880> bit<00:04:10.030> because<00:04:10.450> panties<00:04:11.079> actually<00:04:12.070> are

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
down a bit because panties actually are

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.550 
down a bit because panties actually are
kind<00:04:12.430> of<00:04:12.549> strange<00:04:13.480> in<00:04:13.720> that<00:04:13.900> they<00:04:14.049> like<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:14.440> be

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
kind of strange in that they like to be

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.229 
kind of strange in that they like to be
cut<00:04:14.769> back<00:04:15.010> some<00:04:15.310> when<00:04:15.489> they're<00:04:15.640> transplanted

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
cut back some when they're transplanted

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.690 
cut back some when they're transplanted
if<00:04:16.660> you<00:04:16.780> just<00:04:16.959> move<00:04:17.169> them<00:04:17.320> in<00:04:17.440> tact<00:04:17.709> that's<00:04:18.459> one

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
if you just move them in tact that's one

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.180 
if you just move them in tact that's one
that<00:04:18.850> you<00:04:18.910> hear<00:04:19.299> that<00:04:19.419> they<00:04:19.600> sit<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:19.930> sulk<00:04:20.260> but

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
that you hear that they sit and sulk but

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.890 
that you hear that they sit and sulk but
if<00:04:21.310> you<00:04:21.430> trim<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.970> ends<00:04:22.180> of<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.360> roots<00:04:22.570> and

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
if you trim the ends of the roots and

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.370 
if you trim the ends of the roots and
trim<00:04:23.110> some<00:04:23.349> of<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.530> excess<00:04:23.950> things<00:04:24.280> off

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
trim some of the excess things off

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.340 
trim some of the excess things off
they're<00:04:26.380> going<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.620> say<00:04:26.890> get<00:04:27.099> to
