done I guessed by treatment one of the
previous<00:02:30.360> owners<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:30.959> car<00:02:32.930> apparently

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
previous owners on this car apparently

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.580 
previous owners on this car apparently
they<00:02:34.200> replace<00:02:34.799> this<00:02:35.040> whole<00:02:35.280> quarter<00:02:36.590> and

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
they replace this whole quarter and

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.380 
they replace this whole quarter and
didn't<00:02:37.980> do<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.250> right<00:02:38.280> they<00:02:38.670> didn't<00:02:38.910> undercoat

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
didn't do it right they didn't undercoat

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.030 
didn't do it right they didn't undercoat
it<00:02:39.569> or<00:02:39.690> something<00:02:40.079> and<00:02:40.230> water<00:02:40.500> got<00:02:40.739> up<00:02:40.769> in

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
it or something and water got up in

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.619 
it or something and water got up in
there<00:02:41.220> underneath<00:02:41.579> and<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.060> can<00:02:42.209> see<00:02:42.420> how<00:02:42.569> the

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
there underneath and you can see how the

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.069 
there underneath and you can see how the
water<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.200> ate<00:02:43.470> through<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:45.420> then<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:45.959> just

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
water just ate through and then it just

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.699 
water just ate through and then it just
pulled<00:02:46.410> up<00:02:46.650> underneath<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.250> bondo<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.910> just

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
pulled up underneath the bondo and just

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.830 
pulled up underneath the bondo and just
made<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.739> little<00:02:49.860> river<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.519> rust<00:02:51.060> under<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
made a little river of rust under the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.800 
made a little river of rust under the
bondo<00:02:52.260> something<00:02:53.060> I'll<00:02:54.060> cut<00:02:54.329> all<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.780> out

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
bondo something I'll cut all of that out

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.490 
bondo something I'll cut all of that out
and<00:02:55.290> fix<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.690> little<00:02:57.690> rust<00:02:58.049> up<00:02:58.260> here

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
and fix that little rust up here

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.559 
and fix that little rust up here
underneath<00:02:58.859> the<00:02:59.180> rear<00:03:00.180> quarter<00:03:00.660> windows

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
underneath the rear quarter windows

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.910 
underneath the rear quarter windows
surprisingly<00:03:03.569> there's<00:03:03.930> only<00:03:04.049> that<00:03:04.410> bit<00:03:04.889> of
