the website check out the photo on the
left<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.739> looks<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.370> base<00:00:53.550> check<00:00:54.480> out

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
left if it looks like the base check out

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.560 
left if it looks like the base check out
the<00:00:54.870> videos<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.520> video<00:00:56.789> spite<00:00:57.180> might

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the videos and the video spite might

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.299 
the videos and the video spite might
have<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> base<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.730> it's<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.879> bit<00:01:00.170> different

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
have a base that it's a bit different

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.539 
have a base that it's a bit different
then<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:03.420> picture<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.949> because<00:01:05.280> i<00:01:05.309> want

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
then the picture and it's because i want

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.060 
then the picture and it's because i want
to<00:01:05.640> show<00:01:05.840> modifications<00:01:06.840> as<00:01:07.049> well<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:07.830> it

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
to show modifications as well so if it

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.370 
to show modifications as well so if it
looks<00:01:08.280> pretty<00:01:08.909> much<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.990> base<00:01:10.140> your

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
looks pretty much if the base your

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.260 
looks pretty much if the base your
you're<00:01:10.680> looking<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.580> looks<00:01:11.880> pretty<00:01:12.060> much

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
you're looking for it looks pretty much

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.810 
you're looking for it looks pretty much
like<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.840> picture<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:14.070> go<00:01:14.310> through<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
like in the picture just go through the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.510 
like in the picture just go through the
videos<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.439> check<00:01:16.439> them<00:01:16.650> out<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.490> can

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
videos and check them out and you can

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.350 
videos and check them out and you can
see<00:01:17.820> many<00:01:17.970> ways<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.540> twist<00:01:18.810> are<00:01:19.020> those<00:01:19.799> bases

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
see many ways to twist are those bases

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.390 
see many ways to twist are those bases
so<00:01:21.360> right<00:01:21.990> now<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.350> includes<00:01:22.799> those<00:01:23.040> four

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
so right now it includes those four

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.940 
so right now it includes those four
parts<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.119> only<00:01:24.270> wrote<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.900> names<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.409> I'm

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
parts and I only wrote the names and I'm

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.580 
parts and I only wrote the names and I'm
thinking<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.610> making<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.090> page<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:28.110> all<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
thinking of making a page with all the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.340 
thinking of making a page with all the
pictures<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.310> links<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.630> relevant<00:01:30.659> page

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
website so let's see for example the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.539 
website so let's see for example the
basic<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.790> matrix<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:01.040> i'm<00:02:02.040> going<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.369> show

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
basic a matrix that i'm going to show

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.100 
basic a matrix that i'm going to show
you<00:02:02.579> it's<00:02:02.969> right<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:03.450> as<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.689> can<00:02:03.750> see<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
you it's right here as you can see the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.690 
you it's right here as you can see the
picture<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> bit<00:02:04.799> different<00:02:04.979> because<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
picture is a bit different because the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.100 
picture is a bit different because the
base<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.210> i'm<00:02:06.299> going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.600> show<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.840> right

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
base that i'm going to show you right

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.520 
base that i'm going to show you right
now<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.590> modification<00:02:08.220> of

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
now is a modification of

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.980 
now is a modification of
over<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.400> base<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:12.000> I'm<00:02:12.540> gonna<00:02:12.780> put<00:02:12.959> this

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
over the base so I'm gonna put this

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.780 
over the base so I'm gonna put this
video<00:02:13.440> it's<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.650> go<00:02:13.770> holy<00:02:13.950> attack<00:02:14.190> against<00:02:14.700> it

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
video it's a go holy attack against it

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.850 
video it's a go holy attack against it
and<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.180> might<00:02:15.420> meet<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.959> modification<00:02:16.680> who

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
and you might meet that modification who

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.040 
and you might meet that modification who
knows<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.400> if<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.090> made<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.780> will<00:02:18.900> know

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
knows and if you made it you will know

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.870 
knows and if you made it you will know
how<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.260> treat<00:02:19.620> start<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.810> let's<00:02:21.810> go<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
how to treat start so let's go to the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.570 
how to treat start so let's go to the
attack<00:02:24.090> itself<00:02:24.240> so<00:02:24.860> when<00:02:25.860> you're<00:02:26.010> looking<00:02:26.340> at

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
attack itself so when you're looking at

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.100 
attack itself so when you're looking at
this<00:02:26.760> base<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.300> see<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.630> there<00:02:27.810> are<00:02:27.840> not

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
this base you see that there are not

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.010 
this base you see that there are not
many<00:02:28.580> possible<00:02:29.580> location<00:02:30.030> for<00:02:30.060> bumps<00:02:30.690> there

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
many possible location for bumps there

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.600 
many possible location for bumps there
is<00:02:31.140> one<00:02:31.350> location<00:02:31.650> over<00:02:31.980> here<00:02:32.190> where<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.459> can

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
is one location over here where you can

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.180 
is one location over here where you can
put<00:02:32.790> one<00:02:33.390> bound<00:02:33.660> boldly<00:02:33.989> remember<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.069> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
put one bound boldly remember that the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.430 
put one bound boldly remember that the
giant<00:02:35.489> bump<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.910> two<00:02:36.239> tiles<00:02:36.480> on<00:02:36.750> two<00:02:36.930> tiles<00:02:37.170> and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
giant bump is two tiles on two tiles and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.910 
giant bump is two tiles on two tiles and
that<00:02:37.770> distance<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.520> three<00:02:38.730> tiles<00:02:39.680> pretty<00:02:40.680> much

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
that distance is three tiles pretty much

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.759 
that distance is three tiles pretty much
every<00:02:41.220> defense<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:41.790> three<00:02:42.209> tails<00:02:42.420> own<00:02:42.769> this

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
every defense is three tails own this

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.360 
every defense is three tails own this
one<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.070> three<00:02:44.250> tails<00:02:44.459> for<00:02:44.730> example<00:02:45.150> and

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
one is three tails for example and

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.949 
one is three tails for example and
basically<00:02:47.370> their<00:02:47.670> their<00:02:48.000> possible<00:02:48.480> location

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
basically their their possible location

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.080 
basically their their possible location
for<00:02:49.080> double<00:02:49.620> bombs<00:02:49.830> over<00:02:50.040> here<00:02:50.370> but<00:02:50.580> as<00:02:50.910> you

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
for double bombs over here but as you

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.030 
for double bombs over here but as you
consider<00:02:51.269> nope<00:02:51.720> there<00:02:52.080> are<00:02:52.170> no<00:02:52.290> other<00:02:52.440> places

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
consider nope there are no other places

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.449 
consider nope there are no other places
for<00:02:53.310> Tesla<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.870> can<00:02:55.080> assume<00:02:55.410> with<00:02:56.250> high

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
for Tesla so you can assume with high

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.770 
for Tesla so you can assume with high
percentage<00:02:57.000> pop<00:02:57.440> of<00:02:58.850> knowledge<00:02:59.850> I<00:03:00.180> don't<00:03:00.720> know

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
percentage pop of knowledge I don't know

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.530 
percentage pop of knowledge I don't know
how<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.959> say<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.319> right<00:03:01.530> but<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:03.060> can<00:03:03.209> assume

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
how to say it right but you can assume

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.790 
how to say it right but you can assume
that<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.260> Tesla's<00:03:04.709> are<00:03:05.459> over<00:03:06.090> here<00:03:06.350> all<00:03:07.350> four

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
that the Tesla's are over here all four

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.580 
that the Tesla's are over here all four
and<00:03:10.069> that's<00:03:11.069> it<00:03:11.280> you'll<00:03:12.269> find<00:03:12.540> out<00:03:12.750> during<00:03:13.470> the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
and that's it you'll find out during the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.319 
and that's it you'll find out during the
attack<00:03:13.800> that<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.310> rest<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.940> bombs<00:03:15.120> are

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
attack that the rest of the bombs are

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.270 
attack that the rest of the bombs are
here<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.690> ears<00:03:15.930> only<00:03:16.140> single<00:03:16.680> bomb<00:03:16.860> stand

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
here and ears only single bomb stand

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.840 
here and ears only single bomb stand
this<00:03:17.670> base<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:17.940> pretty<00:03:18.390> good<00:03:18.600> for<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:19.370> gogit<00:03:20.370> XO

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
this base is pretty good for a gogit XO

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.750 
this base is pretty good for a gogit XO
first<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:22.019> all<00:03:22.110> he's<00:03:23.040> going<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.400> lure<00:03:23.610> the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
first of all he's going to lure the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.789 
first of all he's going to lure the
crown<00:03:23.970> castle<00:03:24.180> troops<00:03:24.540> take<00:03:25.200> them<00:03:25.380> out<00:03:25.530> and

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
crown castle troops take them out and

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:32.539 
crown castle troops take them out and
then<00:03:26.340> run<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.920> golem<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:31.310> basically<00:03:32.310> the

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
then run the golem and basically the

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.759 
then run the golem and basically the
king<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:33.150> can<00:03:33.329> drop<00:03:33.540> out<00:03:33.750> both<00:03:34.049> heroes<00:03:34.500> here

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
king you can drop out both heroes here

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.920 
king you can drop out both heroes here
but<00:03:35.070> basically<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.640> king<00:03:35.850> is<00:03:36.000> enough<00:03:36.269> with

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
but basically the king is enough with

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.600 
but basically the king is enough with
some<00:03:37.110> wall<00:03:37.320> breakers<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:38.070> can<00:03:38.250> get<00:03:38.430> through

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
some wall breakers you can get through

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.550 
some wall breakers you can get through
the<00:03:38.760> wall<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.120> get<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.750> archer<00:03:40.049> queen<00:03:40.320> down

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
the wall and get the archer queen down

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.880 
the wall and get the archer queen down
so<00:03:41.400> once<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.940> clan<00:03:42.120> castle<00:03:42.150> troops<00:03:42.680> is<00:03:43.680> out

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
so once the clan castle troops is out

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.039 
so once the clan castle troops is out
and<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.250> archer<00:03:44.670> queen<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:44.970> down<00:03:45.150> as<00:03:45.329> well<00:03:45.510> you

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
and the archer queen is down as well you

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.599 
and the archer queen is down as well you
can<00:03:46.079> start<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.560> main<00:03:46.739> go<00:03:46.920> hug<00:03:47.070> attack<00:03:47.220> and

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
can start the main go hug attack and

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.640 
can start the main go hug attack and
honestly<00:03:48.359> it<00:03:48.540> doesn't<00:03:48.720> really<00:03:48.989> matter<00:03:49.230> where

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
honestly it doesn't really matter where

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.099 
honestly it doesn't really matter where
you<00:03:49.680> start<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:50.190> attack<00:03:50.299> all<00:03:51.299> you<00:03:51.600> have<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.959> do

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
you start the attack all you have to do

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.590 
you start the attack all you have to do
is<00:03:52.320> make<00:03:52.620> sure<00:03:52.650> that<00:03:52.859> your<00:03:53.340> healing<00:03:53.820> in<00:03:54.420> the

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
is make sure that your healing in the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.530 
is make sure that your healing in the
right<00:03:54.780> location<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:55.609> if<00:03:56.609> you<00:03:56.820> ask<00:03:57.030> me<00:03:57.329> i'm<00:03:57.480> not

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
right location and if you ask me i'm not

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.120 
right location and if you ask me i'm not
talking<00:03:57.930> about<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.320> attack<00:03:58.530> i<00:03:59.000> will<00:04:00.000> try

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
talking about the attack i will try

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.560 
talking about the attack i will try
killing<00:04:02.180> between<00:04:03.799> with<00:04:04.799> towers<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:06.030> in<00:04:06.359> this

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
killing between with towers so in this

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.599 
killing between with towers so in this
way<00:04:06.630> that<00:04:08.090> 44<00:04:09.090> exactly<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:09.870> in<00:04:10.680> this<00:04:10.950> way<00:04:11.160> you

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
way that 44 exactly and in this way you

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.900 
way that 44 exactly and in this way you
can<00:04:11.850> cover<00:04:12.720> pretty<00:04:13.410> much<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.950> whole<00:04:13.980> base<00:04:14.579> and

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
can cover pretty much the whole base and

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.440 
can cover pretty much the whole base and
all<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.660> waste<00:04:15.840> our<00:04:15.989> so<00:04:16.350> that's<00:04:16.859> my<00:04:17.070> opinion

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
all the waste our so that's my opinion

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.160 
all the waste our so that's my opinion
but<00:04:19.190> it<00:04:20.190> doesn't<00:04:20.640> what<00:04:21.090> necessary<00:04:21.300> happens<00:04:21.960> in

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
but it doesn't what necessary happens in

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.070 
but it doesn't what necessary happens in
the<00:04:22.320> attack<00:04:22.530> so<00:04:22.800> we<00:04:23.010> will<00:04:23.130> see<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:23.490> tack<00:04:27.080> so

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
the attack so we will see that tack so

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.360 
the attack so we will see that tack so
starting<00:04:28.620> with<00:04:28.650> true<00:04:29.220> Giants<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.180> hog<00:04:31.370> to

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
starting with true Giants and the hog to

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.330 
starting with true Giants and the hog to
lure<00:04:32.610> all<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:33.030> clan<00:04:33.210> castle<00:04:33.240> troops<00:04:34.340> dropping

lure all the clan castle troops dropping
another<00:04:35.580> hug<00:04:35.910> just<00:04:36.210> in<00:04:36.360> case<00:04:36.570> but<00:04:36.840> as<00:04:37.200> you<00:04:37.470> can

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
see if into Giants with total would be

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.800 
see if into Giants with total would be
enough<00:04:39.750> for<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:40.980> one<00:04:43.460> so<00:04:44.460> now<00:04:45.330> we<00:04:45.390> dropped

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
enough for this one so now we dropped

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.290 
enough for this one so now we dropped
those<00:04:46.410> hogs<00:04:46.770> to<00:04:47.100> get<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.430> bumps<00:04:47.760> as<00:04:47.970> you<00:04:48.180> can

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
those hogs to get the bumps as you can

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.170 
those hogs to get the bumps as you can
see<00:04:48.450> i<00:04:48.480> missed<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:48.930> myself<00:04:49.470> but<00:04:49.770> let's<00:04:50.730> go<00:04:50.910> back

a<00:04:51.210> bit<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:54.200> watch<00:04:55.200> on<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.650> left<00:04:55.890> how<00:04:56.130> he<00:04:56.190> gets

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
a bit and watch on the left how he gets

a bit and watch on the left how he gets
that<00:04:56.790> one<00:04:57.450> hug<00:04:57.980> to<00:04:58.980> detonate<00:04:59.490> that<00:04:59.760> bomb<00:04:59.910> so

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570

that one hug to detonate that bomb so
that's<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.560> good<00:05:01.740> check<00:05:02.040> if<00:05:02.400> there<00:05:02.760> is<00:05:02.850> a

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
that's a good check if there is a

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.020 
that's a good check if there is a
boundary<00:05:03.210> or<00:05:03.450> see<00:05:03.630> on<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.870> left<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.740> bomb

even if you don't detonate a single bump
it's<00:05:11.820> not<00:05:11.970> a<00:05:12.030> big<00:05:12.240> threat<00:05:12.540> if<00:05:12.750> you<00:05:12.870> use<00:05:13.050> your
