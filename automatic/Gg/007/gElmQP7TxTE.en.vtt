00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
think just how I built him turned out

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.360 
think just how I built him turned out
really<00:00:54.059> well<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.989> torsos<00:00:55.559> very<00:00:55.920> similar

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
really well and the torsos very similar

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.369 
really well and the torsos very similar
to<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.600> show<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.840> don't<00:00:58.050> know<00:00:58.289> if

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
to the one on the show I don't know if

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.369 
to the one on the show I don't know if
you<00:00:58.500> guys<00:00:58.649> looked<00:00:59.070> at<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.370> very<00:00:59.609> carefully<00:00:59.850> but

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
you guys looked at it very carefully but

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.609 
you guys looked at it very carefully but
it<00:01:01.379> actually<00:01:01.649> looks<00:01:01.980> really<00:01:02.100> similar<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.619> I

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
it actually looks really similar and I

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.130 
it actually looks really similar and I
