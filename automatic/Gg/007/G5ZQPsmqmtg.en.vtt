00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.469
 samsung galaxy s 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:02:55.680
 I want to show you this product 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:02:57.959

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:07.860
 clicks 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:10.970
 It's a place I used to stay I go 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.970

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.550
 photo and up here in her place 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.510
 one thing that must be done I'm 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.510
 even thinking about making other monster 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.210
 But the business requires a lot of people. 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.580
 Imagine on my channel and not just a game 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.760
 online craft and there are some people already 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.680
 thinking about that the reason but I am 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.360
 so I really push myself pushes 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.710
 much bigger craft I really liked the game 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.910
 calm but I do not want it that my 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.860
 channel frequency of the conventional 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.000
 minecraft which is not the goal of 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.620
 to understand even making a lot of 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.920
 it shows why you in November 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.920
 past 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.860
 Because, well, what's happening is that 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:09.970
 should now December the 11th round 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:12.970
 That's how simple it is to see here. 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.970
 ready 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.079
 Yes, it 's a woman speaking, I downloaded the 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.959
 games in the bronx box that are 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:26.580
 inspired by manifest now he does not 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:30.720
 It has it and would have a floater that lishan 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.630
 agility of you doing things 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:39.389
 others do not have to understand what 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:41.760
 makes the game a little more against what 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.610
 Not so with the etf I'm so 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.950
 with the comment is weak for you so 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.680
 talking and to tell you this because 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.320
 It happens like a reflection there I 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.210
 I'm recording and being served with the 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:05:01.830
 and she is disturbing my 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:04.169
 vision of the game but good the goal here is 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:16.320
 do no any construction is 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:18.360
 only show is you opa to you as is the 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:23.310
 what happens in relation to the price I 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:26.280
 I thought so, honey because why you 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.700
 Do not do everything and manifest yourself only for 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:34.550
 you and you have few blogs and such and 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:39.660
 you are worth maria build understanding 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:42.900
 so I found him to be the price of it 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:47.250
 so saving lina understood to be well 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.740
 sincere you the very beautiful image with 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.680
 You can see there, too. 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:56.160
 well cool you with the silver you 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.800
 can actually do things for 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.700
 destroy for example here is safe 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.700
 the heat 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.240
 such as mature blocks 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:17.070
 I take more but the block but more 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:21.240
 with an auction for example only reported 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.620
 every movie then you get points 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.790
 I find it interesting because I have not seen it yet 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.600
 that does not have the definitive version 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:31.590
 you buy one is for example the option of 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:35.250
 You 're saving the game gave the second test 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:37.710
 There I come here, the brothers, the way 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.810
 You on this blog and you have 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:43.080
 that be great and have open game 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:45.389
 guitar world service and it's always like this 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.460
 I played visible or invisible you need 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:50.910
 tax the beauty 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.100
 I came back here and I do not have the condition 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.360
 save what I already did understood that I 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.490
 I think it's because it has areas as well 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.020
 official version does not have this 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:05.210
 problem is right 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:07.500
 So that's it folks know 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.320
 of this game who had the opportunity to 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:15.479
 download from me 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:17.010
 because it's to like and I think 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:18.780
 the wood is free costs nothing 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:22.640
 we meet people who like minecraft 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.640
 mostly right 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:30.590
 Good, I guess that's it, Dad. 

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:42.020
 the default skin is that there it was a 

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.290
 hug everyone 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.290
 was
