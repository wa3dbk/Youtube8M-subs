today sima back here it's time to look
at<00:00:20.470> this<00:00:20.560> sallow<00:00:20.770> wax<00:00:21.010> milder<00:00:21.390> been<00:00:22.390> filtering

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779

at this sallow wax milder been filtering
a<00:00:22.900> wax<00:00:23.080> I've<00:00:24.009> left<00:00:24.250> it<00:00:24.430> alone<00:00:24.520> for<00:00:24.789> a<00:00:24.849> week

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.990 

see<00:00:29.320> my<00:00:29.439> last<00:00:29.650> video<00:00:29.919> on<00:00:29.980> this<00:00:30.160> there<00:00:30.910> are<00:00:30.970> a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
see my last video on this there are a

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.390 
see my last video on this there are a
couple<00:00:31.179> of<00:00:31.739> blobs<00:00:32.739> of<00:00:32.890> waxy<00:00:33.309> and<00:00:34.920> I'd<00:00:35.920> also<00:00:36.100> put

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
couple of blobs of waxy and I'd also put

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.450 
couple of blobs of waxy and I'd also put
a<00:00:36.430> bunch<00:00:36.699> of<00:00:36.850> wax<00:00:37.059> into<00:00:37.269> a<00:00:37.420> container

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
a bunch of wax into a container

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.970 
a bunch of wax into a container
hopefully<00:00:39.460> hoping<00:00:39.970> it<00:00:40.059> would<00:00:40.589> melt<00:00:41.589> down<00:00:41.830> into

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
hopefully hoping it would melt down into

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.329 
hopefully hoping it would melt down into
one<00:00:42.190> lump<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.620> that's<00:00:44.830> exactly<00:00:45.070> what's

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
one lump and that's exactly what's

00:00:45.339 --> 00:01:08.550 
one lump and that's exactly what's
happened<00:01:06.869> there's<00:01:07.869> what's<00:01:08.050> filtered<00:01:08.380> through

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
happened there's what's filtered through

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.740 
happened there's what's filtered through
the<00:01:08.590> paper<00:01:11.910> looking<00:01:12.910> reasonably<00:01:13.390> clean<00:01:13.600> with
