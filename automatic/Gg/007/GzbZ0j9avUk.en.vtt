00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the coloring I could see it's nice and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.980 
the coloring I could see it's nice and
even<00:01:19.070> after<00:01:20.070> bleaching<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.820> some<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
even after bleaching it some of the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.630 
even after bleaching it some of the
streaking<00:01:22.350> has<00:01:22.619> gone<00:01:22.830> out<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> wood<00:01:23.430> which

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
streaking has gone out of the wood which

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.420 
streaking has gone out of the wood which
I<00:01:23.790> was<00:01:23.909> fearful<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.420> I'd<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:24.950> these<00:01:25.950> streaks

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
I was fearful that I'd see these streaks

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.310 
I was fearful that I'd see these streaks
running<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.060> down<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.390> wood<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.990> think

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
running up and down the wood and I think

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.840 
running up and down the wood and I think
this<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.560> actually<00:01:28.650> looking<00:01:28.890> pretty<00:01:29.220> good<00:01:29.400> so

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.960 

as<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.000> start<00:01:33.360> sanding<00:01:33.750> here<00:01:34.579> color<00:01:35.579> really

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
as I start sanding here color really

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.730 
as I start sanding here color really
starts<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.479> pop<00:01:36.750> out<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:37.979> kind<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.939> been

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
starts to pop out and I kind of been

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.929 
starts to pop out and I kind of been
second-guessing<00:01:40.740> what<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.920> did<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.670> moved

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
second-guessing what I did as I moved

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.389 
second-guessing what I did as I moved
through<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.299> body<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:43.070> black<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.100> brown

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
through this body that black and brown

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.420 
through this body that black and brown
really<00:01:45.299> looks<00:01:45.630> outstanding<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.649> probably

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
really looks outstanding I probably

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.340 
really looks outstanding I probably
should<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:47.939> left<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.360> guitar<00:01:48.720> kind<00:01:49.170> of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
should have just left the guitar kind of

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.859 
should have just left the guitar kind of
at<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.950> state<00:01:50.310> because<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.210> got<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.600> color

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
at this state because you got the color

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.469 
at this state because you got the color
evened<00:01:52.290> out<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:53.490> you've<00:01:53.610> got<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:54.060> quilt

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
evened out and you've got that quilt

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.350 
evened out and you've got that quilt
really<00:01:54.930> popping<00:01:55.409> here<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.880> some<00:01:57.060> ways<00:01:57.240> I

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
why next I've got that read that I

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.980 
why next I've got that read that I
diluted<00:02:59.490> a<00:02:59.700> little<00:02:59.970> bit<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.660> added<00:03:00.810> a

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
diluted a little bit and I added a

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.530 
diluted a little bit and I added a
couple<00:03:01.020> drops<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.800> honey<00:03:02.040> amber<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:03.180> give<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.420> a

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
couple drops of honey amber to give it a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.110 
couple drops of honey amber to give it a
little<00:03:04.050> bit<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.320> a<00:03:04.380> yellow<00:03:04.500> tint<00:03:04.950> because<00:03:05.880> the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
little bit of a yellow tint because the

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.400 
little bit of a yellow tint because the
brown<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.600> leaving<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.930> little<00:03:07.110> bit<00:03:07.200> yellow

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
brown is leaving a little bit yellow

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.400 
brown is leaving a little bit yellow
behind<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:08.480> think<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.810> would<00:03:09.900> look<00:03:10.050> good<00:03:10.230> in

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
behind I think that would look good in

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.160 
behind I think that would look good in
this<00:03:10.560> top<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:11.850> out<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.000> just<00:03:12.270> a<00:03:12.450> tinge<00:03:12.930> of

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
this top so out of just a tinge of

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:22.559 
this top so out of just a tinge of
yellow<00:03:13.470> here
