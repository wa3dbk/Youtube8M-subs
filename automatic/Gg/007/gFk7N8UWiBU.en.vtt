00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.600
 Turn around, I just know that I know nothing. 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.150
 the book is divided between chapters and emi 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.119

 against nic tracks you will have 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.980
 always an issue was born now but it does 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.230
 there you will really have something that 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.060
 happened in the past 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.070
 characters are very well built 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.450
 so you get into their skin and have 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.100
 time that you identify more with 1 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.050
 the time you identify yourself more with the 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.060
 Another for this singer is joking. 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.030

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.680
 her this 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.630
 this is to show the ability that 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.680
 the guerrillas have to drive a story 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.350
 Congratulations as well as already committed death 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.320
 Suddenly girls also lead to a product 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.640
 people need to get out of their heads 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.250
 balanced that book has sex 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.620
 violence and revolted they also have 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.530
 sex and violence knows the difference of a 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.480
 level is already in the approach in this 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.700
 in case the author touches 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.650
 relationship of two people who are 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.350
 together for a long time the child 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.150
 no one tried then in case no 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.350
 adult will be harder rolls a 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.150
 identification 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.070
 now if the person wants and 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.079
 It's not me that was asked because I did not 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.709
 I think that this prevents the person likes the 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.840
 work 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.790
 I read kindle so I will not say anything 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.650
 about the Brazilian edition except 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.220
 by title 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.170
 People, I did not read translation, but if you 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.489
 house has to be portuguese 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.579
 in the middle of the reading show found 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.790
 Exemplary girl expression may have 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:39.250
 certainty that was invented because in the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.530
 original at no time did I find 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.030
 any expression even remembered that 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.459
 You know 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.150
 called a gorgeous highlight 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.040
 home but never of an exemplary copy 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.010
 the one that serves as model example 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.840
 for others I was never the emi and 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.870
 You must agree for more that it ends. 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.020
 liking her and boy is she 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.340
 any other nests but by more than the 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.890
 author has shown a bit of 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.650
 insecurity, perhaps always reinforcing 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.810
 hostile of writing it up for it 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.569
 the brilliant nature that surprises every 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.030
 chapter is a magnificent thing I can 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.010
 talking without spoilers in the end is nothing 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.019
 that arrives so this is it if you liked it
