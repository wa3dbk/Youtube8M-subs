 hello my name is pascal fabio patruno e 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:13.460
 practical taiji quan since 1993 are 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.620
 teacher since 1998 is all mine 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.960
 route took place within the 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.660
 international taiji quan association 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.420
 school founded in the 20s by young 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.850
 samsung to spread the yang style 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.940
 original of lineage family 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.369
 worldwide my teachers are 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.259
 been and still are the master carlo 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.619
 lopez and master choking long the ciccio 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.240
 anna is defined as a martial art 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.600
 internal which means energy 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.820
 which is developed used is not 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.310
 muscular mechanical energy but 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.009
 rather that subtle energy that 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.250
 in alternative disciplines it is known 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.320
 under various names for example 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.920
 simplifying prana for yoga the 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.810
 who for the Japanese c for the Chinese 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.940
 I said simplifying why the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.729
 energy problem is very broad 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.429
 very complex for example in China 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.930
 ancient b was a c for everything there was 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.870
 the smile c 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.049
 the color of a climate of taste 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.450
 however the most important vehicle of 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:23.870
 this energy of this is the air that 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.299
 we breathe under normal conditions all 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.880
 we draw on this energy by eating 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.739
 breathing while living but we are not 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.079
 aware and therefore we fail to 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.440
 to hoard this energy a 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.950
 convey it and then enter as it does a little 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.620
 of its function just comes out and yes 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.450
 dispels one of the arts he teaches to 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.209
 cultivate this energy to your own 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.519
 internal is the surrounding that is part 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.950
 integral to any good tacit can not be 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.290
 shut up if somehow it isn't 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.110
 educated moose conga cic1 indeed 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.269
 means exercise of the method energy 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.190
 energy is there for energy e 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.050
 however it is for the method exercise 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.890
 system etc. 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.790
 the many translations taiji quan means 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.250
 gather great energy 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.040
 concentrate the great energy from 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.920
 means big c energy and that has neither a 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.470
 gather concentrate this was a 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.780
 problem very felt by all 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.870
 ancient cultures that is to succeed in 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.510
 collect the surrounding energy of the 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.500
 cosmo to be able to use it to be able to 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.290
 to live better 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.570
 penalty the takeover and the energies 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.330
 chemicals that are consumed and therefore 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.160
 favor old age and all forms of 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.650
 tiredness with what follows 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.110
 after all these were called arts of 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.300
 long life just because they were trying to 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.880
 to overcome the boundaries and limits of the 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.100
 matter through the use and the 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.560
 perception of this bio energy 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.700
 available everywhere around us 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.520
 the ciccio anna is a joyful joyful art 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.550
 because it is only through the smile that 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.900
 the energy moves the smile 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.270
 distension any distension eliminates 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.730
 contractions and everything can flow 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.800
 especially the liquids there 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.410
 constitute we are made of liquids 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.239
 mainly and if there is no smile 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.209
 liquid does not flow the waters there 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.760
 constitute may not move the 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.700
 the shee is also a slow slow art 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.430
 because it must activate in a waking state 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.880
 the neurovegetative system that usually 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:35.270
 instead active in a paused state of 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.970
 rest and also to convince through 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.700
 this slowness the lymphatic system 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.540
 or the sap to move in his 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.320
 channels 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.600
 it is therefore the path of energy and of 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:52.880
 expression and therefore no hard faces 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:56.040
 barrel fights races challenges levels belts 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.430
 the tcs never break the shackles of the 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.650
 contraction and closure when 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.600
 these do not have a functional function 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.170
 but then why we talk about art 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.750
 martial art here is not the art time 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.590
 to strike or hurt but is the art of 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.770
 create an energy field a field of 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.960
 strength that takes you away from non- situations 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.000
 makes you find yourself in the war 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.070
 if anything the real purpose of not doing the 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.560
 war you teach us not to do the 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.990
 war not being in the war e 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.230
 therefore to render and even the 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.480
 obsolete term every tai ci lessons 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.170
 takes place at different times in different 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.520
 phases 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:41.100
 it starts with a heating dc kunga 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.120
 Taoist exercises and some elements 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.620
 theorist who then comes to flow to 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.690
 be realized in the final part of the 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.660
 lesson where there is the form that is one 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.450
 very long sequence of movements 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.870
 learns over time and the said formalities on 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.870
 food 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.760
 no 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.760
 no 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.530
 to 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.260
 no 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.650
 no
