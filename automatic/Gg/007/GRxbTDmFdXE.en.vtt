00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
crazy as it sounds probably how things

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.460 
crazy as it sounds probably how things
work<00:04:36.199> out

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
work out

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.920 
work out
it<00:04:36.650> really<00:04:36.860> is<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:38.270> wasn't<00:04:38.449> the<00:04:38.659> stick<00:04:38.810> it

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
it really is and it wasn't the stick it

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.879 
it really is and it wasn't the stick it
to<00:04:39.020> him<00:04:39.110> but<00:04:39.199> I<00:04:39.289> needed<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.650> make<00:04:39.770> it<00:04:39.860> a

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
to him but I needed to make it a

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.050 
to him but I needed to make it a
decision<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:42.650> think<00:04:43.099> the<00:04:43.520> best<00:04:43.759> decision

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
decision and I think the best decision

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.129 
decision and I think the best decision
for<00:04:44.990> both<00:04:45.139> me<00:04:45.349> and<00:04:45.380> TNA<00:04:46.070> is<00:04:46.340> that<00:04:46.849> I<00:04:47.139> pursue

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
for both me and TNA is that I pursue

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.839 
for both me and TNA is that I pursue
other<00:04:48.320> things<00:04:48.650> with<00:04:48.949> the<00:04:49.039> Ring<00:04:49.220> of<00:04:49.280> Honor<00:04:49.490> and
