and I don't have anything to wipe this
off<00:04:42.270> on<00:04:42.509> let<00:04:42.750> me<00:04:42.840> see<00:04:42.870> I<00:04:42.960> have<00:04:43.080> a<00:04:43.139> brush<00:04:43.590> like<00:04:43.889> I

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
off on let me see I have a brush like I

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.249 
off on let me see I have a brush like I
said<00:04:44.639> this<00:04:44.729> one's<00:04:44.939> kind<00:04:45.150> of<00:04:45.240> dried<00:04:45.539> up<00:04:45.780> so<00:04:46.050> it's

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
said this one's kind of dried up so it's

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.820 
said this one's kind of dried up so it's
probably<00:04:46.439> not<00:04:46.590> going<00:04:46.949> to<00:04:47.099> apply<00:04:47.819> the<00:04:47.939> same<00:04:48.330> way

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
probably not going to apply the same way

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.550 
probably not going to apply the same way
but<00:04:49.830> let's<00:04:50.009> see<00:04:50.129> if<00:04:50.159> I<00:04:50.250> can<00:04:50.280> get<00:04:50.490> any<00:04:50.699> of<00:04:50.909> it<00:04:51.030> off

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
but let's see if I can get any of it off

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.839 
but let's see if I can get any of it off
yeah<00:04:52.560> it's<00:04:52.710> kind<00:04:52.919> of<00:04:52.979> cakey<00:04:53.400> so<00:04:53.580> I<00:04:53.610> would<00:04:53.819> have

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
yeah it's kind of cakey so I would have

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.459 
yeah it's kind of cakey so I would have
to<00:04:54.060> add<00:04:54.210> some<00:04:54.509> more<00:04:54.719> aloe<00:04:55.560> vera<00:04:55.889> gel<00:04:56.219> to<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.789> but

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
you see how that's taking up so let me

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.839

undertone<00:05:38.750> but<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:40.409> thing<00:05:40.620> I<00:05:40.770> like<00:05:40.979> about<00:05:41.009> it

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
undertone but the thing I like about it

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.209 
undertone but the thing I like about it
is<00:05:41.580> you<00:05:41.940> know<00:05:42.150> once<00:05:43.050> you<00:05:43.139> put<00:05:43.409> it<00:05:43.529> on<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:44.069> it

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:44.219 
is you know once you put it on and it

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.029 
is you know once you put it on and it
dries<00:05:44.610> I<00:05:45.150> mean<00:05:46.139> I'm<00:05:46.259> gonna<00:05:46.349> get<00:05:46.500> in<00:05:46.589> here<00:05:46.860> so

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039

you<00:05:47.159> can<00:05:47.310> see<00:05:47.479> it<00:05:48.479> pretty<00:05:48.539> much<00:05:49.020> stays<00:05:49.379> put

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
you can see it pretty much stays put

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.339 
you can see it pretty much stays put
until<00:05:50.129> you<00:05:50.729> wipe<00:05:50.909> it<00:05:51.089> off<00:05:52.219> so<00:05:53.360> um<00:05:54.360> those<00:05:55.319> are

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
until you wipe it off so um those are

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.519 
until you wipe it off so um those are
just<00:05:55.710> the<00:05:55.860> ideas<00:05:56.430> that<00:05:56.460> I<00:05:56.909> would<00:05:57.240> offer<00:05:57.870> up<00:05:58.229> as

00:05:58.519 --> 00:05:58.529 
just the ideas that I would offer up as

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:00.619 
just the ideas that I would offer up as
maybe<00:05:58.770> a<00:05:58.919> cheaper<00:05:59.250> alternative<00:05:59.460> like<00:06:00.360> i<00:06:00.389> said

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:00.629 
maybe a cheaper alternative like i said

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:02.959 
maybe a cheaper alternative like i said

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.170 
lid and I actually had like a neutral I
look<00:07:38.380> on<00:07:38.530> before<00:07:38.980> I<00:07:39.040> put<00:07:39.280> the<00:07:39.460> glitter<00:07:39.700> over

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.280

top of it but I think this color as you
can<00:07:42.430> see<00:07:42.610> on<00:07:42.760> my<00:07:42.790> hand<00:07:43.270> it<00:07:44.260> would<00:07:44.500> have<00:07:44.650> stood

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:44.950 
can see on my hand it would have stood

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.160 
can see on my hand it would have stood
out<00:07:45.250> even<00:07:45.580> without<00:07:46.480> anything<00:07:46.900> because

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.170 
out even without anything because

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.750 
out even without anything because
there's<00:07:47.320> nothing<00:07:47.650> on<00:07:47.770> my<00:07:47.890> hand<00:07:48.130> no<00:07:48.280> base<00:07:48.520> no

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:48.760 
there's nothing on my hand no base no

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.090 
there's nothing on my hand no base no
nothing<00:07:49.210> it's<00:07:49.930> still<00:07:50.140> a<00:07:50.170> little<00:07:50.380> tacky<00:07:50.800> at

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:51.100 
nothing it's still a little tacky at

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.030 
nothing it's still a little tacky at
this<00:07:51.280> point<00:07:52.170> but<00:07:53.170> it's<00:07:53.350> pretty<00:07:53.590> much<00:07:53.770> almost

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:54.040 
this point but it's pretty much almost

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.120 
this point but it's pretty much almost
dry<00:07:54.600> like<00:07:55.600> I<00:07:55.720> said<00:07:55.780> it<00:07:56.050> stays<00:07:56.320> in<00:07:56.350> place<00:07:56.800> on<00:07:56.980> I

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.130 
dry like I said it stays in place on I

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.190 
dry like I said it stays in place on I
mean<00:07:57.340> we<00:07:57.700> I<00:07:57.880> think<00:07:58.120> any<00:07:58.330> glitter<00:07:58.630> you<00:07:58.810> apply<00:07:59.080> if

00:07:59.190 --> 00:07:59.200 
mean we I think any glitter you apply if

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.570 
mean we I think any glitter you apply if
you<00:07:59.290> start<00:07:59.560> rubbing<00:07:59.860> your<00:07:59.950> eyes<00:08:00.130> going<00:08:00.490> to

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:00.580 
you start rubbing your eyes going to

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.850 
you start rubbing your eyes going to
come<00:08:00.700> off<00:08:00.910> but<00:08:01.570> this<00:08:01.750> stays<00:08:02.020> in<00:08:02.260> place<00:08:02.530> as<00:08:02.770> you

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:02.860 
come off but this stays in place as you

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.040 
come off but this stays in place as you
