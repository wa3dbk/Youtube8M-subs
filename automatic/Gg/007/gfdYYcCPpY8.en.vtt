Minneapolis and we've been testing the
3m<00:00:14.199> flashing<00:00:14.920> the<00:00:15.430> eighty<00:00:15.639> sixty<00:00:16.240> seven<00:00:16.660> and

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:16.779 
3m flashing the eighty sixty seven and

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.900 
3m flashing the eighty sixty seven and
it<00:00:17.199> is<00:00:17.230> really<00:00:17.890> cold<00:00:18.160> out<00:00:18.430> here

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
it is really cold out here

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.780 
it is really cold out here
this<00:00:19.359> one's<00:00:19.630> reading<00:00:20.020> about<00:00:20.470> two<00:00:20.920> degrees<00:00:21.370> and

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
this one's reading about two degrees and

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.640 
this one's reading about two degrees and
we're<00:00:22.210> going<00:00:22.360> to<00:00:22.390> test<00:00:22.630> they're<00:00:22.900> flashing<00:00:23.200> on

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
we're going to test they're flashing on

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.560 
we're going to test they're flashing on
this<00:00:23.860> window<00:00:24.250> here<00:00:24.460> it'll<00:00:24.760> start<00:00:25.120> by<00:00:25.270> pulling

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
this window here it'll start by pulling

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:45.689 
this window here it'll start by pulling
the<00:00:25.660> paper<00:00:25.900> back<00:00:26.260> off

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.819 

as<00:00:46.239> you<00:00:46.420> can<00:00:46.570> see<00:00:46.780> that's<00:00:47.019> sticking<00:00:47.379> really

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
as you can see that's sticking really

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.410 
as you can see that's sticking really
good<00:00:48.039> for<00:00:48.339> these<00:00:48.489> temperatures<00:00:49.149> that's

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
good for these temperatures that's

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.930 
good for these temperatures that's
amazing<00:00:50.109> because<00:00:50.620> not<00:00:50.829> much<00:00:51.010> oh<00:00:51.250> yeah

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940

another<00:00:52.750> bitumen<00:00:53.289> type<00:00:54.960> flashing<00:00:55.960> this<00:00:56.170> is

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
another bitumen type flashing this is

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.560 
another bitumen type flashing this is
one<00:00:56.530> most<00:00:57.100> of<00:00:57.339> you're<00:00:57.519> familiar<00:00:57.789> with

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
one most of you're familiar with

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.939 
one most of you're familiar with
it's<00:00:59.050> just<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.469> black<00:00:59.739> and<00:01:01.229> in<00:01:02.229> these<00:01:02.409> templates

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
it's just a black and in these templates

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.770 
it's just a black and in these templates
not<00:01:03.129> even<00:01:03.339> sticking<00:01:03.579> to<00:01:03.820> its<00:01:03.969> own<00:01:04.119> backer<00:01:04.420> burn

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
not even sticking to its own backer burn

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:17.980 
not even sticking to its own backer burn
so<00:01:05.619> we<00:01:06.490> will<00:01:06.670> put<00:01:06.850> this<00:01:07.030> on<00:01:07.330> here

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.179 

and<00:01:18.860> you<00:01:19.009> can<00:01:19.159> see<00:01:19.369> it's<00:01:19.640> just<00:01:19.909> not<00:01:20.540> sticking

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
and you can see it's just not sticking

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.870 
and you can see it's just not sticking
it's<00:01:22.189> just<00:01:22.430> falling<00:01:22.850> right<00:01:23.210> off<00:01:23.240> of<00:01:23.659> there

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
it's just falling right off of there

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.550 
it's just falling right off of there
these<00:01:25.880> products<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:26.600> have<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.810> have<00:01:27.049> 25

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
these products you have to have 25

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.130 
these products you have to have 25
degrees<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:28.340> have<00:01:28.460> any<00:01:28.610> hope<00:01:28.850> of<00:01:29.119> having<00:01:29.840> them

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
degrees to have any hope of having them

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.820 
degrees to have any hope of having them
bond<00:01:30.409> of<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.799> substrate<00:01:31.509> the<00:01:32.509> 3m<00:01:32.990> product<00:01:33.530> we

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
bond of the substrate the 3m product we

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.639 
bond of the substrate the 3m product we
have<00:01:33.950> great<00:01:34.220> bonding<00:01:34.729> on<00:01:34.909> that<00:01:35.179> and<00:01:35.479> to<00:01:36.409> test

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
have great bonding on that and to test

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.460 
have great bonding on that and to test
this<00:01:37.179> we'll<00:01:38.179> take<00:01:38.360> this<00:01:38.570> section<00:01:39.020> right<00:01:39.170> here

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
this we'll take this section right here

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.960 
this we'll take this section right here
that<00:01:39.649> we<00:01:39.770> put<00:01:39.799> on<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.130> little<00:01:40.340> while<00:01:40.520> ago<00:01:40.759> and

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
that we put on a little while ago and

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:55.740 
that we put on a little while ago and
try<00:01:41.179> to<00:01:41.240> peel<00:01:41.570> it<00:01:41.600> off<00:01:53.770> it's<00:01:54.770> not<00:01:54.950> coming<00:01:55.250> out

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
try to peel it off it's not coming out

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.469 
try to peel it off it's not coming out
actually<00:01:56.750> pulling<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.549> OSB<00:01:58.549> strand<00:01:59.179> board

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
actually pulling the OSB strand board

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.840 
actually pulling the OSB strand board
off<00:01:59.780> when<00:02:00.080> we<00:02:00.229> try<00:02:00.470> to<00:02:00.530> take<00:02:00.860> this<00:02:01.100> product<00:02:01.640> off

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
off when we try to take this product off

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.870 
off when we try to take this product off
so<00:02:02.299> we<00:02:02.840> we<00:02:03.140> have<00:02:03.289> we<00:02:03.830> have<00:02:03.860> good<00:02:04.130> adhesion<00:02:04.490> now

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
so we we have we have good adhesion now

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.370 
so we we have we have good adhesion now
we're<00:02:05.030> going<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.179> try<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.479> pull<00:02:05.780> it<00:02:05.929> up<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.289> was

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.630 

and<00:02:24.150> as<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.420> can<00:02:24.600> see<00:02:24.740> it<00:02:25.740> definitely<00:02:26.040> bonded

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
and as you can see it definitely bonded

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.260 
and as you can see it definitely bonded
great<00:02:27.240> we<00:02:27.960> pulled<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.470> paper<00:02:28.830> wrap<00:02:29.220> off

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
great we pulled the paper wrap off
