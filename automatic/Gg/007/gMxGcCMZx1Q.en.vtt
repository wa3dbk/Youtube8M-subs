to get to this point what we have to do

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.190 
to get to this point what we have to do
is<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.240> case<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.600> concrete<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.110> then

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
is that it in case the concrete and then

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.569 
is that it in case the concrete and then
take<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.439> casement<00:01:49.979> away<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.549> a

take that casement away like it like a
