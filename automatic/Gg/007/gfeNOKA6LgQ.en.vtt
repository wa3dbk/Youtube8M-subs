video of my um DJI naza set up I was

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.750 
video of my um DJI naza set up I was
messing<00:00:10.410> around<00:00:10.680> with<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.100> I<00:00:11.280> was<00:00:11.370> trying<00:00:11.670> to

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760 
messing around with it I was trying to

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.680 
messing around with it I was trying to
figure<00:00:12.030> out<00:00:12.060> how<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.330> could<00:00:13.190> have<00:00:14.690> altitude

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
figure out how I could have altitude

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.130 
figure out how I could have altitude
hold<00:00:15.900> without<00:00:16.379> having<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.570> worry<00:00:18.570> about<00:00:18.930> you

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
hold without having to worry about you

hold without having to worry about you
know<00:00:19.260> when<00:00:19.890> I'm<00:00:20.010> putting<00:00:20.610> rudder<00:00:21.180> inputs

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:21.780 
know when I'm putting rudder inputs

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.540 
know when I'm putting rudder inputs
messing<00:00:22.560> up<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.830> stick<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.280> know<00:00:23.310> maybe

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
messing up the stick you know maybe

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.370 
messing up the stick you know maybe
pushing<00:00:24.030> it<00:00:24.150> up<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.510> little<00:00:24.720> bit<00:00:24.930> or<00:00:25.080> down<00:00:25.350> a

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
pushing it up a little bit or down a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.920 
pushing it up a little bit or down a
little<00:00:25.710> bit<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.980> wanted<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.550> see<00:00:27.539> if<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.750> could

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
little bit I wanted to see if I could

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.100 
little bit I wanted to see if I could
use<00:00:28.110> one<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.410> these<00:00:28.560> switches<00:00:29.810> so<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.869> could

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
use one of these switches so I could

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.759 
use one of these switches so I could
lock<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.350> throttle<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.160> 50%<00:00:33.530> without<00:00:34.530> you

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:34.769 
lock the throttle and 50% without you

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.250 
lock the throttle and 50% without you
know<00:00:34.890> me<00:00:35.129> worrying<00:00:35.550> about<00:00:35.960> messing<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
know me worrying about messing with the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.279 
know me worrying about messing with the
throttle<00:00:37.530> wah<00:00:37.890> I'm<00:00:38.010> putting<00:00:38.399> rudder<00:00:38.960> so<00:00:39.960> here

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
throttle wah I'm putting rudder so here

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:50.750 
throttle wah I'm putting rudder so here
we<00:00:40.409> go<00:00:46.819> you<00:00:47.819> could<00:00:47.999> see<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.359> pretty<00:00:48.600> good<00:00:49.760> now

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
we go you could see that pretty good now

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.250 
we go you could see that pretty good now
what<00:00:50.909> I<00:00:50.940> did<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.549> still<00:00:53.549> have<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
what I did is that I still have the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.340 
what I did is that I still have the
switches<00:00:56.120> I'm<00:00:57.120> still<00:00:57.359> able<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.719> switch<00:00:58.109> from

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
switches I'm still able to switch from

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.949 
switches I'm still able to switch from
attitude<00:00:59.190> mode<00:00:59.459> manual<00:01:00.239> mode<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.780> then

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:00.959 
attitude mode manual mode and then

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:06.920 
attitude mode manual mode and then
failsafe<00:01:01.819> okay<00:01:04.159> right<00:01:05.159> now<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:06.329> that's

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
failsafe okay right now that that's

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.749 
failsafe okay right now that that's
controlled<00:01:07.439> by<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.680> switch<00:01:08.130> right<00:01:08.159> here<00:01:08.549> by

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
controlled by this switch right here by

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.429 
controlled by this switch right here by
the<00:01:08.820> way<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.420> FST<00:01:10.280> h9x

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
the way this is the FST h9x

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.550 
the way this is the FST h9x
top<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:14.399> switch<00:01:14.789> is<00:01:15.180> attitude<00:01:15.659> mode<00:01:16.020> you

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
top of that switch is attitude mode you

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.910 
top of that switch is attitude mode you
can<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:17.009> right<00:01:17.880> there<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.420> an<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:21.479> middle

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
can see right there it's an a the middle

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.029 
can see right there it's an a the middle
is<00:01:22.920> still<00:01:23.640> an<00:01:24.259> attitude<00:01:25.259> mode<00:01:25.909> but<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.240> changed

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
is still an attitude mode but I changed

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:34.639 
is still an attitude mode but I changed
throttle<00:01:29.039> on<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.179> it's<00:01:30.630> locked<00:01:31.079> into<00:01:33.649> 50%

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
throttle on it it's locked into 50%

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.010 
throttle on it it's locked into 50%
throttle<00:01:34.859> so<00:01:35.280> pay<00:01:35.520> attention<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.969> that<00:01:36.530> and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
throttle so pay attention to that and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.929 
throttle so pay attention to that and
I'm<00:01:40.020> gonna<00:01:40.320> switch<00:01:40.649> it<00:01:40.679> to<00:01:40.859> the<00:01:41.039> middle

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
I'm gonna switch it to the middle

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:50.720 
I'm gonna switch it to the middle
position<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.719> this<00:01:44.899> switch<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.700> there<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.119> go

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.610 

that's<00:01:50.850> an<00:01:51.030> attitude<00:01:52.020> mode<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:54.260> how<00:01:55.260> to<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
that's an attitude mode and how to to

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.480 
that's an attitude mode and how to to
bold<00:01:56.060> 50%<00:01:57.060> throttle<00:01:57.590> no<00:01:58.590> matter<00:01:58.830> what<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.190> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
bold 50% throttle no matter what I do to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.620 
bold 50% throttle no matter what I do to
the<00:01:59.580> tatl<00:02:00.710> do<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:02.520> down<00:02:02.820> up<00:02:03.060> down<00:02:03.090> right

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
the tatl do that up down up down right

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.890 
the tatl do that up down up down right
now<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.080> have<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.650> total<00:02:04.980> all<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> way<00:02:05.340> up<00:02:05.840> on<00:02:06.840> a

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
now I have the total all the way up on a

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.850 
now I have the total all the way up on a
transmitter<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.369> stays<00:02:08.810> 50%<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:10.680> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
transmitter but it stays 50% on the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.950 
transmitter but it stays 50% on the
nozzle<00:02:11.570> so<00:02:12.570> if<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.900> put<00:02:13.230> rudder<00:02:13.560> inputs<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.960> don't

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
nozzle so if I put rudder inputs I don't

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.340 
nozzle so if I put rudder inputs I don't
have<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.260> worry<00:02:16.440> about<00:02:16.470> bump<00:02:17.070> in<00:02:17.280> that

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
have to worry about bump in that

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.330 
have to worry about bump in that
throttle<00:02:19.350> up<00:02:19.500> or<00:02:19.680> down<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.920> works<00:02:23.070> pretty

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
throttle up or down so it works pretty

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.280 
throttle up or down so it works pretty
good<00:02:25.220> what<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.310> did<00:02:26.550> with<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.570> went

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
good what I did with that is that I went

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:39.910 
good what I did with that is that I went
to<00:02:33.020> settings<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:35.330> we're<00:02:36.330> gonna<00:02:36.450> go<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:38.210> righto

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
to settings and we're gonna go to righto

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.380 
to settings and we're gonna go to righto
curve<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:43.010> this<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.750> position<00:02:45.750> 1<00:02:47.150> okay<00:02:48.150> that's

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
curve and this is position 1 okay that's

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.010 
curve and this is position 1 okay that's
a<00:02:48.540> total<00:02:48.870> curve<00:02:49.560> it's<00:02:49.770> Regular<00:02:50.190> Decision<00:02:52.220> -<00:02:53.220> I

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
a total curve it's Regular Decision - I

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.890 
a total curve it's Regular Decision - I
have<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.140> flat<00:02:55.410> 50<00:02:56.070> percent<00:02:56.430> all<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.580> way<00:02:56.900> from

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
have it flat 50 percent all the way from

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.650 
have it flat 50 percent all the way from
low<00:02:58.200> 1<00:02:58.680> 2<00:02:58.920> 3<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.520> then<00:03:00.030> high<00:03:01.430> so<00:03:02.430> what<00:03:03.270> happens

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
low 1 2 3 and then high so what happens

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.550 
low 1 2 3 and then high so what happens
is<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.050> know<00:03:04.080> have<00:03:05.040> an<00:03:05.220> edited<00:03:05.940> mode<00:03:06.560> and

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
is that you know have an edited mode and

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.010 
is that you know have an edited mode and
you<00:03:07.950> know<00:03:08.070> I<00:03:08.100> have<00:03:08.370> throttle<00:03:08.760> control<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.450> my

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
you know I have throttle control and my

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.960 
you know I have throttle control and my
left<00:03:10.290> stick<00:03:10.620> but<00:03:11.489> once<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:12.120> put<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.540> in<00:03:13.970> second

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
left stick but once I put it in second

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.440 
left stick but once I put it in second
position

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
position

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.190 
position
it<00:03:15.720> locks<00:03:15.959> with<00:03:16.200> auto<00:03:16.440> link<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:18.020> and<00:03:19.020> all<00:03:19.170> I

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
it locks with auto link so and all I

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.560 
it locks with auto link so and all I
have<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.500> do<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:19.980> want<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.190> get<00:03:20.450> control<00:03:21.450> of

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
have to do is I want to get control of

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.810 
have to do is I want to get control of
my<00:03:21.690> throttle<00:03:22.200> again<00:03:22.320> just<00:03:22.680> flip<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:22.920> up<00:03:23.070> and

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
my throttle again just flip it up and

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.610 
my throttle again just flip it up and
I'm<00:03:23.970> good<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.330> go

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
I'm good to go

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.340 
I'm good to go
so<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:26.010> position<00:03:26.880> 1<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.750> stick<00:03:28.080> is

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
so that position 1 and that stick is

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.150 
so that position 1 and that stick is

how<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.220> do<00:04:04.989> good<00:04:05.989> thing<00:04:06.140> about<00:04:06.260> using<00:04:06.950> this

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
how to do good thing about using this

how to do good thing about using this
switch<00:04:07.340> right<00:04:07.790> here<00:04:08.060> is<00:04:08.270> that<00:04:08.650> it<00:04:09.650> doesn't

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
switch right here is that it doesn't

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.600

you know top middle lower switch whether

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.960 
you know top middle lower switch whether
I'm<00:04:17.329> an<00:04:18.940> attitude<00:04:20.620> add<00:04:21.620> it<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:21.950> it<00:04:22.040> with<00:04:22.220> 50%

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
I'm an attitude add it to it with 50%

I'm an attitude add it to it with 50%
throttle<00:04:23.540> lock<00:04:23.870> or<00:04:24.800> manual<00:04:25.370> I<00:04:25.580> can<00:04:26.360> still<00:04:26.950> hit

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
throttle lock or manual I can still hit

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.620 
throttle lock or manual I can still hit
this<00:04:28.220> switch<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:28.790> automatically<00:04:29.389> put<00:04:29.570> it<00:04:30.020> to

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
this switch and automatically put it to

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.810 
this switch and automatically put it to
failsafe<00:04:32.950> and<00:04:33.950> it<00:04:34.190> sets<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.700> whole

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
failsafe and it sets the whole

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.350 
failsafe and it sets the whole
everything<00:04:35.120> down<00:04:37.150> okay

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
everything down okay

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.659 
everything down okay
so<00:04:39.290> that's<00:04:39.440> why<00:04:39.680> did<00:04:39.919> you<00:04:40.070> go<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.220> throttle

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
so that's why did you go to throttle

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.080 
so that's why did you go to throttle
curve<00:04:41.300> and<00:04:41.660> put<00:04:42.440> it<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.680> 50%<00:04:43.010> and<00:04:43.610> make<00:04:43.850> sure

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
curve and put it to 50% and make sure

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:52.170 
curve and put it to 50% and make sure
your<00:04:45.790> you<00:04:46.790> put<00:04:46.970> it<00:04:47.120> 50%<00:04:47.570> and<00:04:49.090> what<00:04:50.090> is<00:04:50.210> that

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
your you put it 50% and what is that

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.730 
your you put it 50% and what is that
position<00:04:53.620> middle<00:04:54.620> position<00:04:55.070> on<00:04:55.220> this<00:04:55.460> switch

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
position middle position on this switch

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.860 
position middle position on this switch
and<00:04:57.740> then<00:04:57.919> you<00:04:58.100> hit<00:04:58.600> enter

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
and then you hit enter

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.100 
and then you hit enter
saves<00:05:00.560> it<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:01.220> then<00:05:01.340> you're<00:05:01.490> good<00:05:01.700> and<00:05:02.210> you

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
saves it and then you're good and you

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:11.739 
saves it and then you're good and you
can<00:05:03.289> see<00:05:03.590> here<00:05:04.070> on<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:05.600> pitch<00:05:05.840> curves

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:11.749 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:16.059 

so<00:05:12.319> you<00:05:12.439> get<00:05:12.559> its<00:05:12.709> attitude<00:05:13.639> mode<00:05:14.830> that's<00:05:15.830> a

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069 
so you get its attitude mode that's a

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:18.699 
so you get its attitude mode that's a
metals<00:05:16.429> switch<00:05:17.360> it's<00:05:17.839> still<00:05:18.110> an<00:05:18.259> attitude

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:18.709 
metals switch it's still an attitude

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:29.819 
metals switch it's still an attitude
mode<00:05:22.360> and<00:05:23.360> then<00:05:26.529> it's<00:05:27.529> manual

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:29.829 
mode and then it's manual

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:35.619 
mode and then it's manual
so<00:05:30.829> that's<00:05:31.039> attitude<00:05:31.489> mode<00:05:34.360> attitude<00:05:35.360> mode

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:35.629 
so that's attitude mode attitude mode

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:42.069 
so that's attitude mode attitude mode
would<00:05:35.809> 50%<00:05:36.589> throttle<00:05:37.429> off<00:05:38.829> manual<00:05:40.449> and<00:05:41.449> see

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:42.079 
would 50% throttle off manual and see

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:43.749 
would 50% throttle off manual and see
what<00:05:42.229> happens<00:05:42.589> when<00:05:42.739> I<00:05:42.769> flip<00:05:43.099> this<00:05:43.339> back

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
what happens when I flip this back

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:47.979 
what happens when I flip this back
switch<00:05:44.119> up<00:05:44.449> that<00:05:45.229> goes<00:05:45.469> straight<00:05:45.769> to<00:05:46.989> 29

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:47.989 
switch up that goes straight to 29

00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:55.959 
switch up that goes straight to 29
percent<00:05:48.289> which<00:05:49.219> is<00:05:50.860> feel<00:05:51.860> safe<00:05:54.610> so<00:05:55.610> yeah

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:55.969 
percent which is feel safe so yeah

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.779 
percent which is feel safe so yeah
that's<00:05:56.389> how<00:05:56.539> I<00:05:56.629> did<00:05:56.839> it<00:05:57.050> I<00:05:57.469> was<00:05:58.279> racking<00:05:58.759> my

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
that's how I did it I was racking my

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.659 
that's how I did it I was racking my
brains<00:05:59.239> all<00:05:59.539> day<00:05:59.749> how<00:06:00.050> I<00:06:00.079> could<00:06:00.529> set<00:06:01.459> that

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
brains all day how I could set that

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.549 
brains all day how I could set that
throttle<00:06:02.179> lock<00:06:02.360> it<00:06:02.599> in<00:06:02.719> at<00:06:03.019> 50<00:06:03.409> percent

00:06:03.549 --> 00:06:03.559 
throttle lock it in at 50 percent

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:05.679 
throttle lock it in at 50 percent
without<00:06:04.219> me<00:06:04.429> worrying<00:06:04.819> about<00:06:04.909> you<00:06:05.239> know<00:06:05.300> dumb

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:05.689 
without me worrying about you know dumb

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:10.419 
without me worrying about you know dumb
thumbing<00:06:06.169> it<00:06:06.909> and<00:06:07.909> I<00:06:08.419> figured<00:06:08.899> that<00:06:09.429> networks

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:10.429
