00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.530
 hello today we will work with you 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.830
 But on such a suitable manicure with 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.680
 using metal mirrored 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.390
 flag of the board if 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.820
 I have already applied metallic silver in 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.010
 as the main color now apply 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.380
 protective agent on the skin around the nails 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.599
 If you do not have this magic tricks 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.640
 can be used with how much when 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.809
 means dries it changes color and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.809
 You can proceed to the manicure 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.379
 I use plain tap water 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.180
 slightly cool degrees 22 24 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.120
 legs should not be thick they should 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.220
 free to drain from the brush if you have 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.199
 varnishes freeze on the surface of the water so 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.940
 that you don't even have time to make a drawing 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:01.730
 it means that you are too warm water 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.840
 for a good picture you need about 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.479
 12 15 drops of varnish use a toothpick 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.300
 or a needle like me in this case 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.759
 create any drawing after each 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:23.840
 such a line i wipe my needle 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:24.830
 using a regular dry napkin when 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.690
 drawing is ready 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.210
 turn the cup the most 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:34.850
 liked part of the picture to you 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.649
 it was convenient to lower a wadded finger 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.869
 sticks and remove the remaining varnish with 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:43.700
 water surface and take out your thumb 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.720
 remove the protective film it is removed 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.820
 very easy 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.479
 try to do it carefully not to 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.729
 brush off the design of a wooden manicure 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.259
 stick through the cuticle line 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.259
 separating varnish from her 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.729
 flat brush and acetone remove 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.729
 nail polish residues around the nails 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.160
 for water manicure is also suitable 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.489
 excellent adhesive tape to protect the skin around 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.489
 nails 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.990
 remove neatly scotch also trying 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.310
 don't touch the news and wipe the cuticle and 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.680
 if necessary 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.490
