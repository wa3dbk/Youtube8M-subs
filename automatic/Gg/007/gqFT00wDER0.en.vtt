haven't blown my hair out like this in a

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.609 
haven't blown my hair out like this in a
in<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.490> little<00:00:17.789> while<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.270> don't<00:00:18.690> do<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.080> as<00:00:19.320> I

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
in a little while I don't do it as I

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.160 
in a little while I don't do it as I
don't<00:00:20.039> do<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.310> very<00:00:20.340> very<00:00:20.640> often<00:00:21.270> but<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.750> do<00:00:21.869> it

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
don't do it very very often but I do it

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.640 
don't do it very very often but I do it
probably<00:00:23.010> more<00:00:23.369> often<00:00:23.699> than<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.939> guys<00:00:24.119> think

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
probably more often than you guys think

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.689 
probably more often than you guys think
but<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.680> make<00:00:25.920> sure<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.189> I'm<00:00:26.279> really<00:00:26.460> really

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
but I make sure that I'm really really

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.359 
but I make sure that I'm really really
careful<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.720> when<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> do<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.619> know<00:00:28.740> when<00:00:29.340> I

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
careful that I when I do you know when I

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.999 
careful that I when I do you know when I
actually<00:00:29.580> do<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.119> um<00:00:30.500> but<00:00:31.500> if<00:00:31.590> i<00:00:31.650> had<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> put<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
actually do it um but if i had to put a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.920 
actually do it um but if i had to put a
number<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.550> i<00:00:32.850> would<00:00:33.180> guess<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.780> I

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
number on it i would guess that I

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.020 
number on it i would guess that I
probably<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.219> once<00:00:35.579> every<00:00:35.820> two<00:00:36.000> months

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
probably do this once every two months

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.450 
probably do this once every two months
and<00:00:36.510> so<00:00:37.469> I'm<00:00:37.590> starting<00:00:37.950> off<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:38.899> wet<00:00:39.899> hair

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
and so I'm starting off with wet hair

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.490 
and so I'm starting off with wet hair
just<00:00:41.460> what<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:42.140> shampoo<00:00:43.820> my<00:00:44.820> hair<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.480> now<00:00:46.379> I'm
