sneak up on them just going to create an
ice<00:02:54.959> bridge<00:02:55.230> right<00:02:55.470> here<00:02:55.680> go<00:02:55.890> around<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.489> then

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
ice bridge right here go around and then

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.240 
ice bridge right here go around and then
take<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.880> Transformers<00:02:57.650> out<00:02:58.650> from<00:02:59.010> under

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250
