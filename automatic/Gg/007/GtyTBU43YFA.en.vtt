00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 this is the first tutorial in photoshop 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.870
 in which we see how to improve one 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:15.150
 generic photo to give it a depth 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.279
 and a more pleasing color gamut the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.250
 photo is taken with a simple e 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.880
 compact but the result will look like 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.609
 the one obtained with a reflex in this 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.859
 tutorial we will talk about nuances of 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.309
 levels of layer masks and 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.309
 curves 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:44.840
 good vision first we open the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.840
 foto this is the sigma bridge 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:53.090
 or.sa valentia and open ours 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.090
 to photoshop cs you know 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:11.729
 now this photo has no depth 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:16.600
 of very high color we can 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:21.210
 improve saturation by acting on 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:24.700
 rgb channels in particular here 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.049
 the histogram for red that we 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:34.240
 we will change by dragging this 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:40.990
 small arrow we leave it when 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:45.100
 smooth g 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:53.259
 we also do for the green you see with 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:55.890
 if so it is also for the blue as well e 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.940
 courses 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.120
 in this way we have already improved 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.550
 the image that results more wine but 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.289
 we can do more still add 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:14.459
 a second level called curve e 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:19.650
 let's go to give this curved shape to 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:23.820
 they simply by clicking on this 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.640
 point and on this other background in this 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.130
 so we improved the contrast 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.130
 of the photo 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.080
 now let's improve too 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.550
 exposure with a new level 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:43.200
 clicking on the show idea button a 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:47.459
 Pence slight increase slightly 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.239
 the brightness and arrange a little 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.239
 also the displacement 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.519
 here's the shifting outline 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:02.959
 antoni better negative shift 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:10.140
 dark settlers let's see the difference between 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:12.840
 the photo and this then with the exposure e 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.070
 now let's go to improve the sky with 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.420
 a new level of exposure 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:24.920
 in which we will improve the range 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.920
 moving it to 0 30 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.340
 too sorry evening 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.430
 here 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.880
 in this way the sky assumed one 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:46.730
 good correlation on blue however la 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:48.560
 photo is as you see burned but for 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.989
 fix this effect let's go to 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.080
 act on the layer mask that is 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.989
 this is represented by this 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.120
 rectangle white you have to know that in 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.980
 photoshop in layer masks 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.110
 when it is white in the white areas of the 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.010
 applied the adjustment we have 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.930
 just made 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.519
 if we go to paint in the mask of 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.870
 level with black 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:20.209
 we will see that you see the little drawing 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.859
 year just done with the brush yes 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.859
 reflects on our photo simply 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.750
 hiding that setting that 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.120
 we just did 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.380
 that's what we hide all fair 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:41.930
 only the one with the black brush 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:45.350
 but we are not interested in this step 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:51.289
 but back to the initial situation e 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:53.600
 we just want to keep it 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.310
 adjustment we just made 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.169
 the exposure of two who are now there 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.169
 we will name a bird 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.490
 he seems to me at the center only in 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:08.400
 this area as we do click on 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.080
 the layer mask let's go to 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.570
 use the nuances 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.880
 here the nuances are very important 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:22.280
 because in a shade from black to 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:32.300
 radial white that we will go to 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:32.300
 invert we have reversed the shade 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.000
 very well so 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:45.960
 now we are going to apply it this way 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:49.530
 here it is a little too much, but this is what it wants 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:52.170
 and here is the result we gave 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.650
 drama to the sky maybe they can't 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:06:00.780
 maybe even fly a little more 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:04.550
 fossils and we still have it maintained 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:08.370
 a good definition of the shadows of 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:11.910
 of the bridge and the color of the various scratches 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.500
 salt in the background and therefore we have 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:19.080
 improved 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:23.180
 simple picture we see now we put 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:26.180
 all these small card came 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.180
 adjustments 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:39.210
 solution pre selection mood all there 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.789
 inside 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:46.020
 from so a simple photo with one 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:48.509
 camera to a photo a lot 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.819
 more professional 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.930
 that's why if you have doubts or 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:56.539
 for clarification 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.539
 write well in the comments thanks
