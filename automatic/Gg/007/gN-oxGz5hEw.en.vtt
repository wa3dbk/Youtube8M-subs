and welcome to a channel today I have
all<00:00:12.049> generated<00:00:12.530> locations<00:00:12.980> and<00:00:13.129> origins

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
all generated locations and origins

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.220 
all generated locations and origins
gonna<00:00:14.089> be<00:00:14.209> showing<00:00:14.360> you<00:00:14.450> guys<00:00:14.570> how<00:00:14.629> to<00:00:14.839> get<00:00:15.139> to

gonna be showing you guys how to get to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.010 
gonna be showing you guys how to get to
the<00:00:15.320> pack<00:00:15.499> punch<00:00:15.740> machine<00:00:15.919> so<00:00:16.910> yeah<00:00:17.120> I'm<00:00:17.780> sorry

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
the pack punch machine so yeah I'm sorry

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.450 
the pack punch machine so yeah I'm sorry
about<00:00:18.110> the<00:00:18.260> video<00:00:18.350> being<00:00:18.620> so<00:00:18.830> mumbo<00:00:19.160> jumbo

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
about the video being so mumbo jumbo

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.070 
about the video being so mumbo jumbo
just<00:00:19.670> because<00:00:19.880> when<00:00:20.060> I<00:00:20.090> played<00:00:20.539> the<00:00:20.689> game<00:00:20.720> why

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
just because when I played the game why

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.420 
just because when I played the game why
didn't<00:00:21.349> do<00:00:21.410> them<00:00:21.560> an<00:00:21.650> order<00:00:21.800> so<00:00:22.070> I<00:00:22.099> had<00:00:22.220> to<00:00:22.340> add

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
didn't do them an order so I had to add

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.859 
didn't do them an order so I had to add
a<00:00:22.519> like<00:00:22.699> that<00:00:22.880> so<00:00:23.060> let's<00:00:23.240> go<00:00:23.269> move<00:00:23.510> it

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
a like that so let's go move it

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.990 
a like that so let's go move it
so<00:00:24.590> the<00:00:24.679> first<00:00:24.920> generator<00:00:25.279> you<00:00:25.550> will<00:00:25.580> find

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
so the first generator you will find

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.120 
so the first generator you will find
will<00:00:26.269> be<00:00:26.390> in<00:00:26.539> the<00:00:26.660> spawn<00:00:27.019> room<00:00:27.050> now<00:00:27.470> you<00:00:27.980> won't

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
will be in the spawn room now you won't

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.999 
will be in the spawn room now you won't
have<00:00:28.279> this<00:00:28.400> once<00:00:28.670> early<00:00:28.970> as<00:00:29.029> possible

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
have this once early as possible

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.230 
have this once early as possible
generally<00:00:31.009> because<00:00:31.400> you<00:00:31.550> can<00:00:31.699> get<00:00:31.820> a<00:00:31.880> maximum

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240 
generally because you can get a maximum

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.140 
generally because you can get a maximum
of<00:00:32.420> ten<00:00:32.960> of<00:00:32.990> them<00:00:33.410> on<00:00:33.650> by<00:00:34.220> ancient<00:00:34.520> zombie

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
of ten of them on by ancient zombie

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.060 
of ten of them on by ancient zombie
things<00:00:35.420> spawn<00:00:35.690> in<00:00:35.840> at<00:00:35.990> time<00:00:36.200> and<00:00:36.440> it<00:00:36.830> generally

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
things spawn in at time and it generally

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:46.510 
things spawn in at time and it generally
just<00:00:37.220> gives<00:00:37.460> you<00:00:37.580> a<00:00:37.610> bit<00:00:37.790> more<00:00:37.850> points<00:00:45.370> so<00:00:46.370> guys

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
just gives you a bit more points so guys

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.580 
just gives you a bit more points so guys
in<00:00:46.730> spawn<00:00:47.030> during<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.390> have<00:00:47.570> two<00:00:47.810> options<00:00:48.350> you

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
in spawn during you have two options you

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.260 
in spawn during you have two options you
can<00:00:48.890> overtake<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.550> door<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:49.880> generate<00:00:50.210> a

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
can overtake the door to generate a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.790 
can overtake the door to generate a
number<00:00:50.510> two<00:00:50.690> which<00:00:50.930> is<00:00:51.080> to<00:00:51.200> the<00:00:51.230> left<00:00:51.320> of<00:00:51.650> my

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
number two which is to the left of my

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.700 
number two which is to the left of my
screen<00:00:51.860> now<00:00:52.820> or<00:00:53.120> you<00:00:53.870> can<00:00:54.020> take<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.320> door<00:00:54.470> to

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
screen now or you can take the door to

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.830 
screen now or you can take the door to
generate<00:00:55.070> and<00:00:55.160> number<00:00:55.340> three<00:00:55.700> that<00:00:55.910> is<00:00:56.420> to<00:00:56.630> the

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
generate and number three that is to the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.280 
generate and number three that is to the
right<00:00:57.170> of<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.590> screen<00:00:58.870> now<00:00:59.870> if<00:00:59.960> you're<00:01:00.080> one<00:01:00.230> of

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
right of the screen now if you're one of

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.950 
right of the screen now if you're one of
those<00:01:00.350> guys<00:01:00.590> that<00:01:00.650> ask<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:01.040> do<00:01:01.160> them<00:01:01.340> in<00:01:01.550> order

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
those guys that ask to do them in order

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.719 
those guys that ask to do them in order
or<00:01:02.960> to<00:01:03.290> just<00:01:03.500> going<00:01:03.680> to<00:01:03.890> generate<00:01:04.189> a<00:01:04.280> two<00:01:04.489> now

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
or to just going to generate a two now

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.000 
or to just going to generate a two now
obviously<00:01:05.210> you<00:01:06.140> opened<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.560> door<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:06.950> you

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
obviously you opened the door and you

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.560 
obviously you opened the door and you
just<00:01:07.250> keep<00:01:07.430> following<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:08.000> signs<00:01:08.299> there's

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
just keep following the signs there's

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.569 
just keep following the signs there's
loads<00:01:08.750> of<00:01:08.840> signs<00:01:09.140> against<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:09.890> walls<00:01:10.130> of<00:01:10.429> the

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
loads of signs against the walls of the

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:12.999 
loads of signs against the walls of the
trenches<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.210> also<00:01:12.170> I<00:01:12.200> suggest<00:01:12.439> you<00:01:12.740> pick<00:01:12.890> up

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
trenches and also I suggest you pick up

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.010 
trenches and also I suggest you pick up
a<00:01:13.070> shovel<00:01:13.310> you<00:01:13.609> know<00:01:13.729> come<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.030> dig<00:01:14.719> up<00:01:14.869> some

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
a shovel you know come and dig up some

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.569 
a shovel you know come and dig up some
stuff<00:01:15.259> you<00:01:15.469> know<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:15.679> might<00:01:15.950> get<00:01:16.100> a<00:01:16.159> good<00:01:16.399> gun

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
stuff you know you might get a good gun

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.669 
stuff you know you might get a good gun
out<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.789> it<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:16.969> never<00:01:17.090> know<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:17.600> here<00:01:18.439> I'm

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
out of it you never know so here I'm

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.029 
out of it you never know so here I'm
turning<00:01:18.950> on<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.070> generating<00:01:19.969> now<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:21.039> you

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
turning on the generating now and you

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.739 
turning on the generating now and you
have<00:01:22.159> to<00:01:22.249> be<00:01:22.369> careful<00:01:22.729> with<00:01:23.119> this<00:01:23.270> one<00:01:23.329> because

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
have to be careful with this one because

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.260 
have to be careful with this one because
more<00:01:24.170> of<00:01:24.289> them<00:01:24.439> ancient<00:01:24.920> people<00:01:25.280> like<00:01:25.880> spawn

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
more of them ancient people like spawn

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.080 
more of them ancient people like spawn
in<00:01:26.859> compared<00:01:27.859> to<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:28.100> first<00:01:28.369> one<00:01:28.670> in<00:01:28.999> this

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
in compared to the first one in this

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.270 
in compared to the first one in this
form<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:29.869> I<00:01:29.960> think<00:01:30.170> it<00:01:30.350> acts<00:01:30.530> that<00:01:30.829> way<00:01:30.979> for

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
form and I think it acts that way for

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.380 
form and I think it acts that way for
every<00:01:31.609> single<00:01:31.999> generate<00:01:32.719> you<00:01:32.899> do<00:01:34.030> now<00:01:35.030> if<00:01:35.299> you

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
every single generate you do now if you

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.940 
every single generate you do now if you
want<00:01:35.569> to<00:01:35.659> get<00:01:35.810> back<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.200> generate<00:01:36.499> a<00:01:36.590> three

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
want to get back to generate a three

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.620 
want to get back to generate a three
from<00:01:37.130> generator<00:01:37.579> to<00:01:37.819> all<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:38.149> got<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.359> do<00:01:38.479> is

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
from generator to all you got to do is

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.380 
from generator to all you got to do is
turn<00:01:38.810> around<00:01:39.219> go<00:01:40.219> back<00:01:40.249> for<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.789> spawn<00:01:41.060> and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
turn around go back for the spawn and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.309 
turn around go back for the spawn and
follow<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.049> signs<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.560> generator<00:01:43.100> 3<00:01:43.749> again<00:01:44.749> so

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
follow the signs to generator 3 again so

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.489 
follow the signs to generator 3 again so
again<00:01:45.859> you<00:01:46.639> go<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.270> generator<00:01:47.719> 2<00:01:47.929> you<00:01:48.289> want<00:01:48.380> to

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
again you go to generator 2 you want to

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.580 
again you go to generator 2 you want to
turn<00:01:48.649> it<00:01:48.770> on<00:01:48.859> and<00:01:49.899> again<00:01:50.899> this<00:01:51.109> one<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.499> want

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
turn it on and again this one you want

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.289 
turn it on and again this one you want
to<00:01:51.710> be<00:01:51.859> very<00:01:51.889> careful<00:01:52.609> because<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:52.789> think<00:01:52.909> more

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
to be very careful because I think more

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.950 
to be very careful because I think more
spawning<00:01:54.549> and<00:01:55.549> like<00:01:56.030> every<00:01:56.270> generate<00:01:56.569> you<00:01:56.689> do

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
spawning and like every generate you do

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.739 
spawning and like every generate you do
like<00:01:57.409> little<00:01:57.889> higher<00:01:58.159> you<00:01:58.460> go<00:01:58.639> I<00:01:58.909> think<00:01:59.240> more

00:01:59.739 --> 00:01:59.749 
like little higher you go I think more

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:02.919 
like little higher you go I think more
of<00:01:59.959> the<00:02:00.139> ancient<00:02:00.920> zombies<00:02:01.310> spawn<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:02.030> I<00:02:02.719> would

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
of the ancient zombies spawn and I would

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:04.770 
of the ancient zombies spawn and I would
suggest<00:02:03.020> watching<00:02:03.350> your<00:02:03.619> back<00:02:03.740> on<00:02:03.950> this<00:02:04.069> one

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
suggest watching your back on this one

suggest watching your back on this one
you<00:02:05.780> don't<00:02:05.869> have<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.170> waste<00:02:06.319> drama<00:02:06.590> on<00:02:06.799> them

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
you don't have to waste drama on them

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.949 
you don't have to waste drama on them
but<00:02:07.219> you<00:02:07.579> know<00:02:07.819> I<00:02:08.119> would<00:02:08.360> normally<00:02:08.660> just<00:02:08.720> run

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
but you know I would normally just run

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.020 
but you know I would normally just run
them<00:02:09.140> around<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.410> circle<00:02:09.800> so<00:02:10.550> now<00:02:10.670> guys<00:02:10.880> we're

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
them around a circle so now guys we're

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.430 
them around a circle so now guys we're
going<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.209> generate<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:11.540> number<00:02:11.660> 4<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.380> I

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
going to generate a number 4 and I

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.170 
going to generate a number 4 and I
believe<00:02:12.710> this<00:02:12.920> one<00:02:13.130> isn't<00:02:13.520> it<00:02:13.610> jog<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.000> walk

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
believe this one isn't it jog and walk

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.030 
believe this one isn't it jog and walk
you<00:02:14.690> want<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.930> go<00:02:15.020> through<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.620> follow<00:02:15.860> the

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
because the robot will stomp down and

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.240 
because the robot will stomp down and
once<00:03:52.230> you've<00:03:52.320> done<00:03:52.350> that<00:03:52.470> just<00:03:52.590> by<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:53.070> door

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
once you've done that just by that door

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.590 
once you've done that just by that door
for<00:03:53.430> like<00:03:53.520> 1,000<00:03:54.209> points<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.690> belief<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:56.600> yeah

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
for like 1,000 points a belief and yeah

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.910 
for like 1,000 points a belief and yeah
you're<00:03:57.750> right<00:03:57.810> generating<00:03:58.200> number<00:03:58.410> five<00:03:58.620> I

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
you're right generating number five I

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.170 
you're right generating number five I
would<00:03:59.040> suggest<00:03:59.160> getting<00:03:59.430> these<00:03:59.610> done<00:03:59.850> at

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
would suggest getting these done at

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.560 
would suggest getting these done at
lower<00:04:00.450> rounds<00:04:00.930> because<00:04:01.200> at<00:04:01.320> higher<00:04:01.530> arms

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
lower rounds because at higher arms

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.630 
lower rounds because at higher arms
zombies<00:04:03.570> kind<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:03.989> go<00:04:04.380> mad<00:04:04.739> when<00:04:05.100> you<00:04:05.220> try<00:04:05.489> and

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
zombies kind of go mad when you try and

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.170 
zombies kind of go mad when you try and
activate<00:04:06.239> these<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:07.010> it<00:04:08.010> is<00:04:08.400> very<00:04:08.760> dangerous

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
activate these and it is very dangerous

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.210 
activate these and it is very dangerous
so<00:04:09.360> do<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:10.290> over<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.620> lowest<00:04:10.890> round<00:04:11.010> you

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
so do it over the lowest round you

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.600 
so do it over the lowest round you
possibly<00:04:11.550> can<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.770> yeah<00:04:13.770> I'll<00:04:14.100> see<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.489> at

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
possibly can and yeah I'll see you at

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:22.610 
possibly can and yeah I'll see you at
generator<00:04:14.940> number<00:04:15.150> six<00:04:20.959> now<00:04:21.959> guys<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.350> get<00:04:22.530> to

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
generate at number six

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.430 
generate at number six
you<00:04:24.180> just<00:04:24.540> want<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.840> go<00:04:25.020> back<00:04:25.230> to<00:04:25.350> the

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
you just want to go back to the

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.890 
you just want to go back to the
excavation<00:04:26.070> site<00:04:26.100> and<00:04:26.640> take<00:04:27.180> don't<00:04:27.720> go

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
excavation site and take don't go

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.300 
excavation site and take don't go
through<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.350> stairs<00:04:28.620> where<00:04:28.890> we<00:04:28.950> went<00:04:29.130> for

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
through the stairs where we went for

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.159 
through the stairs where we went for
juggernaut<00:04:29.729> and<00:04:29.850> just<00:04:30.360> take<00:04:30.510> that<00:04:30.690> long<00:04:30.930> path

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
juggernaut and just take that long path

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.750 
juggernaut and just take that long path
all<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.560> way<00:04:31.650> around<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.100> you<00:04:32.250> will<00:04:32.370> see<00:04:32.430> the

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
all the way around and you will see the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.969 
all the way around and you will see the
church<00:04:33.120> once<00:04:33.900> you<00:04:33.990> get<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.290> church<00:04:34.560> you

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
church once you get to the church you

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.000 
church once you get to the church you
want<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.640> open<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.780> barrier<00:04:37.229> near<00:04:37.830> these

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
want to open the barrier near these

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.750 
want to open the barrier near these
stairs<00:04:38.430> I<00:04:38.790> think<00:04:39.540> it's<00:04:39.690> like<00:04:40.370> 1,250<00:04:41.370> points

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
stairs I think it's like 1,250 points

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.850 
stairs I think it's like 1,250 points
and<00:04:41.970> you<00:04:42.870> want<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.080> run<00:04:43.229> through<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.620> church

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
and you want to run through the church

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.950 
and you want to run through the church
go<00:04:44.790> through<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.210> like<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.450> break<00:04:45.660> in<00:04:45.840> the

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
go through the like the break in the

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.950 
go through the like the break in the
wall<00:04:46.110> and<00:04:46.350> you<00:04:46.950> will<00:04:47.160> be<00:04:47.729> see<00:04:48.060> generator<00:04:48.450> 6<00:04:48.780> now

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
wall and you will be see generator 6 now

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.740 
wall and you will be see generator 6 now
this<00:04:49.110> has<00:04:49.290> to<00:04:49.380> be<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.590> most<00:04:49.770> tricky<00:04:50.010> generator

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
this has to be the most tricky generator

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.030 
this has to be the most tricky generator
because<00:04:51.750> there<00:04:51.900> is<00:04:51.990> no<00:04:52.140> light<00:04:52.290> escape<00:04:52.620> points

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
because there is no light escape points

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.040 
because there is no light escape points
and<00:04:53.220> if<00:04:53.729> you<00:04:53.820> get<00:04:53.970> trapped<00:04:54.180> in<00:04:54.390> here<00:04:54.570> it<00:04:54.810> can<00:04:55.020> be

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
and if you get trapped in here it can be

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.780 
and if you get trapped in here it can be
really<00:04:55.560> tricky<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.890> get<00:04:56.130> out<00:04:56.250> as<00:04:56.430> you<00:04:56.580> can<00:04:56.669> see

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
really tricky to get out as you can see

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.120 
really tricky to get out as you can see
lots<00:04:56.940> of<00:04:57.090> zombies<00:04:57.210> are<00:04:57.450> spawning<00:04:57.690> so<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.950> nuke

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
lots of zombies are spawning so the nuke

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.790 
lots of zombies are spawning so the nuke
really<00:04:59.550> helped<00:04:59.850> there<00:05:00.290> normally<00:05:01.290> I<00:05:01.350> just<00:05:01.620> run

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
really helped there normally I just run

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.950 
really helped there normally I just run
them<00:05:02.040> round<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.580> generator<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.120> slim<00:05:03.750> said<00:05:03.930> I

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
them round the generator and slim said I

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.159 
them round the generator and slim said I
want<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.710> race<00:05:04.860> my<00:05:05.070> ammo<00:05:05.490> but<00:05:06.240> yeah<00:05:06.360> guys<00:05:06.600> that

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
want to race my ammo but yeah guys that

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.050 
want to race my ammo but yeah guys that
was<00:05:07.320> generator<00:05:07.680> 6<00:05:08.160> once<00:05:08.430> you<00:05:08.550> have<00:05:08.729> done<00:05:09.030> that

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
was generator 6 once you have done that

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.360 
was generator 6 once you have done that
you<00:05:09.690> can<00:05:09.870> head<00:05:10.169> back<00:05:10.410> to<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:10.919> pack-a-punch
