know<00:00:45.090> definitely<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.899> going<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> make<00:00:46.200> it

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
know definitely this is going to make it

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.810

into<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> game<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.160> think<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
into the game and I think it's going to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.139 
into the game and I think it's going to
be<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.320> 360<00:00:49.320> rotational<00:00:50.190> style<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.940> can

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
be a 360 rotational style so you can

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.240 
be a 360 rotational style so you can
look<00:00:51.300> at<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> character<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.289> see<00:00:53.070> all<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
look at the character and see all the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.950 
look at the character and see all the
detail<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.030> i<00:00:54.210> think<00:00:54.329> that's<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> be

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
detail so i think that's going to be

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.200
