00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 if you had to choose my vegetable 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.080
 favorite I could undoubtedly 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.300
 carrot victory scepter 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.370
 think that I like this cut to such 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.740
 point that when I graduated mine 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.870
 friends disguised me as a carrot 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.000
 you will rightly ask but why 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.789
 this bizarre introduction what 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.680
 it's about it because I want to exalt the carrot 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.420
 which will be the protagonist ingredient 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.880
 in the recipe that I suggest today 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.179
 in fact we will prepare a wonderful one 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.660
 rustic loaf without fat with le 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.260
 carrots to prepare the loaf e 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.530
 carrot rustic 400 g are needed 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.219
 of manitoba flour 20 g of yeast of 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.520
 beer 160 grams of carrots cut a 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.149
 julienne then again 9 grams of salt 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.680
 up to 5 grams of sugar and 200 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.210
 about milliliters and warm water 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.559
 so let's start immediately preparing the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.690
 rustic loaf 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.309
 first in a glass crumble 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:11.580
 I love the yeast then we add 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:14.280
 sugar to activate the yeast then 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.850
 a little warm water as we know 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.770
 even the temperature a little dull 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.330
 favors correct leavening 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.970
 we always mix with the usual 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.259
 wooden stick up to complete 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.119
 dissolution 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.100
 now that we have dissolved the yeast 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.600
 the over we are at 100 so I like 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.979
 you see I'm transferred to florida 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.380
 inside a large bowl 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.700
 we can also add the remainder 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.920
 water 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.900
 I advise you if you die nerves aside 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.930
 a little flour if there were any 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.770
 need 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.960
 then the salt then the salt begins to 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.610
 distribute it only on the flour then 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.799
 we avoid direct contact with the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.210
 yeast because we know it can do a little 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:00.540
 interfere with proper leavening 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.030
 as you can see I do not add oil 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.990
 extra virgin will begin a bread without 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:12.390
 fat for that we're here a little 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:15.450
 things now we mix a little and add 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.080
 carrots 160 grams of carrots cut a 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.130
 julienne 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.680
 so in carrots they will give some 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.260
 bread moisture so we can do 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.140
 very well without oil and I assure you that 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.940
 the result will be surprising 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.980
 now let's continue to mix a little with the 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.410
 wooden spoon and then proceed 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:40.110
 human as usual are about 5 minutes 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.200
 that we continue to work well 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.430
 the dough to favor therefore 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.980
 gluten information in cooking la 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.160
 ball must be a bit sticky like 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.780
 see this is the perfect consistency 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:00.959
 ok we even slammed it a little bit 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.989
 to make a soft product 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.690
 end we work another bit 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.209
 then we will put it to rise in a 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.360
 warm environment possibly also 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:17.579
 damp inside a mold with 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.700
 18 cm diameter we shape a 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:25.140
 little ball 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.250
 here without the areas or not the pan 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.690
 we need it 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.880
 let's go and let her rest 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.079
 about an hour are when it will become 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:39.140
 nice swells first but let's make a 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.140
 cross cut on the loaf as well 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.019
 perfect things then avoiding the cross 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.170
 it will open after about an hour of 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.540
 rising as you can see the bread 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.329
 it's super leavened and now let's go 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.120
 then to cook it sustained temperature 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.100
 then 220 degrees for about 15 minutes 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.750
 then then passed these 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.150
 fifteen minutes go down 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.760
 slightly the temperature to around 190 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.519
 degrees and continue cooking for others 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.980
 15 minutes then see you later for the 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.930
 final result but beware of 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.060
 shifts because this bread a lot 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.329
 delicate and if you don't move too much 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.780
 quickly collapses after about 35 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.330
 40 minutes of cooking the beautiful loaf 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.990
 carrot fat-free and ready for 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.210
 to be 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.639
 the ideal novelties to eat the types of 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.069
 na with a teaspoon of honey on top for 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.630
 a nutritious sample breakfast 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.630
 energetic in the name of wellness
