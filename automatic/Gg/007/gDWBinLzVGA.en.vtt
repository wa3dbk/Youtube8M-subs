00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.680 
if you know it's October first don't
panic<00:00:56.489> if<00:00:56.610> there's<00:00:56.820> still<00:00:57.030> no<00:00:57.180> new<00:00:57.360> videos

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
panic if there's still no new videos

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.209 
panic if there's still no new videos
like<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.350> said<00:00:58.410> about<00:00:58.710> two<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.010> three<00:00:59.039> weeks

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
it'll be a good MMO although my

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.400 
it'll be a good MMO although my
suspicion<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:13.020> that

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
suspicion is is that

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.870 
suspicion is is that
the<00:02:13.560> kind<00:02:13.740> of<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:13.860> memo<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.370> only<00:02:14.580> play<00:02:14.820> for

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
the kind of a memo that I only play for

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.160 
the kind of a memo that I only play for
three<00:02:15.210> months<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.600> then<00:02:15.720> end<00:02:15.900> up<00:02:15.960> quitting

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
three months and then end up quitting

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.930 
three months and then end up quitting
out<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.530> boredom<00:02:16.860> hopefully<00:02:17.460> that's<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
out of boredom hopefully that's not the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.310 
out of boredom hopefully that's not the
case<00:02:18.090> hopefully<00:02:18.660> it's<00:02:18.810> awesome<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.230> amazing

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320
