the leak down tester still in the leak

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.230 
the leak down tester still in the leak
down<00:00:10.110> tester<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:11.280> made<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:12.000> other<00:00:12.120> day

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
down tester that we made the other day

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.120 
down tester that we made the other day
and<00:00:12.840> we're<00:00:13.170> going<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.380> show<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.590> how<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.860> use

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
and we're going to show you how to use

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.740 
and we're going to show you how to use
that<00:00:15.199> I've<00:00:16.199> already<00:00:16.590> taken<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.210> core<00:00:18.210> out<00:00:18.690> of

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
that I've already taken the core out of

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.950 
that I've already taken the core out of
the<00:00:19.590> hose<00:00:20.039> here<00:00:20.580> off<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.000> my<00:00:21.539> compression

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
the hose here off of my compression

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.519 
the hose here off of my compression
tester<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:22.590> we're<00:00:22.740> ready<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.100> go

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
tester so we're ready to go

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.920 
tester so we're ready to go
now<00:00:25.529> we're<00:00:25.710> going<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.920> be<00:00:26.039> using<00:00:26.250> 100<00:00:26.910> psi<00:00:27.599> at

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
now we're going to be using 100 psi at

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.349 
now we're going to be using 100 psi at
the<00:00:28.230> tester<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.519> first<00:00:29.789> thing<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.210> to

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
the tester so the first thing we have to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.450 
the tester so the first thing we have to
do<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.810> go<00:00:31.260> over<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> regulator<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.189> our

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
do is go over to the regulator on our

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.360 
do is go over to the regulator on our
feed<00:00:32.759> line<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.570> we<00:00:33.899> want<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:34.290> ten<00:00:34.739> pounds

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
feed line and we want to go ten pounds

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.720 
feed line and we want to go ten pounds
over<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.380> so<00:00:37.850> turn<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.879> up<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> hundred<00:00:40.230> and

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
over that so turn it up to a hundred and

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:49.029 
over that so turn it up to a hundred and
ten<00:00:45.469> person<00:00:46.469> my<00:00:46.620> trusty<00:00:47.520> pump<00:00:48.030> plow<00:00:48.239> for<00:00:48.539> this

ten person my trusty pump plow for this

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.590 
ten person my trusty pump plow for this
procedure<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.879> any<00:00:51.149> vehicle

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
procedure you can do this on any vehicle

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.110 
procedure you can do this on any vehicle
of<00:00:51.690> course<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> cylinder<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.910> first

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
of course with a cylinder the first

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.880 
of course with a cylinder the first
thing<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.719> need<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.680> get<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
thing we need to do is just get the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.610 
thing we need to do is just get the
engine<00:00:56.820> warm<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.360> don't<00:00:57.600> want<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.050> heat<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.379> up

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
engine warm we don't want to heat it up

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.740 
engine warm we don't want to heat it up
to<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.280> hot<00:00:59.910> temperature<00:01:00.390> because<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.660> never

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
to a hot temperature because you never

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.240 
to a hot temperature because you never
want<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.050> take<00:01:01.260> your<00:01:01.379> spark<00:01:01.680> plugs<00:01:01.980> out<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
want to take your spark plugs out of the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.090 
want to take your spark plugs out of the
hot<00:01:02.399> engine<00:01:02.899> now<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.960> next<00:01:04.260> thing<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.890> need<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
hot engine now the next thing we need to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.580 
hot engine now the next thing we need to
do<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.729> take<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:06.630> one<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> spark<00:01:07.320> plugs

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
do is take out one of the spark plugs

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
do is take out one of the spark plugs
and<00:01:08.330> we<00:01:09.330> need<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.840> find<00:01:10.170> top<00:01:10.950> dead<00:01:11.220> center<00:01:11.580> on

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and we need to find top dead center on

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
and we need to find top dead center on
the<00:01:11.760> cylinder<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.689> want<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> cylinder<00:01:13.409> up<00:01:13.650> on

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the cylinder you want the cylinder up on

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.969 
the cylinder you want the cylinder up on
top<00:01:14.430> dead<00:01:14.640> center<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.780> you're<00:01:16.350> working<00:01:16.590> on

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
top dead center now if you're working on

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.950 
top dead center now if you're working on
a<00:01:17.040> standard<00:01:17.670> shift<00:01:17.880> car<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.420> don't<00:01:18.600> really

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
a standard shift car you don't really

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.140 
a standard shift car you don't really
need<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.710> top<00:01:20.100> dead<00:01:20.340> center<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.000> can

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
need to be on top dead center you can

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.270 
need to be on top dead center you can
just<00:01:21.330> put<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.750> gear<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.680> can<00:01:22.830> lock<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
just put it in gear and you can lock the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.859 
just put it in gear and you can lock the
engine<00:01:23.610> down<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.060> way<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.630> when<00:01:24.780> you

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
engine down that way because when you

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.560 
engine down that way because when you
put<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.380> air<00:01:25.680> pressure<00:01:26.280> into<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.090> cylinder

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
put the air pressure into the cylinder

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.600 
put the air pressure into the cylinder
it's<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.960> want<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.259> push<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:29.159> cylinder

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
it's going to want to push the cylinder

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.810 
it's going to want to push the cylinder
over<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:30.720> most<00:01:31.229> cars<00:01:31.650> are<00:01:31.860> automatics<00:01:32.610> so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
over but most cars are automatics so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.010 
over but most cars are automatics so
we're<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.180> be<00:01:33.360> doing<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.960> way

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
we're going to be doing it this way

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.530 
we're going to be doing it this way
we're<00:01:34.799> going<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.250> bring<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.030> top<00:01:36.270> dead

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
we're going to bring it up the top dead

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.490 
we're going to bring it up the top dead
center<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:38.009> first<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.460> need<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:39.140> put<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.259> our

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
center so first we need to put in our

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.240 
center so first we need to put in our
hose<00:01:40.860> here<00:01:42.380> already<00:01:43.380> taking<00:01:43.710> out<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> spark

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
hose here already taking out the spark

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.080 
hose here already taking out the spark
plug<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:46.500> we're<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> do<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.280> we're

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
plug and what we're going to do is we're

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.240 
plug and what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.270> turn<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.750> engine<00:01:48.899> over<00:01:49.409> by<00:01:49.740> hand

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
going to turn the engine over by hand

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.810 
going to turn the engine over by hand
and<00:01:50.520> feel<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.450> pressure<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:53.159> cylinder

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and feel the pressure of the cylinder

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.420 
and feel the pressure of the cylinder
then<00:01:54.060> we'll<00:01:54.240> know<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:55.350> we're<00:01:55.649> coming<00:01:56.040> up<00:01:56.310> to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
then we'll know that we're coming up to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.270 
then we'll know that we're coming up to
top<00:01:57.240> dead<00:01:57.540> center

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.220 

okay<00:02:04.300> right<00:02:05.300> there<00:02:05.540> I<00:02:05.810> feel<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.320> pressure

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.230 
okay right there I feel the pressure

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.330 
okay right there I feel the pressure
next<00:02:09.230> thing<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.410> want<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.590> do<00:02:09.680> is<00:02:09.800> remove<00:02:10.100> that

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
next thing you want to do is remove that

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.290 
next thing you want to do is remove that
hose<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:11.860> I'm<00:02:12.860> going<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.160> be<00:02:13.280> inserting<00:02:14.150> a

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
hose and I'm going to be inserting a

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.680 
hose and I'm going to be inserting a
wooden<00:02:14.840> dowel<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:16.030> through<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.180> spark<00:02:17.450> plug

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
wooden dowel in through the spark plug

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.570 
wooden dowel in through the spark plug
hole<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.110> can<00:02:18.470> know<00:02:18.740> when<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.100> piston<00:02:19.490> is

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
hole so I can know when the piston is

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.910 
hole so I can know when the piston is
exactly<00:02:20.180> on<00:02:20.390> top<00:02:20.660> then<00:02:20.870> set<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.320> now<00:02:21.740> I'm<00:02:21.800> going

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
exactly on top then set it now I'm going

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.960 
exactly on top then set it now I'm going
to<00:02:22.010> rotate<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.550> engine<00:02:23.260> look<00:02:24.260> at<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.560> dowel

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
to rotate the engine look at the dowel

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.120 
to rotate the engine look at the dowel
it's<00:02:25.970> moving<00:02:26.600> it's<00:02:26.930> moving<00:02:29.320> it<00:02:30.320> went<00:02:30.590> past<00:02:30.860> a

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
it's moving it's moving it went past a

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.970 
it's moving it's moving it went past a
little<00:02:31.400> bit<00:02:32.050> right<00:02:33.050> there

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
little bit right there

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.180 
little bit right there
piston<00:02:34.670> should<00:02:34.820> be<00:02:34.910> right<00:02:35.300> at<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:36.650> top<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:36.920> its

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
piston should be right at the top of its

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:49.390 
piston should be right at the top of its
stroke<00:02:38.980> okay<00:02:39.980> now<00:02:40.370> we<00:02:40.430> can<00:02:40.580> put<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.850> hose<00:02:41.060> in

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:57.560 

well<00:02:52.130> we<00:02:53.130> want<00:02:53.430> our<00:02:53.640> regulator<00:02:55.760> back<00:02:56.760> all<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
well we want our regulator back all the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.810 
well we want our regulator back all the
way<00:02:57.950> counterclockwise<00:03:01.400> before<00:03:02.400> we<00:03:02.520> put<00:03:02.730> our

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
way counterclockwise before we put our

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.270 
way counterclockwise before we put our
air<00:03:03.300> on<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:04.320> we're<00:03:04.440> going<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.650> do<00:03:04.830> is<00:03:05.010> going<00:03:05.190> to

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
air on and we're going to do is going to

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.310 
air on and we're going to do is going to
turn<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.550> regulator<00:03:05.970> up<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.080> we're<00:03:07.170> going<00:03:07.260> to

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
turn the regulator up and we're going to

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.760 
turn the regulator up and we're going to
bring<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.680> pressure<00:03:08.190> on<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.390> gauge<00:03:09.630> up<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.740> a

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
bring the pressure on the gauge up to a

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.300 
bring the pressure on the gauge up to a
hundred<00:03:11.750> pounds<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.070> then<00:03:14.070> we're<00:03:14.160> going<00:03:14.280> to

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
hundred pounds and then we're going to

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.180 
hundred pounds and then we're going to
connect<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.330> hose<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:16.040> what<00:03:17.040> we're

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
connect it to the hose and what we're

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.900 
connect it to the hose and what we're
looking<00:03:17.520> for<00:03:17.550> is<00:03:18.230> where<00:03:19.340> hopefully<00:03:20.340> we<00:03:20.670> want

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
looking for is where hopefully we want

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.540 
looking for is where hopefully we want
to<00:03:21.000> see<00:03:21.240> no<00:03:21.900> more<00:03:22.170> than<00:03:22.860> 10%<00:03:23.280> leakage<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.960> if<00:03:25.290> it

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
to see no more than 10% leakage so if it

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:33.230 
to see no more than 10% leakage so if it
goes<00:03:26.550> down<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:27.150> 90<00:03:28.190> psi<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.670> would<00:03:29.880> be<00:03:30.000> 10%<00:03:32.240> so

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
goes down to 90 psi that would be 10% so

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:48.140 
goes down to 90 psi that would be 10% so
that's<00:03:33.480> what<00:03:33.690> we're<00:03:33.810> looking<00:03:34.050> for<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:48.000> as

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
that's what we're looking for and as

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.500 
that's what we're looking for and as
soon<00:03:48.450> as<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:49.430> put<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.460> on<00:03:50.880> you<00:03:51.090> want<00:03:51.240> to<00:03:51.330> take

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
soon as you put that on you want to take

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.030 
soon as you put that on you want to take
a<00:03:51.540> reading<00:03:52.020> and<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.590> are<00:03:52.620> done<00:03:54.290> okay<00:03:55.290> up<00:03:55.890> to

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
a reading and you are done okay up to

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:03.559 
a reading and you are done okay up to
100<00:03:56.430> psi<00:03:57.180> let's<00:03:57.720> see<00:03:57.989> what<00:03:58.140> happens

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.280 

okay<00:04:04.569> man<00:04:05.140> we<00:04:05.290> got<00:04:05.410> a<00:04:05.440> lot<00:04:05.620> of<00:04:05.650> leakage<00:04:06.069> here

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
okay man we got a lot of leakage here

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:21.230 
okay man we got a lot of leakage here
for<00:04:08.290> at<00:04:08.590> forty<00:04:12.300> this<00:04:13.300> engine<00:04:13.810> is<00:04:13.989> very<00:04:14.500> old

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:21.240 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.070 

okay<00:04:22.240> let's<00:04:23.139> try<00:04:23.350> that<00:04:23.470> again<00:04:23.680> make<00:04:24.370> sure

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
okay let's try that again make sure

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.860 
okay let's try that again make sure
we're<00:04:26.080> reading<00:04:26.380> what's<00:04:26.560> correct<00:04:27.570> all<00:04:28.570> right

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
we're reading what's correct all right

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.530 
we're reading what's correct all right
it<00:04:29.050> needle<00:04:29.500> went<00:04:29.650> down<00:04:29.889> that<00:04:30.699> came<00:04:30.970> back<00:04:31.240> up

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
it needle went down that came back up

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.770 
it needle went down that came back up
now<00:04:32.500> it's<00:04:32.680> stabilizing<00:04:33.510> at<00:04:34.510> 40<00:04:35.110> psi<00:04:36.570> okay<00:04:37.570> now

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
now it's stabilizing at 40 psi okay now

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.960 
now it's stabilizing at 40 psi okay now
I<00:04:37.810> want<00:04:38.139> a<00:04:38.229> pinpoint<00:04:38.830> where<00:04:39.220> that<00:04:39.400> leakage<00:04:39.850> is

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
I want a pinpoint where that leakage is

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.610 
I want a pinpoint where that leakage is
occurring<00:04:40.450> so<00:04:41.050> I'm<00:04:41.110> going<00:04:41.260> to<00:04:41.320> use<00:04:41.440> my

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
occurring so I'm going to use my

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.460 
occurring so I'm going to use my
stethoscope<00:04:41.919> here<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:46.570> I'm<00:04:47.080> going<00:04:47.290> to<00:04:47.350> go

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
stethoscope here and I'm going to go

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.460 
stethoscope here and I'm going to go
into<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:48.070> exhaust<00:04:48.490> pipe<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:53.080> I'm<00:04:53.320> going<00:04:53.440> to

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
into the exhaust pipe and I'm going to

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.920 
into the exhaust pipe and I'm going to
go<00:04:53.590> into<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.950> carburetor<00:04:54.400> or<00:04:54.789> you<00:04:55.660> can<00:04:55.780> go

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
go into the carburetor or you can go

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.060 
go into the carburetor or you can go
into<00:04:56.110> your<00:04:56.229> throttle<00:04:56.740> body<00:04:56.950> if<00:04:57.160> you<00:04:57.250> have<00:04:57.460> it

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
into your throttle body if you have it

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.029 
into your throttle body if you have it
and<00:05:00.070> I'm<00:05:00.310> going<00:05:00.400> to<00:05:00.490> take<00:05:00.700> out<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.090> dipstick

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
and I'm going to take out the dipstick

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:12.520 
and I'm going to take out the dipstick
check<00:05:03.090> there

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.300 

and<00:05:14.080> most<00:05:15.080> of<00:05:15.200> the<00:05:15.290> air<00:05:15.470> is<00:05:15.770> definitely<00:05:16.070> coming

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
and most of the air is definitely coming

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.720 
and most of the air is definitely coming
out<00:05:16.730> the<00:05:16.940> exhaust<00:05:17.240> pipe<00:05:17.710> so<00:05:18.710> we<00:05:19.250> have<00:05:19.430> a<00:05:19.460> lot<00:05:19.700> of

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
out the exhaust pipe so we have a lot of

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.630 
out the exhaust pipe so we have a lot of
leakage<00:05:20.240> in<00:05:20.540> our<00:05:20.960> exhaust<00:05:21.320> valves<00:05:22.990> and<00:05:24.640> you

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
leakage in our exhaust valves and you

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.690 
leakage in our exhaust valves and you
can<00:05:25.790> also<00:05:26.150> check<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.170> coolant<00:05:27.740> take<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:28.430> cap

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
can also check the coolant take the cap

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.780 
can also check the coolant take the cap
off<00:05:28.880> the<00:05:29.090> coolant<00:05:29.420> and<00:05:29.620> see<00:05:30.620> if<00:05:30.800> you<00:05:31.070> you're

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
off the coolant and see if you you're

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.910 
off the coolant and see if you you're
having<00:05:32.150> bubbles<00:05:32.570> coming<00:05:33.200> in<00:05:33.290> to<00:05:33.380> coolant<00:05:33.770> and

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
having bubbles coming in to coolant and

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.070 
having bubbles coming in to coolant and
that<00:05:34.040> would<00:05:34.220> suggest<00:05:34.730> that<00:05:35.600> you<00:05:35.900> have<00:05:36.020> a

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
that would suggest that you have a

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.850 
that would suggest that you have a
problem<00:05:36.410> most<00:05:37.040> likely<00:05:37.430> with<00:05:37.550> the<00:05:37.580> head<00:05:37.790> gasket

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.400 

so<00:05:43.390> 40<00:05:44.390> psi<00:05:45.080> would<00:05:45.470> be<00:05:45.680> 60%<00:05:46.669> leakage<00:05:47.660> that's

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
so 40 psi would be 60% leakage that's

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.830 
so 40 psi would be 60% leakage that's
not<00:05:48.770> very<00:05:49.010> good<00:05:49.310> but<00:05:49.970> you<00:05:50.120> got<00:05:50.150> to<00:05:50.330> take<00:05:50.510> into<00:05:50.690> a

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
not very good but you got to take into a

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.970 
not very good but you got to take into a
cow<00:05:51.850> this<00:05:52.850> volkswagen<00:05:53.690> is<00:05:53.950> like<00:05:54.950> a<00:05:55.040> 74<00:05:56.980> they

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
cow this volkswagen is like a 74 they

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.760 
cow this volkswagen is like a 74 they
never<00:05:58.220> had<00:05:58.460> any<00:05:58.669> real<00:05:59.510> head<00:05:59.870> gaskets<00:06:00.440> on<00:06:00.620> them

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
never had any real head gaskets on them

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.550 
never had any real head gaskets on them
and<00:06:01.390> the<00:06:02.390> course<00:06:02.630> would<00:06:02.810> probably<00:06:03.200> leak<00:06:03.380> and

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
and the course would probably leak and

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:12.730 
and the course would probably leak and
by<00:06:03.680> the<00:06:03.740> valves<00:06:04.460> the<00:06:04.790> rings<00:06:07.720> so<00:06:10.180> anyways<00:06:11.740> that

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
by the valves the rings so anyways that

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.820 
by the valves the rings so anyways that
is<00:06:12.980> the<00:06:13.070> leak<00:06:13.490> down<00:06:13.730> test<00:06:14.380> so<00:06:15.380> that's<00:06:15.620> all

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
is the leak down test so that's all

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.950 
is the leak down test so that's all
there<00:06:15.980> is<00:06:16.040> to<00:06:16.310> doing<00:06:16.550> a<00:06:16.640> leak<00:06:16.850> down<00:06:17.090> test<00:06:17.510> on

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
there is to doing a leak down test on

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:25.879 
there is to doing a leak down test on
your<00:06:18.380> automotive<00:06:18.740> engine

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:25.889 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.840 

you

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.590 

okay<00:06:30.850> now

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
okay now

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.470 
okay now
hose<00:06:31.870> back<00:06:32.320> in<00:06:33.750> yep<00:06:34.750> in<00:06:34.960> the<00:06:35.110> right<00:06:35.260> way
