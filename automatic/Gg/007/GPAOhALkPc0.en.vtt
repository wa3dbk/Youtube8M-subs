improve<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.370> performance<00:01:03.550> and<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.619> if<00:01:05.800> they

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
improve the performance and so if they

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.920

Toby you can use the smartphone to to
the<00:01:50.149> overclocking<00:01:50.659> so<00:01:51.289> you<00:01:51.350> don't<00:01:51.649> have<00:01:51.770> to

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
the overclocking so you don't have to

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.400 
the overclocking so you don't have to
enter<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.399> hallways

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.170 

it's<00:01:57.410> a<00:01:57.560> daughter<00:01:57.830> card<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.170> because<00:02:00.170> on<00:02:00.680> this

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
it's a daughter card and because on this

it's a daughter card and because on this
general<00:02:02.180> motherboard<00:02:02.690> if<00:02:03.530> we<00:02:04.370> want<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.670> go<00:02:04.850> 80

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
general motherboard if we want to go 80

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.680 
general motherboard if we want to go 80
I<00:02:05.210> we<00:02:05.570> need<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.290> medium<00:02:06.980> for<00:02:07.220> 200<00:02:07.970> I<00:02:08.180> see<00:02:08.540> our

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
I we need and a medium for 200 I see our

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.800 
I we need and a medium for 200 I see our
goal<00:02:08.990> but<00:02:09.590> under<00:02:10.130> our<00:02:10.250> testing<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.330> effort

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
goal but under our testing the effort

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.890 
goal but under our testing the effort
200<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.130> chip<00:02:13.400> will<00:02:13.820> delay<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.270> graphics

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
200 I the chip will delay the graphics

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.110 
200 I the chip will delay the graphics
performance

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
performance

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.589 

so<00:02:17.659> it<00:02:17.930> shows<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.409> put<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.860> Empress<00:02:19.299> 200<00:02:20.299> chip

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
so it shows to put the Empress 200 chip

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.430 
so it shows to put the Empress 200 chip
on<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.080> total<00:02:21.650> card<00:02:21.920> here<00:02:22.930> so<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.080> see<00:02:24.290> if

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
on the total card here so you see if

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.649 
on the total card here so you see if
they<00:02:24.680> want<00:02:25.099> to<00:02:25.159> choose<00:02:25.489> use<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.970> for<00:02:26.150> work<00:02:26.299> so<00:02:26.629> I

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
they want to choose use it for work so I

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.080 
they want to choose use it for work so I
don't<00:02:27.349> need<00:02:27.470> two<00:02:27.739> spoons<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.099> this<00:02:28.280> total<00:02:28.849> card

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
don't need two spoons of this total card

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.080 
don't need two spoons of this total card
on<00:02:29.360> this<00:02:29.659> motherboard<00:02:30.200> if<00:02:31.190> they<00:02:31.430> only<00:02:31.610> use<00:02:31.909> me
