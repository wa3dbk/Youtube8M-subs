and<00:00:51.000> carefully<00:00:51.570> roll<00:00:51.809> them<00:00:52.020> onto<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.350> wooden

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
and carefully roll them onto a wooden

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.130 
and carefully roll them onto a wooden
spoon<00:00:53.039> trim<00:00:53.789> off<00:00:53.940> here<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.449> then<00:00:54.690> pinch<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
spoon trim off here and then pinch the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.389 
spoon trim off here and then pinch the
dough<00:00:55.500> together<00:00:57.500> through<00:00:58.500> experimentation

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
dough together through experimentation

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.400 
dough together through experimentation
we<00:00:59.579> realize<00:00:59.910> that<00:00:59.940> greasing<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.140> spoon

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
we realize that greasing up the spoon

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.860 
we realize that greasing up the spoon
was<00:01:01.620> not<00:01:01.800> necessary<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.460> get<00:01:02.789> them<00:01:02.940> off<00:01:03.120> pull

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
was not necessary to get them off pull

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.329 
was not necessary to get them off pull
and<00:01:04.320> there<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.799> guys

all<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.580> need<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.820> do<00:01:08.939> different<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.450> boil<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
all you need to do different is boil a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.929 
all you need to do different is boil a
shallow<00:01:10.290> pan<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.650> water<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.159> add<00:01:11.430> about<00:01:11.610> 1/2<00:01:11.760> a

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
shallow pan of water and add about 1/2 a

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.120 
shallow pan of water and add about 1/2 a
cup<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.210> baking<00:01:12.450> soda<00:01:12.869> bring<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> boil<00:01:13.799> and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
cup of baking soda bring to a boil and

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.370 
cup of baking soda bring to a boil and
brush<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.640> mixture<00:01:14.970> onto<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> dough<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.259> we

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
brush this mixture onto the dough so we

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.960 
brush this mixture onto the dough so we
sprinkle<00:01:16.710> down<00:01:16.830> sea<00:01:17.100> salt<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.640> then<00:01:17.759> later

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
sprinkle down sea salt but then later

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.580 
sprinkle down sea salt but then later
realized<00:01:18.360> was<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.720> easier<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> roll<00:01:19.320> into

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
realized was just easier to roll into

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.859 
realized was just easier to roll into
the<00:01:19.770> salt<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.280> then<00:01:20.850> finally<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.450> bake<00:01:21.659> for

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the salt and then finally we bake for

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.539 
the salt and then finally we bake for
the<00:01:21.990> same<00:01:22.200> amount<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.530> time<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.280> did<00:01:23.430> with

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the same amount of time as we did with

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.920 
the same amount of time as we did with
the<00:01:23.640> crackers<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.150> our<00:01:27.270> pizza<00:01:27.570> filling
