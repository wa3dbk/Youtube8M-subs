00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.879
 video a bit particular which 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.589
 red answers to some questions though 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.760
 also a soul drone 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.410
 I don't know that I couldn't call this 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.179
 new series because i'm sure it 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.530
 I will do a series because anyway 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.809
 like a lot and since I don't have 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.730
 this great camera I can take advantage of 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.990
 the fact of speaking over the design for 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.020
 make the groove more interesting 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.269
 soul that higher quality however 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.269
 of the video because computer is fine 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.550
 register in 720 are bare I do not go 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.160
 expected so let me know 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.520
 clearly if you like it and nothing 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.620
 let's start immediately then the smile asks 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.180
 if you had to choose to pass the whole 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.860
 your life with your idol singers 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.780
 youtubers etc. but not able 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.399
 draw or mark forever not 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.910
 stay longer with your friends which one 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.219
 you would choose and then in the meantime I salute you 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.620
 because you write to me from England that is 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.000
 below wrote that they excuse me for free 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.280
 excluding Italian in the maximum 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.210
 quiet is perfect but it's four 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.070
 years that I moved to 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.539
 england for two branches do 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.700

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.360

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.740
 food you can't draw because it's good 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.420
 draw my passion though 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.369
 friendship is something else entirely 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.830
 compared to passions 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.540
 that is if passion is not a friend 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.409
 serves no purpose holds the little of the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.479
 passion for which one would give up 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.900
 youtubers singers because anyway ce 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.100
 is something I do not know them personally his 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.840
 nice but new though 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.600
 next question 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.210
 irene venturini asks so answers 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.439
 how well apart from the jokes the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.299
 most beautiful design you've done 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.219
 who would you choose between Richard H all 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.030
 greta and the fallen and if I had to do one 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.780
 cooperation 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.200
 so first of all so much good 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.850
 and the most beautiful design I made on 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.280
 my favorite ie I don't know if the most 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.289
 nice that I did but my favorite is 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:04.189
 that of eminem which I hold was al 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:06.890
 Wall half beretta not know if if 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.569

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.549
 he saw it for sure because 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.829
 I posted two or three photos on this 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.230
 design for which follow me on instagram 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:17.510
 because the public always everything 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.249
 the social media that I use the most and therefore there is 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.150
 place from the facebook page to the page 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:24.709
 instagram in fact the others than to those 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.230

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.230
 of the output of this video were they 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.389
 as a straight line it then makes more drawings 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.430
 high factor of eminem and who 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:37.069
 You would choose secret trailers for groups 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.599
 for a collaboration then for one 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.939
 technical collaboration how to say 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.000
 I would choose Richard H TV and why is it 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:46.340
 person from which to learn more 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.169

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:54.799
 anyway because they are my favorites 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:57.290
 I would choose and even try to secret me 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.209
 a lot because but apart from i 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.109
 beautiful jokes but it is a pinch 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.969
 through pass question simone sellitto 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.260
 he asks how old you are from where he comes 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:09.590
 this is some sport 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.780

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.750

 but only imported from Sicily as 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:32.419
 say from 100 and then some sport gets in 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.689
 this moment I do from the boxes with diego 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:38.470

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:41.449
 bully because it is big times less 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.180
 dangerous part box with him while 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:47.120
 then if self-taught it depends 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.709
 and if you mean in the drawing you are 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.989
 one hundred percent self-taught 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.750

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.400

 bryan and not at console are not yes or no 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.430
 not only the wii oh well but I don't think that 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:17.410
 nor can it be classified as a console 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:19.690
 while you are part of the box videos me 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.150
 like to go skateboarding this 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.770
 period is dedicating me particularly 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.010
 You are trying to learn 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:31.900

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.790

 I wish I could fly fly back 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.169
 positive even if you are not afraid of 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.890
 go by plane and even if I take it two 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:50.440
 times a year 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:51.940
 I board on the plane while another 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.890
 super power that should be a 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.890
 beak in my ability to read in the 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:00.889
 people's mind because a person 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:02.810
 quite curious next year 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.900
 but we are bows that is one with mine 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.460
 classmate requires a bit sad 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.800
 this thing that my companions of 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.610
 Class I ask questions I 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.430
 matches what your car is 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:20.060
 dream beautiful dream car in this 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:21.860
 moment I would say deep an audi r8 ie 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.629
 I don't point if you lamborghini those things 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.819
 there audi r8 modest something small 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:31.279
 relatively small maximum demand 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.479
 luca casati and his answer 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:34.159
 what prompted you to do drawing at 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.279
 computer knows how to be now 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:39.710
 magnetic design is illuminated 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:41.419
 then no I'm not enlightened not me 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.250
 I do n't even think any good 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.439
 kind of ice cream that rightly so 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.439
 receive constructive wounded knowledge that a 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:51.199
 sometimes I prefer even more gods 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:52.759
 compliments you can say and what has me 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.370
 driven to make computer drawings 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:59.689
 the fact that for Christmas he took the 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:01.789
 graphics tablet and therefore since I 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:03.229
 I've always been a bit of a person 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.310
 exhibitionist how to say to me is always 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.479
 enjoyed putting myself in the middle 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.150
 attention 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:10.819
 I said but rather than to score for 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:14.029
 I can't do anything on youtube e 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:16.580
 then I gave birth to the channel made 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:18.680
 now I'm a little out of the 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.110
 question however has gone so far as to design the 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.180
 computer the port that 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:27.400
 I have taken the dog on this subject 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.530
 even he asks his answers those pairs of 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.750
 sports those cups of what sport they are 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.750
 then this comment was put 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.820

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:40.660
