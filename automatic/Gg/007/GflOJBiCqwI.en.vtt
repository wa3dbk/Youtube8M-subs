00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
immediately I've found that those

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.000 
immediately I've found that those
options<00:01:11.760> are<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> little<00:01:12.180> buggy<00:01:12.510> right<00:01:12.810> now

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
options are a little buggy right now

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.649 
options are a little buggy right now
they<00:01:14.010> don't<00:01:14.040> exactly<00:01:14.460> work<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:14.970> they<00:01:15.330> should

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
they don't exactly work like they should

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.499 
they don't exactly work like they should
in<00:01:16.290> my<00:01:16.470> experience<00:01:16.759> so<00:01:17.759> I'm<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.270> going<00:01:18.420> to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
in my experience so I'm just going to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.660 
in my experience so I'm just going to
wait<00:01:18.659> until<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.110> tweak<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.470> updated<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.040> get

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
wait until this tweak is updated to get

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.310 
wait until this tweak is updated to get
all<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.970> bugs<00:01:21.299> worked<00:01:21.659> out<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.990> things<00:01:22.200> like

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
all the bugs worked out and things like

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.630 
all the bugs worked out and things like
that<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:22.710> for<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> most<00:01:23.130> part<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.490> works

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
that but for the most part it works

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.820 
that but for the most part it works
really<00:01:23.970> well<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.900> extremely<00:01:25.320> handy<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
really well and it's extremely handy to

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.230 
really well and it's extremely handy to
have<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.250> also<00:01:26.369> turn<00:01:26.610> off<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.820> camera

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
