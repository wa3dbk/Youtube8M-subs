00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.869
 multiple episodes so do it 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.299

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.130

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.429
 You can sort my two cat and 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.799
 this folder is via on chill but you have to 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.299
 pay attention and year so it will 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.710
 not just the next episode 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.539
 but there are others too 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.160
 extra episodes for example not 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.959
 only department 50 size is also possible with volts 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.810
 that in 53 we also deal with viewers 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.370
 or is 56 60 or 70 does not matter but the 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.900
 next episode is anyway with 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.670
 viewers so that is why you need your skye 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.080
 drop nevens so yes just something 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.800
 information or let yourself know that 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.430
 I always like it 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.290
 So 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.810
 now on and drag and you will be my divorce 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.000
 from brian normally you always have that 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.549
 nice black cap or 4 video and now have 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.920
 you don't yes that's a reason for that 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.719
 with is so in my school you can on them 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.549
 from the minimal gimpet I find 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.530
 it really is a fucking cool shit because yes 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.579
 you may like yourself better soon 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.170
 you have your head et cetera 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.730
 yes I think it is nonsense with ours 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.409
 school sentence yes you can put a cap on 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.969
 doing that is not allowed according to the rules 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.620
 yes then i am not allowed to put on a cap either 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.150
 only yes so then i can give him new york 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.769
 copy to do what I have so straight away 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.450
 in the school and then her goes 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:58.909
 this harder is going to be very weird 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.200
 So yes it is after four without cap 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.609
 but next time oh again 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.040

 You probably know it and let it speak 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.419
 then you see so many things mandatory 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.099

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.870
