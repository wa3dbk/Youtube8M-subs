beekeeping is the process of farming the
bees<00:00:09.929> essentially<00:00:10.620> for<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.580> honey<00:00:11.820> or<00:00:12.179> the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
bees essentially for the honey or the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
propolis an apiary is basically what we

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.840 
propolis an apiary is basically what we
would<00:00:18.539> call<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.529> area<00:00:20.010> where<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.609> actually

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
would call the area where we actually

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.330 
would call the area where we actually
keep<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.480> hives<00:00:21.660> we<00:00:22.289> call<00:00:22.650> them<00:00:22.800> also<00:00:23.010> be

keep the hives we call them also be

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.990 
keep the hives we call them also be
yards<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.600> keep<00:00:24.859> between<00:00:25.859> 12<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.550> 36

regrowing<00:00:30.630> as<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> hobby<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.619> think<00:00:32.040> mostly

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
regrowing as a hobby I think mostly

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.190 
regrowing as a hobby I think mostly
because<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:33.090> all<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.570> problems<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
because of all the problems that the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.930 
because of all the problems that the
bees<00:00:34.350> have<00:00:34.500> been<00:00:34.530> having<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.550> bees<00:00:35.760> are

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
bees have been having the bees are

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.139 
bees have been having the bees are
getting<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.329> lot<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.540> press<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.290> people<00:00:37.710> are

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
starting to notice that the bees are

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.240 
starting to notice that the bees are
really<00:00:41.550> important<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.440> our<00:00:43.440> ecosystems<00:00:44.100> but

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
really important to our ecosystems but

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.150 
really important to our ecosystems but
also<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.960> our<00:00:45.960> farming<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> food<00:00:46.920> that

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
also the our farming and the food that

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.510 
also the our farming and the food that
people<00:00:47.309> eat<00:00:47.579> every<00:00:47.820> single<00:00:47.850> day<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.989> main

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
people eat every single day and the main

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.330 
people eat every single day and the main
priority<00:00:50.520> when<00:00:50.700> taking<00:00:51.420> care<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.690> bees

priority when taking care of bees

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.180 
priority when taking care of bees
especially<00:00:53.510> nowadays<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.530> keep<00:00:55.800> them<00:00:55.949> free

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
especially nowadays is to keep them free

fall<00:02:02.850> they<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.990> live<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> few<00:02:04.590> months

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
fall they can live for a few months

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.230 
fall they can live for a few months
because<00:02:05.220> they're<00:02:05.430> not<00:02:05.520> as<00:02:05.670> spending<00:02:06.060> as<00:02:06.210> much

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
because they're not as spending as much

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.270 
because they're not as spending as much
time<00:02:06.600> flying<00:02:07.560> outside<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.009> they're<00:02:08.130> spending

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
time flying outside and they're spending

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.730 
time flying outside and they're spending
more<00:02:08.460> time<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.850> inside<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.210> hive<00:02:09.619> first<00:02:10.619> of

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
more time just inside the hive first of

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.470 
more time just inside the hive first of
all<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.039> thing<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.400> need<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.760> probably<00:02:12.030> this

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
all the thing you need is probably this

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.680 
all the thing you need is probably this
the<00:02:13.050> bee<00:02:13.200> suit<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.770> I've<00:02:14.010> got<00:02:14.250> on<00:02:14.400> here

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
the bee suit that I've got on here

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.280 
the bee suit that I've got on here
well<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.440> also<00:02:16.590> comes<00:02:16.860> with<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.510> mesh<00:02:18.510> hood<00:02:18.810> to

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
well it also comes with a mesh hood to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.560 
well it also comes with a mesh hood to
keep<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.530> bees<00:02:19.650> off<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.980> your<00:02:20.100> face<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:21.270> is

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
keep the bees off of your face this is

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.150 
keep the bees off of your face this is
our<00:02:22.560> hive<00:02:23.310> tool<00:02:23.930> which<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:25.350> use<00:02:25.530> for<00:02:25.560> prying

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
our hive tool which we use for prying

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.699 
our hive tool which we use for prying
the<00:02:26.340> frames<00:02:26.550> apart<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:28.080> boxes<00:02:28.440> as<00:02:28.560> well

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
the frames apart and the boxes as well

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.380 
the frames apart and the boxes as well
as<00:02:28.860> since<00:02:29.040> they<00:02:29.130> do<00:02:29.190> get<00:02:29.400> pretty<00:02:29.580> sticky<00:02:29.910> we

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
as since they do get pretty sticky we

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.920 
as since they do get pretty sticky we
also<00:02:30.540> have<00:02:30.870> our<00:02:31.080> smoker<00:02:31.770> which<00:02:32.160> we<00:02:32.430> use<00:02:33.120> to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
also have our smoker which we use to

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.150 
also have our smoker which we use to
calm<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.800> bees

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
calm the bees

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.100 
calm the bees
so<00:02:35.520> for<00:02:35.700> smoker<00:02:36.060> fuel<00:02:36.390> we<00:02:36.600> use<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.810> combination

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
so for smoker fuel we use a combination

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.250 
so for smoker fuel we use a combination
of<00:02:37.770> paper<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.670> dried<00:02:38.880> horse<00:02:39.120> manure<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:40.050> first

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
of paper and dried horse manure so first

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.940 
of paper and dried horse manure so first
I'm<00:02:40.350> going<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.500> take<00:02:40.650> off<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.100> top<00:02:41.459> cover<00:02:41.880> here

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
I'm going to take off the top cover here

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.420 
I'm going to take off the top cover here
and<00:02:43.950> we<00:02:44.070> just<00:02:44.190> set<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.550> side<00:02:45.739> then<00:02:46.739> the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
and we just set it to the side then the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.110 
and we just set it to the side then the
inner<00:02:47.760> cover<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.880> this<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.330> theatre<00:02:51.630> tank

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
inner cover and this is the theatre tank

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.240 
inner cover and this is the theatre tank
but<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.840> smoke<00:02:54.110> does<00:02:54.319> and<00:02:54.590> makes<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:55.040> bees

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
but the smoke does and makes the bees

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.910 
but the smoke does and makes the bees
think<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.239> there's<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.480> fire<00:02:56.720> nearby<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.530> so

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
think that there's a fire nearby and so

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.220 
think that there's a fire nearby and so
they<00:02:58.459> prepare<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.090> evacuate<00:02:59.629> the<00:02:59.750> hive<00:02:59.930> and

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
they prepare to evacuate the hive and

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.600 
they prepare to evacuate the hive and
what<00:03:00.349> they<00:03:00.440> do<00:03:00.500> is<00:03:00.680> they<00:03:00.860> fill<00:03:01.400> up<00:03:01.430> their

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
what they do is they fill up their

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.309 
what they do is they fill up their
stomachs<00:03:01.970> with<00:03:02.090> honey<00:03:02.299> so<00:03:02.569> that<00:03:02.599> if<00:03:03.080> they<00:03:03.290> have

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
stomachs with honey so that if they have

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.750 
stomachs with honey so that if they have
to<00:03:03.440> be<00:03:03.560> gone<00:03:03.680> away<00:03:03.890> from<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:04.159> hive<00:03:04.340> for<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.610> long

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
to be gone away from the hive for a long

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.640 
to be gone away from the hive for a long
time<00:03:05.000> there<00:03:05.390> will<00:03:05.930> be<00:03:06.049> able<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.260> handle<00:03:06.530> it

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
time there will be able to handle it

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.589 
time there will be able to handle it
obviously<00:03:07.340> one<00:03:07.580> of<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.790> biggest<00:03:07.970> danger<00:03:08.390> is

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
obviously one of the biggest danger is

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.369 
obviously one of the biggest danger is
the<00:03:09.170> bee<00:03:09.349> stings<00:03:10.180> but<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.450> can<00:03:11.690> be<00:03:11.720> pretty

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
the bee stings but that can be pretty

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.670 
the bee stings but that can be pretty
easily<00:03:12.620> avoided<00:03:13.370> if<00:03:13.879> you're<00:03:14.720> approaching<00:03:15.560> the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
easily avoided if you're approaching the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.059 
easily avoided if you're approaching the
bees<00:03:16.120> calmly<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.299> gently<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:18.019> you're<00:03:18.890> not

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
bees calmly and gently and you're not

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.649 
bees calmly and gently and you're not
opening<00:03:19.459> up<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:19.700> hives<00:03:19.909> and<00:03:20.209> bad<00:03:20.390> weather

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
opening up the hives and bad weather

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.449 
opening up the hives and bad weather
which<00:03:20.989> irritates<00:03:21.560> them<00:03:21.739> quite<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:21.980> bit<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:22.400> you

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
which irritates them quite a bit and you

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.970 
which irritates them quite a bit and you
also<00:03:23.239> use<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.540> smoker<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.290> kind<00:03:24.470> of<00:03:24.500> distract

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
also use the smoker to kind of distract

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.440 
also use the smoker to kind of distract
them<00:03:25.190> from<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.579> fact<00:03:25.609> that<00:03:25.879> you're<00:03:26.060> poking

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
them from the fact that you're poking

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.110 
them from the fact that you're poking
around<00:03:26.569> and<00:03:27.079> they're<00:03:27.379> in<00:03:27.739> their<00:03:27.980> home<00:03:28.160> in<00:03:28.819> the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
around and they're in their home in the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.390 
around and they're in their home in the
two<00:03:29.299> seasons<00:03:29.599> of<00:03:29.989> beekeeping<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.920> have<00:03:31.220> been

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
two seasons of beekeeping I have been

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.520 
two seasons of beekeeping I have been
stung<00:03:31.760> about<00:03:32.450> 15<00:03:32.959> times<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.940> I<00:03:35.690> don't<00:03:35.930> react

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
stung about 15 times and I don't react

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.110 
stung about 15 times and I don't react
very<00:03:36.769> well<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:37.220> bee<00:03:37.400> stings<00:03:37.430> at<00:03:38.000> all

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
very well to bee stings at all

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.170 
very well to bee stings at all
unfortunately<00:03:38.840> but<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.200> found<00:03:39.409> that<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.739> best

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
unfortunately but I found that the best

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.660 
unfortunately but I found that the best
remedy<00:03:41.319> as<00:03:42.319> a<00:03:42.379> preventative<00:03:42.920> measure<00:03:43.069> is<00:03:43.459> to

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
remedy as a preventative measure is to

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.550 
remedy as a preventative measure is to
put<00:03:43.849> a<00:03:43.879> penny<00:03:44.180> on<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.629> sting<00:03:44.930> because<00:03:45.349> it

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
put a penny on the sting because it

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.680 
put a penny on the sting because it
draws<00:03:45.829> the<00:03:46.579> copper<00:03:46.909> and<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.060> penny<00:03:47.269> draws<00:03:47.540> out

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
draws the copper and the penny draws out

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.619 
draws the copper and the penny draws out
the<00:03:47.720> bee<00:03:47.959> venom<00:03:48.730> if<00:03:49.730> you<00:03:49.819> want<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.060> take<00:03:50.480> up

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
the bee venom if you want to take up

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.069 
the bee venom if you want to take up
beekeeping<00:03:51.140> I<00:03:51.319> would<00:03:51.709> start<00:03:52.489> by<00:03:52.840> doing<00:03:53.840> a<00:03:53.989> lot

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
beekeeping I would start by doing a lot

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.960 
beekeeping I would start by doing a lot
of<00:03:54.140> reading<00:03:54.440> there's<00:03:55.099> lots<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.400> information

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
of reading there's lots of information
