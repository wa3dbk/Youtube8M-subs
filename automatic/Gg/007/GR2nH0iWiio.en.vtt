00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.820
 Here one says to kick there 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.640
 in England says and Abbas ocher 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.269
 continue in the USA 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.980
 and sometimes "Barbie Foot" 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.429
 in France though 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.040
 What is the Vespa? 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.719
 a breeze 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.619
 yes, you've already played yourself 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.849
 maybe it looked like this 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.480
 there is everything there 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.199
 There is not yet name 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.939
 Here you turn on 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.289
 he grabs lightning fast with his hands and of course is as light as that 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:28.680
 here 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.579
 He also holds Beijing 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.310
 but can you imagine 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.190
 That is also true professionals there 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.410
 and again game looks at the 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.190
 what is actually table football 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.260
 first time 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.960
 probably does not like it 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.239
 especially as you do that 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.720
 when the stomach is around 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.710
 that looks better this is a professional table 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.020
 quite expensive 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.080
 and with and with handy balls 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.970
 You can do other things as well 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.440
 but that costs a lot of time and a lot of patience 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.879
 but it works and it is a lot of fun 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.270
 change the Iceland 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.610
 and if possible, do not lose the ball 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.610
 moves the fast and controlled 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.290
 is that possible what you can see here 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.670
 That's a quick game in defense 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.790
 The goal is not just to play the ball and arm 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.780
 knot 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.260
 but above all, to play Schwendinger like that 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
 STG because I know or the Spiderman arrives 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.950
 and that is not so easy with politicians 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.230
 so you do not allow thick 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.010
 and you do not slip so easily 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.770
 is preparing to be prepared 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.270
 around the country is out of the 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.990
 one hovers that just hold the pole 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.320
 that works with silicone 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.800
 this is for example Pronto which one in there 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.060
 And so you do not get washed off on the body so much on it 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.480
 the Nexus One is 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.060
 They make sure that you even with sweaty fingers 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.460
 Not slipping so fast, the man also shoots with other techniques 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.650
 as the ones he knows 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.140
 Well, and so you put on better looks at such gloves 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.210
 that is very small in the Gulf at schools text 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.500
 "I did not think of any skin 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.120
 the game city is important 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.929
 you have to go out to start the game 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.629
 at the first throw-in has 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.229
 if you are allowed to beat your arms 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:12.989
 one lays in Munich 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.989
 after being greeted, it is also important here 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.219
 and the coin freezes the one who wins Windhoff can choose 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.180
 even at the elections or the page 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.119
 Of course, most of them come to the ball 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:27.789
 and then it starts 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:28.849
 the knock 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.319
 that means respect 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.359
 Are you ready 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.379
 and then there's a workshop 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.709
 The rest is not that difficult 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.749
 but still there are rules he probably does not know 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.070
 and we'll take care of that now 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.679
 only a few are actually very important 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:48.389
 For example, if a ball was in there like here 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:49.899
 and get out of the gate 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:52.529
 then he pulls anyway 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:53.399
 also 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:56.089
 but that's the turn that's certainly not allowed 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:59.469
 and whole money to the banks strike Soester table right hotels 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:00.749
 you can not do that either 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.279
 because then the opponent can 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.620
 But that does not mean that there is a trick 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.749
 He puts his finger in the inner web 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:08.959
 that a wolf hole 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.839
 then let the ball roll Rheine from his finger 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:15.639
 Pero then automatically on the own film series to which one should be established 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.799
 in the hand 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.730
 and then you go with the passing game OWS 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.169
 and that's just as important as in real football 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.169
 Finally, a little if you do not get the ball forward 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.649
 whether that makes that knock 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:29.959
 however, when ready with the construction 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.509
 Game went back and forth and if one sown sown 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:33.830
 then you shoot him over 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.669
 that went pretty fast 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.669
 and because you could not see each other any faster 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.389
 Beijing along the gang 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.989
 and there are several standards shots 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.369
 suits to change 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:49.569
 Let's take another look at a perspective 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:50.999
 Feel the burden 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:52.390
 and just before the gang 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.849
 that's because she lets the figure catch it, we just let it change 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.329
 angle tilted forward 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.899
 the problem I here of which is actually too 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:04.839
 if the way is blocked when I am so 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:07.839
 Just play with the edge and move forward through 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:12.889
 Weier means that means that the ball runs between two figures 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:15.989
 that makes the sound 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.479
 Tick ​​Tack Tack Tack 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.359
 and eventually liquid play with the ball through 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.930
 there are many problems to cover 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.270
 they can also do the ball 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.389
 to the gang 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.650
 let it bounce and take the dried ball with you 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.819
 by counter diagonals and exactly to those with the characters like here 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.839
 from the back to the front to fit that is also important Crotta 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.580
 in double and also in single 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.490
 again simply leave the figure in front 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.650
 and Finder the way to go is just to let the ball come along 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.680
 could be diagonal 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.129
 Hartz could not be her 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.160
 they are already measured at up to 250 km / h 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.099
 we can not keep up with you anymore 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.059
 but of course I like to try that 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:00.639
 these are all progressing shots pretty fast 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.879
 maybe around the 80 but I think it's enough 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:06.879
 and such shots are very common 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.160
 But now I like it most of all 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.080
 that you never let the opponent know what you are doing 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.280
 if the game ideas that can help what is now on board you 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.199
 would then just stand and shoot through 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.339
 mostly opponents did not do that 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:22.330
 or something like here 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
 here too is played back and forth 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.059
 and at the end 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:29.270
 completed with the ticket 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.550
 Another option is to play game back and forth 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.960
 then play the ball the gang then loose 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.370
 flaky no too dry 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.529
 Incidentally, it's called SportScheck 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:42.000
 that's a nice thing 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.639
 for the Gewas level of choice is 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.889
 and that was just a song called doors also called flip almost 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.009
 what unexpected is always good for example to play over gang here 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.670
 so that the children are not right 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.099
 then he has no chance 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:55.550
 Compper to the defense 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.629
 Of course she has to score goals as well 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:00.629
 These are, for example, a pusher 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:08.589
 but prevent 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:11.430
 is actually the actual task 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.509
 and here you can see how it works if you have relevant 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:17.379
 in the storm then you can not just stand somewhere 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.540
 that does not work, he chooses the gap and is so fast 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.130
 that you have no chances to come 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.960
 that's why you move 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.169
 buy me 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.309
 and before the one can shoot 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:30.889
 when she was back to so it was one that actually where to shoot him 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.050
 and must accidentally shoot in front 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.050
 and then you need a bit of luck 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:39.240
 and that in detail 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.960
 that is also a double important now comes a passport 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.369
 from the back over the gang forward 

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:47.680
 and is nevertheless executed immediately 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.939
 and now a few game sequences 

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:52.939
 without comment 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.189
 With 

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:50.439
 this and other person 

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:51.589
 and for the characters 

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:54.589
 have fun 

00:08:14.159 --> 00:08:14.999
 s
