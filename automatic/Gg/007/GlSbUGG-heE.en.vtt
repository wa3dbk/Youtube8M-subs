00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.330 
sets off at a constant speed and cover
70<00:01:25.060> kilometers<00:01:25.660> in<00:01:25.870> three<00:01:26.170> hours<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:27.100> that's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
70 kilometers in three hours and that's

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.150 
70 kilometers in three hours and that's
it<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.600> average<00:01:28.750> speed<00:01:29.320> for<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.590> journey<00:01:29.890> is

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
it the average speed for the journey is

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.030 
it the average speed for the journey is
the<00:01:30.520> distance<00:01:30.940> divided<00:01:31.360> by<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.630> time

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the distance divided by the time

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.370 
the distance divided by the time
remember<00:01:33.040> speed<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:33.940> in<00:01:34.090> kilometers<00:01:34.900> per<00:01:34.930> hour

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
remember speed is in kilometers per hour

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.300 
remember speed is in kilometers per hour
so<00:01:36.250> that<00:01:36.280> seventy<00:01:37.030> divided<00:01:37.360> by<00:01:37.600> three<00:01:38.310> twenty

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
so that seventy divided by three twenty

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.160 
so that seventy divided by three twenty
three<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.730> third<00:01:39.970> kilometers<00:01:40.660> an<00:01:40.780> hour

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.890 
cyclist sets off at a constant speed and
travels<00:01:53.290> 15<00:01:53.740> kilometers<00:01:54.340> in<00:01:54.520> three<00:01:54.790> hours<00:01:54.940> the

graph<00:01:56.140> then<00:01:56.380> levels<00:01:56.800> up<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:58.240> means<00:01:58.540> that<00:01:58.840> the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
graph then levels up that means that the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.110 
graph then levels up that means that the

in<00:02:03.910> fact<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.390> graph<00:02:04.630> shows<00:02:04.930> that<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.290> red

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
in fact the graph shows that the red

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.860 
in fact the graph shows that the red
cyclist<00:02:06.040> stops<00:02:06.280> altogether<00:02:06.520> for<00:02:07.090> four<00:02:07.360> hours

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
the rest of the graph means that the red

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.320 
the rest of the graph means that the red
