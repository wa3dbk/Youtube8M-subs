this for what is your use case so an

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.750 
this for what is your use case so an
engine<00:02:19.080> would<00:02:19.230> go<00:02:19.380> well<00:02:19.620> no<00:02:20.280> we<00:02:20.430> don't<00:02:20.460> have

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
engine would go well no we don't have

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.040 
engine would go well no we don't have
that<00:02:20.820> right<00:02:21.030> now<00:02:21.240> but<00:02:21.510> can<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.780> tell<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.960> little

we want to be able to see XY and Z

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.840 
we want to be able to see XY and Z
because<00:02:31.800> that's<00:02:32.010> important<00:02:32.430> in<00:02:32.490> kind<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.760> our

because that's important in kind of our
workflow<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.600> engine<00:02:33.840> won't<00:02:33.960> go<00:02:34.170> ha<00:02:34.680> it's

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
workflow and the engine won't go ha it's

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.710 
workflow and the engine won't go ha it's
interesting<00:02:35.280> can't<00:02:35.970> tell<00:02:36.150> me<00:02:36.240> exactly<00:02:36.420> the

work for like would you want to just see

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.130 
work for like would you want to just see
these<00:02:38.370> numbers<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:39.030> those<00:02:39.300> numbers<00:02:39.690> would<00:02:40.020> it

these numbers of those numbers would it

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.510 
these numbers of those numbers would it
be<00:02:40.230> important<00:02:40.530> for<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.710> to<00:02:40.830> see<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.310> or

feedback<00:03:27.210> from<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.840> prospect<00:03:28.290> if<00:03:28.440> that's<00:03:28.650> a

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
feedback from the prospect if that's a

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.190

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
important if there was a workaround the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.670 
important if there was a workaround the
engineer<00:03:36.210> would<00:03:36.360> actually<00:03:36.630> offer<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:37.020> which

engineer would actually offer it which

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.990 
engineer would actually offer it which
was<00:03:37.860> brilliant<00:03:38.070> right<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.670> engine<00:03:38.880> would

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
was brilliant right so the engine would

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.400 
was brilliant right so the engine would
say<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.180> know<00:03:39.330> what<00:03:39.480> we<00:03:39.630> don't<00:03:39.750> have<00:03:40.050> the
