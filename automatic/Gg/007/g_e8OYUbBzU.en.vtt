00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.080
 Christine Konrad shows us how to get along 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.580
 the horse lying on the right and flat 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.580
 are developed step by step 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.289
 the lying one works from the 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.360
 compliment 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.430
 It is important that the horse 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.890
 as that teaches it from every side 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.020
 go with any father with him down 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.900
 So you can practically compliment that 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.730
 both sides can do then so I 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.500
 the horses like watching themselves 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.150
 lie down because there's gonna be the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.400
 make it better the other way to the left 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.470
 rather to the right with the touch on the 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.870
 Vorderbein invites you to compliment 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.390
 and then leave the horse upright 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.790
 lie for working out of the fly 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.920
 There are several possibilities the one 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.299
 is with the help of the hill the head of the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.299
 to lead horses down 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.210
 to lure your head up to much 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.670
 have weight on the shoulder and then 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.290
 roll to the side or as a third 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.090
 Possibility I had with my 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.159
 apply because the case could not be 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.990
 bring down and hold 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.970
 I just have that fatigue 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.650
 tactics I just made it that way 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.250
 often again and again to compliment 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.040
 let it go down one day 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.290
 sighed and lay down and away 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.120
 that day he lies down because that 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.470
 is not as exhausting as ever 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.060
 stay in compliment 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.400
 here again the individual steps 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.970
 from the other side compliment 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.970
 lie upright and lie flat 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.390
 It is important that the horses relax 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.840
 lie down and not immediately again 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.000
 jump up 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.950
 if at the beginning it happens that 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.420
 the horse is indeed above itself 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.709
 Self-scared is either off 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.480
 so do not jump that 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.459
 forcibly keep down 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.819
 then it jumped up again 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.680
 It is better with it then the moment 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.290
 Armed with enough leckerlis or 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.860
 a helper has the caution to do so 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.860
 can come 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.000
 in the advanced version 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.010
 the horses react to the bare one 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.480
 command down are for the upright 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.480
 and sleep for the flat lina
