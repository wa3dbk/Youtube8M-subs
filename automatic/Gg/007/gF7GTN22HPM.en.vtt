00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.370
 hello youtube friends today I'm going to 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.640
 teach how to do an intro of lyon 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.310
 seagate 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.500
 for this we need to sell the agro 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.140
 pour efe and this file folder 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.329
 that I will leave them in the description of 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.949
 video so you can download the 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.620
 well the first thing we will do is 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:46.449
 unzipping the file will leave you a 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.449
 folder with the bloomberg project 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.610
 we open it 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.420
 now we erase the letters that serve us 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.230
 by clicking on them and press the 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.230
 delete key 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.930
 Once the single letters are deleted 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.479
 we click on any of these 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.280
 letters to select the title when 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.860
 we have selected them we press 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.439
 the key is for us to enter the mode 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.630
 of editing in this mode we can already 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.060
 write our name we want 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.369
 for him he entered once we finished our 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.890
 title press start to exit the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.690
 edit mode in these flat letters 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.470
 we write our name again 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.600
 to be able to give it the 3d effect now 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.880
 if our lyrics are coming out of 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.830
 picture we should reduce its size 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.830
 for that we go to this option 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.500
 and here we download the numbers to the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.829
 scale is to modify the size of the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.829
 text 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.890
 You can move the text with the arrow 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.890
 horizontal red 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.420
 this is already erase again these 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.870
 loose letters that I forgot to erase 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.870
 before 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.780
 to write the subtitle we perform the 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.780
 same previous procedure 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.710
 once the whole title is finished we are going to 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.800
 this rendering option is a 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.080
 Very busy little camera in there we give to 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.540
 animation to start creating 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.030
 our title is just such an image 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.780
 that will not delay in creating and we finished 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.780
 with the inder 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.510
 then we open the project that 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.970
 I let them duster efe remember that for 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.520
 that the crc works should have 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.380
 installed quick time if they do not have it 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.380
 I'll leave it in the description too 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.780
 well here we have to go to 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.360

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:00.990

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.990
 without loss the format in 264 h 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.720
 and in audio output we mark the box 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.960
 we choose the place to store 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.680
 and we give to process 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.270
