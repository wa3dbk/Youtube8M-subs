we're<00:00:05.700> visiting<00:00:06.120> with<00:00:06.299> dr.<00:00:06.600> yorn<00:00:06.870> dire<00:00:07.109> bird

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
we're visiting with dr. yorn dire bird

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.440 
we're visiting with dr. yorn dire bird
from<00:00:07.710> Copenhagen<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.610> we've<00:00:09.000> been<00:00:09.120> talking

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
from Copenhagen and we've been talking

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.560 
from Copenhagen and we've been talking
about<00:00:09.510> fat<00:00:10.019> good<00:00:10.740> SAT<00:00:10.980> bad<00:00:11.280> fat<00:00:11.639> we<00:00:12.210> hear<00:00:12.389> so

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
about fat good SAT bad fat we hear so

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.660 
about fat good SAT bad fat we hear so
much<00:00:12.660> about<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.080> omega-3<00:00:13.620> fatty<00:00:13.830> acids<00:00:14.370> today

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
much about the omega-3 fatty acids today

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.269 
much about the omega-3 fatty acids today
being<00:00:15.030> good<00:00:15.120> fats<00:00:15.599> would<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.500> tell<00:00:16.740> us<00:00:16.920> what

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
being good fats would you tell us what

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.790 
being good fats would you tell us what
the<00:00:17.670> differences<00:00:18.210> or<00:00:18.570> what<00:00:19.230> omega-3s

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
the differences or what omega-3s

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.560 
the differences or what omega-3s
actually<00:00:20.189> are<00:00:20.340> what<00:00:20.580> are<00:00:20.699> they<00:00:20.880> yeah<00:00:21.150> what<00:00:21.420> are

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
actually are what are they yeah what are

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.160 
actually are what are they yeah what are
they<00:00:21.750> they<00:00:22.020> are<00:00:22.400> poly<00:00:23.400> unsaturated<00:00:24.170> fatty

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
they they are poly unsaturated fatty

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.820 
they they are poly unsaturated fatty
acids<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.039> these<00:00:26.750> polyunsaturated<00:00:27.830> fatty

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
acids and these polyunsaturated fatty

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.179 
acids and these polyunsaturated fatty
acids<00:00:29.279> are<00:00:29.429> essential<00:00:29.840> for<00:00:30.840> our<00:00:31.320> well-being

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
acids are essential for our well-being

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.600 
acids are essential for our well-being
for<00:00:32.820> cellular<00:00:33.450> function<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.370> I'm

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
for cellular function and it is so I'm

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.240 
for cellular function and it is so I'm
sorry<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.360> bit<00:00:36.390> complicated<00:00:36.930> but<00:00:37.739> that's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
sorry it's a bit complicated but that's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.040 
sorry it's a bit complicated but that's
how<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.570> two<00:00:39.899> families<00:00:40.649> of

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
how it is that we have two families of

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.380 
how it is that we have two families of
polyunsaturated<00:00:43.050> fatty<00:00:44.040> acids<00:00:44.550> don't<00:00:45.180> get

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
polyunsaturated fatty acids don't get

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.160 
polyunsaturated fatty acids don't get
sixes<00:00:45.899> new<00:00:46.739> mega<00:00:46.980> threes<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.579> just<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.750> by
