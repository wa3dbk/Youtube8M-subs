00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
it in neutral because I guess it seems

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:53.830 
it in neutral because I guess it seems
like<00:02:46.280> it's<00:02:46.430> teaming<00:02:46.849> up<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:53.480> there's<00:02:53.750> that

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
like it's teaming up and there's that

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.229

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
to put a stats on it or something I

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.190
