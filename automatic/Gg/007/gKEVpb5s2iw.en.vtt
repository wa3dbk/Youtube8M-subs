00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.790 
the problem of their careers and then
they're<00:03:47.930> going<00:03:48.110> to<00:03:48.200> mentor<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.650> young

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
they're going to mentor the young

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.070 
they're going to mentor the young
players<00:03:49.210> the<00:03:50.210> kids<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.540> are<00:03:50.660> coming<00:03:50.960> in

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
players the kids that are coming in

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.780 
players the kids that are coming in
through<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.290> draft<00:03:51.590> this<00:03:51.920> year<00:03:51.980> so<00:03:52.580> I<00:03:52.610> think

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
through the draft this year so I think

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.020 
through the draft this year so I think
there's<00:03:53.180> like<00:03:53.240> three<00:03:53.630> different<00:03:54.400> phases<00:03:55.400> of

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
there's like three different phases of

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.740 
there's like three different phases of
the<00:03:56.420> player<00:03:57.100> grouping<00:03:58.100> in<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.940> WNBA<00:03:59.360> and<00:03:59.570> I

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
the player grouping in the WNBA and I

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.360 
the player grouping in the WNBA and I
think<00:03:59.960> the<00:04:00.110> fans<00:04:00.530> are<00:04:00.740> really<00:04:00.830> going<00:04:01.100> to<00:04:01.160> see

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
think the fans are really going to see

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.670 
think the fans are really going to see
the<00:04:02.240> highest<00:04:02.660> level<00:04:02.990> of<00:04:03.050> play<00:04:03.260> this<00:04:03.470> year

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
the highest level of play this year

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.410 
the highest level of play this year
because<00:04:03.890> of<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.280> condensed<00:04:04.910> rosters

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
because of the condensed rosters

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.120 
because of the condensed rosters
and<00:04:06.510> of<00:04:06.750> course<00:04:06.840> with<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.319> common<00:04:07.709> stop<00:04:07.920> being

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130
