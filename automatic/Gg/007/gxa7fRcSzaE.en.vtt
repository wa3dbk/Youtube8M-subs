 watermelon and melon puree and two 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.440
 teaspoons of honey so that this

 you must have left at least all the 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.159
 night the fruits in the refrigerator what 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.190
 what do you need to do with these three 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.350
 ingredients is to mix them all and you go to 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.470
 start with watermelon and melon porridge 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.350
 and then little by little you add honey 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.450
 watermelon contains vitamin e vitamin c 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.820
 which will bring shine to your face

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.380
 fruit that has more water is also very 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.390
 recognized for its antioxidant action what 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.310
 which means that it fights the effect 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.350
 of the free radicals that cause the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.870
 aging on the other hand the melon 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.600
 provides vitamin E and honey contributes its 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.030
 exfoliating antiseptic properties 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.400
 moisturizer to apply this mask 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.290
 I recommend you use a gauze 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.780
 the same one that is used to put the 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.360
 compresses and heal wounds in 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.220
 costales this will make the mask 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.619
 stay in place for 30 minutes 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.080
 that you should be using it once 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.490

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.259
