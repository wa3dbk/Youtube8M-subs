00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello I all and all these seven 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.560
 projects so we end up in a 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.970
 little moment since I had to stop my 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.309
 videos following a few small problems 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.030
 I had 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.340
 now all these problems are 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.710
 finished so I can get back on my 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.330
 project with cadences that go well 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.460
 decreased that I found a job 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.949
 employment 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.300
 he'll take a good time I can 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.420
 work weekends and holidays 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.699
 the nights so really good I'll have a 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.279
 little less than that to the project but not 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.870
 worry there will always be something 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.059
 make videos and find content 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.870
 so as you see he has 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.270
 completely changed 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.280
 the car has completely changed it 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.360
 is still not beautiful since I do not 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.660
 still do not do a good job 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.059
 since it's dassier that was soldered I 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.059
 do not really know how welded it really is 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.620
 very strong it holds I typed on it and 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.170
 that hammers ensures a weld 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.030
 good death it holds but it's not beautiful 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.160
 as we see on youtube the cords 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.879
 who are not yet in the soul 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.059
 but it holds 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.670
 that's the main thing all this will come after 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.590
 I think by manipulating and taking 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.479
 the habit since it's still a 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.850
 old post that is not easy but good 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.320
 so we find on our engine 40 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.189
 cubic centimeters that had been modified 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.540
 and the same settings as the old and 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.820
 so with a little game of 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.320
 gear ratios have increased the torque 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.119
 and reduce the speed knowing that we're going 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.380
 recover from the speed after on a bm 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.380
 gear reduction that's going to be here 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.910
 the back will be suspended so it'll be 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.250
 a separate chassis with two arms of 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.070
 suspension here so the wheels are like 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.040
 that and then what we deliver in this way 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.170
 if paris for the front here I have under 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.710
 two small two small pieces of metal 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:55.540
 to fix a rocket so the rocket this 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.400
 part here that's the part here it's going 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.050
 be replaced by metal so tube 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.910
 that I'm going to fold in a triangle 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:07.720
 so I'm going to put in so that's fine 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.340
 give us a suspension here so 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.560
 we will really have the red cat that will be 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.810
 not independent since both wheels 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.250
 before are independent can move 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.050
 how sorry but the two wheels 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.160
 backs will be against it is the ideal 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.440
 they can move but there will be 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.000
 suspensions but really the pumping is 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.080
 independent that there will be only one 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.930
 only one tree 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.610
 So that's the same for the transmission 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.370
 back it's going to be another one again 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.709
 pinion of with another chain and so 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.550
 So here we go to see 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:42.060
 all this so we have the engine here the little one 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.080
 tank is so small support 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.030
 remember who was in the back 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.260
 my transmission there the engine that was 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.780
 cut in half to keep 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.310
 bearings that holds so this one here is 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.860
 so when I tell you that my weld 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.420
 are not beautiful is that she goes neither 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.190
 solder are really not beautiful not 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.200
 beautiful at all but hey it's very 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.700
 loud so this little video is 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.370
 really very short it was for 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.050
 explain my new project for you 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.970
 thank you also for following me for 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.350
 have so many beautiful subscribers 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.180
 comments that could have me the 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.769
 make progress so do not hesitate to 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.540
 continue it's really great to you 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.360
 thank you I really thank you 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.700
 a lot and so subscribe for the 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.269
 suite and we go for for 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.140
 new videos 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.140
 go ciao
