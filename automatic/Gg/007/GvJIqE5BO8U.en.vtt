00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.009
 league 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.009
 vibram 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:24.500
 they are very strange unique shoes 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.810
 in its kind that I will need for 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.800
 go kayaking because you already have those 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:34.580
 crocs are gone now 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.130
 here this model this model is 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.440
 enough for 4 stuff but not too much 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.410
 because there are various models that now 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.980
 the spotlight is on the 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.790
 walk running barefoot and these have 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.170
 practically the fingers of the fano scale 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:01:00.530
 then with this idea I say and waste 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:05.030
 have invented vibra shoes is one 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:09.320
 brand then of Italian kanoh embroidery 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.750
 it should be if not European Italian 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.060
 ugly also because when in short 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:20.149
 had to buy but I asked this is 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:25.130
 the 12 euros that said 6 43 44 in Rome 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:27.830
 do find and it is a 44 then the first 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.479
 once you do try the top saying came a 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.149
 this strainer failed in the final 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.780
 fingers is not easy to thread all the 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:38.539
 we write five companies but anyway 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.600
 I wanted to point out that the sole is this 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.670
 here it's more like kayaks so-so 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.280
 even if now I go for a ride 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:52.520
 put no if you want to run there are 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.970
 those with crampons cini price 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.500
 average of these shoes and on the 80s 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:04.009
 dollars that you will say 80 dollars here 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.490
 pair of water slippers and me there 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.640
 this makes ten simple ones 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.090
 be more beautiful those lake i 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.260
 rapportini the maximum cost 110 100 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.819
 100 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.659
 I'd like to see in Italy a little 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.659
 place comics the line that are there 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.659
 accessories 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:31.620
 let's put the suffered also enter 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.439
 while the shop tests me not 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.859
 entered the little finger I said capuzzo is not 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:41.329
 that his feet are malformed instead 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.329
 wash too tight dates 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:03:00.370
 I say then why when you run for 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.000
 millions of years the man rushed to foot 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.100
 barefooted 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.980
 then the shoes went and started 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.640
 runs into evil for everyone runs with the 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:14.460
 barefoot bears all weight 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:17.890
 on the front fingers and then softens 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:22.000
 in other words, the knees are not micro 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.520
 cracks in the internal bone system and instead 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.070
 with shoes more things on the heel and 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.880
 hence by a stronger impact indeed 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:34.120
 I could very well not want not 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.690
 i do that guy ran the beloved because 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:42.520
 tt study the knees as they say in 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:46.210
 knees because the race hurts him 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.560
 all the experts say and as well as yes 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.660
 who loves 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.319
 so that these things do not tell her 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.180
 because there is conspiracy 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.480
 of the shoe industry they want 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:04.720
 sell more shoes then this is born 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:09.140
 new project to make the planet 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.000
 human a racing car and you will say 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:17.870
 and then now and then with the race 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.910
 no because these are from craig things to 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.410
 place 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:30.250
