00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
celery to kind of break that down a

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.160 
celery to kind of break that down a
little<00:02:25.250> bit<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.300> pretty<00:02:26.600> much<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.840> same

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
we're just simply sauteing this and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.880 
we're just simply sauteing this and
bring<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.780> all<00:02:32.870> those<00:02:33.050> flavors<00:02:33.230> all<00:02:33.650> together

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890
