00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
I like my texturizing sprays I like my

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.920 
I like my texturizing sprays I like my
hair<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:47.070> be<00:04:47.100> sort<00:04:47.460> of<00:04:47.490> beachy<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.210> wavy<00:04:48.900> and

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
hair to be sort of beachy and wavy and

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.500 
hair to be sort of beachy and wavy and
just<00:04:49.500> not<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.890> polish<00:04:50.220> not<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.700> sleep<00:04:50.970> but<00:04:51.330> a

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
just not to polish not to sleep but a

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.900 
just not to polish not to sleep but a
little<00:04:52.020> bit<00:04:52.200> missy's<00:04:52.710> of<00:04:52.980> beachy<00:04:53.430> so<00:04:53.640> a

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
little bit missy's of beachy so a

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.060 
little bit missy's of beachy so a
texturizing<00:04:54.660> spray<00:04:54.930> is<00:04:55.320> perfect<00:04:55.770> for<00:04:55.950> that

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
texturizing spray is perfect for that

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.280 
texturizing spray is perfect for that
and<00:04:56.370> this<00:04:57.120> has<00:04:57.300> been<00:04:57.420> my<00:04:57.600> favorite<00:04:58.020> I've<00:04:58.140> been

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
and this has been my favorite I've been

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.870 
and this has been my favorite I've been
using<00:04:58.500> it<00:04:58.710> for<00:04:58.740> a<00:04:58.890> few<00:04:59.070> months<00:04:59.220> now<00:04:59.370> and<00:04:59.670> I

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
using it for a few months now and I

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.070 
using it for a few months now and I
don't<00:04:59.940> know<00:05:00.150> why<00:05:00.300> I<00:05:00.330> didn't<00:05:00.600> mention<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:00.900> in<00:05:01.050> my

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
don't know why I didn't mention it in my

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.780 
don't know why I didn't mention it in my
previous<00:05:01.560> monthly<00:05:01.980> favorites<00:05:02.370> so<00:05:02.490> I<00:05:02.520> thought

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
previous monthly favorites so I thought

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.060 
previous monthly favorites so I thought
I'd<00:05:02.940> mention<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.360> today<00:05:03.690> and<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:04.590> just<00:05:04.830> comes

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
I'd mention it today and it just comes

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.490 
I'd mention it today and it just comes
in<00:05:05.280> this<00:05:05.460> sort<00:05:05.700> of<00:05:05.730> spray<00:05:06.120> and<00:05:06.480> it<00:05:07.260> always

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
in this sort of spray and it always

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.410 
in this sort of spray and it always
smells<00:05:08.010> like<00:05:08.100> salt<00:05:08.550> so<00:05:08.760> I'm<00:05:08.850> thinking<00:05:09.270> there

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
smells like salt so I'm thinking there

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.060 
smells like salt so I'm thinking there
is<00:05:09.450> definitely<00:05:09.900> some<00:05:10.140> salt<00:05:10.410> in<00:05:10.530> this<00:05:10.710> so<00:05:10.950> it

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
is definitely some salt in this so it

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.250 
is definitely some salt in this so it
could<00:05:11.280> be<00:05:11.310> like<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.610> salt<00:05:12.000> sprite<00:05:12.330> but<00:05:12.570> it's

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
could be like a salt sprite but it's

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.930 
could be like a salt sprite but it's
just<00:05:13.470> called<00:05:13.680> texturizing<00:05:14.130> spray<00:05:14.370> and<00:05:14.760> a
