now finally render the videos way faster

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.289 
now finally render the videos way faster
and<00:01:54.630> also<00:01:54.750> obviously<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.729> 1080p<00:01:56.729> instead<00:01:57.210> of

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
and also obviously in a 1080p instead of

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.560 
and also obviously in a 1080p instead of
the<00:01:57.600> 30<00:01:57.960> FPS<00:01:58.380> also<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.090> last<00:02:00.240> video<00:02:00.420> i

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
the 30 FPS also just in the last video i

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.440 
the 30 FPS also just in the last video i
tested<00:02:00.960> recording<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.500> 60<00:02:01.920> FPS<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.610> it

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
tested recording a 60 FPS but it

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.420 
tested recording a 60 FPS but it
actually<00:02:03.890> doesn't<00:02:04.890> turn<00:02:05.100> out<00:02:05.130> too<00:02:05.400> well

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
actually doesn't turn out too well

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.089 
actually doesn't turn out too well
because<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.540> interlaces<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.320> frame

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
because it just interlaces the frame

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.669 
because it just interlaces the frame
stand<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.759> when<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.569> stop<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.929> video<00:02:10.049> in

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
stand and when you stop the video in

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.500 
stand and when you stop the video in
general<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.220> looks<00:02:11.549> a<00:02:11.670> little<00:02:11.819> bit<00:02:11.970> weird<00:02:12.299> and

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
general it looks a little bit weird and

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.890 
general it looks a little bit weird and
you<00:02:12.930> can<00:02:13.079> unfortunately<00:02:13.349> not<00:02:13.799> upload<00:02:14.249> through
