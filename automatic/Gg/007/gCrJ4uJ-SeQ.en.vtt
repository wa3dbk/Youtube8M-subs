guitars tell me what major difference
you<00:00:57.539> see<00:00:57.570> here<00:00:59.570> maybe<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> giant<00:01:01.379> gaping

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
you see here maybe it's the giant gaping

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.210 
you see here maybe it's the giant gaping
hole<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.670> one<00:01:02.989> see<00:01:03.989> basically<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.070> is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
hole in this one see basically this is

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.730

day<00:01:12.000> connects<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.630> Xbox<00:01:13.409> 360<00:01:13.950> guitar<00:01:14.220> when

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
day connects is a Xbox 360 guitar when

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.090 
day connects is a Xbox 360 guitar when
it<00:01:14.909> connects<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> Xbox<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.290> connects<00:01:16.890> as

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
it connects in the Xbox it connects as

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.710 
it connects in the Xbox it connects as
an<00:01:17.280> entirely<00:01:17.850> separate<00:01:18.330> controller

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
an entirely separate controller

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.140 
an entirely separate controller
therefore<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.680> goes<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.979> direct<00:01:20.280> all<00:01:20.490> signals

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
therefore it goes to direct all signals

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.060 
therefore it goes to direct all signals
sent<00:01:21.390> wirelessly<00:01:21.659> from<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.290> go<00:01:22.650> directly

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
sent wirelessly from this go directly

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.570 
sent wirelessly from this go directly
into<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.580> right<00:01:24.570> into<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> Xbox<00:01:25.340> this<00:01:26.340> on

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
into this right into the Xbox this on

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.859 
into this right into the Xbox this on
the<00:01:26.700> other<00:01:26.820> hand<00:01:29.150> you<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> controller

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the other hand you have the controller

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.410 
the other hand you have the controller
stuck<00:01:31.439> inside<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.549> when<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.820> tap<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
stuck inside here so when you tap the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.109 
stuck inside here so when you tap the
signal<00:01:33.960> goes<00:01:34.110> through<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> controller<00:01:35.119> then

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
signal goes through the controller then

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.690 
signal goes through the controller then
to<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> Wii<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.590> then<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> result

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
to the Wii and then you get the result

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.149 
to the Wii and then you get the result
making<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.600> little<00:01:40.290> making<00:01:41.220> about<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
making a little making about a

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.179 
making a little making about a
significant<00:01:44.540> delay<00:01:45.540> time<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.020> mean<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:47.159> I

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
significant delay time I mean when I

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.440 
significant delay time I mean when I
play<00:01:47.549> guitar<00:01:48.390> hero<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.290> 360<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.970> my<00:01:51.119> TV

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
play guitar hero on the 360 and on my TV

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.719 
play guitar hero on the 360 and on my TV
the<00:01:51.899> lag<00:01:52.259> time<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.590> set<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.070> about<00:01:53.159> 10

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the lag time I set is about 10

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.050 
the lag time I set is about 10
milliseconds<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.670> set<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.880> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
milliseconds on this I have to set it to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.950 
milliseconds on this I have to set it to
about<00:01:58.369> 60<00:01:59.369> milliseconds<00:02:00.149> that's<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.570> 50

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
about 60 milliseconds that's a 50

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.690 
about 60 milliseconds that's a 50
millisecond<00:02:01.500> difference<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.490> higher

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
millisecond difference and the higher

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.340 
millisecond difference and the higher
you<00:02:02.880> go<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> lag<00:02:03.540> calibration<00:02:04.170> settings

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
you go on the lag calibration settings

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.990 
you go on the lag calibration settings
then<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.009> know<00:02:05.159> it's<00:02:05.490> not<00:02:05.729> going<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.939> be

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
then you know it's not going to be

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.429 
then you know it's not going to be
perfect<00:02:06.390> when<00:02:06.509> you're<00:02:06.600> going<00:02:06.960> up<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.229> high

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
perfect when you're going up that high

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.800 
perfect when you're going up that high
and<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:08.160> ridiculously<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.119> even<00:02:09.450> then<00:02:09.629> it

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
and it's ridiculously and even then it

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.050 
and it's ridiculously and even then it
still<00:02:09.929> doesn't<00:02:10.229> feel<00:02:10.379> adjusted

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
still doesn't feel adjusted

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.870 
still doesn't feel adjusted
right<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:12.100> there's<00:02:13.100> even<00:02:13.370> more<00:02:13.400> wrong<00:02:13.819> with

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
right and there's even more wrong with

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.240 
right and there's even more wrong with
this<00:02:14.090> guitar<00:02:14.270> than<00:02:14.630> that<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:15.050> mean<00:02:15.530> if<00:02:16.040> you

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
this guitar than that I mean if you

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.250 
this guitar than that I mean if you
think<00:02:16.280> about<00:02:16.610> it

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
think about it

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.190 
think about it
this<00:02:18.260> guitar<00:02:18.500> cost<00:02:19.160> just<00:02:19.490> as<00:02:19.670> much<00:02:19.700> as<00:02:20.360> this

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
this guitar cost just as much as this

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.500 
this guitar cost just as much as this
one<00:02:21.850> but<00:02:22.850> if<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.959> think<00:02:24.080> about<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.470> but<00:02:25.160> this

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
one but if you think about it but this

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.320 
one but if you think about it but this
it's<00:02:26.510> basically<00:02:26.840> just<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.410> hollow<00:02:27.620> shell<00:02:27.920> very

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
it's basically just a hollow shell very

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.270 
it's basically just a hollow shell very
ordinary<00:02:29.330> very<00:02:29.720> plain<00:02:30.020> when<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:30.830> hit<00:02:31.069> the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
ordinary very plain when you hit the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.670 
ordinary very plain when you hit the
commands<00:02:31.940> when<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.540> activate<00:02:33.020> star<00:02:33.230> power<00:02:33.470> by

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
commands when you activate star power by

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.949 
commands when you activate star power by
tilting<00:02:33.890> up<00:02:34.220> it's<00:02:34.700> not<00:02:34.880> there<00:02:35.360> is<00:02:35.510> no<00:02:35.690> motion

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
tilting up it's not there is no motion

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.900 
tilting up it's not there is no motion
there<00:02:36.500> are<00:02:36.650> no<00:02:36.800> accelerometers<00:02:37.610> in<00:02:37.640> the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
there are no accelerometers in the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.850 
there are no accelerometers in the
guitar<00:02:38.209> itself<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:39.050> determine<00:02:39.170> that's<00:02:39.620> being

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
guitar itself to determine that's being

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.010 
guitar itself to determine that's being
lifted<00:02:40.130> up<00:02:40.430> that's<00:02:41.330> actually<00:02:41.900> that

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
lifted up that's actually that

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.509 
lifted up that's actually that
technology's<00:02:42.560> actually<00:02:42.950> in<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.160> controller

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
technology's actually in the controller

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.850 
technology's actually in the controller
which<00:02:43.820> makes<00:02:44.360> this<00:02:44.570> a<00:02:44.810> significantly<00:02:45.590> cheaper

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
which makes this a significantly cheaper

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.840 
which makes this a significantly cheaper
guitar<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.850> produce<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:48.160> yet<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.340> costs<00:02:49.580> just

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
guitar to produce and yet it costs just

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.009 
guitar to produce and yet it costs just
as<00:02:50.000> much<00:02:50.150> as<00:02:50.300> this<00:02:50.390> which<00:02:50.660> has<00:02:50.870> an

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
as much as this which has an

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.960 
as much as this which has an
accelerometer<00:02:51.470> in<00:02:51.800> it<00:02:52.010> for<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.519> star<00:02:52.730> power

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
accelerometer in it for the star power

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.590 
accelerometer in it for the star power
and<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:54.380> just<00:02:54.800> isn't<00:02:55.220> right<00:02:55.519> at<00:02:55.790> all<00:02:55.940> if<00:02:56.450> you

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
and that just isn't right at all if you

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.520 
and that just isn't right at all if you
think<00:02:56.840> about<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.230> another<00:02:58.069> I<00:02:58.340> mean<00:02:58.870> also<00:02:59.870> it's

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
think about it another I mean also it's

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.470 
think about it another I mean also it's
ridiculously<00:03:01.340> battery<00:03:01.819> draining<00:03:02.150> for<00:03:02.269> a<00:03:02.330> Wii

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
ridiculously battery draining for a Wii

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.210 
ridiculously battery draining for a Wii
Remote<00:03:02.840> for<00:03:03.110> control<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.680> it's<00:03:03.890> already

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
Remote for control of it's already

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.890 
Remote for control of it's already
ridiculously<00:03:04.760> battery<00:03:05.150> draining<00:03:05.510> as<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.780> is

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
ridiculously battery draining as it is

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.710 
ridiculously battery draining as it is
this<00:03:06.440> just<00:03:06.680> drains<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.160> even<00:03:07.370> more<00:03:07.720> because

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
this just drains it even more because

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.390 
this just drains it even more because
you<00:03:09.019> also<00:03:09.170> have<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.500> rumble<00:03:09.800> feature<00:03:09.950> which

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
you also have the rumble feature which

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.670 
you also have the rumble feature which
is<00:03:10.700> just<00:03:11.510> set<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.019> a<00:03:12.170> ridiculous<00:03:12.650> degree

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
is just set to a ridiculous degree

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.530 
is just set to a ridiculous degree
because<00:03:13.190> as<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.430> shake<00:03:13.670> this<00:03:13.819> entire<00:03:14.150> guitar

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
because as to shake this entire guitar

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.830 
because as to shake this entire guitar
in<00:03:15.350> order<00:03:15.920> for<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.190> feel<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:16.430> this<00:03:17.120> they

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
in order for you to feel it this they

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.229 
in order for you to feel it this they
know<00:03:18.049> Roman<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.709> mean<00:03:19.070> when<00:03:19.760> they<00:03:19.850> decided<00:03:20.150> that

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
know Roman I mean when they decided that

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.699 
know Roman I mean when they decided that
3/6<00:03:20.810> either<00:03:20.959> like<00:03:21.110> you<00:03:21.230> know<00:03:21.320> what<00:03:21.440> rumbling

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
3/6 either like you know what rumbling

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.170 
3/6 either like you know what rumbling
isn't<00:03:22.130> really<00:03:22.310> in<00:03:22.400> essential<00:03:22.760> parts<00:03:23.030> they

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
isn't really in essential parts they

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.699 
isn't really in essential parts they
just<00:03:23.360> took<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.600> rumble<00:03:23.930> out<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.590> it

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
just took the rumble out of it

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.640 
just took the rumble out of it
altogether<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.459> that's<00:03:25.549> fine<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:27.440> hear

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
altogether and that's fine and you hear

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.199 
altogether and that's fine and you hear
the<00:03:27.739> clanking<00:03:28.100> noises<00:03:28.280> in<00:03:28.579> here<00:03:28.820> as<00:03:28.940> opposed

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
the clanking noises in here as opposed

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.259 
the clanking noises in here as opposed
to<00:03:29.329> on<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.510> TV<00:03:29.780> with<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:29.989> 361<00:03:30.709> but<00:03:31.459> also

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
to on the TV with the 361 but also

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.699 
to on the TV with the 361 but also
another<00:03:33.049> huge<00:03:33.640> fault<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:34.850> this<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.590> let's<00:03:36.590> say

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
another huge fault to this is let's say

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.319 
another huge fault to this is let's say
you<00:03:36.860> have<00:03:37.010> a<00:03:37.130> bunch<00:03:37.370> of<00:03:37.489> puns<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:37.850> won't<00:03:38.150> play

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
you have a bunch of puns that won't play

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.860 
you have a bunch of puns that won't play
you<00:03:39.079> have<00:03:39.170> one<00:03:39.410> wheel<00:03:39.590> remote<00:03:40.660> but<00:03:41.660> you<00:03:41.750> have

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
you have one wheel remote but you have

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.099 
you have one wheel remote but you have
two<00:03:42.049> guitars<00:03:42.440> you're<00:03:43.340> beat<00:03:43.549> because<00:03:44.329> you<00:03:44.900> need

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
two guitars you're beat because you need

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.170 
two guitars you're beat because you need
an<00:03:45.350> additional<00:03:45.590> Wii<00:03:45.950> Remote<00:03:46.250> for<00:03:46.459> each<00:03:46.730> guitar

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
an additional Wii Remote for each guitar

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.280 
an additional Wii Remote for each guitar
that<00:03:47.720> you<00:03:47.840> use<00:03:48.200> therefore<00:03:50.170> even<00:03:51.170> though<00:03:51.230> you

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
that you use therefore even though you

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.900 
that you use therefore even though you
bought<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.739> guitar<00:03:51.859> and<00:03:52.190> you<00:03:52.250> can't<00:03:52.489> use<00:03:52.730> it

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
bought the guitar and you can't use it

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.880 
bought the guitar and you can't use it
unless<00:03:53.060> you<00:03:53.239> have<00:03:53.329> another<00:03:53.510> wheel<00:03:53.750> note<00:03:53.989> where

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
unless you have another wheel note where

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.910 
unless you have another wheel note where
as<00:03:55.010> opposed<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:55.430> this<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:56.150> can<00:03:56.329> just<00:03:56.829> for<00:03:57.829> each

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
as opposed to this you can just for each

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.140 
as opposed to this you can just for each
guitar<00:03:58.130> you<00:03:58.400> use<00:03:58.579> you<00:03:58.730> know<00:03:58.820> it<00:03:58.880> doesn't

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
guitar you use you know it doesn't

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.300 
guitar you use you know it doesn't
matter<00:03:59.269> how<00:03:59.420> many<00:03:59.480> 360<00:04:00.079> controllers<00:04:00.950> you<00:04:01.130> have
