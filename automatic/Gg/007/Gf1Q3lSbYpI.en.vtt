00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
hey guys what is up glitch D and today

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.360 
hey guys what is up glitch D and today
we<00:00:12.090> will<00:00:12.240> be<00:00:12.300> getting<00:00:12.600> the<00:00:13.260> DNA<00:00:13.470> splicers<00:00:14.160> to

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
we will be getting the DNA splicers to

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
we will be getting the DNA splicers to
turn<00:00:14.610> QM<00:00:15.390> into<00:00:15.840> white<00:00:16.650> QM<00:00:17.010> or<00:00:17.220> black<00:00:17.520> um<00:00:17.970> so

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
will give you the D and you show her a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.270 
will give you the D and you show her a
cube<00:00:46.410> I'm<00:00:46.500> sure<00:00:46.649> we'll<00:00:46.739> give<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> DNA

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
cube I'm sure we'll give you the DNA

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.639 
cube I'm sure we'll give you the DNA
splicers<00:00:47.730> sadly<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.870> already<00:00:49.680> got<00:00:50.130> them<00:00:50.430> but

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
splicers sadly I already got them but

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.619 
splicers sadly I already got them but
the<00:00:52.649> great<00:00:53.190> Pokemon<00:00:53.579> QM<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:54.000> use<00:00:54.149> those<00:00:54.300> DNA

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the great Pokemon QM can use those DNA

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.740 
the great Pokemon QM can use those DNA
spacers<00:00:55.079> then<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.040> can<00:00:56.280> absolutely<00:00:56.910> sham<00:00:57.600> or

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
spacers then it can absolutely sham or

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.990 
spacers then it can absolutely sham or
Zek<00:00:57.989> around<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> just<00:00:59.670> talk<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.820> her<00:00:59.910> and

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
Zek around so just talk to her and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.830 
Zek around so just talk to her and
she'll<00:01:00.059> go<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.360> and<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.570> that's<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
she'll go to you and then that's the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.560 
she'll go to you and then that's the
next<00:01:01.050> time<00:01:01.200> she'll<00:01:01.440> say<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:02.239> was<00:01:03.239> going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
next time she'll say I was going to the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.570 
next time she'll say I was going to the
bag<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.079> look<00:01:04.409> at<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> DNA<00:01:04.949> splitters<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.489> you

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
bag and look at the DNA splitters as you

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.789 
bag and look at the DNA splitters as you
can<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:05.850> right<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.600> splice<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.320> fuses

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
can see right there a splice that fuses

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.560 
can see right there a splice that fuses
Kurama<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.369> certain<00:01:08.640> pokémon<00:01:08.790> they're<00:01:09.360> said

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
Kurama in a certain pokémon they're said

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.710 
Kurama in a certain pokémon they're said
to<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.869> been<00:01:10.409> one<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> beginning

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
to have been one in the beginning

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:20.929 
to have been one in the beginning
alright<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.869> actually<00:01:16.260> let's<00:01:16.710> go<00:01:17.630> use<00:01:19.939> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
alright so actually let's go use the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.109 
alright so actually let's go use the
DNA's<00:01:21.270> place<00:01:21.570> here<00:01:22.460> okay<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> DNA<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.909> best

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
DNA's place here okay the DNA is best

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.260 
DNA's place here okay the DNA is best
right<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.260> use<00:01:25.470> QM<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.700> then

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
right here it's like you use QM and then

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.640 
right here it's like you use QM and then
go<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.659> select<00:01:27.810> rich<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.290> more<00:01:28.470> tech

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
go and select rich and I'm more tech

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.179 
go and select rich and I'm more tech
around

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
around

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.469 
around
I<00:01:29.220> have<00:01:29.520> rush<00:01:29.700> RAM<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.659> case<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.479> then

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
I have rush RAM in this case and then

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.940 
I have rush RAM in this case and then
we'll<00:01:33.600> fuse<00:01:33.900> together<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.439> create<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:36.950> gem

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
we'll fuse together to create one gem

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.030 
we'll fuse together to create one gem

to<00:01:55.259> send<00:01:55.409> up<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.680> mighty<00:01:55.979> beast<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
to send up this mighty beast in the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.319 
to send up this mighty beast in the
battle<00:01:56.970> to<00:01:57.000> eat<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:58.110> scatterbug

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
battle to eat up a little scatterbug

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.200 
battle to eat up a little scatterbug
you'll<00:02:00.329> destroy<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.520> there<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.820> look<00:02:03.060> at

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
you'll destroy it there it is look at

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.719 
you'll destroy it there it is look at
that<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.570> thing's<00:02:03.869> massive<00:02:04.670> compared<00:02:05.670> to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that this thing's massive compared to

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.590 
that this thing's massive compared to
scatterbug

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
scatterbug

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.239 
scatterbug
scatterbug<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.500> probably<00:02:07.829> sitting<00:02:08.039> there

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:08.249 
scatterbug is probably sitting there

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:10.420 
scatterbug is probably sitting there
like<00:02:08.489> peanuts<00:02:09.209> pants<00:02:09.689> right<00:02:09.840> now

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
like peanuts pants right now

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.160 
like peanuts pants right now
so<00:02:11.430> here's<00:02:11.669> one<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.909> the<00:02:11.969> signature<00:02:12.419> moves

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
so here's one of the signature moves
