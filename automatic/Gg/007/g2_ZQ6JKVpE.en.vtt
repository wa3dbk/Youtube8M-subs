requested for the benchmark bring you
for<00:00:07.490> xolo<00:00:08.490> q500<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.690> have<00:00:10.200> done<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.349> bench

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
for xolo q500 I have done a bench

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.209 
for xolo q500 I have done a bench
McGriff<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.690> of<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:13.139> one<00:00:13.380> already<00:00:13.650> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
McGriff you of of this one already the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.510 
McGriff you of of this one already the
score<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.549> pretty<00:00:14.940> good<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.900> as<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.170> can<00:00:16.350> see

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
score is pretty good and as you can see

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.140 
score is pretty good and as you can see
Scott<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.730> score<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.270> 11,000<00:00:18.900> 218<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.150> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
Scott this score of 11,000 218 and the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:29.410 
Scott this score of 11,000 218 and the
ranking<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:23.119> I<00:00:24.119> think<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:27.830> it's<00:00:28.830> about

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
ranking is I think it's it so it's about

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.770 
ranking is I think it's it so it's about
HTC<00:00:30.420> One<00:00:30.660> X<00:00:30.929> okay<00:00:31.650> HTC<00:00:32.640> One<00:00:32.820> X<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.360> comes<00:00:33.600> on

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
HTC One X okay HTC One X so it comes on

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.229 
HTC One X okay HTC One X so it comes on
top<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:36.710> so<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.850> see<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
top of that and so you can see the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.900 
top of that and so you can see the
details<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:40.160> this<00:00:41.160> form<00:00:41.520> here<00:00:42.950> okay<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
details of this form here okay the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.360 
details of this form here okay the
banking<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.530> bar<00:00:49.739> chart<00:00:50.070> which<00:00:50.219> I

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
banking so this is the bar chart which I

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.459 
banking so this is the bar chart which I
think<00:00:50.579> everyone<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.059> interested<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.629> right<00:00:51.840> so

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
think everyone is interested in right so

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.049 
think everyone is interested in right so
these<00:00:52.739> are<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.890> top<00:00:53.160> 20<00:00:53.520> phones<00:00:53.760> right<00:00:54.000> now

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
these are the top 20 phones right now

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.029 
these are the top 20 phones right now
and<00:00:54.570> as<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.680> see<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:57.230> solo<00:00:58.230> queue<00:00:58.680> hundred

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and as you can see a solo queue hundred

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.369 
and as you can see a solo queue hundred
is<00:00:59.129> placed<00:00:59.609> here<00:00:59.789> okay<00:01:00.359> at<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.449> code<00:01:00.809> just

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
is placed here okay at this code just

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.889 
is placed here okay at this code just
below<00:01:01.710> HTC<00:01:02.219> One<00:01:02.399> X<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.850> course<00:01:03.539> its<00:01:03.660> reach

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
below HTC One X of course its reach

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.929 
below HTC One X of course its reach
studying<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.470> better<00:01:04.680> than<00:01:04.860> samsung<00:01:05.100> galaxy

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
studying it's better than samsung galaxy

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.740 
studying it's better than samsung galaxy
s2<00:01:06.170> which<00:01:07.170> was<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> pretty<00:01:07.619> good<00:01:07.799> form<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.750> I

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
s2 which was a pretty good form and I

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.240 
s2 which was a pretty good form and I
think<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.170> tells<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.530> lot<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.830> things<00:01:11.040> about

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
think this tells a lot of things about

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.800 
think this tells a lot of things about
this<00:01:11.430> phone<00:01:11.490> being<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.000> quad-core<00:01:12.270> processor

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
this phone being a quad-core processor

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.880 
this phone being a quad-core processor
and<00:01:12.960> 1gb<00:01:13.110> ram<00:01:13.760> it's<00:01:14.760> pretty<00:01:15.090> good<00:01:15.240> form<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.860> I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and 1gb ram it's pretty good form so I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.710 
and 1gb ram it's pretty good form so I
just<00:01:17.159> try<00:01:17.460> though<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.030> test<00:01:18.240> again<00:01:18.600> okay<00:01:20.720> so

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
just try though the test again okay so

00:01:21.720 --> 00:02:13.010 
just try though the test again okay so
we<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.030> full<00:01:24.030> test<00:01:24.299> actually<00:01:24.540> no

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.620 

the<00:02:13.860> tests<00:02:14.250> actually<00:02:14.340> if<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.090> know<00:02:15.300> how<00:02:15.480> this

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
the tests actually if you know how this

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.950 
the tests actually if you know how this
does<00:02:15.900> work<00:02:15.980> they<00:02:16.980> do<00:02:17.130> some<00:02:17.840> lot<00:02:18.840> of

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
does work they do some lot of

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.060 
does work they do some lot of
computations<00:02:19.650> inside<00:02:20.660> some<00:02:22.070> instructions

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
computations inside some instructions

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.350 
computations inside some instructions
they<00:02:23.220> call<00:02:23.400> instruction<00:02:23.730> computer

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
they call instruction computer

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.900 
they call instruction computer
instructions<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.580> they<00:02:26.580> do<00:02:26.730> some

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
instructions and they do some

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.880 
instructions and they do some
sophisticated<00:02:27.570> testing<00:02:28.380> actually<00:02:28.770> with

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
sophisticated testing actually with

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.430 
sophisticated testing actually with
instructions<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.700> all<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.600> don't<00:02:31.290> go

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
instructions and all so don't go

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.900 
instructions and all so don't go
completely<00:02:31.890> with<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:32.400> tests<00:02:32.790> actually

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
completely with this tests actually

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.940 
completely with this tests actually
these<00:02:33.300> tests<00:02:33.570> don't<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:34.110> lot<00:02:34.320> of<00:02:34.380> things<00:02:34.830> but

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
these tests don't a lot of things but

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.580 
these tests don't a lot of things but
definitely<00:02:35.700> give<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:35.910> some<00:02:36.620> flu<00:02:37.620> about<00:02:38.510> the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
definitely give you some flu about the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.620 
definitely give you some flu about the
CPU<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.070> everything<00:02:41.280> but<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.270> won't<00:02:42.480> tell

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
CPU is and everything but it won't tell

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.590 
CPU is and everything but it won't tell
you<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.930> whole<00:02:43.110> story<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:44.400> I'm<00:02:44.520> not<00:02:44.670> very<00:02:44.910> I'm

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
you the whole story so I'm not very I'm

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.450 
you the whole story so I'm not very I'm
not<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.810> big<00:02:46.020> fan<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.320> all<00:02:46.620> these<00:02:46.830> tests<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.370> all

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
not a big fan of all these tests and all

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.660 
not a big fan of all these tests and all
because<00:02:47.720> most<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.930> time<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:50.220> operating

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
because most of the time the operating

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.280 
because most of the time the operating
system<00:02:51.000> which<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.330> runs<00:02:51.600> makes<00:02:51.960> a<00:02:52.110> lot<00:02:52.260> of

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
system which it runs makes a lot of

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.350 
system which it runs makes a lot of
difference<00:02:52.800> maybe<00:02:53.070> if<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.520> is<00:02:53.640> using<00:02:54.090> stock

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
difference maybe if it is using stock

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.420 
difference maybe if it is using stock
Android<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:55.500> will<00:02:55.620> be<00:02:55.740> definitely<00:02:55.890> faster

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
Android it will be definitely faster

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.220 
Android it will be definitely faster
than<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.930> other<00:02:58.020> Android<00:02:58.470> questions<00:03:00.080> so<00:03:01.080> it

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
than the other Android questions so it

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.400 
than the other Android questions so it
all<00:03:01.350> depends<00:03:01.710> upon<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.310> question<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.410> Android

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
all depends upon the question of Android

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.120 
all depends upon the question of Android
it<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.740> running<00:03:05.100> as<00:03:05.280> well<00:03:05.460> as<00:03:05.610> whether<00:03:05.820> it<00:03:06.090> is

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
it is running as well as whether it is

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.860 
it is running as well as whether it is
plain<00:03:08.130> Android<00:03:08.700> or<00:03:08.910> whether<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.510> running

xolo<00:03:19.950> hasn't<00:03:20.400> changed<00:03:20.790> much<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.420> Android

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
xolo hasn't changed much of the Android

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.490 
xolo hasn't changed much of the Android
interface<00:03:22.020> it's<00:03:22.410> almost<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:24.500> standard

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
interface it's almost the standard

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.770 
interface it's almost the standard
Android<00:03:25.890> 4.1<00:03:26.880> point<00:03:27.240> which<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.480> living

Android 4.1 point which a living

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.520 
Android 4.1 point which a living
interface<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:28.350> it's<00:03:28.500> pretty<00:03:28.709> fast<00:03:29.490> and<00:03:29.790> smooth

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
interface so it's pretty fast and smooth

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.110

micromax comes with their own interface
which<00:03:39.660> is<00:03:39.780> again<00:03:41.209> pretty<00:03:42.209> slow<00:03:42.480> actually<00:03:42.690> into

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
which is again pretty slow actually into

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.160 
which is again pretty slow actually into
face<00:03:43.290> even<00:03:43.440> Samsung<00:03:43.890> has<00:03:44.070> its<00:03:44.250> own<00:03:44.430> interface

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
face even Samsung has its own interface

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.480 
face even Samsung has its own interface
except<00:03:46.170> carbon<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.650> think<00:03:46.860> I<00:03:46.950> think<00:03:47.160> carbon

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490

they are doing some intensive graphic
dressed<00:03:54.000> right<00:03:54.240> now<00:03:54.800> some<00:03:55.800> these<00:03:56.220> are

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
intensive graphic does it's going on

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.680 
intensive graphic does it's going on
very<00:03:58.560> well<00:03:58.709> it's<00:03:59.520> kind<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.850> you<00:04:00.270> can<00:04:00.420> see<00:04:00.570> the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
very well it's kind of you can see the

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.410 
very well it's kind of you can see the
screen<00:04:00.959> here<00:04:01.520> it's<00:04:02.520> going<00:04:02.790> on<00:04:02.940> pretty<00:04:03.120> well

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
screen here it's going on pretty well

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:13.800 
screen here it's going on pretty well
lined<00:04:03.720> up<00:04:04.110> is<00:04:05.070> able<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.490> compute<00:04:05.820> everything

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.570 

yeah<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:14.990> Tory<00:04:15.230> performance<00:04:15.920> you<00:04:16.130> can<00:04:16.430> see

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
yeah the Tory performance you can see

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.910 
yeah the Tory performance you can see
the<00:04:16.730> frame<00:04:16.940> rate<00:04:17.150> is<00:04:17.299> pretty<00:04:17.510> low<00:04:17.870> here<00:04:18.170> it<00:04:18.739> is

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
the frame rate is pretty low here it is

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.120 
the frame rate is pretty low here it is
around<00:04:19.130> seven<00:04:19.489> point<00:04:19.820> two<00:04:19.940> so<00:04:20.650> so<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.799> 2d

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
around seven point two so so the 2d

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.160 
around seven point two so so the 2d
graphics<00:04:22.490> chip<00:04:22.970> actually<00:04:23.450> which<00:04:23.600> runs<00:04:23.870> here<00:04:24.140> i

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
graphics chip actually which runs here i

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.150 
graphics chip actually which runs here i
think<00:04:24.500> it<00:04:24.560> is<00:04:24.590> open<00:04:25.100> GI<00:04:25.340> opengl<00:04:26.030> es<00:04:26.240> 2.0<00:04:27.160> it's

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
think it is open GI opengl es 2.0 it's

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.760 
think it is open GI opengl es 2.0 it's
not<00:04:28.490> very<00:04:28.820> smooth<00:04:29.390> here<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:29.960> can<00:04:30.140> make<00:04:30.320> or<00:04:30.590> no

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
not very smooth here you can make or no

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.160 
not very smooth here you can make or no
make<00:04:31.100> some<00:04:31.400> difference<00:04:31.640> here<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.840> can<00:04:33.020> see

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
make some difference here you can see

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.620 
make some difference here you can see
the<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.740> thing<00:04:34.310> here<00:04:34.520> it's<00:04:34.700> not<00:04:34.910> very<00:04:35.090> smooth

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
the the thing here it's not very smooth

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.170 
the the thing here it's not very smooth
tough<00:04:36.020> law<00:04:36.260> because<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:36.980> frame<00:04:37.280> rate<00:04:37.520> is<00:04:37.700> a

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
tough law because the frame rate is a

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.030 
tough law because the frame rate is a
bit<00:04:38.540> low<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:39.020> even<00:04:39.230> the<00:04:39.350> triangles<00:04:39.860> you<00:04:39.920> can

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
bit low and even the triangles you can

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.400 
bit low and even the triangles you can
see<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:40.490> it's<00:04:41.060> a<00:04:41.150> bit<00:04:41.330> low<00:04:41.540> slow<00:04:41.960> on<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.200> side

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
see you it's a bit low slow on the side

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.850 
see you it's a bit low slow on the side
and<00:04:44.380> benchmark<00:04:45.380> is<00:04:45.500> over<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:46.150> you<00:04:47.150> can<00:04:47.330> see

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
and benchmark is over and you can see

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.350 
and benchmark is over and you can see
now<00:04:48.860> tries<00:04:49.160> to<00:04:49.340> compare<00:04:49.700> their<00:04:49.880> benchmark

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
now tries to compare their benchmark

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.810 
now tries to compare their benchmark
with<00:04:50.510> this<00:04:51.080> form<00:04:51.410> which<00:04:51.740> is<00:04:51.920> basically<00:04:52.370> it<00:04:52.580> is

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
with this form which is basically it is

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.610 
with this form which is basically it is
close<00:04:53.630> to<00:04:53.810> eleven<00:04:54.080> thousand<00:04:54.500> two<00:04:54.590> hundred

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
close to eleven thousand two hundred

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.170 
close to eleven thousand two hundred
year<00:04:56.920> 1400<00:04:57.920> here<00:04:58.040> okay<00:04:58.400> so<00:04:58.460> it's<00:04:58.730> just<00:04:58.940> about

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
year 1400 here okay so it's just about

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.440 
year 1400 here okay so it's just about
the<00:04:59.240> galaxy<00:04:59.750> s2<00:04:59.900> I<00:05:00.320> think<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:01.340> helps<00:05:01.670> about

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
the galaxy s2 I think that helps about

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.260 
the galaxy s2 I think that helps about
the<00:05:02.720> benchmarking<00:05:03.700> thanks<00:05:04.700> this<00:05:05.150> is<00:05:05.210> the
