emerald green and I thought this is a
tricky<00:01:37.110> color<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.860> work<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:39.090> because<00:01:39.450> I

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
tricky color to work with just because I

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.050 
tricky color to work with just because I
don't<00:01:40.409> know<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.130> weird<00:01:41.430> color<00:01:41.790> for

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.520 
don't know it's like a weird color for
my<00:01:42.150> skin<00:01:42.420> tone<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.869> bought<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.500> I

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
my skin tone but I bought it so I

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.010 
my skin tone but I bought it so I
figured<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.250> got<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.820> find<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.090> way<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.810> make
