00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
interested in the void in this part here

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.370 
interested in the void in this part here
and<00:03:16.640> as<00:03:17.030> with<00:03:17.420> his<00:03:17.570> sculpture

and as with his sculpture

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.550 
and as with his sculpture
he's<00:03:18.920> produced<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.940> situation<00:03:20.510> in<00:03:20.630> which<00:03:20.750> this

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
he's produced a situation in which this

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.320 
he's produced a situation in which this
could<00:03:21.980> go<00:03:22.220> right<00:03:22.490> through<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.880> back<00:03:23.060> of<00:03:23.090> this

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
could go right through the back of this

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.420 
could go right through the back of this
wall<00:03:23.600> considering<00:03:24.470> it's<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.769> black<00:03:25.100> that's

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
wall considering it's the black that's

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.850 
wall considering it's the black that's
underneath<00:03:25.850> in<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.180> red<00:03:26.390> that's<00:03:26.570> on<00:03:26.780> top<00:03:27.080> the

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.400 
underneath in the red that's on top the
effect<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.400> he's<00:03:28.670> got<00:03:28.910> here<00:03:29.239> is<00:03:29.420> of<00:03:29.840> black<00:03:30.080> on

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
effect that he's got here is of black on

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.220 
effect that he's got here is of black on
top<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:30.980> red<00:03:31.190> underneath<00:03:31.550> and<00:03:32.420> I<00:03:32.660> mean<00:03:33.050> that's

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
top and red underneath and I mean that's

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.500 
top and red underneath and I mean that's
magic<00:03:33.769> that<00:03:34.010> is<00:03:34.160> absolute<00:03:34.730> magic<00:03:35.150> what's

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
magic that is absolute magic what's

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.850 
magic that is absolute magic what's
