 many years ago and we are 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.739

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.800
 capabilities and fantastic experience 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.950
 of the Koreans in this subject of 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.280
 recovery of rivers for example one of 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.400
 the 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.860
 let's say the 20 worldwide was 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.840
 england in the river recovery 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.960
 thames they achieved it in 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.390
 approximately 50 years by various 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.140
 reasons that you have to talk more about 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.020
 detail korea achieved s

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.000
 how much time is expected to recover 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.679
 the rimac basin 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.240
 created the multisectoral commission there 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.110

 path of avoidance for access to 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.870
 callao and the construction of 12 viaducts 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.900
 for interconnections in different 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.360
 points thanks to the successful experience 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.280
