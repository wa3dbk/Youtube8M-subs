check this out this is what most video

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.320 
check this out this is what most video
looks<00:00:13.980> like<00:00:14.160> when<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.429> shoot<00:00:14.670> with<00:00:14.700> an<00:00:14.940> iPhone

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
looks like when you shoot with an iPhone

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.000 
looks like when you shoot with an iPhone
it<00:00:15.750> doesn't<00:00:16.080> look<00:00:16.170> all<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.379> good<00:00:16.770> its

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
it doesn't look all that good its

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.210 
it doesn't look all that good its
handheld<00:00:17.430> kind<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.090> bumpy<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.570> jerky<00:00:19.220> but

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
handheld kind of bumpy and jerky but

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:29.990 
handheld kind of bumpy and jerky but
this<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.520> what<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.730> could<00:00:20.939> look<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:28.939> I've<00:00:29.939> got

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
this is what it could look like I've got

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.890 
this is what it could look like I've got
four<00:00:30.390> tricks

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
four tricks

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.549 
four tricks
here<00:00:31.230> they<00:00:31.349> go<00:00:32.450> even<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> nice<00:00:33.899> camera<00:00:34.230> it's

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
here they go even on a nice camera it's

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.900 
here they go even on a nice camera it's
really<00:00:34.800> important<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.190> hold<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.489> steady<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
really important to hold it steady and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.000 
really important to hold it steady and
since<00:00:36.420> these<00:00:36.570> iPhones<00:00:36.840> don't<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:37.500> any<00:00:37.649> image

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
since these iPhones don't have any image

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.220 
since these iPhones don't have any image
stabilization<00:00:38.460> built<00:00:39.090> into<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> lenses<00:00:39.899> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
stabilization built into the lenses it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.889 
stabilization built into the lenses it
really<00:00:40.649> helps<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.040> lock<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.030> down<00:00:42.180> using<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
really helps to lock it down using a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.500 
really helps to lock it down using a
little<00:00:43.110> tripod<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.040> safe<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:45.270> really

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
little tripod like this safe can really

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.029 
little tripod like this safe can really
improve<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> performance<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.710> your<00:00:46.739> shots

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
improve the performance of your shots

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.290 
improve the performance of your shots
next<00:00:47.579> sound<00:00:49.219> that<00:00:50.219> sounds<00:00:50.610> may<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
next sound that sounds may be one of the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.549 
next sound that sounds may be one of the
most<00:00:51.420> important<00:00:51.930> things<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.170> you're<00:00:52.350> got<00:00:52.530> to

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
most important things that you're got to

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.660 
most important things that you're got to
consider<00:00:52.890> when<00:00:53.160> you're<00:00:53.250> shooting<00:00:53.370> with<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
consider when you're shooting with a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.970 
consider when you're shooting with a
smartphone<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.840> sound<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.320> really<00:00:55.829> not

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
smartphone the sound is just really not

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.319 
smartphone the sound is just really not
that<00:00:56.219> good<00:00:56.489> when<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:56.760> coming<00:00:57.030> from<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
that good when it's coming from the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.650 
that good when it's coming from the
phone<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.320> what<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.820> get<00:01:00.629> a

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
phone so what I like to do is get a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.930 
phone so what I like to do is get a
little<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.350> lavalier<00:01:01.890> microphone<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.789> if<00:01:02.850> you

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
little a lavalier microphone and if you

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.630 
little a lavalier microphone and if you
can<00:01:03.090> see<00:01:03.300> if<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.989> wires<00:01:04.229> up<00:01:04.650> my<00:01:04.830> shirt<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.369> is

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
can see if it wires up my shirt and is

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.880 
can see if it wires up my shirt and is
attached<00:01:06.000> right<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.290> fact<00:01:07.500> I'm<00:01:07.710> using

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
attached right here in fact I'm using

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.070 
attached right here in fact I'm using
the<00:01:08.130> rode<00:01:08.369> smartlav<00:01:08.810> it's<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> most

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the rode smartlav it's the most

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.510 
the rode smartlav it's the most
expensive<00:01:10.409> thing<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.710> bought<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.280> make<00:01:11.310> this

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
expensive thing I bought to make this

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.130 
expensive thing I bought to make this
production<00:01:11.970> work<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.240> think<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.510> ran<00:01:12.630> me<00:01:12.780> sixty

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
production work I think it ran me sixty

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.410 
production work I think it ran me sixty
dollars<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:15.060> sounds

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
dollars but as you can see it sounds

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.450 
dollars but as you can see it sounds
much<00:01:15.570> better<00:01:15.900> than<00:01:16.409> if<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.650> don't<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
much better than if I don't have the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.140 
much better than if I don't have the
audio<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.740> without<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.189> audio<00:01:20.490> here<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.000> is

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
audio like without the audio here it is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.850 
audio like without the audio here it is
really<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.780> terrible<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.619> you're<00:01:22.770> gonna

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
really just terrible and you're gonna

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.649 
really just terrible and you're gonna
use<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> recording<00:01:23.549> app<00:01:23.790> like<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.479> from

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
use a recording app like this one from

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.140 
use a recording app like this one from
Road<00:01:24.990> which<00:01:25.830> goes<00:01:26.040> with<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.369> microphone<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
Road which goes with the microphone and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.300 
Road which goes with the microphone and
actually<00:01:27.659> makes<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.930> really<00:01:28.110> good<00:01:28.380> sound<00:01:28.680> next

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
actually makes a really good sound next

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.719 
actually makes a really good sound next
light<00:01:29.930> like<00:01:30.930> okay<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> better<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
light like okay the better the like of

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.940 
light like okay the better the like of
the<00:01:32.850> better<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.420> image<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.020> actually<00:01:34.439> lit

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
the better the image I actually lit

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.560 
the better the image I actually lit
myself<00:01:35.130> up<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.790> well<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> bunch<00:01:36.450> of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
myself up really well with a bunch of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.080 
myself up really well with a bunch of
lights<00:01:36.840> here<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.470> here<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.100> back<00:01:38.430> there<00:01:38.460> and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
lights here and here and back there and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.819 
lights here and here and back there and
as<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:39.509> without<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.229> bright<00:01:40.530> lights

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
as you can see without the bright lights

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.280 
as you can see without the bright lights
surrounding<00:01:41.159> me<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.720> really<00:01:42.840> doesn't<00:01:43.170> look

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
surrounding me it it really doesn't look

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.020 
surrounding me it it really doesn't look
that<00:01:43.409> great<00:01:43.680> but<00:01:44.220> here's<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.520> trick<00:01:44.790> if<00:01:45.000> you

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
that great but here's a trick if you

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.340 
that great but here's a trick if you
