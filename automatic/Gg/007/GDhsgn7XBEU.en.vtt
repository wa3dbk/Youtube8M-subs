you<00:01:06.060> know<00:01:06.180> me<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.479> quell<00:01:06.900> his<00:01:07.229> special<00:01:07.740> defense

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
you know me do quell his special defense

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.370 
you know me do quell his special defense
is<00:01:08.159> pretty<00:01:08.340> decent<00:01:08.580> usable<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.479> guess<00:01:09.659> defense

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
is pretty decent usable I guess defense

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.289 
is pretty decent usable I guess defense
not<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.619> much<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.369> basically<00:01:11.700> if<00:01:11.970> you're<00:01:12.119> going

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
not so much so basically if you're going

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.580 
not so much so basically if you're going
up<00:01:12.390> against<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.720> physical<00:01:13.080> attacker<00:01:13.320> once

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
up against the physical attacker once

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.109 
up against the physical attacker once
you<00:01:13.680> baton<00:01:13.950> pass<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.729> want<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> go<00:01:15.000> ahead

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
you baton pass in you want to go ahead

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.310 
you baton pass in you want to go ahead
and<00:01:15.210> set<00:01:15.330> up<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.570> reflect<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.229> will

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
and set up that reflect and that will

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.960 
and set up that reflect and that will
pretty<00:01:16.530> much<00:01:16.650> cover<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.880> know

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
pretty much cover you for and you know

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.330 
pretty much cover you for and you know
at<00:01:18.090> least<00:01:18.150> until<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.659> sweep<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.340> if

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
at least until you can sweep in if

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.560 
at least until you can sweep in if
you're<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.610> up<00:01:20.729> against<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> special<00:01:21.450> I

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
you're going up against the special I

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.510 
you're going up against the special I
would<00:01:21.840> probably<00:01:22.170> still<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:22.799> reflect<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.250> for

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
would probably still do reflect just for

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.010 
would probably still do reflect just for
the<00:01:23.580> coverage<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.150> if<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.420> think<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.810> their

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the coverage but if you think that their

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.570 
the coverage but if you think that their
team<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.680> know<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.009> their<00:01:26.130> teams<00:01:26.369> all

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
special attackers you can just go ahead

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
wanna have a timid nature but anyway so

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.760 
wanna have a timid nature but anyway so

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
you baton pass a plus-10 boost at least

you baton pass a plus-10 boost at least
the<00:01:40.920> plus<00:01:41.130> 10<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.579> you're<00:01:41.759> not<00:01:41.909> taking<00:01:42.360> damage

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
the plus 10 if you're not taking damage

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.480 
the plus 10 if you're not taking damage
yet<00:01:42.930> then<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.439> go<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.890> she'll<00:01:44.130> smash<00:01:44.340> and

yet then you can go and she'll smash and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.010 
yet then you can go and she'll smash and
protect<00:01:44.790> one<00:01:44.909> more<00:01:45.060> time<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:45.930> it

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
protect one more time and you can be it

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.810 
protect one more time and you can be it
you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.259> what<00:01:46.680> plus<00:01:46.920> 16<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.399> think<00:01:47.700> are

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
you know what plus 16 I think are

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.060 
you know what plus 16 I think are
actually<00:01:48.090> plus<00:01:48.270> 18<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:49.829> you're<00:01:49.920> going<00:01:50.009> to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
actually plus 18 so what you're going to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.560 
actually plus 18 so what you're going to
do<00:01:50.220> them<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.640> you're<00:01:51.000> going<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.149> have<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> stored

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
do them is you're going to have a stored

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.780 
do them is you're going to have a stored
power<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.110> 20<00:01:53.040> base<00:01:53.220> power<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.700> then

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
power this is 20 base power and then

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.219 
power this is 20 base power and then
plus<00:01:53.970> 20<00:01:54.299> for<00:01:54.329> each<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.780> boost<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.049> you

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
plus 20 for each of the boost that you

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.780 
plus 20 for each of the boost that you
have<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.799> assuming<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.219> you're<00:01:56.340> plus<00:01:56.549> 10

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
have so assuming that you're plus 10

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.030 
have so assuming that you're plus 10
it's<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.119> be<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> think<00:01:57.509> what<00:01:57.630> 220<00:01:58.200> it

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
it's going to be I think what 220 it

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.440 
it's going to be I think what 220 it
should<00:01:59.189> be<00:01:59.219> 220<00:01:59.700> base<00:01:59.850> power<00:02:00.060> if<00:02:00.240> i'm<00:02:00.329> not

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
should be 220 base power if i'm not

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.929 
should be 220 base power if i'm not
mistaken<00:02:00.570> i'm<00:02:01.079> thinking<00:02:01.439> mistaken<00:02:02.070> sorry<00:02:02.219> you

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
mistaken i'm thinking mistaken sorry you

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.609 
mistaken i'm thinking mistaken sorry you
should<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> 220<00:02:03.600> base<00:02:03.750> power<00:02:03.960> along<00:02:04.409> with

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
should be a 220 base power along with

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.410 
should be a 220 base power along with
stab<00:02:04.890> for<00:02:05.130> sidekick<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.820> mind<00:02:06.030> plate<00:02:06.240> is

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
stab for sidekick and the mind plate is

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.059 
stab for sidekick and the mind plate is
going<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> be<00:02:06.840> pretty<00:02:07.170> insane<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.039> you're

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
going to be pretty insane and you're

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.199 
going to be pretty insane and you're
pretty<00:02:08.489> much<00:02:08.520> going<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.759> won't<00:02:08.910> hit<00:02:09.030> anything

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
pretty much going to won't hit anything

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.300 
pretty much going to won't hit anything
even<00:02:09.629> without<00:02:09.720> special<00:02:10.200> attack<00:02:10.410> eb's<00:02:10.709> here<00:02:11.220> it

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
even without special attack eb's here it

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.949 
even without special attack eb's here it
has<00:02:11.459> 130<00:02:11.849> base<00:02:12.090> special<00:02:12.480> attack<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.840> that's

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
has 130 base special attack and that's

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.700 
has 130 base special attack and that's
good<00:02:13.110> enough<00:02:13.290> as<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
good enough as it

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.710 
good enough as it
is<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.820> reason<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.060> have<00:02:15.180> dazzling<00:02:15.570> gleam

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
is so the reason I have dazzling gleam

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.120 
is so the reason I have dazzling gleam
here<00:02:15.900> by<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.110> way<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.440> because<00:02:16.590> stored<00:02:16.980> power

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
here by the way is because stored power

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.590 
here by the way is because stored power
is<00:02:17.310> not<00:02:17.400> going<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.640> hit<00:02:17.790> dark<00:02:18.000> types<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.480> this

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
is not going to hit dark types and this

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.090 
is not going to hit dark types and this
is<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> great<00:02:18.930> coverage<00:02:19.290> move<00:02:19.500> for<00:02:19.680> dark<00:02:19.860> has

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
is a great coverage move for dark has

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.020 
is a great coverage move for dark has

like<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.150> said<00:02:24.210> you<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.540> run<00:02:24.810> expert<00:02:25.200> belt<00:02:25.380> here

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
like I said you can run expert belt here

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.100 
like I said you can run expert belt here
that's<00:02:25.980> going<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.190> give<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.370> plus<00:02:26.690> 1.2<00:02:27.690> x

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
that's going to give you plus 1.2 x

power<00:02:28.470> for<00:02:29.040> both<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.460> these<00:02:29.520> moves<00:02:29.760> that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
power for both of these moves that

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.220 
power for both of these moves that
they're<00:02:30.060> super<00:02:30.330> effective<00:02:30.600> which<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.080> is

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
they're super effective which this is

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.080 
they're super effective which this is
often<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.800> mean<00:02:31.920> if<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.040> use<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.400> move<00:02:32.640> it's

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
often I mean if you use this move it's

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.460 
often I mean if you use this move it's
going<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.330> be<00:02:33.450> super<00:02:33.630> effective<00:02:33.990> or<00:02:34.260> at<00:02:34.410> least

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
going to be super effective or at least

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.730 
going to be super effective or at least
if<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:34.980> use<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.250> properly<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:36.290> that's<00:02:37.290> my<00:02:37.470> set

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
if you use it properly so that's my set

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.080 
if you use it properly so that's my set
though<00:02:37.920> you're<00:02:38.130> going<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.310> steamroll<00:02:38.850> teams

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
though you're going to steamroll teams

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.250 
though you're going to steamroll teams
with<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:39.390> if<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.540> can<00:02:39.660> get<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.900> work<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.170> is

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
with it if you can get it to work it is

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.750 
with it if you can get it to work it is
a<00:02:40.290> bit<00:02:40.530> gimmicky<00:02:40.740> but<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.190> works<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.550> most

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
a bit gimmicky but it works in most

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.220 
a bit gimmicky but it works in most
situations<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.420> considered<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.930> be<00:02:43.020> fairly

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
situations so I considered to be fairly

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.260 
situations so I considered to be fairly
practical<00:02:43.500> it's<00:02:44.400> kind<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.760> fun<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:44.940> use<00:02:45.120> on

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
practical it's kind of fun to use on

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.030 
practical it's kind of fun to use on
like<00:02:45.300> XY<00:02:45.780> battle<00:02:46.020> spot<00:02:46.200> singles<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.740> showdown

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
like XY battle spot singles and showdown

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.650 
like XY battle spot singles and showdown

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660
