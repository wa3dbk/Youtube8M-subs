00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
vanguard of alternative and I think that

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.030 
vanguard of alternative and I think that
their<00:00:37.700> importance<00:00:38.270> can't<00:00:38.510> be<00:00:38.630> underestimated

hallways of our junior high school we're
sort<00:00:43.760> of<00:00:43.790> fully<00:00:44.030> expecting<00:00:44.600> it<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.780> be<00:00:44.810> this

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
sort of fully expecting it to be this

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.800 
sort of fully expecting it to be this
glittering<00:00:45.500> punk-rock<00:00:46.250> heaven<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:46.880> there's

glittering punk-rock heaven and there's

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.140 
glittering punk-rock heaven and there's
just<00:00:47.960> kind<00:00:48.110> of<00:00:48.230> nothing<00:00:48.560> left<00:00:48.800> some<00:00:49.610> musicians
