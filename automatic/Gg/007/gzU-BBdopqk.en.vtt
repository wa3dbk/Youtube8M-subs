00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 your 28 then keyboard code we have 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.630
 for this level a six-digit code to 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.420
 find when I'm going to press this 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.509
 red button 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.789
 I will see here nets 4 number to 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.560
 three figures 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.260
 names of hundreds so four 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.180
 hooked numbers the ideal falls in love with a 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.580
 paper to note them know that both 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.859
 first go together we'll see 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.400
 why and the 3rd and 4th are also going 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:38.399
 together 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:41.040
 so we go and support 213 951 312 302 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.320
 that's it with his four clues I have 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.850
 find my first pass series I live 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.850
 the first two go together 213 951 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:58.829
 213 gives us the order in which we 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:03.719
 must write the numbers of the number 951 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.280
 young explains 213 2 1 3 the wine is at 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.619
 middle so first I'll take the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.350
 five of the 951 after in the 213 2 2 and in 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.640
 first so I'll take the 9951 so 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.610
 my code will start with 5.9 and the 3 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.650
 being in the end so I will take the wine 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.189
 in 3rd position so half of my 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.409
 code will be so 591 and I will do 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.360
 the same for three and four years 3 you 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.420
 had 312 who will give us the position 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:39.090
 of each digit that make up the 302 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.390
 so 312 one is in the middle so that will be so 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.180
 0 then the 2 is quite right this 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.329
 will be 2 and 3 is first 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.439
 so we will take the last 3 302 we 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.780
 will have 0.23 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.060
 it's when you stick it or 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.229
 first 591 we found and well 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.969
 all of our code which is 591 0.23 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.530
 and that's what I'm going to tap on the 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:09.100
 keyboard 580 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.729
 0.23 the door opens I can go to 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.729
 level 29
