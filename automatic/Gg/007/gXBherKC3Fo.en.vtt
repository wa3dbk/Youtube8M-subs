earlier<00:02:09.890> it<00:02:10.160> was<00:02:10.190> all<00:02:10.459> forced<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.750> up<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.590> I

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
earlier it was all forced this up so I

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.839 
earlier it was all forced this up so I
removed<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.940> outside<00:02:14.420> screw<00:02:15.340> okay<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.580> then

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
removed this outside screw okay and then

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.570 
removed this outside screw okay and then
I<00:02:17.209> took<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.900> torch<00:02:18.260> started<00:02:19.040> heating<00:02:19.160> up<00:02:19.340> the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
I took a torch started heating up the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.150 
I took a torch started heating up the
edges<00:02:19.910> right<00:02:20.060> with<00:02:20.840> pair<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.140> pliers<00:02:21.349> and<00:02:21.680> I

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
edges right with pair of pliers and I

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.729 
edges right with pair of pliers and I
gave<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.519> a<00:02:22.549> form<00:02:22.849> after<00:02:23.470> punching<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.530> hole<00:02:24.709> I

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
gave it a form after punching the hole I

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.460 
gave it a form after punching the hole I
needed<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:26.420> would<00:02:26.569> put<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.840> longer<00:02:27.230> screw

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
needed and I would put a longer screw

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.860 
needed and I would put a longer screw
locked<00:02:28.160> it<00:02:28.310> down<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:29.299> then<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:29.540> come<00:02:29.750> in

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
locked it down and then you come in

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.220 
locked it down and then you come in
underneath<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.700> heat<00:02:32.239> up<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.480> bottom<00:02:32.840> areas

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
underneath and heat up the bottom areas

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.690 
underneath and heat up the bottom areas
where<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.560> bends<00:02:33.920> need<00:02:34.129> to<00:02:34.220> be<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.670> that

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
where the bends need to be and that

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.949 
where the bends need to be and that
piece<00:02:35.209> will<00:02:35.420> start<00:02:35.660> flying<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:37.400> what<00:02:37.549> it<00:02:37.670> needs

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
piece will start flying to what it needs

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.390 
piece will start flying to what it needs
and<00:02:38.959> pressure<00:02:39.349> against<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.010> other<00:02:40.160> pieces

and pressure against the other pieces

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.839 
and pressure against the other pieces

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
and if you need to add a little bit of

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.950 
and if you need to add a little bit of
plastic<00:04:11.500> or<00:04:11.980> some<00:04:12.160> supports<00:04:12.610> take<00:04:13.330> a<00:04:13.360> wire<00:04:13.660> tie

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
plastic or some supports take a wire tie

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.350 
plastic or some supports take a wire tie
v<00:04:14.800> square<00:04:15.160> ties<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.670> black<00:04:15.850> ones<00:04:16.060> are<00:04:16.180> really

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360 
v square ties the black ones are really

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.570 
v square ties the black ones are really
good<00:04:16.510> for<00:04:16.690> this<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:17.470> torch<00:04:17.860> and<00:04:18.220> you<00:04:18.340> eat<00:04:18.459> them

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
good for this and torch and you eat them

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.000 
good for this and torch and you eat them
up<00:04:18.640> and<00:04:18.820> melt<00:04:19.030> them<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.770> they<00:04:20.770> work<00:04:20.980> great

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
up and melt them and they work great

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.800 
up and melt them and they work great
that's<00:04:21.580> basically<00:04:22.030> essentially<00:04:22.450> what<00:04:22.690> they

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
that's basically essentially what they

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.440 
that's basically essentially what they
use<00:04:22.990> for<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.380> plastic<00:04:23.950> welders<00:04:25.170> so<00:04:27.450> that's

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
use for the plastic welders so that's

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.590 
use for the plastic welders so that's
about<00:04:28.600> it<00:04:28.780> now<00:04:29.640> it<00:04:30.640> comes<00:04:30.820> to<00:04:31.030> mixing<00:04:31.180> fire

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
about it now it comes to mixing fire

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.870 
about it now it comes to mixing fire
bless<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.100> clothes<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:33.490> have<00:04:33.640> never

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
bless and the clothes you have never

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.590 
bless and the clothes you have never
done<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.350> real<00:04:35.350> simple<00:04:35.740> okay<00:04:37.710> first<00:04:38.710> of<00:04:38.890> all

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
done it real simple okay first of all

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.940 
done it real simple okay first of all
okay<00:04:40.600> this<00:04:40.780> is<00:04:40.960> your<00:04:41.020> resin<00:04:41.520> okay<00:04:43.770> since<00:04:44.770> your

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
okay this is your resin okay since your

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.310 
okay this is your resin okay since your
hardener<00:04:46.140> alright<00:04:47.490> and<00:04:48.490> this<00:04:48.700> is<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.320> trave

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
hardener alright and this is the trave

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.610 
hardener alright and this is the trave
if<00:04:50.560> you<00:04:51.550> use<00:04:51.760> one<00:04:52.000> time<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:53.080> then<00:04:53.290> throw<00:04:53.530> it

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
if you use one time and then throw it

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.159 
if you use one time and then throw it
away<00:04:53.680> probably<00:04:54.130> so<00:04:54.910> best<00:04:55.510> thing<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:55.720> do<00:04:55.900> is<00:04:56.020> set

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
away probably so best thing to do is set

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.010 
away probably so best thing to do is set
it<00:04:56.230> an<00:04:56.410> angle<00:04:56.820> pour<00:04:57.820> in<00:04:57.910> your<00:04:58.060> resin<00:04:58.419> and<00:04:58.630> it's

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
it an angle pour in your resin and it's

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.520 
it an angle pour in your resin and it's
the<00:04:59.440> resin<00:04:59.830> is<00:04:59.950> basically<00:05:00.870> like<00:05:01.870> if<00:05:02.260> you<00:05:02.440> use

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
the resin is basically like if you use

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.200 
the resin is basically like if you use
this<00:05:02.770> much<00:05:03.010> resin<00:05:03.400> out<00:05:03.490> of<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:03.669> bottle<00:05:04.030> right

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
this much resin out of the bottle right

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.440 
this much resin out of the bottle right
there<00:05:04.919> you<00:05:05.919> would<00:05:06.070> come<00:05:06.250> in<00:05:06.400> with<00:05:06.580> about<00:05:06.820> five

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
there you would come in with about five

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.200 
there you would come in with about five
or<00:05:07.600> six<00:05:07.720> drops<00:05:08.050> of<00:05:08.260> this<00:05:08.700> hardener<00:05:09.700> catalyst

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
or six drops of this hardener catalyst

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.380 
or six drops of this hardener catalyst
okay<00:05:10.720> and<00:05:10.990> it<00:05:11.740> mix<00:05:11.919> up<00:05:12.070> real<00:05:12.310> good<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.669> then

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
okay and it mix up real good and then

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.760 
okay and it mix up real good and then
you've<00:05:13.570> got<00:05:13.840> a<00:05:13.870> very<00:05:14.080> short<00:05:14.230> amount<00:05:14.530> of<00:05:14.710> time

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
you've got a very short amount of time

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.360 
you've got a very short amount of time
to<00:05:15.010> work<00:05:15.130> with<00:05:15.160> it<00:05:15.780> okay<00:05:16.780> less<00:05:17.650> harder<00:05:17.980> you<00:05:18.160> use

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
to work with it okay less harder you use

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.430 
to work with it okay less harder you use
the<00:05:19.120> less<00:05:19.270> you<00:05:19.300> wear<00:05:19.480> you<00:05:19.570> too<00:05:19.900> much<00:05:20.080> harder

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
the less you wear you too much harder

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.710 
the less you wear you too much harder
and<00:05:20.530> you'll<00:05:20.680> melt<00:05:20.830> this<00:05:21.010> dish<00:05:21.450> okay<00:05:22.450> because

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
and you'll melt this dish okay because

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.360 
and you'll melt this dish okay because
it<00:05:22.930> does<00:05:23.110> react<00:05:23.410> to<00:05:23.560> gets<00:05:23.740> warm<00:05:24.010> make<00:05:24.250> sure

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
it does react to gets warm make sure

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.100 
it does react to gets warm make sure
you're<00:05:24.760> in<00:05:24.850> a<00:05:24.910> ventilated<00:05:25.210> area

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
you're in a ventilated area

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.180 
you're in a ventilated area
so<00:05:26.650> you<00:05:26.740> don't<00:05:26.800> suffocate<00:05:27.190> okay<00:05:28.090> and<00:05:29.190> don't

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
so you don't suffocate okay and don't

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.530 
so you don't suffocate okay and don't
breathe<00:05:30.460> in<00:05:30.640> those<00:05:30.790> humans<00:05:31.180> because<00:05:31.360> it's

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
breathe in those humans because it's

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.690 
breathe in those humans because it's
toxic<00:05:31.780> that<00:05:32.140> work<00:05:32.290> I<00:05:32.560> worked<00:05:32.950> a<00:05:33.040> Bayliner<00:05:33.370> many

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
toxic that work I worked a Bayliner many

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.390 
toxic that work I worked a Bayliner many
years<00:05:33.910> ago<00:05:34.030> in<00:05:34.240> there<00:05:34.390> it's<00:05:34.690> not<00:05:34.810> a<00:05:34.930> fun<00:05:35.170> thing

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
years ago in there it's not a fun thing

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.520 
years ago in there it's not a fun thing
walking<00:05:36.400> in<00:05:36.670> and<00:05:36.760> out<00:05:36.850> of<00:05:36.910> that<00:05:36.970> place<00:05:37.500> after<00:05:38.500> a

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
walking in and out of that place after a

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.650 
walking in and out of that place after a
while<00:05:38.740> there<00:05:38.980> you<00:05:39.160> can<00:05:39.970> stand<00:05:40.180> your<00:05:40.300> pants<00:05:40.480> up
