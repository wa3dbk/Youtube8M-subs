when i'm looking for a set of your
phones<00:00:09.640> i'm<00:00:09.970> looking<00:00:10.180> for<00:00:10.390> a<00:00:10.599> flat<00:00:10.840> response

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.050 
phones i'm looking for a flat response

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.850 
phones i'm looking for a flat response
over<00:00:11.860> the<00:00:12.760> whole<00:00:12.940> spectrum<00:00:13.360> and<00:00:13.860> something

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
over the whole spectrum and something

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.830 
over the whole spectrum and something
that<00:00:14.890> fits<00:00:15.190> well<00:00:15.430> it's<00:00:15.940> loud<00:00:16.240> enough<00:00:16.270> that<00:00:16.539> can

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
that fits well it's loud enough that can

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.870 
that fits well it's loud enough that can
get<00:00:17.019> over<00:00:17.380> a<00:00:17.410> lot<00:00:17.890> of<00:00:18.010> background<00:00:18.220> noise<00:00:18.550> i

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
get over a lot of background noise i

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.929 
get over a lot of background noise i
think<00:00:19.600> the<00:00:19.689> audio<00:00:20.050> Pia<00:00:20.439> fees<00:00:20.740> have<00:00:21.039> very<00:00:21.490> clear

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
think the audio Pia fees have very clear

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.060 
think the audio Pia fees have very clear
sound<00:00:22.300> quality<00:00:22.749> other<00:00:23.140> brands<00:00:23.800> try<00:00:24.009> to

sound quality other brands try to

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.819 
sound quality other brands try to
compensate<00:00:24.820> with<00:00:25.269> just<00:00:25.749> making<00:00:26.650> things

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:26.829 
compensate with just making things

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.589 
compensate with just making things
louder<00:00:27.189> and<00:00:27.869> whereas<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:29.259> audios<00:00:29.800> really

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
louder and whereas the audios really

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.150 
louder and whereas the audios really
went<00:00:31.599> for<00:00:31.659> clarity<00:00:32.140> and<00:00:32.259> integrity<00:00:32.710> of<00:00:32.829> sound

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
went for clarity and integrity of sound

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.610 
went for clarity and integrity of sound
over<00:00:33.730> the<00:00:33.880> entire<00:00:34.300> spectrum<00:00:34.720> as<00:00:35.170> a<00:00:35.260> sound

mixer<00:00:35.739> I'm<00:00:36.160> listening<00:00:36.780> constantly<00:00:37.950> trunk<00:00:38.950> the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
mixer I'm listening constantly trunk the

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.770 
mixer I'm listening constantly trunk the
broad<00:00:39.760> range<00:00:40.030> of<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.270> spectrum<00:00:40.390> of

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
broad range of the spectrum of

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.890 
broad range of the spectrum of
frequencies<00:00:40.900> and<00:00:41.910> hearing<00:00:42.910> what<00:00:42.940> comes<00:00:43.720> out

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
frequencies and hearing what comes out

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.470 
frequencies and hearing what comes out
where<00:00:44.200> and<00:00:44.440> with<00:00:45.310> the<00:00:45.460> with<00:00:45.700> the<00:00:45.790> PF<00:00:46.060> es<00:00:46.270> I

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
where and with the with the PF es I

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.100 
where and with the with the PF es I
noticed<00:00:46.870> a<00:00:47.140> lot<00:00:47.710> of<00:00:47.740> a<00:00:48.700> lot<00:00:48.910> of<00:00:49.030> definition<00:00:49.630> in

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
noticed a lot of a lot of definition in

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.880 
noticed a lot of a lot of definition in
it<00:00:50.470> and<00:00:50.730> everything<00:00:51.810> was<00:00:52.810> extremely<00:00:53.560> clear

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
it and everything was extremely clear

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.740 
it and everything was extremely clear
well<00:00:54.610> I<00:00:54.640> think<00:00:54.760> sound<00:00:55.180> isolation<00:00:55.510> is

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
well I think sound isolation is

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.960 
well I think sound isolation is
extremely<00:00:56.200> important<00:00:56.650> because<00:00:56.740> it<00:00:57.730> blocks

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
extremely important because it blocks

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.230 
extremely important because it blocks
out<00:00:58.240> the<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:59.410> ambience<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.910> traffic

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
out the the ambience the traffic

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.640 
out the the ambience the traffic
ambience<00:01:01.420> and<00:01:01.780> whatever<00:01:02.020> else<00:01:02.079> is<00:01:02.470> happening

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
ambience and whatever else is happening

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.590 
ambience and whatever else is happening
around<00:01:02.860> you<00:01:03.250> so<00:01:03.880> you<00:01:03.910> can<00:01:04.059> focus<00:01:04.239> on<00:01:04.570> what

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
around you so you can focus on what

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.399 
around you so you can focus on what
you're<00:01:04.839> listening<00:01:04.989> to<00:01:05.259> PFE<00:01:05.920> s<00:01:05.979> have<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.549> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
you're listening to PFE s have the the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.090 
you're listening to PFE s have the the
22<00:01:08.409> tips<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:09.090> silicon<00:01:10.090> ones<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:11.200> foam

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
22 tips the silicon ones and the foam

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.950 
22 tips the silicon ones and the foam
ones<00:01:12.370> and<00:01:12.700> I<00:01:12.760> found<00:01:13.000> that<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.300> foam<00:01:13.510> ones<00:01:13.750> were

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
ones and I found that the foam ones were

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.740 
ones and I found that the foam ones were
more<00:01:14.440> comfortable<00:01:14.950> for<00:01:15.010> me<00:01:15.250> they<00:01:15.880> also<00:01:16.120> have<00:01:16.540> a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
more comfortable for me they also have a

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.100 
more comfortable for me they also have a
lot<00:01:16.990> more<00:01:17.260> options<00:01:17.590> and<00:01:18.250> sizes<00:01:19.000> depending<00:01:19.780> on

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
lot more options and sizes depending on

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.560 
lot more options and sizes depending on
the<00:01:20.200> size<00:01:20.409> of<00:01:20.530> your<00:01:20.560> ear<00:01:20.890> I<00:01:21.150> always<00:01:22.150> encourage

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
my clients to UM use headphones and and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.290 
my clients to UM use headphones and and
iPods<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.760> to<00:01:28.690> spur<00:01:28.930> on<00:01:29.110> their<00:01:29.440> their<00:01:30.400> work<00:01:31.090> out

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
iPods to to spur on their their work out

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.390 
iPods to to spur on their their work out
to<00:01:31.510> inspire<00:01:31.870> them<00:01:32.140> because<00:01:32.440> I<00:01:32.560> think<00:01:32.620> it<00:01:33.250> keeps

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
to inspire them because I think it keeps

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.490 
to inspire them because I think it keeps
you<00:01:33.610> moving<00:01:33.790> it<00:01:34.090> keeps<00:01:34.330> you<00:01:34.479> going<00:01:34.659> so<00:01:35.260> if<00:01:35.380> you

fit very well inside the ear canal is to

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.750 
fit very well inside the ear canal is to

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.670 
sounds once we're isolated from those
sounds<00:02:56.489> it<00:02:57.420> makes<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.900> possible<00:02:58.110> for<00:02:58.440> us<00:02:58.650> to

sounds it makes it possible for us to
keep<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.400> volume<00:02:59.550> on<00:02:59.910> our<00:03:00.030> mp3<00:03:00.180> players<00:03:00.750> down

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
keep the volume on our mp3 players down

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.410 
keep the volume on our mp3 players down
the<00:03:01.800> result<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.310> over<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.209> long<00:03:03.360> term

the result of that over the long term

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.810 
the result of that over the long term
lower<00:03:04.050> listening<00:03:04.530> levels<00:03:04.860> it's<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.459> safer

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
lower listening levels it's the safer

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.310 
lower listening levels it's the safer
listening<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.510> over<00:03:06.750> time<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.050> helps<00:03:07.230> to

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
listening and over time it helps to

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.130 
listening and over time it helps to
protect<00:03:07.470> our<00:03:07.770> hearing
