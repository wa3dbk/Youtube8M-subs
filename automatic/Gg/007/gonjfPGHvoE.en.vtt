stroke is the third leading cause of
death<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.860> United<00:00:14.250> States<00:00:14.630> stroke<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.870> a

death in the United States stroke is a

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.460 
death in the United States stroke is a
major<00:00:16.680> problem<00:00:17.100> it's<00:00:18.060> largely<00:00:18.600> preventable

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
and for those who do have stroke they're

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.099 
and for those who do have stroke they're
often<00:00:22.830> left<00:00:23.010> with<00:00:23.160> permanent<00:00:23.850> disability<00:00:24.510> so

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
often left with permanent disability so

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.200 
often left with permanent disability so

onset we need to see people in the
emergency<00:02:40.210> department<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.410> we<00:02:41.530> can

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
emergency department so that we can
