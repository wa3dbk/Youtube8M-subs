00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
surprisingly it was feels a little damp

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.840 
surprisingly it was feels a little damp
so<00:00:53.819> I<00:00:54.030> did<00:00:54.510> achieve<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.469> bit<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.039> frizz<00:00:56.339> from<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
so I did achieve a bit of frizz from the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.899 
so I did achieve a bit of frizz from the
batten<00:00:57.469> now<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.920> clearly<00:00:59.190> see<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.609> the

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
batten now you can clearly see that the

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.759 
batten now you can clearly see that the
ends<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.359> curl<00:01:00.769> and<00:01:01.769> I<00:01:02.280> am<00:01:02.489> gently<00:01:03.269> taking<00:01:04.229> down

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
ends of curl and I am gently taking down

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.760 
ends of curl and I am gently taking down
these<00:01:05.159> braids<00:01:05.640> because<00:01:06.330> my<00:01:06.570> hair<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.049> damp<00:01:07.470> I

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
didn't want it to get big frizzy so

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.130 
didn't want it to get big frizzy so
here's<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.460> close-up<00:01:11.789> of<00:01:12.180> me<00:01:12.360> gently<00:01:12.780> taking

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
create a very loose wave pattern that

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.010 
create a very loose wave pattern that
actually<00:01:20.070> stretches<00:01:20.640> your<00:01:20.789> hair<00:01:21.210> more<00:01:21.960> than
