the<00:01:46.990> tape<00:01:47.380> oh<00:01:49.020> my<00:01:50.020> gosh<00:01:50.259> that<00:01:51.220> museum<00:01:51.789> is<00:01:51.940> a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
the tape oh my gosh that museum is a

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.109 
the tape oh my gosh that museum is a
death<00:01:52.360> trap<00:01:53.250> there<00:01:54.250> are<00:01:54.310> instantly<00:01:54.729> zehrs<00:01:55.000> on

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
death trap there are instantly zehrs on

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.790 
death trap there are instantly zehrs on
just<00:01:55.299> about<00:01:55.390> every<00:01:55.780> piece<00:01:55.989> in<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.229> museum<00:01:56.530> and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
just about every piece in a museum and

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.770 
just about every piece in a museum and
look<00:01:57.099> at<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.250> corners<00:01:57.489> of<00:01:57.580> this<00:01:57.670> case<00:01:57.910> those

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
look at the corners of this case those

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.260 
look at the corners of this case those
are<00:01:58.959> force<00:01:59.229> field<00:01:59.560> generators<00:02:00.160> so<00:02:00.789> I<00:02:01.119> guess

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
are force field generators so I guess

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.169 
are force field generators so I guess
you<00:02:01.539> cancel<00:02:01.959> the<00:02:01.989> mission<00:02:02.229> no<00:02:03.129> way<00:02:03.429> Rene<00:02:03.819> we're

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
you cancel the mission no way Rene we're

one of the many advantages of
anti-gravity<00:02:17.620> sneaks<00:02:18.129> you<00:02:18.760> guys<00:02:18.910> wanna<00:02:19.209> kick

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
anti-gravity sneaks you guys wanna kick

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.550 
anti-gravity sneaks you guys wanna kick
him<00:02:19.780> what<00:02:20.319> if<00:02:20.379> there<00:02:20.530> are<00:02:20.590> saying<00:02:20.830> sensors

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
him what if there are saying sensors

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.670
