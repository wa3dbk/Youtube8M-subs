00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.280
 and very good up to two kids I'm a waiter 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.920
 and the video today seriously I think that 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.720
 it's going to be amazing mainly because 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.359
 it's a book piece that I do not know if someone 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.339
 the more it has gone up a part has gone up 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.289
 but they did not know what to do with the diamond 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.630
 bogado that I explain to you this little 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.829
 will consist of duplicating items, and I will 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.920
 do with diamonds but you can do 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:34.070
 with any item worth 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.050
 what happens I 've seen a good video 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.900
 I have seen many videos in which only 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.880
 they simply look for the diamond they can 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.030
 throw away as many diamonds as possible 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.190
 ground but once they're going to catch them 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.239
 disappear do not get into the 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.290
 inventory then what are we going to do 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:56.780
 look let's start by putting a tnt 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.480
 a lever and a chest in this chest 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.949
 let's put two items of those that 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.550
 we want duplications will only have 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.550
 to diamond 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.980
 the dynamite explodes at 8 ticks me 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.300
 I explain a little better and that is, look 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.250
 to lower the volume a little bit because if not 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:18.890
 I'm sure you can not hear me 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:21.410
 when we activate it, look at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.010
 in the eighth when it explodes 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.110
 said this right when the dynamite goes 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.400
 by the eighth tic we will have to 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.090
 take out the diamonds but we can not 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.090
 we can not take them out like that 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.520
 we have to take them out by giving him the number 1 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.670
 from the keyboard to the number if we give the 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.290
 number 1 is placed in the first slot if 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.690
 we give the number 2 as it is placed in 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.580
 the second then remember that you do not 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.660
 you can remove the shift 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.060
 however what you have to give the 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.490
 number 1 may well not leave the 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.200
 first I am in version 1.0 point 9 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.240
 but it works 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.369
 as of 1.7 he is testing I do not know 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.070
 if it works before and I do not know if it's going to 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:05.320
 work after 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:09.100
 and let's start we give it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.950
 I give him nothing has not worked but let's go 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.940
 again we put lever dynamite 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:20.500
 chest the complement for the diamonds 1 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:23.620
 2 3 4 5 6 7 and there you have seen it 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.510
 there are not two diamonds and that I stay with 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.060
 a ship diamond given that's what it's going 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.590
 to spend with this diamond look at us 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.690
 we take it out of the east square and if 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.250
 we give you right click they're going to start 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.170
 get out many diamonds 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.489
 this is the moderate diamond that I 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.140
 I recommend saving I do not know if I try it 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.420
 I know if the diamond when leaving and now at 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.510
 re -enter our world is going to 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.640
 disappear but look at all 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.670
 diamonds that there are lawyers however 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.489
 we catch and disappear as you see I 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.530
 been testing and there is a way that 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.620
 I do not know if someone else knows it is 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.110
 doing the same process of taking out the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.890
 diamonds 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.810
 giving right click to diamonds 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.850
 As you see them, they disappear without 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.590
 However, if the diamonds are removed 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.220
 below there is a hopper a hopper 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.470
 and beneath the hopper at one watch box 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.600
 what's happening is incredible 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.980
 it's amazing if the methods 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.450
 to see if there yes it is worth 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.940
 what happens when I put the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.519
 diamond in the hopper without putting it in 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.310
 we seem that the game like that what 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.400
 overflow or something like that here we have here 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.940
 all our diamonds that by the way 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.210
 you have to take them out with him too 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.760
 with the number 1 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.030
 ok they are giving me back to everyone to see 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.030
 Yes, there 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.540
 ok there is 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.790
 here enter the diamonds we give the 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.530
 number 1 and as you can see we have here 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.480
 diamonds these diamonds so you can see 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.760
 that work can make a breastplate of 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.450
 diamond and we have our breastplate of 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.989
 diamond as you see it works and so that 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.760
 you see that it works I will remove what 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.070
 element again in the world and look 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.640
 we have the diamonds 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.680
 the bogado diamond is still what 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.150
 happens that the diamonds that we have 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.880
 got through the process of this 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.190
 of the hopper and the chest will disappear 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.240
 However, what we do with 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.520
 those diamonds before saving the world 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.980
 Well, it's going to stay then this is 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.340
 amazing these diamonds as you see 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:50.070
 disappear and what we have said here 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.070
 all our diamonds well 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.410
 what I advise is for example 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.020
 we have 14 we take some those that 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.600
 let's go to use we give the number 1 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.850
 that will get us here and we make ourselves 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.389
 our our diamond armor 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.639
 totally free just with a diamond 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.520
 As you can see, it's incredible, I'm 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.710
 super excited mainly because 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:17.430
 for me what I discovered this process 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.940
 from here it has not been discovered what I know 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.470
 is that 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.080
 they did not know what to do with the diamond 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.110
 bogado and good I have managed to discover 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.550
 that there and nothing this has been all for 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.210
 today I hope you liked it and even 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.210
 the next video
