 parsley pimpinelle and sorrel 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.270
 there was nothing more to get out of the garden 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.690
 Of course, it could still be frozen now 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:05.020
 But first take what the garden 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:09.430
 gives some salt I know it unfortunately 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:18.250
 I do not even a teaspoon have 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:20.530

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.150
 as I said, possibly after-seasoning 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.360
 ever now the lid 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:43.210

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.090

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:09.060

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.259
 Here immediately a big thick grödig 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.770
 however, but put to the side 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.770
 try 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:30.120
 I think you can leave it that way 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:31.240
 one tastes sour at the very tasty 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.210
 taste 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:44.169
 But then try one more time 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:46.870
 bit yellowish that that 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.639
 finished food kwi kicker out too 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:06:01.870
 really cooked everything to the point and 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:06:13.060
 Now we try it here 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:14.710
 delicious yummy kurabi 1 a so looked the 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.289
 chamber even a bit as a country 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:22.110
 let go if you want 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:22.110
 Of course only as fake 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.430
 when collins gets really super 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:35.290
 made more often 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:39.100
 In any case, a lot of work was before 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.720
 cut that kohlrabi and that was it 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:44.260
 already 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:48.840
 insofar as the handlebars eat fast if 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:50.560
 You are still in the meat 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.650
 roast the key 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.750
 that's what makes it pack this bit 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:59.820
 but so I am very satisfied 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.820
 thank you very much for having a nice evening and see you soon
