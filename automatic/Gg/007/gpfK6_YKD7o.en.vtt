/ cards that they give you so they've
been<00:02:15.760> pretty<00:02:15.909> good<00:02:16.030> job<00:02:16.269> so<00:02:16.329> this<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.870> the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
been pretty good job so this is the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.550 
been pretty good job so this is the
model<00:02:17.260> nice<00:02:17.349> big<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.739> mean<00:02:17.769> obviously<00:02:19.560> that's

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
model nice big I mean obviously that's

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.589 
model nice big I mean obviously that's
cool<00:02:20.769> so<00:02:21.099> we<00:02:21.189> got<00:02:21.310> Travis<00:02:21.790> Lewis<00:02:22.180> it's<00:02:22.360> number

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
cool so we got Travis Lewis it's number

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.130 
cool so we got Travis Lewis it's number
2<00:02:22.689> 99<00:02:23.260> it's<00:02:23.560> red<00:02:23.860> ink<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.569> guess<00:02:25.870> these<00:02:26.079> are

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
2 99 it's red ink so I guess these are

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.750 
2 99 it's red ink so I guess these are
its<00:02:26.680> number<00:02:26.950> two<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.069> iodine<00:02:27.370> but<00:02:27.519> you<00:02:27.610> don't

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
its number two the iodine but you don't

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.369 
its number two the iodine but you don't
know<00:02:27.849> how<00:02:28.000> many<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.510> 99<00:02:28.930> are<00:02:29.109> reading

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
know how many of the 99 are reading

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.710 
know how many of the 99 are reading
there<00:02:29.590> could<00:02:29.769> be<00:02:30.359> 17<00:02:31.359> of<00:02:31.480> them<00:02:31.569> could<00:02:31.689> be

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
there could be 17 of them could be

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.270 
there could be 17 of them could be
writing<00:02:32.049> you<00:02:32.170> don't<00:02:32.560> know<00:02:32.680> no<00:02:33.069> I<00:02:33.099> guess

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
writing you don't know no I guess

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.099
