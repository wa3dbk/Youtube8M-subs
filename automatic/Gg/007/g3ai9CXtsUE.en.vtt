00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
the ego you know it appears unlikely to

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.570 
the ego you know it appears unlikely to
me<00:07:08.960> that<00:07:08.990> the<00:07:09.290> ego<00:07:09.620> would<00:07:09.800> trust<00:07:10.040> all<00:07:10.250> of<00:07:10.310> the

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 
me that the ego would trust all of the

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.450 
me that the ego would trust all of the
jewels<00:07:10.820> with<00:07:11.000> one<00:07:11.150> messenger<00:07:12.190> so<00:07:13.190> it<00:07:13.280> seems

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
jewels with one messenger so it seems

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.340 
jewels with one messenger so it seems
logical<00:07:13.640> that<00:07:14.000> we<00:07:14.540> may<00:07:14.690> expect<00:07:15.080> another

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:15.350 
logical that we may expect another

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.490 
logical that we may expect another
messenger<00:07:15.830> to<00:07:15.980> show<00:07:16.100> up<00:07:16.250> from<00:07:16.400> South<00:07:16.550> America
