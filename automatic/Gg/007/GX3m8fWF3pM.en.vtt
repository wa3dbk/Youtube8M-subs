played again for me this game was

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.589 
played again for me this game was
frustrating<00:00:26.220> for<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.580> very<00:00:26.849> long<00:00:27.029> time<00:00:27.090> due<00:00:27.539> to

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
frustrating for a very long time due to

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.019

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the hit detection and I know I'm either

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.970 
the hit detection and I know I'm either
a<00:00:30.150> majority<00:00:30.720> or<00:00:30.750> minority<00:00:30.929> when<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.650> comes<00:00:31.830> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
a majority or minority when it comes to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.500 
a majority or minority when it comes to
that<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.579> don't<00:00:33.059> know<00:00:33.149> if<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.270> other<00:00:33.300> one

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
that had hit detection issues but for me

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.660 
that had hit detection issues but for me
it<00:00:36.570> was<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.070> game-breaking<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> lot<00:00:38.550> of

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
it was a game-breaking for a lot of

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.729

of the game it just happened to be one
of<00:00:42.180> those<00:00:42.329> rare<00:00:42.570> times<00:00:42.629> when<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.140> was<00:00:43.260> working
