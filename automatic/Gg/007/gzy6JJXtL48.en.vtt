00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
you Charlie with so you kind of know

you Charlie with so you kind of know
what<00:04:43.160> you're<00:04:43.340> in<00:04:43.370> over<00:04:43.700> Cyril<00:04:44.000> understeer<00:04:44.420> you

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
what you're in over Cyril understeer you

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.570 
what you're in over Cyril understeer you
do<00:04:45.020> get<00:04:45.170> a<00:04:45.200> little<00:04:45.320> bit<00:04:45.530> of<00:04:45.560> sensation<00:04:46.040> but<00:04:46.130> but

do get a little bit of sensation but but

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.920 
do get a little bit of sensation but but
ultimately<00:04:46.970> i<00:04:47.090> think<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.330> beginning<00:04:47.630> is<00:04:47.750> what

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
ultimately i think the beginning is what

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.840 
ultimately i think the beginning is what
we<00:04:48.020> wanted<00:04:48.320> was<00:04:48.470> to<00:04:48.620> make<00:04:48.650> a<00:04:48.890> racing<00:04:49.490> game<00:04:49.520> on

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
wii the analog control be pretty good

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.500 
wii the analog control be pretty good
we've<00:04:52.400> had<00:04:52.490> a<00:04:52.550> lot<00:04:52.670> of<00:04:52.730> success<00:04:53.030> with<00:04:53.060> that<00:04:53.210> and

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
we've had a lot of success with that and

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.820 
we've had a lot of success with that and
and<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:53.870> be<00:04:53.960> honest<00:04:54.230> like<00:04:54.260> it's<00:04:54.560> actually

looking like they're too I kind of get

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.430 
looking like they're too I kind of get
it<00:04:56.270> past<00:04:56.450> all<00:04:56.600> of<00:04:56.660> us<00:04:56.810> when<00:04:56.930> we<00:04:57.020> saw<00:04:57.170> much

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
it past all of us when we saw much

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.590 
it past all of us when we saw much
profits<00:04:57.860> we<00:04:57.980> could<00:04:58.130> push<00:04:58.340> push<00:04:59.240> onto<00:04:59.420> the

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
profits we could push push onto the

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.060 
profits we could push push onto the
machine<00:04:59.690> is<00:04:59.990> still<00:05:00.110> keep<00:05:00.320> our<00:05:00.440> physics<00:05:00.770> model

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
machine is still keep our physics model

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.380 
machine is still keep our physics model
running<00:05:01.250> at<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.400> right<00:05:01.550> speed<00:05:01.790> as<00:05:01.940> well<00:05:02.120> yeah

running at the right speed as well yeah
okay<00:05:02.780> and<00:05:03.110> then<00:05:03.380> the<00:05:03.620> DS<00:05:03.770> version<00:05:03.860> finally<00:05:04.640> is

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
okay and then the DS version finally is

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.460 
okay and then the DS version finally is
coming<00:05:05.330> out<00:05:05.420> that<00:05:05.600> we're<00:05:05.750> all<00:05:05.870> coming<00:05:06.080> out<00:05:06.290> in

coming out that we're all coming out in

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.380 
coming out that we're all coming out in
November<00:05:07.070> aren't<00:05:07.100> they<00:05:07.400> yeah<00:05:07.670> and<00:05:07.940> so<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.210> d/s

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
November aren't they yeah and so the d/s

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.450 
November aren't they yeah and so the d/s
version<00:05:08.720> is<00:05:08.840> is<00:05:08.990> going<00:05:09.650> to<00:05:09.710> have<00:05:09.890> the<00:05:10.160> same

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
version is is going to have the same

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.680 
version is is going to have the same
amount<00:05:10.700> of<00:05:10.730> tracks<00:05:11.090> but<00:05:11.270> it's<00:05:11.390> gonna<00:05:11.480> it's

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
amount of tracks but it's gonna it's

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.120 
amount of tracks but it's gonna it's
going<00:05:11.840> to<00:05:11.900> differ<00:05:12.020> slightly<00:05:12.230> I<00:05:12.620> guess<00:05:12.920> in

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
going to differ slightly I guess in

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.770 
going to differ slightly I guess in
there<00:05:13.280> yeah<00:05:13.700> I<00:05:13.910> mean<00:05:14.000> controls<00:05:14.360> but<00:05:14.480> I'm<00:05:14.600> not

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
there yeah I mean controls but I'm not

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.300 
there yeah I mean controls but I'm not
actually<00:05:14.990> sure<00:05:15.170> about<00:05:15.530> what<00:05:15.740> the<00:05:15.890> what<00:05:16.280> the

actually sure about what the what the

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.160 
actually sure about what the what the
final<00:05:16.850> track<00:05:17.150> specification<00:05:17.720> is<00:05:17.810> for<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.020> DS

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
final track specification is for the DS

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.750 
final track specification is for the DS

together and development teams just kind

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:27.790 
together and development teams just kind
of<00:05:26.750> you<00:05:26.840> know<00:05:26.870> taco<00:05:27.170> what<00:05:27.410> we're<00:05:27.500> going<00:05:27.590> to<00:05:27.680> do

of you know taco what we're going to do
like<00:05:28.130> just<00:05:28.310> sharing<00:05:28.610> glass<00:05:28.730> that's<00:05:28.910> where<00:05:29.060> we

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
like just sharing glass that's where we

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.270 
like just sharing glass that's where we
have<00:05:29.300> you<00:05:29.570> know<00:05:29.690> and<00:05:30.110> I<00:05:30.320> just<00:05:30.620> kind<00:05:30.800> of<00:05:30.830> keeping

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
have you know and I just kind of keeping

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.650 
have you know and I just kind of keeping
them<00:05:31.490> in<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.640> same<00:05:31.880> style<00:05:32.180> while<00:05:32.330> each<00:05:32.450> other

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
them in the same style while each other

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.480 
them in the same style while each other
and<00:05:33.350> I<00:05:33.410> think<00:05:33.440> that<00:05:33.740> that's<00:05:33.770> pretty<00:05:34.130> good<00:05:34.370> too

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
and I think that that's pretty good too

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.710 
and I think that that's pretty good too
because<00:05:34.610> you<00:05:34.700> know<00:05:34.820> and<00:05:35.030> actually<00:05:35.270> is<00:05:35.510> it<00:05:35.630> you

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
because you know and actually is it you

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.840 
because you know and actually is it you
know<00:05:35.810> on<00:05:35.840> TS<00:05:36.500> it's<00:05:36.710> a<00:05:36.770> pretty<00:05:36.980> it<00:05:37.370> looks<00:05:37.430> good<00:05:37.790> I

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
know on TS it's a pretty it looks good I

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.880 
know on TS it's a pretty it looks good I
think<00:05:38.000> it<00:05:38.210> raises<00:05:38.360> it<00:05:38.510> very<00:05:38.660> well<00:05:38.810> so<00:05:39.800> you<00:05:39.860> can

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
think it raises it very well so you can

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.100 
think it raises it very well so you can
be<00:05:40.040> a<00:05:40.070> promising<00:05:40.220> title<00:05:40.730> pretty<00:05:40.850> and<00:05:41.270> then<00:05:41.660> you

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
be a promising title pretty and then you

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.960 
be a promising title pretty and then you
mentioned<00:05:42.440> briefly<00:05:42.620> before<00:05:43.070> burnouts<00:05:43.790> and

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
mentioned briefly before burnouts and

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.270 
mentioned briefly before burnouts and
who's<00:05:44.150> there<00:05:44.300> for<00:05:44.360> me<00:05:44.870> to<00:05:45.080> driver<00:05:45.410> it's<00:05:46.130> been

working<00:05:46.610> quietly<00:05:46.760> in<00:05:47.390> developing<00:05:47.810> game<00:05:48.050> and

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
working quietly in developing game and

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.300 
working quietly in developing game and
just<00:05:48.320> making<00:05:48.530> sure<00:05:48.740> that<00:05:48.770> everything<00:05:49.070> is

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:01.569 
actually takes that he worked quite a

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:02.969 
actually takes that he worked quite a
bit<00:06:01.719> in<00:06:01.750> each<00:06:01.900> car<00:06:02.110> decided<00:06:02.469> on<00:06:02.560> front<00:06:02.770> we<00:06:02.860> do

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979 
bit in each car decided on front we do

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:05.040 
bit in each car decided on front we do
an<00:06:03.069> initial<00:06:03.250> setup<00:06:03.639> on<00:06:04.210> forget<00:06:04.509> it<00:06:04.599> again<00:06:04.870> and

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
an initial setup on forget it again and

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.899 
an initial setup on forget it again and
apply<00:06:05.319> some<00:06:05.530> basic<00:06:05.889> vehicle<00:06:06.219> physics<00:06:06.699> to<00:06:06.819> it

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:06.909 
apply some basic vehicle physics to it

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:08.010 
apply some basic vehicle physics to it
so<00:06:07.030> it's<00:06:07.150> staying<00:06:07.360> on<00:06:07.479> the<00:06:07.539> road<00:06:07.689> and<00:06:07.870> it's

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
so it's staying on the road and it's

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.839 
so it's staying on the road and it's
certainly<00:06:08.169> one<00:06:08.530> and<00:06:08.770> beyond<00:06:09.340> that<00:06:09.400> we<00:06:09.669> work

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849 
certainly one and beyond that we work

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.249 
certainly one and beyond that we work
