fishing<00:00:06.920> with<00:00:07.040> braids<00:00:07.250> has<00:00:07.430> its<00:00:07.609> advantages

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
fishing with braids has its advantages

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.390 
fishing with braids has its advantages
for<00:00:08.719> starters<00:00:09.110> it's<00:00:09.500> significantly<00:00:10.070> thinner

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
for starters it's significantly thinner

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.490 
for starters it's significantly thinner
and<00:00:10.700> stronger<00:00:11.540> than<00:00:11.690> monofilament<00:00:12.200> or

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
and stronger than monofilament or

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.900 
and stronger than monofilament or
fluorocarbon<00:00:12.799> and<00:00:13.309> the<00:00:13.519> no<00:00:13.639> stretch

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
fluorocarbon and the no stretch

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.849 
fluorocarbon and the no stretch
properties<00:00:14.449> make<00:00:14.629> it<00:00:14.779> super<00:00:15.289> sensitive<00:00:15.770> to

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
properties make it super sensitive to

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:17.980 
properties make it super sensitive to
detect<00:00:16.190> even<00:00:16.460> the<00:00:16.609> most<00:00:16.760> subtle<00:00:17.119> bites<00:00:17.420> it

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
detect even the most subtle bites it

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.510 
detect even the most subtle bites it
also<00:00:18.140> means<00:00:18.440> there's<00:00:18.770> less<00:00:18.830> memory<00:00:19.310> in<00:00:19.460> the

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
also means there's less memory in the

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.830 
also means there's less memory in the
line<00:00:19.699> when<00:00:19.880> it<00:00:19.970> sits<00:00:20.119> on<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.390> spool<00:00:20.600> so

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
line when it sits on the spool so

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.900 
line when it sits on the spool so
depending<00:00:21.320> on<00:00:21.410> how<00:00:21.980> much<00:00:22.130> you<00:00:22.310> use<00:00:22.339> it<00:00:22.550> and

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
depending on how much you use it and

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.730 
depending on how much you use it and
attempt<00:00:23.179> to<00:00:23.300> abuse<00:00:23.509> it<00:00:23.749> you<00:00:24.169> may<00:00:24.320> only<00:00:24.439> need<00:00:24.650> to

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
attempt to abuse it you may only need to

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.040 
attempt to abuse it you may only need to
change<00:00:24.919> your<00:00:25.160> line<00:00:25.279> a<00:00:25.310> few<00:00:25.579> times<00:00:25.820> a<00:00:25.970> year<00:00:26.050> we

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
change your line a few times a year we

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.599 
change your line a few times a year we
all<00:00:27.199> have<00:00:27.380> our<00:00:27.410> own<00:00:27.529> way<00:00:27.800> of<00:00:27.919> restoring<00:00:28.249> and
