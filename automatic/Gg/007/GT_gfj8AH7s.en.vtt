00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 hello crazy and what is the guitar 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.609
 stop with the lights 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.000
 and today's question is 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:21.800
 enough of the lights to know in which legs 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.369
 the guitar is placed depends on what 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.040
 applied is that you are because if you are a 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.460
 little careless or careless then 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.649
 this position place the guitar on 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.309
 your right leg will be wrong 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:40.760
 because at the time of playing you will do this not 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.829
 you only want like this and you support your arm in 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.610
 the leg this as you can check 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.100
 It can be fatal for the back is bad 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.240
 to play because you have the arm is 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.240
 stuck good it's not a great idea 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.280
 then and you are in this way that you do not 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.750
 you fix a lot on things the best is 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.870
 place it 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.250
 in the middle or that this part is in the 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.580
 part in the left leg 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.830
 this makes the arm unable to 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.160
 no way reach the leg and be 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.860
 always well placed makes you 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:21.520
 back straight and you forget pains 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.490
 and play normally then without looking at 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.890
 strings the main problem that there is to 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.900
 place the guitar in this way is that 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.870
 so that the position is really 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.780
 comfortable you have to have this leg a 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.370
 little rise and how do you do that good 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.390
 if you do not have a lot of money then you put 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.979
 some books under the foot or a box and 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.060
 If not then what you do is buy yourself 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.600
 this apparatus 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.000
 that regulates 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.299
 the height where you are going to place the foot 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.390
 then this would go on the foot where it is 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.330
 supported the guitar not in the other the 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.720
 another problem that there is when touching of this 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.770
 way is that this position is not 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.920
 very rockera we say 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.890
 then the position of rock that 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.290
 you see in all the concerts and the clips 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.510
 that you normally see on television or 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.310
 currently, on the internet 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.410
 guitar they have it on this 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.110
 way but look and the guitarist 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.780
 she has her back well placed 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.990
 straight and the arm because he never has it 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.060
 supported 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.650
 this is may seem a bit like 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.380
 foolishness but over time it 's going to 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.930
 appear pains in the back in the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.000
 arms and it's going to be quite uncomfortable 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.120
 play the guitar so if it is you catch 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.060
 the rock position the back well 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.820
 straight and if you know the classical position 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.090
 because all this takes three cattle but 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.760
 well it's not so spectacular I hope 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.850

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.770
