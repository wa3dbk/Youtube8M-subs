00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
different caveats on this this is in my

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.639 
different caveats on this this is in my
opinion<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.740> best<00:01:15.130> weapon<00:01:15.969> um<00:01:16.240> that<00:01:17.229> you<00:01:17.409> can

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
opinion the best weapon um that you can

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.130 
opinion the best weapon um that you can
use<00:01:18.090> pretty<00:01:19.090> regularly<00:01:19.630> from<00:01:19.869> a<00:01:19.960> certain

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
use pretty regularly from a certain

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.639 
use pretty regularly from a certain
point<00:01:20.380> in<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.560> game<00:01:20.590> on<00:01:20.979> so<00:01:21.399> it's<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.850> best

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
point in the game on so it's the best

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.819 
point in the game on so it's the best
normal<00:01:23.649> or<00:01:23.829> highly<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:26.140> look<00:01:26.350> thats<00:01:26.560> not<00:01:26.770> the

like the gauss rifle which is like you
know<00:01:34.600> one<00:01:35.020> of<00:01:35.049> the<00:01:35.229> best<00:01:35.380> weapons<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:35.950> it's

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
know one of the best weapons and it's

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.200 
know one of the best weapons and it's
the<00:01:36.159> best<00:01:36.280> sniper<00:01:36.579> weapon<00:01:36.759> but<00:01:37.030> there<00:01:37.179> just

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
the best sniper weapon but there just

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.389 
the best sniper weapon but there just
isn't<00:01:37.420> a<00:01:37.659> lot<00:01:37.689> of<00:01:37.929> ammo<00:01:38.289> for<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:38.890> it's

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
isn't a lot of ammo for it and it's

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.999 
isn't a lot of ammo for it and it's
something<00:01:40.179> you<00:01:40.479> can<00:01:40.659> only<00:01:40.840> use<00:01:41.140> in<00:01:41.439> spots<00:01:41.770> it's

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
something you can only use in spots it's

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.120 
something you can only use in spots it's
phenomenal<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:44.079> it's<00:01:44.530> similarly<00:01:45.009> the

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
phenomenal and it's similarly the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.849 
phenomenal and it's similarly the
microwave<00:01:45.579> can't<00:01:45.909> same<00:01:46.270> type<00:01:46.479> of<00:01:46.509> thing<00:01:46.859> the

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
microwave can't same type of thing the

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:51.719 
microwave can't same type of thing the
best<00:01:48.130> shortwave<00:01:48.999> web<00:01:49.380> range<00:01:50.380> weapon<00:01:51.130> but

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
best shortwave web range weapon but

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.319 
best shortwave web range weapon but
again<00:01:51.939> there's<00:01:52.479> not<00:01:52.689> a<00:01:52.719> ton<00:01:53.079> of<00:01:53.139> ammo<00:01:53.829> for<00:01:54.329> both

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
again there's not a ton of ammo for both

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.569 
again there's not a ton of ammo for both
the<00:01:55.869> gauss<00:01:56.079> rifle<00:01:56.259> and<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.950> microwave<00:01:57.189> can

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
the gauss rifle and the microwave can

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.090 
the gauss rifle and the microwave can
you<00:01:58.240> know<00:01:58.359> you<00:01:58.420> can<00:01:58.630> use<00:01:58.990> do<00:01:59.409> a<00:01:59.469> decent<00:01:59.770> amount

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
of ammo now here we're using the

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.530 
of ammo now here we're using the
microwave<00:02:39.049> can

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
microwave can

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.350 
microwave can
you<00:02:41.079> can<00:02:41.260> take<00:02:41.439> these<00:02:41.560> guys<00:02:41.769> out<00:02:42.010> quit<00:02:42.430> great

you can take these guys out quit great

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.099 
you can take these guys out quit great
short<00:02:43.750> range<00:02:44.969> but<00:02:45.969> again<00:02:47.939> limited<00:02:48.939> ammo<00:02:49.510> and

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
short range but again limited ammo and

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.569 
short range but again limited ammo and
you<00:02:50.290> can<00:02:50.469> see<00:02:50.590> right<00:02:50.620> there<00:02:50.980> burned<00:02:51.310> through

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
you can see right there burned through

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.849 
you can see right there burned through
about<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.849> third<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.239> my<00:02:52.359> clip<00:02:52.659> pretty<00:02:53.230> fast<00:02:53.590> on

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
about a third of my clip pretty fast on

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.809 
about a third of my clip pretty fast on
two<00:02:54.099> enemies<00:02:54.489> well<00:02:55.030> switch<00:02:55.329> out<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:57.370> for

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
two enemies well switch out the this for

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.599 
two enemies well switch out the this for
the<00:02:57.879> range<00:02:58.090> FK<00:02:58.540> 60<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:59.109> I<00:02:59.319> think<00:02:59.439> is<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.870> best

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
the range FK 60 this I think is the best

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.479 
the range FK 60 this I think is the best
all-around<00:03:03.609> weapon<00:03:04.799> because<00:03:05.799> you<00:03:05.920> can<00:03:06.099> use<00:03:06.310> it

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
all-around weapon because you can use it

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.240 
all-around weapon because you can use it
a<00:03:06.639> lot<00:03:06.939> and<00:03:07.359> it's<00:03:08.230> got<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.829> get<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.040> good

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
a lot and it's got you to get a good

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.390 
a lot and it's got you to get a good
little<00:03:09.430> scope<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:13.060> that's<00:03:13.239> it<00:03:13.480> oh<00:03:14.400> that's

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
little scope and that's it oh that's

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.520 
little scope and that's it oh that's
what<00:03:15.579> you<00:03:15.700> do<00:03:15.879> you've<00:03:16.810> got<00:03:16.989> some<00:03:17.170> precision

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
what you do you've got some precision

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:25.070 
what you do you've got some precision
you<00:03:18.159> don't<00:03:18.340> have<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.549> get<00:03:18.669> crazy

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.080 

it<00:03:26.080> just<00:03:26.410> works<00:03:26.710> takes<00:03:27.490> a<00:03:27.580> little<00:03:27.730> bit<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:27.940> time

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
it just works takes a little bit of time

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.960 
it just works takes a little bit of time
to<00:03:28.300> load<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.720> reload<00:03:28.780> in<00:03:29.260> between<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.790> make

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
to load and reload in between so make

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.030 
to load and reload in between so make
sure<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.300> factor<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.750> in<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:35.320> would<00:03:35.560> pair

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
sure you factor that in and I would pair

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.270 
sure you factor that in and I would pair
this<00:03:36.220> up<00:03:36.960> if<00:03:37.960> I<00:03:38.110> wasn't<00:03:38.230> demoing<00:03:38.860> this<00:03:39.070> I'd

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
this up if I wasn't demoing this I'd

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.860 
this up if I wasn't demoing this I'd
pair<00:03:39.520> this<00:03:39.640> up<00:03:39.820> with<00:03:40.030> it<00:03:40.180> with<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.360> microwave

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
pair this up with it with the microwave

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.200 
pair this up with it with the microwave
cannon<00:03:41.260> just<00:03:41.410> so<00:03:41.500> i<00:03:41.560> have<00:03:41.590> like<00:03:41.890> strong<00:03:42.310> short

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
cannon just so i have like strong short

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.020 
cannon just so i have like strong short
range<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:43.960> again<00:03:44.800> you<00:03:44.920> can<00:03:44.950> just<00:03:45.220> reload<00:03:45.880> it

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
range and again you can just reload it

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.490 
range and again you can just reload it
right<00:03:46.180> here<00:03:46.450> at<00:03:46.600> any<00:03:46.900> normal<00:03:47.170> ammunition<00:03:47.830> dump

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
right here at any normal ammunition dump

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.720 
right here at any normal ammunition dump
that's<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.710> that's<00:03:50.920> what<00:03:51.190> i<00:03:51.250> think<00:03:51.340> is<00:03:51.700> the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
that's it that's what i think is the

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.020 
that's it that's what i think is the
best<00:03:51.910> weapons<00:03:52.510> of<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:53.200> game<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.940> there<00:03:57.940> you

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
best weapons of the game and there you

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.580 
best weapons of the game and there you
go<00:03:58.060> that's<00:03:58.420> why<00:03:58.600> we<00:03:58.840> like<00:03:59.050> those<00:03:59.200> weapons<00:03:59.380> a

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
go that's why we like those weapons a

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.960 
go that's why we like those weapons a
lot<00:03:59.740> i<00:03:59.950> think<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.340> they<00:04:00.430> are<00:04:00.460> very<00:04:00.550> very

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
lot i think that they are very very

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.080 
lot i think that they are very very
solid<00:04:01.480> I<00:04:01.660> think<00:04:02.110> again<00:04:03.070> with<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.340> mk6<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:03.970> can

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
solid I think again with the mk6 you can

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.190 
solid I think again with the mk6 you can
put<00:04:04.210> the<00:04:04.300> scope<00:04:04.510> on<00:04:04.720> you<00:04:04.840> can<00:04:04.960> do<00:04:05.050> different

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
put the scope on you can do different

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.530 
put the scope on you can do different
things<00:04:05.380> you<00:04:05.710> have<00:04:05.830> normal<00:04:06.700> modifications<00:04:07.360> on

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
things you have normal modifications on

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.810 
things you have normal modifications on
the<00:04:08.500> other<00:04:08.620> weapons<00:04:08.950> are<00:04:09.040> also<00:04:09.220> fantastic

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
the other weapons are also fantastic

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.090 
the other weapons are also fantastic
it's<00:04:10.660> great<00:04:10.960> it's<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.290> great<00:04:11.320> game<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.860> think

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
it's great it's a great game I think

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.400 
it's great it's a great game I think
that's<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.580> citta<00:04:12.880> that<00:04:13.060> you<00:04:13.180> want<00:04:13.450> you<00:04:14.170> use

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
that's the citta that you want you use
