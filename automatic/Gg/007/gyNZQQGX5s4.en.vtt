00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.730 
geography course today we'll be looking
at<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.170> factors<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.770> population<00:00:08.550> change<00:00:09.740> so

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
at the factors of population change so

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.370 
at the factors of population change so
as<00:00:11.010> we<00:00:11.160> have<00:00:11.280> seen<00:00:11.429> earlier<00:00:11.670> on<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.090> course

over this so when we look at for example
in<00:00:41.700> our<00:00:41.879> 15<00:00:42.390> markers<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> exam<00:00:43.350> when<00:00:43.890> we're

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
in our 15 markers in the exam when we're

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.069 
in our 15 markers in the exam when we're
going<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.340> have<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> question<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.719> discuss

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
going to have a question to discuss

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.930 
going to have a question to discuss
we're<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.520> compare

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
we're going to have to compare

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.760 
we're going to have to compare
advantages<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.750> disadvantages<00:00:49.260> really<00:00:49.590> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
advantages and disadvantages really and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.130 
advantages and disadvantages really and
these<00:00:50.370> advantages<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.239> disadvantages<00:00:51.930> are

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
these advantages and disadvantages are

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.900 
these advantages and disadvantages are
going<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.590> classified<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.460> seat

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
going to be classified as seat

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.389 
going to be classified as seat
advantages<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.719> disadvantages<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:56.039> if<00:00:56.309> you

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
advantages and disadvantages so if you

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.099 
advantages and disadvantages so if you
were<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.640> mention<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> exam<00:00:57.899> that

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
were to mention that in the exam that

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.080 
were to mention that in the exam that
this<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> social<00:00:58.829> impact<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.000> an

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
this is a social impact and this is an

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.849 
this is a social impact and this is an
environmental<00:01:00.660> impact<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.500> would<00:01:01.620> then<00:01:01.739> pick

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
environmental impact you would then pick

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.100 
environmental impact you would then pick
up<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> marks<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.809> how<00:01:03.899> we're<00:01:04.019> going

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
up the marks so this is how we're going

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.500 
up the marks so this is how we're going
to<00:01:04.229> classify<00:01:04.379> all<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> factors<00:01:05.339> okay<00:01:06.150> first

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
to classify all the factors okay first

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.910 
to classify all the factors okay first
we're<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.840> check<00:01:06.930> out<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.500> social

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
we're going to check out the social

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.039 
we're going to check out the social
factors<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.090> first<00:01:09.270> social<00:01:09.420> factor<00:01:09.869> is

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
factors and the first social factor is

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.670 
factors and the first social factor is
religion<00:01:10.650> okay<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.270> religion<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.530> for

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
religion okay so we have religion so for

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.780 
religion okay so we have religion so for
example<00:01:13.979> at<00:01:14.040> Catholicism<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.820> Islam<00:01:14.990> which

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
example at Catholicism and Islam which

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.510 
example at Catholicism and Islam which
encourage<00:01:17.790> families<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.290> kids<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.890> also

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
encourage families to have kids and also

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.480 
encourage families to have kids and also
teachers<00:01:21.240> families<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:22.710> not<00:01:23.310> use

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
teachers families to not not use

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.219 
teachers families to not not use
contraception<00:01:24.090> because<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.930> different

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
contraception because of different

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.819 
contraception because of different
beliefs<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.220> therefore<00:01:27.170> since<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.439> Bible<00:01:28.710> may

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
beliefs so therefore since the Bible may

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.160 
beliefs so therefore since the Bible may
say<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.880> know<00:01:30.299> children<00:01:30.570> are<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> fruit

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
say that you know children are the fruit

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.749 
say that you know children are the fruit
of<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> womb<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.100> family<00:01:32.430> should<00:01:32.579> have

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
of the womb and that family should have

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.120 
of the womb and that family should have
many<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.119> them<00:01:33.409> more<00:01:34.409> religious<00:01:34.740> families

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
many of them more religious families

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.100 
many of them more religious families
such<00:01:35.400> as<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.880> Mexico<00:01:36.329> where<00:01:36.600> there's<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.840> high

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
such as in Mexico where there's a high

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.499 
such as in Mexico where there's a high
percentage<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:38.189> Catholics<00:01:38.790> we'll<00:01:39.150> have<00:01:39.329> more

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
percentage of Catholics we'll have more

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:39.920 
percentage of Catholics we'll have more
kids

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
kids

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.249 
kids
hence<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.409> birth<00:01:40.560> rate<00:01:40.799> will<00:01:40.950> increase<00:01:42.259> okay

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
hence the birth rate will increase okay

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.990 
hence the birth rate will increase okay
the<00:01:43.380> next<00:01:43.619> social<00:01:43.770> factor<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.399> health<00:01:44.729> care

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
the next social factor is health care

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.639 
the next social factor is health care
and<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.270> course<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.840> logical<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.439> if<00:01:46.619> you

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
and of course it's logical that if you

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.980 
and of course it's logical that if you
have<00:01:46.860> an<00:01:47.130> improved<00:01:47.399> health<00:01:47.700> care<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
have an improved health care that the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.139 
have an improved health care that the
population<00:01:49.740> will<00:01:49.950> probably<00:01:50.340> live<00:01:50.579> longer<00:01:51.000> and

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
population will probably live longer and

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.840 
population will probably live longer and
also<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.500> they<00:01:52.799> do<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:53.189> disease<00:01:53.490> they<00:01:53.700> can

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
also if they do have disease they can

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.660 
also if they do have disease they can
treat<00:01:54.030> them<00:01:54.210> easily<00:01:54.390> with<00:01:54.570> health<00:01:55.049> care<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
treat them easily with health care and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.280 
treat them easily with health care and
the<00:01:56.670> death<00:01:57.060> rate<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.450> going<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.750> decrease

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the death rate is going to decrease

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.690 
the death rate is going to decrease
because<00:01:58.469> not<00:01:58.799> as<00:01:58.890> many<00:01:58.920> people<00:01:59.130> are<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.520> to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
because not as many people are going to

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.490 
because not as many people are going to
be<00:01:59.820> dying<00:02:00.030> as<00:02:00.299> opposed<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.229> amount<00:02:01.469> that

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
be dying as opposed to the amount that

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.980 
be dying as opposed to the amount that
would<00:02:01.680> die<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:02.130> there<00:02:02.159> was<00:02:02.460> no<00:02:03.180> or<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.899> know

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
would die if there was no or you know

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.520 
would die if there was no or you know
worse<00:02:04.290> health<00:02:04.590> care<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.950> place<00:02:06.229> okay<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.439> we

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
worse health care in place okay and we

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.880 
worse health care in place okay and we
also<00:02:07.680> have<00:02:08.039> education<00:02:08.700> finally<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
also have education finally and

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.229 
also have education finally and
education<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:10.979> mainly<00:02:11.220> educational<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
education is mainly educational and

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.650 
education is mainly educational and
fertility<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.989> isn't<00:02:13.260> school

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
fertility this isn't school

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.570 
fertility this isn't school
in<00:02:14.050> education<00:02:14.260> where<00:02:14.920> they<00:02:14.980> teach<00:02:15.100> about<00:02:15.370> math

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
in education where they teach about math

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.090 
in education where they teach about math
science<00:02:15.940> etc<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.230> more<00:02:17.380> educated<00:02:17.800> country

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
science etc so the more educated country

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.100 
science etc so the more educated country
is<00:02:18.430> on<00:02:18.700> fertility<00:02:19.060> it's<00:02:19.450> going<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.750> know<00:02:19.900> how

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
is on fertility it's going to know how

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.470 
is on fertility it's going to know how
to<00:02:20.170> use<00:02:20.380> methods<00:02:20.710> of<00:02:20.800> contraception<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.610> that

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
to use methods of contraception and that

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.710 
to use methods of contraception and that
it<00:02:22.630> may<00:02:22.840> be<00:02:22.900> more<00:02:23.790> resourceful<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.240> you<00:02:25.600> know

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
it may be more resourceful and you know

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.570 
it may be more resourceful and you know
more<00:02:26.170> economical<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.680> have<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> smaller<00:02:27.310> family

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
more economical to have a smaller family

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.320 
more economical to have a smaller family
for<00:02:28.570> example<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:29.770> families<00:02:30.520> in<00:02:30.760> Thailand

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
for example the families in Thailand

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.800 
for example the families in Thailand
that<00:02:31.570> used<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.960> in<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.470> nineteen<00:02:32.920> sort<00:02:33.490> of<00:02:33.550> 70s

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
that used to in the nineteen sort of 70s

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.540 
that used to in the nineteen sort of 70s
1960s<00:02:34.810> we<00:02:35.320> used<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.530> have<00:02:35.680> six<00:02:35.950> or<00:02:36.040> seven<00:02:36.310> kids

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
1960s we used to have six or seven kids

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.150 
1960s we used to have six or seven kids
per<00:02:37.180> family<00:02:37.210> have<00:02:37.750> now<00:02:37.840> been<00:02:38.050> educated<00:02:38.650> that

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
per family have now been educated that

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.040 
per family have now been educated that
it's<00:02:39.280> much<00:02:39.460> easier<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.120> now<00:02:40.510> it's<00:02:40.660> up<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.930> them

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
it's much easier and now it's up to them

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.690 
it's much easier and now it's up to them
to<00:02:41.290> have<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.440> smaller<00:02:41.740> family<00:02:41.920> which<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.430> easier

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
to have a smaller family which is easier

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.330 
to have a smaller family which is easier
to<00:02:42.850> control<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:44.290> therefore<00:02:44.800> with<00:02:44.980> all<00:02:45.010> these

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
to control so therefore with all these

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.250 
to control so therefore with all these
different<00:02:45.640> social<00:02:45.790> factors<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.660> population

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
different social factors the population

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.610 
different social factors the population
can<00:02:47.440> increase<00:02:48.040> or<00:02:48.160> decrease<00:02:49.260> okay<00:02:50.260> next<00:02:50.440> we're

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
can increase or decrease okay next we're

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.230 
can increase or decrease okay next we're
going<00:02:50.740> to<00:02:50.800> look<00:02:50.980> at<00:02:51.160> economic<00:02:51.670> factors<00:02:52.060> and

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
going to look at economic factors and

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.390 
going to look at economic factors and
the<00:02:52.960> main<00:02:53.080> one<00:02:53.260> really<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.710> people's<00:02:54.100> income

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
the main one really is people's income

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.190 
the main one really is people's income
if<00:02:54.880> individuals<00:02:55.480> don't<00:02:55.630> have<00:02:55.750> enough<00:02:55.990> money

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
if individuals don't have enough money

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.840 
if individuals don't have enough money
and<00:02:56.440> they're<00:02:57.130> not<00:02:57.190> going<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.400> be<00:02:57.550> able<00:02:57.760> to

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
and they're not going to be able to

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.300 
and they're not going to be able to
raise<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.210> child<00:02:58.770> because<00:02:59.770> simply<00:03:00.190> they

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
raise the child because simply they

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.540 
raise the child because simply they
can't<00:03:00.490> pay<00:03:00.640> for<00:03:00.670> it<00:03:00.880> so<00:03:01.830> for<00:03:02.830> example<00:03:03.220> today<00:03:03.370> in

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
can't pay for it so for example today in

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.010 
can't pay for it so for example today in
modern<00:03:03.820> society<00:03:04.270> if<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:04.510> family<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:05.920> think<00:03:06.850> it's

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
modern society if a family I think it's

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.450 
modern society if a family I think it's
150<00:03:08.020> pounds<00:03:08.410> that's<00:03:08.560> going<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.950> burst<00:03:09.100> sorry

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
150 pounds that's going to burst sorry

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.250 
150 pounds that's going to burst sorry
150<00:03:10.120> thousand<00:03:10.450> pounds<00:03:10.750> it's<00:03:10.840> going<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.110> cost

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
150 thousand pounds it's going to cost

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.410 
150 thousand pounds it's going to cost
to<00:03:11.350> have<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.500> kid<00:03:11.740> to<00:03:12.310> raise<00:03:12.490> it<00:03:12.670> from<00:03:12.880> birth<00:03:13.150> all

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
to have a kid to raise it from birth all

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.550 
to have a kid to raise it from birth all
the<00:03:13.450> way<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.690> university<00:03:14.530> or<00:03:14.980> 18<00:03:15.610> plus<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:17.290> if

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
the way to university or 18 plus so if

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.140 
the way to university or 18 plus so if
families<00:03:18.100> now<00:03:18.310> know<00:03:18.490> that<00:03:18.670> they<00:03:18.760> can't<00:03:18.910> afford

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
families now know that they can't afford

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.480 
families now know that they can't afford
them<00:03:19.450> of<00:03:20.440> course<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.770> birthrate<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.190> going<00:03:21.370> to

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
them of course the birthrate is going to

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.280 
them of course the birthrate is going to
decrease<00:03:21.910> as<00:03:22.270> they're<00:03:22.780> not<00:03:22.930> going<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.170> bother

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
decrease as they're not going to bother

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.810 
decrease as they're not going to bother
having<00:03:23.530> another<00:03:23.800> kid<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:24.250> they<00:03:24.490> can't<00:03:24.670> pay

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
having another kid that they can't pay

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.030 
having another kid that they can't pay
for<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.650> also<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:29.200> developing<00:03:29.620> countries

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
for so it also in developing countries

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.310 
for so it also in developing countries
works<00:03:30.640> in<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.880> same<00:03:31.090> way<00:03:31.270> if<00:03:31.540> people<00:03:32.140> need

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
works in the same way if people need

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.620 
works in the same way if people need
more<00:03:32.500> income<00:03:32.980> they<00:03:33.520> may<00:03:33.760> increase<00:03:34.300> the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
more income they may increase the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.750 
more income they may increase the
birthrate<00:03:35.050> because<00:03:35.410> they<00:03:35.590> want<00:03:35.860> more<00:03:36.160> kids<00:03:36.400> in

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
birthrate because they want more kids in

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.190 
birthrate because they want more kids in
order<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.840> work<00:03:38.380> on<00:03:38.709> their<00:03:39.070> farms<00:03:39.640> or<00:03:39.930> more<00:03:40.930> as

order to work on their farms or more as

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.600 
order to work on their farms or more as
producers<00:03:41.830> so<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.100> they<00:03:42.190> can<00:03:42.340> increase

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
producers so that they can increase

their<00:03:42.820> income<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.450> in<00:03:43.720> developing<00:03:43.810> world<00:03:44.350> they

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
their income so in developing world they

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.290 
their income so in developing world they
may<00:03:44.800> want<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.040> decrease<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.489> birthrate<00:03:45.940> due

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
may want to decrease the birthrate due

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.720

to<00:03:46.420> income<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.870> developing<00:03:47.800> well<00:03:48.280> they<00:03:48.550> want

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
to income and developing well they want

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.190 
to income and developing well they want
to<00:03:48.880> increase<00:03:49.300> the<00:03:49.420> birthrate<00:03:49.780> so<00:03:49.959> they<00:03:50.080> get

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
to increase the birthrate so they get

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.130 
to increase the birthrate so they get
more<00:03:50.350> money<00:03:50.500> from<00:03:50.860> work<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.489> labour<00:03:52.140> ok

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140

the spread of disease are a big problem
because<00:04:26.740> if<00:04:26.860> a<00:04:26.950> country

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400

the<00:04:30.160> death<00:04:30.340> rate<00:04:30.550> is<00:04:30.669> of<00:04:30.850> course<00:04:31.120> going<00:04:31.389> to

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
the death rate is of course going to

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.830 
the death rate is of course going to
pick<00:04:32.350> up<00:04:32.500> so<00:04:32.710> for<00:04:32.919> example<00:04:33.660> Bangladesh<00:04:34.660> is<00:04:34.810> a

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
pick up so for example Bangladesh is a

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.430 
pick up so for example Bangladesh is a
country<00:04:34.900> that<00:04:35.290> is<00:04:36.120> has<00:04:37.120> a<00:04:37.150> very<00:04:37.300> low<00:04:37.780> sea<00:04:38.139> level

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
country that is has a very low sea level

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.279 
country that is has a very low sea level
that's<00:04:38.830> quite<00:04:39.039> near<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.310> sea<00:04:39.460> level<00:04:39.759> and<00:04:40.289> it's

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
that's quite near the sea level and it's

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.560 
that's quite near the sea level and it's
as<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.860> result<00:04:42.250> it<00:04:42.430> is<00:04:42.639> you<00:04:43.090> know<00:04:43.150> prone<00:04:43.449> to

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
as a result it is you know prone to

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.350 
as a result it is you know prone to
flooding<00:04:43.810> so<00:04:44.410> due<00:04:44.770> to<00:04:44.919> all<00:04:45.039> the<00:04:45.220> water<00:04:46.000> that

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
flooding so due to all the water that

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.060 
flooding so due to all the water that
can<00:04:46.750> sort<00:04:47.050> of<00:04:47.110> infect<00:04:47.620> all<00:04:47.979> the<00:04:49.830> areas<00:04:50.830> in

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
can sort of infect all the areas in

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.120 
can sort of infect all the areas in
Bangladesh<00:04:51.820> where<00:04:52.060> they<00:04:52.150> will<00:04:52.509> receive<00:04:52.810> water

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
Bangladesh where they will receive water

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.430 
Bangladesh where they will receive water
so<00:04:54.130> for<00:04:54.310> example<00:04:54.699> in<00:04:54.789> the<00:04:54.880> piping<00:04:55.419> or<00:04:55.960> by

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
so for example in the piping or by

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.110 
so for example in the piping or by
people<00:04:56.830> that<00:04:56.860> are<00:04:57.190> walking<00:04:57.430> down<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.820> street

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
people that are walking down the street

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.750 
people that are walking down the street
maybe<00:04:58.449> taking<00:04:59.050> a<00:04:59.110> drink<00:04:59.259> from<00:04:59.760> contaminated

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
maybe taking a drink from contaminated

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.080 
maybe taking a drink from contaminated
water<00:05:00.789> cholera<00:05:01.479> can<00:05:01.780> then<00:05:02.010> spread<00:05:03.010> into<00:05:03.550> the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
water cholera can then spread into the

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.000 
water cholera can then spread into the
people<00:05:04.690> from<00:05:04.810> Bangladesh<00:05:04.960> and<00:05:05.500> as<00:05:05.620> a<00:05:05.650> result

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
people from Bangladesh and as a result

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.529 
people from Bangladesh and as a result
they<00:05:06.190> will<00:05:06.460> have<00:05:06.639> cholera<00:05:06.940> and<00:05:07.180> if<00:05:07.270> they<00:05:07.360> don't

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
they will have cholera and if they don't

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:08.610 
they will have cholera and if they don't
have<00:05:07.690> the<00:05:07.810> correct<00:05:07.990> health<00:05:08.229> care<00:05:08.410> they<00:05:08.590> may

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
have the correct health care they may

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.680 
have the correct health care they may
die<00:05:09.010> so<00:05:09.580> of<00:05:09.699> course<00:05:09.850> it<00:05:10.060> will<00:05:10.180> decrease<00:05:10.570> the

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
die so of course it will decrease the

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.920 
die so of course it will decrease the
death<00:05:11.650> rate<00:05:12.120> also<00:05:13.120> the<00:05:13.479> risk<00:05:13.660> of<00:05:13.810> natural

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
death rate also the risk of natural

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.719 
death rate also the risk of natural
disaster<00:05:14.680> is<00:05:14.889> a<00:05:15.370> big<00:05:15.760> problem<00:05:16.139> for<00:05:17.610> that<00:05:18.610> the

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
disaster is a big problem for that the

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.550 
disaster is a big problem for that the
death<00:05:19.060> rate<00:05:19.180> as<00:05:19.419> well<00:05:19.599> as<00:05:19.660> people<00:05:20.320> will<00:05:20.440> die

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
death rate as well as people will die

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.200 
death rate as well as people will die
more<00:05:20.740> often<00:05:20.949> in<00:05:21.250> places<00:05:21.370> that<00:05:21.669> have<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.030> high

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
more often in places that have a high

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.839 
more often in places that have a high

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
risk of the natural disaster for example

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.969 
risk of the natural disaster for example
the<00:05:24.940> earthquakes<00:05:25.389> that<00:05:25.660> happen<00:05:25.930> Morphin<00:05:26.860> in

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
more prone to these natural disasters as

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.140 
more prone to these natural disasters as
opposed<00:05:38.289> to<00:05:38.410> the<00:05:38.560> UK<00:05:38.860> which<00:05:39.190> very<00:05:39.580> rarely<00:05:39.849> will

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150

ever experience an earthquake the final

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.800 
ever experience an earthquake the final
example<00:05:44.470> is<00:05:44.889> famine<00:05:45.460> which<00:05:45.940> is<00:05:46.210> more<00:05:46.539> people

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.409 
example is famine which is more people
die<00:05:47.020> set<00:05:47.229> unable<00:05:47.470> to<00:05:47.699> obtain<00:05:48.699> nourishment<00:05:49.360> and

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
die set unable to obtain nourishment and

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:50.820 
die set unable to obtain nourishment and
that<00:05:49.539> kind<00:05:49.750> of<00:05:49.810> links<00:05:50.020> into<00:05:50.260> the<00:05:50.380> weather<00:05:50.560> if

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
that kind of links into the weather if

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.990 
that kind of links into the weather if
they<00:05:51.280> don't<00:05:51.460> have<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.639> right<00:05:51.789> weather

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
they don't have the right weather

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.040 
they don't have the right weather
conditions<00:05:52.060> in<00:05:52.810> order<00:05:53.020> to<00:05:53.699> be<00:05:54.699> able<00:05:54.849> to<00:05:55.300> grow

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
conditions in order to be able to grow

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.659 
conditions in order to be able to grow
the<00:05:56.199> crops<00:05:56.349> there<00:05:56.740> will<00:05:56.889> be<00:05:56.919> a<00:05:57.010> famine<00:05:57.370> and<00:05:57.580> as

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
the crops there will be a famine and as

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.300 
the crops there will be a famine and as
a<00:05:57.699> result<00:05:58.090> people<00:05:58.780> will<00:05:59.169> die<00:05:59.500> so<00:05:59.830> all<00:06:00.130> these

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
a result people will die so all these

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.950 
a result people will die so all these
environmental<00:06:00.760> factors<00:06:01.270> really<00:06:01.479> decrease

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
environmental factors really decrease

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.730 
environmental factors really decrease
the<00:06:02.229> birthrate<00:06:03.960> some<00:06:04.960> examples<00:06:05.470> are<00:06:05.710> shown

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
the birthrate some examples are shown

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.730 
the birthrate some examples are shown
here<00:06:06.250> down<00:06:06.550> below

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
here down below

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.300 
here down below
ok<00:06:08.740> now<00:06:08.949> finally<00:06:09.490> the<00:06:09.639> political<00:06:10.120> factors

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
ok now finally the political factors

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.409 
ok now finally the political factors
population<00:06:12.310> policies<00:06:12.729> that<00:06:12.849> are<00:06:12.970> set<00:06:13.150> by<00:06:13.360> the

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
population policies that are set by the

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.420 
population policies that are set by the
country<00:06:13.930> can<00:06:14.229> then<00:06:14.440> alter<00:06:14.830> the<00:06:14.949> birth<00:06:15.130> rate

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
country can then alter the birth rate

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.820 
country can then alter the birth rate
for<00:06:15.669> example<00:06:16.120> China<00:06:16.840> had<00:06:17.110> their<00:06:17.349> one-child

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
for example China had their one-child

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.000 
for example China had their one-child
policy<00:06:17.919> where<00:06:18.699> families<00:06:19.270> were<00:06:20.010> strongly

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
policy where families were strongly

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.060 
policy where families were strongly
encouraged<00:06:21.550> in<00:06:22.449> fact<00:06:22.659> forced<00:06:23.080> many<00:06:23.349> times<00:06:23.590> to

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
encouraged in fact forced many times to

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.219 
encouraged in fact forced many times to
only<00:06:24.220> have<00:06:24.460> one<00:06:24.729> child<00:06:25.120> so<00:06:25.630> of<00:06:25.870> course<00:06:26.050> the

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
only have one child so of course the

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.580 
only have one child so of course the
birthrate<00:06:26.740> decreased<00:06:27.460> greatly<00:06:27.909> and<00:06:28.590> the

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
birthrate decreased greatly and the

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.080 
birthrate decreased greatly and the
population<00:06:30.099> difficulty<00:06:30.550> need<00:06:30.699> to<00:06:30.789> increase

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
population difficulty need to increase

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.450 
population difficulty need to increase
but<00:06:32.050> the<00:06:32.139> replacement<00:06:32.409> level<00:06:32.710> is<00:06:33.099> of<00:06:33.220> course

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
but the replacement level is of course

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.040 
but the replacement level is of course
decreasing<00:06:34.000> so<00:06:34.150> two<00:06:34.539> parents<00:06:34.900> are<00:06:34.960> only

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
decreasing so two parents are only

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.200 
decreasing so two parents are only
having<00:06:35.320> one<00:06:35.349> kid<00:06:35.710> and<00:06:35.889> that's<00:06:36.370> really<00:06:36.820> slowed

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
having one kid and that's really slowed

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.190 
having one kid and that's really slowed
down<00:06:37.389> the<00:06:37.659> birth<00:06:38.020> rate<00:06:38.289> so<00:06:39.099> now

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
down the birth rate so now

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.900 
down the birth rate so now
not<00:06:40.770> as<00:06:40.860> many<00:06:41.010> children<00:06:41.370> gonna<00:06:41.520> be<00:06:41.610> born<00:06:41.820> on

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
not as many children gonna be born on

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.370 
not as many children gonna be born on
the<00:06:42.000> population<00:06:42.450> will<00:06:42.570> decrease<00:06:42.870> over<00:06:43.200> time

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
the population will decrease over time

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.530 
the population will decrease over time
in<00:06:43.590> the<00:06:43.650> long<00:06:43.800> run<00:06:44.010> if<00:06:44.520> not<00:06:44.910> as<00:06:45.000> many<00:06:45.180> children

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
in the long run if not as many children

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.710 
in the long run if not as many children
are<00:06:45.630> going<00:06:45.720> to<00:06:45.810> be<00:06:45.960> born<00:06:46.910> also<00:06:47.910> war<00:06:48.480> is<00:06:48.690> a

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
are going to be born also war is a

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.690 
are going to be born also war is a
political<00:06:49.170> factor<00:06:49.560> which<00:06:49.890> you<00:06:50.340> know<00:06:50.400> it<00:06:50.520> speak

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
political factor which you know it speak

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.700 
political factor which you know it speak
to<00:06:50.730> itself<00:06:51.120> if<00:06:51.330> you<00:06:51.390> have<00:06:51.630> a<00:06:51.660> war<00:06:51.990> your<00:06:52.470> death

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
to itself if you have a war your death

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.280 
to itself if you have a war your death
rates<00:06:52.980> are<00:06:53.130> going<00:06:53.280> to<00:06:53.490> increasing<00:06:54.330> as<00:06:54.600> your

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.290 
rates are going to increasing as your

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.930 
rates are going to increasing as your
soldiers<00:06:55.710> are<00:06:55.830> going<00:06:56.010> to<00:06:56.100> be<00:06:56.190> dying<00:06:56.400> when<00:06:56.790> they

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
soldiers are going to be dying when they

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.260 
soldiers are going to be dying when they
are<00:06:57.060> battling<00:06:57.240> against<00:06:57.870> other<00:06:58.050> countries

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
are battling against other countries

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.090 
are battling against other countries
okay<00:07:00.270> so<00:07:00.330> we<00:07:01.080> have<00:07:01.350> gone<00:07:01.530> through<00:07:01.560> all<00:07:01.770> these

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
okay so we have gone through all these

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.490 
okay so we have gone through all these
seep<00:07:02.460> factors<00:07:03.090> of<00:07:03.210> population<00:07:03.750> change<00:07:03.990> now<00:07:04.260> I

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 
seep factors of population change now I

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.840 
seep factors of population change now I
would<00:07:05.070> like<00:07:05.160> you<00:07:05.220> to<00:07:05.370> attempt<00:07:05.760> these

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:51.570 
part we will be looking at factors or

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.630
