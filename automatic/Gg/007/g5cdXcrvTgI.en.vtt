matter<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.840> roughly<00:01:07.140> what<00:01:07.470> 16<00:01:08.010> man<00:01:08.220> i

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
matter it's roughly what 16 man i

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.109 
matter it's roughly what 16 man i
believe<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:09.780> not<00:01:09.900> cheap<00:01:10.850> ok<00:01:11.850> now<00:01:12.060> we

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
believe so it's not cheap ok now we

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
it's not too crazy hard I guess how can

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.420 
it's not too crazy hard I guess how can
I<00:03:34.989> put<00:03:35.170> this<00:03:35.230> if<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.680> can<00:03:35.829> handle<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.280> frost

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
I put this if you can handle the frost

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.490 
I put this if you can handle the frost
moon<00:03:36.820> or<00:03:37.120> if<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:37.989> can<00:03:38.110> get<00:03:38.200> some<00:03:38.350> decent

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
moon or if you can get some decent

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.350 
moon or if you can get some decent
weapons<00:03:38.890> of<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.070> frost<00:03:39.310> moon<00:03:39.579> you<00:03:40.239> could

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
weapons of the frost moon you could

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.080 
weapons of the frost moon you could
probably<00:03:40.600> take<00:03:40.840> on<00:03:41.049> Duke<00:03:41.320> fish<00:03:41.530> Ron<00:03:42.030> now<00:03:43.030> the

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
probably take on Duke fish Ron now the

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.250 
probably take on Duke fish Ron now the
thing<00:03:43.450> that<00:03:43.540> really<00:03:43.660> helps<00:03:43.959> here<00:03:44.110> would<00:03:44.230> be

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
thing that really helps here would be

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.660 
thing that really helps here would be

mythical blizzard staff excuse me as i
butchered<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.880> bubble<00:03:49.150> gun<00:03:49.980> as<00:03:50.980> i

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
butchered that and the bubble gun as i

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.710 
butchered that and the bubble gun as i
got<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.280> mystic<00:03:51.730> bubble<00:03:52.060> gun<00:03:52.209> i<00:03:52.239> went<00:03:52.510> ahead<00:03:52.570> and

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
got a mystic bubble gun i went ahead and

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.050 
got a mystic bubble gun i went ahead and
enhanced<00:03:53.350> it<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:53.530> little<00:03:53.680> bit<00:03:53.920> so<00:03:54.880> i<00:03:54.910> think

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
enhanced it a little bit so i think

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.490 
enhanced it a little bit so i think
these<00:03:55.360> two<00:03:55.570> are<00:03:55.600> probably<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.110> better<00:03:56.290> off

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
these two are probably the better off

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.180 
these two are probably the better off
one's<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:58.480> superior<00:03:58.930> razor<00:03:59.140> blade<00:03:59.500> it's<00:03:59.799> okay

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
one's the superior razor blade it's okay

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.330 
one's the superior razor blade it's okay
but<00:04:00.700> it's<00:04:00.750> i<00:04:01.890> don't<00:04:02.890> want<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.070> say<00:04:03.130> it's<00:04:03.250> the

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
but it's i don't want to say it's the

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.910 
but it's i don't want to say it's the
best<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:04.720> blizzard<00:04:05.079> staff<00:04:05.290> just<00:04:05.470> continues

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
best the blizzard staff just continues

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.039 
best the blizzard staff just continues
to<00:04:05.950> have<00:04:06.130> a<00:04:06.160> higher<00:04:06.340> dps<00:04:06.730> ratio<00:04:07.269> so<00:04:07.900> it's

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
to have a higher dps ratio so it's

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.520 
to have a higher dps ratio so it's
better<00:04:08.230> off<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.470> you<00:04:09.430> just<00:04:09.609> stick<00:04:09.880> with<00:04:10.120> that

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
better off that you just stick with that

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.140 
better off that you just stick with that

arrow mass which I

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.530 
arrow mass which I
even<00:04:22.270> know<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.390> had<00:04:22.480> on<00:04:22.900> me<00:04:24.450> actually<00:04:25.450> you<00:04:25.510> know

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540

what<00:04:25.630> we'll<00:04:25.900> go<00:04:25.990> ahead<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:26.230> try<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.920> do<00:04:27.520> a

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
what we'll go ahead and try to do a

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.300 
what we'll go ahead and try to do a
little<00:04:27.670> test<00:04:28.060> with<00:04:28.390> plantera<00:04:28.960> with<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:30.100> razor

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
little test with plantera with the razor

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.980 
little test with plantera with the razor
blade<00:04:30.640> typhoon<00:04:31.090> I<00:04:31.360> think<00:04:31.720> that'll<00:04:31.900> be<00:04:31.930> a

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
blade typhoon I think that'll be a

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.410 
blade typhoon I think that'll be a
pretty<00:04:32.230> good<00:04:32.440> bet<00:04:32.880> so<00:04:33.880> once<00:04:34.030> we<00:04:34.090> go<00:04:34.180> back<00:04:34.330> to

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
pretty good bet so once we go back to

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.790 
pretty good bet so once we go back to
the<00:04:34.510> jungle<00:04:34.870> I'll<00:04:34.990> show<00:04:35.140> you<00:04:35.230> guys<00:04:35.380> how<00:04:35.440> that

the jungle I'll show you guys how that

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.040 
the jungle I'll show you guys how that
works<00:04:36.040> it's<00:04:36.310> really<00:04:36.790> kind<00:04:37.120> of<00:04:37.180> cool<00:04:37.390> against

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050
