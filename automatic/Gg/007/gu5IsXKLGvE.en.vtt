some<00:00:04.940> incredibly<00:00:05.940> fast<00:00:06.270> picking<00:00:06.600> licks<00:00:07.049> and

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
some incredibly fast picking licks and

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.549 
some incredibly fast picking licks and
this<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.649> one<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:07.830> my<00:00:07.980> favorites<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:09.320> has<00:00:10.320> sort

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
this is one of my favorites it has sort

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.000 
this is one of my favorites it has sort
of<00:00:10.620> an<00:00:10.769> ambiguous<00:00:13.070> timing<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.400> it

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
of an ambiguous timing to it it

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.290 
of an ambiguous timing to it it
basically<00:00:17.010> just<00:00:17.430> came<00:00:17.640> out<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.910> some<00:00:18.060> pull

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
basically just came out of some pull

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.910 
basically just came out of some pull
offs<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.720> was<00:00:18.900> doing<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.619> tried<00:00:19.830> to

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
offs that I was doing and I tried to

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.859 
offs that I was doing and I tried to
pick<00:00:20.130> them<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.640> they<00:00:20.760> seemed<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.449> work<00:00:21.630> great

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
pick them and they seemed to work great

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.620 
pick them and they seemed to work great
but<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.500> find<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:22.740> works<00:00:22.949> best<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:24.240> company

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
but I find this works best on a company

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.689 
but I find this works best on a company
unless<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> lot<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.350> songs<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.890> 9/8<00:00:26.430> or

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
unless you do a lot of songs in 9/8 or

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.990 
unless you do a lot of songs in 9/8 or
sometimes<00:00:27.180> signature<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.949> you<00:00:28.949> know<00:00:29.070> few

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
sometimes signature that you know few

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.569 
sometimes signature that you know few
would<00:00:30.150> dare<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.660> play<00:00:31.040> but<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.309> basically

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
would dare to play but this is basically

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.120 
would dare to play but this is basically
how<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.790> goes<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.899> all<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.290> two<00:00:34.530> strings<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
how it goes it's all on two strings the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.090 
how it goes it's all on two strings the
B<00:00:35.280> string<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.300> E<00:00:36.329> string<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.770> G

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
B string and the E string and it's on G

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.760 
B string and the E string and it's on G
minor<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:39.020> I'm<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.140> gonna<00:00:40.260> play<00:00:40.500> through<00:00:40.530> it

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
minor and I'm just gonna play through it

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:49.819 
minor and I'm just gonna play through it
real<00:00:41.040> real<00:00:41.280> slow<00:00:47.809> that's<00:00:48.809> basically<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
real real slow that's basically the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.110 
real real slow that's basically the
first<00:00:49.860> pattern<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:54.920> from<00:00:55.920> there<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:57.059> just

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
first pattern of it from there it just

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.700 
first pattern of it from there it just
does<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> same<00:00:57.570> kind<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.020> pattern<00:00:58.230> but

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
does the same kind of pattern but

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:16.480 
does the same kind of pattern but
starting<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.460> new<00:01:00.090> note<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.960> there<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.680> go

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:35.380 

and<00:01:16.810> then<00:01:17.810> I<00:01:17.840> ascend<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:18.560> same<00:01:18.740> thing<00:01:34.390> and

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
and then I ascend the same thing and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.179 
and then I ascend the same thing and
you're<00:01:35.509> back<00:01:35.689> at<00:01:35.810> your<00:01:35.840> original<00:01:36.289> note<00:01:36.469> so<00:01:37.069> let

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
you're back at your original note so let

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:38.109 
you're back at your original note so let
me<00:01:37.280> play<00:01:37.429> through<00:01:37.549> the<00:01:37.670> whole<00:01:37.759> thing<00:01:37.880> without

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
me play through the whole thing without

00:01:38.119 --> 00:02:06.270 
me play through the whole thing without
stopping<00:01:38.630> so<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:38.840> can<00:01:38.959> have<00:01:39.200> sounds<00:01:39.469> together

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.750 

something<00:02:07.280> like<00:02:07.370> that

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
something like that

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.969 
something like that
now<00:02:08.149> before<00:02:08.450> we<00:02:08.479> even<00:02:08.630> attempt<00:02:09.140> doing<00:02:09.770> this

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
now before we even attempt doing this

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.320 
now before we even attempt doing this
quick<00:02:10.250> it's<00:02:10.460> really<00:02:10.490> important<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.030> sort<00:02:11.240> of

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
quick it's really important to sort of

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.060 
quick it's really important to sort of
take<00:02:11.450> one<00:02:11.690> section<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:12.320> get<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.560> down<00:02:12.770> so<00:02:12.800> you

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
take one section and get it down so you

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.810 
take one section and get it down so you
probably<00:02:13.270> start<00:02:14.270> at<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.420> top<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:14.630> just<00:02:14.900> go

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:27.460 

you<00:02:19.820> did<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.060> much<00:02:20.300> of<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:26.110> well<00:02:27.110> alternate

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
you did that much of it well alternate

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.310 
you did that much of it well alternate
picking<00:02:27.740> studying<00:02:28.160> with<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.340> downstroke<00:02:28.880> and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
picking studying with the downstroke and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.450 
picking studying with the downstroke and
the<00:02:30.320> thing<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.620> really<00:02:30.800> keeps<00:02:31.070> me<00:02:31.310> on<00:02:31.430> the

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
the thing that really keeps me on the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.030 
the thing that really keeps me on the
ball<00:02:31.730> doing<00:02:32.330> this<00:02:32.570> is<00:02:32.950> concentrating<00:02:33.950> on

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
ball doing this is concentrating on

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.180 
ball doing this is concentrating on
where<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.400> left<00:02:34.610> hand<00:02:35.470> shifts<00:02:36.470> positions<00:02:36.950> and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
where the left hand shifts positions and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.830 
where the left hand shifts positions and
for<00:02:37.640> some<00:02:37.820> reason<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.240> always<00:02:38.360> ends<00:02:38.660> up<00:02:38.780> being

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
for some reason it always ends up being

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.470 
for some reason it always ends up being
a<00:02:39.080> Down<00:02:39.290> stroke<00:02:39.590> there<00:02:39.830> so<00:02:40.070> if<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.340> sync<00:02:40.670> up<00:02:40.880> my

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
a Down stroke there so if I sync up my

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.350 
a Down stroke there so if I sync up my
left<00:02:41.690> hand<00:02:41.930> shifts<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.820> my<00:02:43.820> down<00:02:44.000> stroke

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
left hand shifts and my down stroke

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.300 
left hand shifts and my down stroke
seems<00:02:44.660> to<00:02:44.750> help<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.959> lot<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.740> concentrated<00:02:45.980> on

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
seems to help a lot so I concentrated on

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.150 
seems to help a lot so I concentrated on
going<00:02:48.190> down<00:02:50.260> daaamn<00:02:51.260> because<00:02:51.830> those<00:02:52.010> are<00:02:52.130> the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
going down daaamn because those are the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.010 
going down daaamn because those are the
two<00:02:52.340> shifts<00:02:53.350> down<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:56.360> found<00:02:56.600> that<00:02:56.750> that

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
two shifts down and I found that that

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.449 
two shifts down and I found that that
really<00:02:57.380> keeps<00:02:57.560> me<00:02:57.709> in<00:02:57.800> sync<00:02:58.130> with<00:02:58.250> my<00:02:58.400> two

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
really keeps me in sync with my two

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.090 
really keeps me in sync with my two
hands<00:02:58.910> so<00:02:59.320> we<00:03:00.320> play<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.590> whole<00:03:00.709> thing<00:03:00.739> pretty

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
hands so we play the whole thing pretty

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.080 
hands so we play the whole thing pretty
quick<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.750> see<00:03:02.750> if<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.900> works
