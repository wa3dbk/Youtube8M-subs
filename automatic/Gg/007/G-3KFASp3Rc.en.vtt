00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
possibly I don't know what it is it's

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.380 
possibly I don't know what it is it's
definitely<00:01:08.130> not<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.460> clad<00:01:08.700> quarter<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> rain

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:19.249 
definitely not a clad quarter the rain
way<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.780> rang<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.549> let's<00:01:11.549> find<00:01:11.850> out<00:01:11.970> together

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:27.360 

it's<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.829> celebration<00:01:20.219> station<00:01:21.119> token

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.470 

I<00:01:27.490> found<00:01:28.150> one<00:01:28.330> of<00:01:28.360> these<00:01:28.510> before<00:01:28.750> I<00:01:30.240> was<00:01:31.240> hoping

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
I found one of these before I was hoping

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.640 
I found one of these before I was hoping
it<00:01:31.600> was<00:01:31.690> gonna<00:01:31.780> be<00:01:31.960> older<00:01:32.170> but<00:01:32.290> I<00:01:32.350> think<00:01:32.560> this

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
it was gonna be older but I think this

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.850 
it was gonna be older but I think this
is<00:01:32.860> kind<00:01:33.760> of<00:01:33.790> like<00:01:34.200> 80s<00:01:35.200> something<00:01:35.740> like

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
is kind of like 80s something like

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.940 
is kind of like 80s something like
around<00:01:35.980> in<00:01:36.280> there<00:01:36.460> so<00:01:36.820> not<00:01:37.030> too<00:01:37.270> old<00:01:37.480> but<00:01:37.950> you'd

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
around in there so not too old but you'd

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.250 
around in there so not too old but you'd
find<00:01:39.190> anyway<00:01:39.550> I<00:01:39.760> think<00:01:40.450> he<00:01:40.570> got<00:01:40.720> clipped<00:01:40.990> by

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
find anyway I think he got clipped by

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.400 
find anyway I think he got clipped by
the<00:01:41.290> mower<00:01:41.530> or<00:01:41.740> something<00:01:43.140> okay<00:01:44.140> I<00:01:44.170> got<00:01:44.380> a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
solid really hard-hitting 12:35 signal

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.080 
solid really hard-hitting 12:35 signal
that<00:01:47.950> I<00:01:47.980> thought<00:01:48.190> was<00:01:48.340> gonna<00:01:48.430> be<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.640> zinc<00:01:48.910> penny

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.000 
that I thought was gonna be a zinc penny
until<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.390> got<00:01:49.480> about<00:01:49.660> three<00:01:49.930> inches<00:01:50.140> down<00:01:50.410> in

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.180 
his thick dirt and I wasn't there yet
these<00:01:52.600> things<00:01:52.810> just<00:01:53.020> don't<00:01:53.470> sink<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:53.950> deep

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
these things just don't sink that deep

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.490 
these things just don't sink that deep
around<00:01:54.340> here<00:01:54.700> in<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:54.880> thick<00:01:55.090> soil<00:01:55.330> I<00:01:55.630> pulled

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500

around here in the thick soil I pulled
this<00:01:56.590> out<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:56.950> it's<00:01:57.100> pretty<00:01:57.370> exciting<00:01:57.730> I

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.140 
hidden by a lawn mower there so there's
that<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:22.890> uh<00:04:23.010> probably<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.580> best<00:04:23.790> find<00:04:24.060> of

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
that and uh probably the best find of

that and uh probably the best find of
the<00:04:24.240> day<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:25.160> assume<00:04:26.160> because<00:04:26.340> of<00:04:26.550> that

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
the day I assume because of that

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.110 
the day I assume because of that

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:44.939 
know I wasn't expecting it because they

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:47.389 
know I wasn't expecting it because they
made<00:07:45.149> very<00:07:45.389> few<00:07:45.809> the<00:07:46.709> silver<00:07:47.129> Eisenhower

dollars<00:07:48.119> for<00:07:48.359> the<00:07:48.449> sets<00:07:48.689> so<00:07:49.529> these<00:07:50.279> are<00:07:50.399> all

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:50.519 
dollars for the sets so these are all

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:52.279 
dollars for the sets so these are all
pretty<00:07:50.729> much<00:07:50.879> circulation<00:07:51.509> strikes<00:07:51.899> but<00:07:52.139> um

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:52.289 
pretty much circulation strikes but um

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:54.229 
pretty much circulation strikes but um
I'll<00:07:52.559> go<00:07:52.679> through<00:07:52.919> and<00:07:53.069> check<00:07:53.579> them<00:07:53.789> to<00:07:53.819> see<00:07:54.179> if

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:54.239 
I'll go through and check them to see if

00:07:54.239 --> 00:07:56.599 
I'll go through and check them to see if
there's<00:07:54.419> anything<00:07:55.049> interesting<00:07:55.439> or<00:07:55.979> anything

00:07:56.599 --> 00:07:56.609 
there's anything interesting or anything

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:59.899 
there's anything interesting or anything
worth<00:07:56.959> substantially<00:07:57.959> more<00:07:58.139> than<00:07:58.819> you<00:07:59.819> know

00:07:59.899 --> 00:07:59.909 
worth substantially more than you know

00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:02.779 
worth substantially more than you know
the<00:08:00.059> the<00:08:00.449> face<00:08:00.659> value<00:08:00.929> but<00:08:01.769> I<00:08:01.799> don't<00:08:02.219> think<00:08:02.369> so

00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:02.789 
the the face value but I don't think so

00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:03.889 
the the face value but I don't think so
but<00:08:02.939> I<00:08:02.969> figured<00:08:03.239> that'd<00:08:03.359> be<00:08:03.389> cool<00:08:03.629> to<00:08:03.749> show

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:03.899 
but I figured that'd be cool to show

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:05.419 
but I figured that'd be cool to show
because<00:08:04.199> you<00:08:04.319> don't<00:08:04.469> get<00:08:04.919> to<00:08:05.039> go<00:08:05.159> through<00:08:05.399> a
