00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
by demonstrating how easy it is to put

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.150 
by demonstrating how easy it is to put
on<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.819> fins<00:03:16.060> with<00:03:16.419> ultra<00:03:16.690> fins<00:03:16.930> new<00:03:17.290> turnkey

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
on the fins with ultra fins new turnkey

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.280 
on the fins with ultra fins new turnkey
system<00:03:18.609> so<00:03:18.910> Sarah<00:03:19.419> go<00:03:19.629> ahead<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:19.959> give<00:03:20.079> us<00:03:20.109> a

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
system so Sarah go ahead and give us a

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.930 
system so Sarah go ahead and give us a
demo<00:03:22.829> basically<00:03:23.829> you<00:03:23.980> just<00:03:24.160> line<00:03:24.370> up<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.579> fins

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
demo basically you just line up the fins

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.809 
demo basically you just line up the fins
and<00:03:25.780> goes<00:03:26.139> the<00:03:26.379> key<00:03:26.590> give<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.220> quarter<00:03:27.489> turn

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
and goes the key give it a quarter turn

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.479 
and goes the key give it a quarter turn
and<00:03:27.879> that<00:03:28.180> locks<00:03:28.569> it<00:03:28.840> in<00:03:28.930> place<00:03:28.959> now<00:03:29.500> wasn't

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
and that locks it in place now wasn't

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.319 
and that locks it in place now wasn't
that<00:03:30.609> easy<00:03:30.699> it's<00:03:31.359> just<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.780> easy<00:03:31.930> dad<00:03:33.329> pretty

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
that easy it's just that easy dad pretty

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.410 
that easy it's just that easy dad pretty
simple

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.510 

the<00:03:39.420> other<00:03:39.540> way<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.780> do<00:03:39.990> this<00:03:40.020> is<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:41.070> run<00:03:41.340> your

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
the other way to do this is to run your

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.150 
the other way to do this is to run your
tubing<00:03:41.880> parallel<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.900> joists<00:03:43.170> if<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:44.010> do

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
tubing parallel to the joists if you do

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.070 
tubing parallel to the joists if you do
that<00:03:44.370> then<00:03:44.820> you're<00:03:45.000> going<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.240> suspend<00:03:45.900> it

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
that then you're going to suspend it

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.720 
that then you're going to suspend it
from<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.320> floor<00:03:46.560> sheeting<00:03:47.070> using<00:03:47.460> snake

ultra<00:04:42.090> fence<00:04:42.300> system<00:04:42.570> is<00:04:42.930> its<00:04:43.230> flexibility<00:04:44.010> in

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
ultra fence system is its flexibility in

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.030 
ultra fence system is its flexibility in
working<00:04:44.490> with<00:04:44.730> different<00:04:45.150> boilers<00:04:45.780> if<00:04:46.770> you're

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
working with different boilers if you're

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.190 
working with different boilers if you're
using<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.490> high<00:04:47.669> temperature<00:04:48.090> boiler<00:04:48.720> your

using a high temperature boiler your

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.930 
using a high temperature boiler your
layout<00:04:49.530> will<00:04:49.740> need<00:04:49.919> the<00:04:50.100> least<00:04:50.370> amount<00:04:50.760> of

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940
