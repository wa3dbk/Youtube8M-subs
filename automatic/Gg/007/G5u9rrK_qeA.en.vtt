a<00:00:22.380> realization<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.640> came<00:00:23.880> across<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:26.960> when<00:00:27.960> we

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
a realization I came across and when we

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.209 
a realization I came across and when we
talk<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.710> world<00:00:28.949> being<00:00:29.220> our<00:00:29.460> reflection<00:00:30.090> I

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
talk of the world being our reflection I

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.770 
talk of the world being our reflection I
just<00:00:32.219> see<00:00:32.369> how<00:00:32.550> everything<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.239> playing<00:00:33.570> out

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
just see how everything is playing out

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.220 
just see how everything is playing out
within<00:00:34.770> my<00:00:35.040> own<00:00:35.190> journey<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.850> other<00:00:36.840> people

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
within my own journey and other people

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.160 
within my own journey and other people
I'm<00:00:37.350> connecting<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.210> in<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.390> wider<00:00:39.600> world<00:00:40.820> how

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
I'm connecting to in the wider world how

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.520 
I'm connecting to in the wider world how
really<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.320> truly<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:45.020> ultimately<00:00:46.020> exist

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
really and truly we ultimately exist

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.709 
really and truly we ultimately exist
within<00:00:46.770> our<00:00:46.980> minds<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.320> a<00:00:49.320> lot<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.649> us<00:00:49.829> we

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
within our minds and a lot of us we

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.069 
within our minds and a lot of us we
externalize<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.079> much<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.559> life<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:54.079> whenever

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
externalize so much in life and whenever

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.770 
externalize so much in life and whenever
we<00:00:55.379> external<00:00:56.010> eyes<00:00:56.160> something<00:00:56.660> we<00:00:57.660> actually

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
we external eyes something we actually

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.380 
we external eyes something we actually
give<00:00:58.199> away<00:00:58.410> our<00:00:58.440> power<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.969> just<00:01:00.210> realized

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
give away our power and I just realized

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.670 
give away our power and I just realized
that<00:01:02.210> there<00:01:03.210> was<00:01:03.359> nothing<00:01:03.570> external<00:01:04.320> out

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
that there was nothing external out

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.859 
that there was nothing external out
there<00:01:04.979> everything<00:01:05.549> was<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.180> here<00:01:06.420> happening

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
there everything was in here happening

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.520 
there everything was in here happening
right<00:01:07.049> now<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:08.180> essentially<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.170> made

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
right now and essentially it just made

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.780 
right now and essentially it just made
me<00:01:10.680> look<00:01:10.830> at<00:01:10.979> people<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.460> different<00:01:11.549> way

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
me look at people in a different way

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.359 
me look at people in a different way
because<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.360> many<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.780> us<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.770> someone<00:01:14.040> and

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
because so many of us we see someone and

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.490 
because so many of us we see someone and
we<00:01:15.270> don't<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.689> them<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.890> realized<00:01:18.500> what's

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
we don't like them and I realized what's

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.800 
we don't like them and I realized what's
happening<00:01:20.009> here<00:01:20.220> because<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.150> remember<00:01:21.689> as<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
happening here because I remember as a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.109 
happening here because I remember as a
child<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:23.250> lot<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.520> people<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.850> talked<00:01:24.090> to

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
child and a lot of people I talked to

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.249 
child and a lot of people I talked to
they<00:01:24.299> can<00:01:24.570> remember<00:01:24.810> when<00:01:25.110> they<00:01:25.229> were

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
they can remember when they were

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.140 
they can remember when they were
children

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
children

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.210 
children
they<00:01:27.150> were<00:01:27.210> living<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.110> very<00:01:28.259> neutral<00:01:28.619> state

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
they were living in a very neutral state

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.590 
they were living in a very neutral state
and<00:01:32.000> non<00:01:33.000> judgment<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.810> really<00:01:35.090> freedom<00:01:36.090> in

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and non judgment is really freedom in

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.410 
and non judgment is really freedom in
his<00:01:37.290> true<00:01:37.560> essence<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.909> what<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.210> have

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
his true essence and that's what we have

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.840 
his true essence and that's what we have
as<00:01:39.570> children<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:40.290> child<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.189> born<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.640> no

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
as children a child is born with no

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.760 
as children a child is born with no
state<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.180> mind<00:01:45.079> they<00:01:46.079> don't<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
state of mind they don't have the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.859 
state of mind they don't have the
judgments<00:01:48.530> we<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.829> as<00:01:50.159> adults<00:01:50.549> as<00:01:51.090> damaged

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
judgments we have as adults as damaged

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.390 
judgments we have as adults as damaged
goods<00:01:52.369> many<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.549> us<00:01:53.759> who<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.119> all<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.720> these

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.460 

ideas<00:01:59.400> about<00:01:59.730> people<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:01.080> is<00:02:01.230> a<00:02:01.260> good

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
ideas about people and this is a good

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.410 
ideas about people and this is a good
person<00:02:01.710> that's<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.130> bad<00:02:02.310> personal<00:02:02.880> all<00:02:03.210> of

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
person that's a bad personal all of

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.640 
person that's a bad personal all of
these<00:02:03.600> things<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:05.210> when<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.240> really<00:02:07.200> began<00:02:07.470> to

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
these things and when I really began to

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.440 
these things and when I really began to
see<00:02:07.830> that<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.130> world<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.580> our<00:02:08.729> reflection<00:02:09.390> I

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
see that the world is our reflection I

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.800 
see that the world is our reflection I
realized<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.760> lot<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.790> times<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.510> example

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
realized that a lot of times for example

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.480 
realized that a lot of times for example
we<00:02:15.810> can<00:02:16.050> see<00:02:16.650> someone<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:19.130> we<00:02:20.130> don't<00:02:20.310> like

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
we can see someone and we don't like

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.390 
we can see someone and we don't like
this<00:02:20.670> person<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:22.430> we<00:02:23.430> don't<00:02:23.459> want<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.850> show

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
this person and we don't want to show

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.980 
this person and we don't want to show
these<00:02:26.400> purse<00:02:26.730> these<00:02:27.270> people<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.780> we<00:02:27.870> don't

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
these purse these people that we don't

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.310 
these purse these people that we don't
like<00:02:28.230> them<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.250> our<00:02:29.340> minds<00:02:29.670> we're<00:02:30.320> screwing

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
like them so in our minds we're screwing

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.880 
like them so in our minds we're screwing
our<00:02:31.620> face<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.430> frowning<00:02:35.989> but<00:02:36.989> essentially

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
our face and frowning but essentially

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.050 
our face and frowning but essentially
what<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.550> hate<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.090> become

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.420 

just<00:02:44.720> like<00:02:44.900> what<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.140> love<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.709> also<00:02:46.040> become

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
just like what you love you also become

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.850 
just like what you love you also become
and<00:02:46.819> a<00:02:47.270> lot<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.480> us<00:02:47.750> what<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:47.959> realize<00:02:48.440> even<00:02:48.830> more

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
and a lot of us what I realize even more

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.130 
and a lot of us what I realize even more
is<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:50.440> lot<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.680> times<00:02:52.569> when<00:02:53.569> we<00:02:53.630> see<00:02:54.110> a

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
is that a lot of the times when we see a

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.780 
is that a lot of the times when we see a
person<00:02:54.470> that<00:02:54.650> we<00:02:54.890> don't<00:02:55.099> like<00:02:55.400> they're

see we are to a certain extent because

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:12.760 
see we are to a certain extent because
it's<00:05:05.159> the<00:05:05.430> perception<00:05:06.150> which<00:05:06.749> is<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.050> key<00:05:08.719> and

that's the whole saying that the

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.070 
that's the whole saying that the
greatest<00:05:17.309> discovery<00:05:17.819> comes<00:05:18.120> not<00:05:18.479> in<00:05:18.629> seeking
