statues and the price points because
that<00:00:17.310> usually<00:00:17.520> comes<00:00:18.029> with<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.660> scale<00:00:19.020> so

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
that usually comes with the scale so

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.290 
that usually comes with the scale so
over<00:00:20.070> on<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> left<00:00:20.279> there<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.580> have<00:00:20.820> Batman

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
features bases all that kind of stuff

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.910 
features bases all that kind of stuff
those<00:04:12.709> all<00:04:12.980> factored<00:04:13.400> into<00:04:13.520> the<00:04:13.670> price<00:04:13.700> points

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
those all factored into the price points

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.039

so<00:04:15.920> there's<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.430> quick<00:04:16.669> look<00:04:17.030> at<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.480> scale<00:04:17.840> of

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
so there's a quick look at the scale of

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.630 
so there's a quick look at the scale of
statues<00:04:18.500> so<00:04:18.950> you<00:04:19.010> guys<00:04:19.130> can<00:04:19.310> get<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.459> better
