00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.900 
is Diet Coke I know a lot of you are so
disappointed<00:00:33.079> yes<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.530> low-calorie<00:00:35.399> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
disappointed yes it is low-calorie and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.850 
disappointed yes it is low-calorie and
sugar<00:00:36.360> free<00:00:36.630> but<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.320> doesn't<00:00:37.770> mean

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
sugar free but that doesn't mean

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.040 
sugar free but that doesn't mean
anything<00:00:38.460> what<00:00:39.059> matters<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.420> actually<00:00:39.870> what's

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
anything what matters is actually what's

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.780 
anything what matters is actually what's
in<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> food<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.920> because<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.489> made<00:00:41.610> with

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
in the food so because it's made with

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.490 
in the food so because it's made with
artificial<00:00:42.149> sweeteners<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:43.050> think<00:00:43.320> it's

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
artificial sweeteners I think it's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.650 
artificial sweeteners I think it's
totally<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> wrong<00:00:44.280> way<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.550> go<00:00:44.820> not<00:00:45.420> only

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
totally the wrong way to go not only

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.510 
totally the wrong way to go not only
will<00:00:45.930> your<00:00:46.020> body<00:00:46.230> start<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.590> crave<00:00:46.860> more<00:00:47.160> sugar

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
will your body start to crave more sugar

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.520 
will your body start to crave more sugar
because<00:00:48.059> your<00:00:48.239> taste<00:00:48.480> buds<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:48.960> forever

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
because your taste buds will be forever

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.740 
because your taste buds will be forever
coated<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:51.030> also<00:00:51.239> because<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
coated in it but also because the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.720 
coated in it but also because the
chemicals<00:00:51.930> are<00:00:52.350> actually<00:00:52.739> very<00:00:52.829> toxic<00:00:53.129> for

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
chemicals are actually very toxic for

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.119 
chemicals are actually very toxic for
your<00:00:53.879> brain<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.329> not<00:00:54.750> good<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.350> instead<00:00:56.070> of

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
your brain and not good so instead of

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.099 
your brain and not good so instead of
doing<00:00:56.340> diet<00:00:56.640> coke<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.120> recommend<00:00:57.660> doing<00:00:57.809> some

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
doing diet coke I recommend doing some

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.779 
doing diet coke I recommend doing some
kombucha<00:00:58.500> doing<00:00:59.039> some<00:00:59.280> sparkling<00:00:59.730> water

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
kombucha doing some sparkling water

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.000 
kombucha doing some sparkling water
maybe<00:01:00.449> even<00:01:00.750> with<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> little<00:01:01.260> bit<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.440> juice<00:01:01.710> in

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
maybe even with a little bit of juice in

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.250 
maybe even with a little bit of juice in
between<00:01:02.539> something<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.660> still<00:01:03.989> has<00:01:04.110> that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
between something that still has that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.530 
between something that still has that
same<00:01:04.559> fizz<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.610> little<00:01:05.909> bit<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.090> an<00:01:06.180> energy

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
same fizz and a little bit of an energy

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.990 
same fizz and a little bit of an energy
boost<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:07.110> without<00:01:07.409> all<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.920> scary<00:01:08.460> stuff<00:01:08.549> in

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
boost but without all the scary stuff in

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.140 
boost but without all the scary stuff in
there<00:01:09.180> number<00:01:10.140> two<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.740> agave<00:01:11.040> syrup<00:01:11.430> kind<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
there number two is agave syrup kind of

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.090 
there number two is agave syrup kind of
for<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.330> same<00:01:12.600> reason<00:01:12.710> anything<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.830> sounds

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
for the same reason anything that sounds

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.920 
for the same reason anything that sounds
too<00:01:14.220> good<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.400> be<00:01:14.490> true<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.909> usually<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.360> that's

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
too good to be true it usually is that's

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.560 
too good to be true it usually is that's
my<00:01:16.170> role<00:01:16.790> agave<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.939> something<00:01:18.210> that's<00:01:18.299> come

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
my role agave is something that's come

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.380 
my role agave is something that's come
into<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.140> press<00:01:19.380> more<00:01:19.650> recently<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:21.000> it's

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
into the press more recently and it's

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.240 
into the press more recently and it's
actually<00:01:21.780> something<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.200> now<00:01:22.680> they<00:01:22.950> found

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
actually something that now they found

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.700 
actually something that now they found
has<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.790> same<00:01:24.210> amount<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.630> fructose<00:01:24.930> if<00:01:25.409> not

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
has the same amount of fructose if not

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.310 
has the same amount of fructose if not
more<00:01:26.130> than<00:01:26.610> high<00:01:26.850> fructose<00:01:27.119> corn<00:01:27.390> syrup<00:01:27.689> so

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
more than high fructose corn syrup so

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.350 
more than high fructose corn syrup so
why<00:01:28.680> that's<00:01:28.920> important<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.820> because<00:01:30.119> it

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
why that's important is just because it

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.730 
why that's important is just because it
affects<00:01:30.630> your<00:01:30.810> blood<00:01:31.020> sugar<00:01:31.320> much

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
affects your blood sugar much

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.190 
affects your blood sugar much
differently<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.790> spike<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.240> up<00:01:33.420> drop<00:01:34.020> you

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
differently can spike you up drop you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.380 
differently can spike you up drop you
down<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.829> make<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.189> eat<00:01:35.340> more<00:01:35.579> food<00:01:35.820> overall

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
down and make to eat more food overall

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.690 
down and make to eat more food overall
so<00:01:36.869> instead<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.470> doing<00:01:37.710> agave<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.549> would

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
so instead of doing agave I would

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.179 
so instead of doing agave I would
recommend<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.720> absolutely<00:01:40.290> natural<00:01:40.680> normal

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
recommend the absolutely natural normal

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.649 
recommend the absolutely natural normal
sweeteners<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:42.090> been<00:01:42.210> around<00:01:42.360> forever

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
sweeteners that have been around forever

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.859 
sweeteners that have been around forever
that<00:01:43.320> would<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.619> organic<00:01:44.250> maple<00:01:44.490> syrup<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.600> raw

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
that would be organic maple syrup so raw

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.260 
that would be organic maple syrup so raw
honey<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.560> black<00:01:47.189> strap<00:01:47.430> molasses<00:01:47.909> all

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270

this before at a previous blog post but

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.780 
this before at a previous blog post but
it's<00:03:00.959> really<00:03:01.350> important<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:01.860> know<00:03:02.070> that<00:03:02.100> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
it's really important to know that the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.780 
it's really important to know that the
way<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.180> most<00:03:03.450> soy<00:03:04.080> is<00:03:04.489> produced<00:03:05.489> in<00:03:05.670> this

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
way that most soy is produced in this

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.520 
way that most soy is produced in this
country<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.390> very<00:03:06.810> different<00:03:07.080> than<00:03:07.260> how<00:03:07.500> it

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
country is very different than how it

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.470 
country is very different than how it
used<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:07.950> be<00:03:08.070> produced<00:03:08.430> very<00:03:08.940> different<00:03:09.360> than

used to be produced very different than

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.300 
used to be produced very different than
the<00:03:09.600> old<00:03:09.810> world<00:03:10.080> way<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:10.769> we<00:03:10.980> used<00:03:11.190> to

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
the old world way that we used to

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.210 
the old world way that we used to
consume<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.000> grow<00:03:12.239> soy<00:03:12.600> so<00:03:13.320> three<00:03:13.890> things

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
consume and grow soy so three things

consume and grow soy so three things
about<00:03:14.400> soy<00:03:14.820> that<00:03:15.180> are<00:03:15.330> kind<00:03:15.959> of<00:03:16.110> scary<00:03:16.760> number

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
about soy that are kind of scary number

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.449 
about soy that are kind of scary number
one<00:03:18.000> is<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:19.350> way<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.709> it's<00:03:19.890> processed

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
one is that the way that it's processed

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.670 
one is that the way that it's processed
it's<00:03:21.060> usually<00:03:21.510> genetically<00:03:22.019> modified<00:03:22.470> the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
it's usually genetically modified the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.140 
it's usually genetically modified the
way<00:03:22.799> we<00:03:22.980> grow<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.370> second<00:03:24.299> reason<00:03:24.480> soy<00:03:25.290> itself

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
way we grow it second reason soy itself

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.520 
way we grow it second reason soy itself
mimics<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.390> chemical<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:27.989> mimics<00:03:28.320> the

actually grow with intense layer of acid
around<00:03:44.640> them<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.840> have<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.260> do<00:03:46.380> something

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
around them so you have to do something

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.830 
around them so you have to do something
to<00:03:46.890> get<00:03:47.010> rid<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.519> acid<00:03:47.970> before<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.540> eat<00:03:48.810> it

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
to get rid of the acid before you eat it

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.930 
to get rid of the acid before you eat it
most<00:03:49.709> modern<00:03:50.100> day<00:03:50.370> forms<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.880> soy<00:03:51.060> do<00:03:51.239> not

most modern day forms of soy do not

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.060 
most modern day forms of soy do not
this<00:03:52.180> so<00:03:52.840> if<00:03:53.110> you<00:03:53.200> don't<00:03:53.470> get<00:03:53.620> rid<00:03:53.680> of<00:03:53.830> that

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
this so if you don't get rid of that

acid you end up ingesting it can cause a

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.010 
acid you end up ingesting it can cause a

and actually end up with something that
can<00:04:56.380> cause<00:04:56.560> a<00:04:56.590> little<00:04:56.980> bit<00:04:57.100> more<00:04:57.340> inflammation

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
can cause a little bit more inflammation

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.690 
can cause a little bit more inflammation
and<00:04:58.360> stress<00:04:58.660> on<00:04:58.900> your<00:04:59.020> system<00:04:59.440> so<00:05:00.160> instead<00:05:00.640> of
