00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
 Then, even if the sound response is dark, no separate payment can be made public 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.279
 That's right, keep your own state of heat 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:10.249
 I can not see it 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.889
 The map was always surrounded by steam vs. 1 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.949
 It turns out that 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.380
 However, it is the first state after such a state occurs 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.720
 As a matter of course, I can do that time 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.359
 Such 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.380
 In the indicator 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.060
 Because the energy of the collision is not released, the mark is 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.310
 It is not going to disappear 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.699
 By all means 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:33.519
 Of course 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:36.770
 The taste of sober is solidified and close 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.790
 Make sure you have enough steam 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.610
 Depending on the air year, the rest is 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.920
 Rain for example 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.830
 Compound of carbon 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.230
 Change to another city that is primarily responsible for carbon dioxide 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.340
 Will 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.950
 It is said that 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.800
 Eh, the Earth is a line of magma when it can be natural 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.300
 It is about to carry around if it is 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.910
 Eschen co-op 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.059
 I keep the temperature in the Seino region 19 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.440
 The song is now bondage 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.259
 By the time the Ema calms down, I think there is also a habit 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.259
 It's overpowering this time 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.360
 When it becomes less than 100 degrees 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.920
 But it's even less than $ 100 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.800
 Because there are 12 full carbon dioxide values 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.410
 Have an identity 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.300
 It's no different than it is now 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.950
 There was much more carbon dioxide 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.470
 At that time, one win is still like the continental crust 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.380
 Yes 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.469
 It was close to the last round when only the Eastern Rampaba was solidified. 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.369
 It seems that the country spreads to the top and it is in the reproduced city on it 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.520
 That's right 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.920
 English environment 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.710
 Correspondence still went around 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.549
 The great world is getting brighter now 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.050
 From now on, the sun is actually 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.030
 It's because it breaks the brightness 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.790
 But the atmosphere of the earth is 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.909
 If it was a city that became carbon dioxide in September 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.499
 Because the district goes up when the red color gets lighter 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:21.420
 For example, once it has cooled to about 50 degrees, 85 movements 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.420
 I'm confused I was as it was 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.460
 The performance is evaporated 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.769
 It replaced the 19th place that there was water vapor in the bait 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.659
 Participation in the purpose of life that moved to March by hand 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.210
 With that greenhouse effect 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.060
 Female gannies become harder 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.179
 If you silently return to the main hall in the plan 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:45.609
 Even if the sea was built, the water of the sea was evaporated 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.370
 To Naka- 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.319
 The fact is not steam 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.279
 It is from the hole sun It is strong ultraviolet rays from that time and the sun 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.359
 Is it disassembled in Lhasa city war? 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.159
 In hydrogen and oxygen 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.510
 The hydrogen escapes because it is light in space 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.959
 That is why water is lost 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.909
 In fact, it is hard to say that it happened 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:08.429
 is 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:11.369
 Debut 9 is by chance 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:15.579
 The environment has changed before s5 happened. 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.079
 It has changed 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.069
 If the sea day is qualified as a pre-decision person, that atom is near 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.689
 I divided it into two, and close the conference with the thing called the continental crust 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:29.999
 Divided into 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:33.430
 Let's put a face on top of the sky sea on the mainland crust theme 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:38.049
 Well then, for example, when the rain shakes 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.840
 The water evaporated from the sea is just recombine 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:44.779
 Though 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:49.159
 If it rains on the continent, it will erode the continent 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.299
 You're eroding and you're going to sink into the whole of the continental part. 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.809
 And as a result, the ingredients in the sea are added 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.229
 US continental crust 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:03.959
 In fact, the ingredients of the sea are added after being handed out before being born 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.219
 is not it 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:08.359
 Sea growth with the creation of the continental crust 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.029
 That's right 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:12.679
 It's weird 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:16.019
 It will be tempting to go with acidity 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.980
 Therefore, it dissolves in carbon dioxide etc. depending on the area 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.489
 Be able to 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.140
 For those who will be able to jump into the sea, the people go to that soil 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.169
 I'm going to go 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.939
 As I said earlier 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:32.090
 Even if the sun gets bright, the part is just getting rid of carbon dioxide 

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:33.310
 If there is no 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.250
 Separately 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.349
 The temperature does not rise 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:41.679
 If the f1 sea continental crust is made, it will be said earlier 

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:44.729
 At the very beginning of this series 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.099
 Hail As described in the paradox for Thailand 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:53.070
 The carbon dioxide circulation in the vicinity of Taira has become functional 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.150
 We explained weapon of bait, but it is big strategy though 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.089
 Even if the sun gets bright, in fact 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:04.099
 Reduce spring and carbon dioxide 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:05.949
 Ground surface temperature does not change 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:07.370
 In that 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.570
 You will be able to maintain an environment that has the sea for a long time 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.240
 When 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.190
 Well it is such a thing 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.610
 So of the earth 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.860
 Meanwhile, the history of the town 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.559
 From the living situation that Asaishi Hamanogi Tenjo 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:23.999
 Even if only one point was said to be a factor in sales decline, this is 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:26.249
 I was pretty crowded with carbon dioxide 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:29.249
 From that state the continental crust is born 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:34.340
 When it comes to the situation, it will be different from carbon dioxide tights and 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.699
 It seems like the ambassador, the same ambassador as Nitrogen 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.770
 The other main ingredients 12 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.509
 It will change in the best way 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.569
 So if the temperature can be raised, public expenses come from very good condition 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:48.330
 The 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.379
 Yeah 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:51.750
 3 That's it 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.150
 New atmospheric component t-can 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.250
 Participate in the width from the steam standby Completed in the same waters including carbon monoxide 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.680
 Instead of the first match of the season 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.680
 It doesn't change much to the original that took place this time 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:07.669
 In there 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:12.449
 Life is born when Evans life is born 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.509
 If you can do what you call the biological research department 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:17.999
 This is right 

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:22.559
 But that's the same as it is now. 

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:25.719
 Was made during the period of oxygen 

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:29.039
 It would be clear if two people during the show obviously increased 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.289
 It will be a situation that is almost the same as Morimae 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.809
 Before the time of feeding 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:37.879
 It is the figure of the equipment which hardly changes from the present 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:41.729
 Well when it went that very roughly 19 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:44.910
 For the group environment 2000 

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:47.339
 Well this is 

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:51.269
 Published history of bathing global environment 4.6 billion years 

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:55.039
 Let's talk about it 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.029
 Well in the second half 

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:00.029
 But a little bit 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:05.749
 Did it happen that you got it in a short time span? 

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:09.099
 We talk about that and it is actually 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:14.310
 The global environmental problems we need are complete 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.850
 As something closer is happening 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:17.390
 Connect
