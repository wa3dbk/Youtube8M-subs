00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.900
 Hi everyone every people would Moores by Zeche you Seek and I have for 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.009
 Bring the brand new album Art 5 Ticks Boxing to you today 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.910
 yes come from Berlin German manufacturer who knows Adam knows it 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.900
 thus the only ones still on the market which use a ribbon tweeter 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.990
 and you have them for your new x-series which comes in different sizes 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.749
 completely redeveloped 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.819
 and that he then has such a very interesting frequency response 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:33.500
 the boxes namely from 50 to days and write 50 kilos Herzer so 50 as 

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:35.700
 up to 50 kilos that's a lot 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.780
 So Roberto Spektrum you have plenty of heights are very very 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.840
 transparent 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.830
 but also the bass reproduction of the five-point 5-inch deep 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.760
 Midrange can be seen 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.900
 on the front who knew the old a5 will already recognize we have 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.900
 now two Basri Flex fulfillment as opposed to one before 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.290
 Controls are still on the front so the buyer and of course 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.710
 a switch the whole lights then a bit green what still wants 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.260
 then the second indicator would be for stereo mating that is 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.000
 namely a special feature that you only know of one 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.190
 namely that you can connect the boxes with each other 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.700
 via Porsche Carvalho and then 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.200
 Do you have the option with the one thing Stella both boxes at the same time 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.060
 to rules 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.820
 This prevents, among other things, that you can easily make out different 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.730
 level 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.710
 at the pits so that you always have the same level 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.010
 what else can you say about the a 5 x 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.370
 the trends Advance Forms knows who from the deep midrange to the x Ad hoc 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.510
 Finn is at 200 kilos heart 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.420
 this means 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.710
 Downstairs is nice steam and then it is already for the middle and the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.010
 and of course limited then on the streams tweeter here around him 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.049
 it also well protected 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.090
 because ribbon 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.469
 you have to be careful 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:51.880
 are a bit more sensitive 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.450
 but also in the heights rendering very much more transparent 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.840
 as the normal membrane 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.920
 otherwise from the power twice 50 watts once for the deep 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.220
 Midrange once King Saud tweeter 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.030
 that means also power reserves has the a 5 x 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.800
 Suffice Victor's only six and a half kilos can therefore also Primal 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.630
 with the blind already recovered yes wall mount SVO directions somewhere 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.219
 on tight if you want 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.599
 nevertheless with the low weight HAP but of course a few fine things 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.939
 namely made the sample surface bevelled forward so that I again 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.230
 just a very reflected us arms front have at the a5 x 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.969
 thus the positioning 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.439
 very easy 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.369
 and as I said double-pass monkey opening in contrast to the old a5 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:37.129
 which had only one front 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.529
 All in all, one can say a very compact box with percent very imposing 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:42.439
 Sound features 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.430
 and if you want to know how it sounds then just come by 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.029
 Look at such a lawyer attending boxing bringing your own music with you 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:52.959
 always the most sensible and of course you can as always with our service 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.290
 Package 33 days to take the PAC and 66 days to the exclusion of all home

 Take a look and see if the a 5 tips for you the right one 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.119
