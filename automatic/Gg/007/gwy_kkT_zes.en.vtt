00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:43.190
 without a shot than ever despite 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.500
 the obvious collage work 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.269
 content and misleading marketing

 dead island and manages to take advantage of one 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.900
 own personality due to the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.580
 persistence of developers in 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.080
 stay true to a non-combat system 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.869
 traditional for a title in first

 person a holiday paradise yes 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:00.739
 suddenly turns into hell 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.140
 when something turns residents into 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.280
 order the undead will naturally be at 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.170
 player and find an escape route 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.020
 while helping the rest 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.520
 survived the initial selection of the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.380
 character is not limited to the factor 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.869
 aesthetic but adds accompanied by 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.610
 bonuses and weaknesses removed these thin 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.320
 differences the four protagonists yes 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.310
 substantially involve the same 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.960
 way 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.340
 the paragraph system in fact constituted in 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.410
 good part from the melee attack 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.780
 basic combined with calcium able to 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.159
 remove the enemies considered 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.570
 the attitude of the game to throw 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.670
 against the player small groups of 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.440
 zombie what results is a fronts 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.830
 why slash that succeeds admirably at 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.360
 emerge thanks to the first person is 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.280
 the system of 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.050
 localized damage that allows 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.570
 thanks to the dynamic pointer to break 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.250
 the individual arts putting one out of order 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.750
 good idea that unfortunately does not find full 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.420
 satisfaction due to two factors 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.670
 disqualifying in primis light box yes 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.229
 secondarily reveal the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.580
 frenzy of non-group clashes 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.130
 allows you to take full advantage of the 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.780
 mechanics as variations to this 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.580
 clichÃ©s are noted for the possibility of 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.229
 throwing any weapon is the move 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.080
 special available to each of the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.610
 characters defined fury not without i

 his problems dead fight 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.299
 island is still fun 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.440
 despite the lack of options and 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.069
 also manages to reserve some 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.209
 pleasant surprise 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.099
 as far as firearms are concerned 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.439
 rarely present their use yes 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.609
 in fact it reveals a lot of fun 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.319
 some skills are also noteworthy 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:24.420
 passive and active unlockable via 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.969
 the accumulation of experience and currency points 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.230
 in three classic trees where they are 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.180
 developers have really indulged 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.030
 and in creating a system of 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.260
 very effective weapons modification 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.700
 user collection is an activity 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.530
 fundamental in dead island 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.879
 in addition to providing a continuous exchange of 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.230
 blunt or throwing objects 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.040
 necessary given their rapid 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.840
 deteriorate 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.639
 it makes it possible to accumulate 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.069
 money and above all pieces for the 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.629
 modification of completely useless weapons if 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.040
 taken individually the latter 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.230
 can be assembled at 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.659
 special work tables to create a 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.819
 large number of blunt objects 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.989
 modified in the most absurd ways 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.280
 in addition to changes the tables 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.959
 will also allow you to repair the 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.599
 objects and to increase the damage and the 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.400
 resist the dead game map 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.659
 island is ideally divided into two areas 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.340
 main 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.500
 the holiday resort and a neighbor 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.329
 village total extension not 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.129
 exceptional but the variety is not lacking 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.870
 thanks to the possibility of exploring 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.329
 also different locations inside and 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.040
 even in the underground the quests 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.329
 main and secondary will always come 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.609
 entrusted to the player by the various 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.530
 survivors are unfortunately noticeable 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.689
 repeatability of tasks to be completed 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.099
 the positive side is instead represented 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.169
 from absolute freedom is made by 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.849
 approach to the various situations which 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.340
 will often present more than one way to 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.870
 be completed to favor the 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.549
 the exploratory component takes care of the 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.340
 vehicles ranging from jeeps to 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.049
 more armored solutions edilfast revel e

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.009
 groups of survivors 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.090
 the cooperative for four players is 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:49.560
 undoubtedly one of the strengths 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.509
 of the clan production 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.799
 as there is not in the formula of 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.120
 game no real element that the 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.209
 encourage it turns out very much 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.169
 funny in any case dead island not 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.629
 is a title to be addressed 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.129
 necessarily the enemies not company 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.719
 they get stronger they increase by 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.790
 number and quests complete 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:06.840
 exactly the same way 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.489
 it is more than anything else one 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.410
 quick online component and not too much 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.520
 supported 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.680
 able to increase the fun 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.760
 without however having a strong impact on 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.760
 characteristics of the experience

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.180
 in front of an attractive design as well 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.130
 in its realism the chrome engine 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.080
 presents defects to the usual advantages 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.880
 the size of the map is fair 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.350
 polygonal density and good textures 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.630
 they are compensated with a framerate 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.090
 decidedly dancer and widespread pop 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.590
 up of the textures instead wants the job 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.630
 done on the animations of the body of the 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.220
 protagonist and sound in general 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.420
 pardoned of the outline music in the 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.740
 media and an engaging effect

 be your next purchase will be 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.190
 need to remove the memory of the 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.110
 trailer and accept the fact of being

 bloody and enthralling even in the
