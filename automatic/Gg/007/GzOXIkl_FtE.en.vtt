00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
and the next day I told my doctor I said

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.710 
and the next day I told my doctor I said
okay<00:01:48.009> i'm<00:01:48.100> done<00:01:48.130> with<00:01:48.429> brian<00:01:48.729> i'm<00:01:49.270> gonna<00:01:49.420> keep

okay i'm done with brian i'm gonna keep
her<00:01:49.929> and<00:01:50.140> I'm<00:01:50.320> gonna<00:01:50.409> bring<00:01:50.710> her<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:51.039> full<00:01:51.250> time

her and I'm gonna bring her to full time

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.940 
her and I'm gonna bring her to full time
so<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.810> think<00:01:53.200> that<00:01:53.439> was<00:01:53.530> one<00:01:53.679> of<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.799> hardest

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
so I think that was one of the hardest

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.279 
so I think that was one of the hardest
for<00:01:54.340> me<00:01:54.369> but<00:01:54.759> I<00:01:54.970> picked<00:01:55.450> myself<00:01:55.630> up<00:01:55.990> really

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
for me but I picked myself up really

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:02.249 
for me but I picked myself up really
quickly<00:01:58.319> I'm<00:01:59.319> not<00:01:59.500> so<00:01:59.679> young<00:01:59.920> anymore<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:01.259> that

it keeps me strong you know with kids

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.320 
it keeps me strong you know with kids
when<00:02:17.010> they<00:02:17.099> don't<00:02:17.190> eat<00:02:17.400> their<00:02:17.610> lunches<00:02:18.030> or

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
when they don't eat their lunches or

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.510 
when they don't eat their lunches or
their<00:02:18.480> dinners<00:02:18.780> we<00:02:19.020> see<00:02:19.260> well<00:02:19.830> then<00:02:20.220> just<00:02:20.400> let

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
their dinners we see well then just let

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.930 
their dinners we see well then just let
them<00:02:20.670> drink<00:02:20.819> milk<00:02:21.349> we<00:02:22.349> say<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.709> so<00:02:22.860> often<00:02:23.040> and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
them drink milk we say that so often and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.940 
them drink milk we say that so often and
I<00:02:24.090> think<00:02:24.360> as<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.780> mother<00:02:25.110> like<00:02:25.470> many<00:02:25.709> other

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
I think as a mother like many other

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.699 
I think as a mother like many other
mothers<00:02:26.220> out<00:02:26.400> there<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:27.270> neglect<00:02:27.690> our<00:02:28.020> own

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
mothers out there we neglect our own

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.460 
mothers out there we neglect our own
calcium<00:02:29.400> intake<00:02:29.760> but<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> fact<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.870> that

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
calcium intake but the fact is that

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.860 
calcium intake but the fact is that
calcium<00:02:32.160> intake<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.850> very<00:02:33.060> important<00:02:33.600> not

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
calcium intake is very important not

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.960 
calcium intake is very important not
just<00:02:34.530> because<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:35.040> my<00:02:35.160> age<00:02:35.190> but<00:02:35.610> also<00:02:35.760> because

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
just because of my age but also because

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.000 
just because of my age but also because

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580

know I think it's ironic that we're even
spend<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.000> lot<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.180> time<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.900> investing<00:02:49.680> on<00:02:49.860> our

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
spend a lot of time and investing on our

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.809 
spend a lot of time and investing on our
exterior<00:02:50.780> facials<00:02:51.780> our<00:02:52.459> hair<00:02:53.459> color<00:02:53.730> and

exterior facials our hair color and

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.240 
exterior facials our hair color and
manicures<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.720> all<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.350> sometimes<00:02:55.980> we

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
manicures and all that and sometimes we

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.550 
manicures and all that and sometimes we
forget<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:57.209> focus<00:02:57.660> on<00:02:57.780> what<00:02:57.930> on<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.170> inside

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
forget to focus on what on the inside

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.110 
forget to focus on what on the inside
I'm<00:02:59.160> talking<00:02:59.489> about<00:02:59.670> something<00:02:59.880> more

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
I'm talking about something more

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.970 
I'm talking about something more
structural<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.930> fundamental<00:03:01.530> like<00:03:01.830> our

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
structural and fundamental like our

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.910 
structural and fundamental like our
bones<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.569> want<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.660> age<00:03:03.810> gracefully<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.709> that<00:03:04.890> I

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
bones I want to age gracefully so that I

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.979 
bones I want to age gracefully so that I
can<00:03:05.069> keep<00:03:05.430> up<00:03:05.610> with<00:03:05.760> my<00:03:05.910> kids<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.420> terms<00:03:06.660> of

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
can keep up with my kids in terms of

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.100 
can keep up with my kids in terms of
their<00:03:07.230> energy<00:03:07.620> levels<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.660> just<00:03:09.810> takes<00:03:09.989> a

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
their energy levels so it just takes a

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.330 
their energy levels so it just takes a
bit<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.260> focus<00:03:10.500> and

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
bit of focus and

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:20.920 
bit of focus and
cichlid<00:03:11.790> but<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.180> definitely<00:03:12.450> can<00:03:12.900> be<00:03:12.930> done

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.989
