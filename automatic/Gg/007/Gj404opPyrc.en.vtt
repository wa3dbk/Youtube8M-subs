00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
okay that's the whole thing that chord

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.830 
okay that's the whole thing that chord
progression<00:04:41.590> just<00:04:42.190> keeps<00:04:42.610> repeating<00:04:43.030> over

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
and over and over for all the verses I

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.700 
and over and over for all the verses I
think<00:04:47.920> the<00:04:48.070> song<00:04:48.340> has<00:04:48.700> four<00:04:49.180> or<00:04:49.570> five<00:04:49.930> verses

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
think the song has four or five verses

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.980 
think the song has four or five verses
to<00:04:50.950> it<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:53.530> again<00:04:53.830> it<00:04:53.980> just<00:04:54.570> keeps<00:04:55.570> repeating

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
to it and again it just keeps repeating

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.830 
to it and again it just keeps repeating
