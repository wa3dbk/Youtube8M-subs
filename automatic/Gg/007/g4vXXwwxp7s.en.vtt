regular LED strip which I criss crossed

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:10.540 
regular LED strip which I criss crossed
across<00:01:04.129> here<00:01:04.840> and<00:01:05.840> here<00:01:06.610> all<00:01:07.610> in<00:01:07.940> parallel<00:01:09.550> and

and I am going to be putting an LED
strobe<00:01:21.550> right<00:01:22.550> here<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:23.300> that<00:01:23.480> will<00:01:23.600> make<00:01:23.810> it

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
strobe right here so that will make it

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.320 
strobe right here so that will make it
even<00:01:24.080> look<00:01:26.470> better

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330
