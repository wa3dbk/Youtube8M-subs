00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
back here I added a lightning rod on top

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.780 
back here I added a lightning rod on top
of<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.360> house<00:01:21.750> because<00:01:22.189> my<00:01:23.189> guys<00:01:23.369> struck<00:01:23.670> by

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
of this house because my guys struck by

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.200 
of this house because my guys struck by
lightning<00:01:24.149> one<00:01:24.299> time<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:26.280> had<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.790> exit<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
lightning one time and I had to exit the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.310 
lightning one time and I had to exit the
server<00:01:27.450> because<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> whole<00:01:27.899> house<00:01:28.049> weren't

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
server because the whole house weren't

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.490 
server because the whole house weren't
down<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:30.060> then<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.960> without<00:01:31.079> wall<00:01:31.380> without

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
down and then and without wall without

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.200 
down and then and without wall without
saving<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.340> what's<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:32.909> then<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.149> decided

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
saving so what's here so then I decided

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.789 
saving so what's here so then I decided
to<00:01:33.659> add<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.290> next<00:01:34.530> thing<00:01:34.649> you<00:01:34.710> know

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710

looking<00:03:46.060> thing<00:03:46.530> looks<00:03:47.530> could<00:03:48.220> almost<00:03:48.400> be<00:03:48.730> the

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
probably made out of probably made out

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.970 
probably made out of probably made out
of<00:05:27.610> like<00:05:28.350> maybe<00:05:31.470> iron<00:05:32.470> or<00:05:32.650> something<00:05:32.920> like

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
of like maybe iron or something like

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.620 
of like maybe iron or something like
that<00:05:33.220> they<00:05:33.430> would<00:05:33.490> there<00:05:33.640> be<00:05:33.670> iron<00:05:33.910> bars<00:05:34.240> which

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
that they would there be iron bars which

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.360 
that they would there be iron bars which
is<00:05:34.780> pretty<00:05:34.960> fun<00:05:35.230> fun<00:05:36.100> see<00:05:36.460> so<00:05:37.300> iron<00:05:37.510> bars<00:05:38.370> see

is pretty fun fun see so iron bars see
anyway<00:05:39.580> that's<00:05:39.760> my<00:05:39.910> idea<00:05:40.180> we<00:05:41.110> will<00:05:41.320> be

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
anyway that's my idea we will be

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.560 
anyway that's my idea we will be
building<00:05:41.830> out<00:05:41.950> this<00:05:42.160> way<00:05:42.340> and<00:05:42.610> there<00:05:43.330> will<00:05:43.450> be

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
building out this way and there will be

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.690 
building out this way and there will be
doing<00:05:43.870> more<00:05:44.140> houses<00:05:44.590> here<00:05:44.890> along<00:05:45.100> here<00:05:45.130> and
