00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.390
 one of the most interesting topics in the kitchen 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.749
 they of flavored oils 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.040
 and that of flavored vinegars 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.490
 then we can for this recipe 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.730
 a fruit vinegar 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.340
 now they can use also in the field there is no problem 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.380
 what are we going to allocate those and fresh herbs 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.530
 of this case by going to Rome 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.180
 I remove millions 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.260
 fresh 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.260
 after 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
 the most important thing when you work conserves 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.900
 the idea of ​​this study is to have one 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.350
 vinegar that serves well to finish a vinaigrette that in this case is no longer 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.900
 deteriorate the oil salt and pepper 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.170
 once it is reasonably prepared 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.659
 and that's why now for no reason fanny tur has seen almost nothing left over 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.549
 good era and is to reach eighty degrees one I do not see much and just 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.450
 for a long time until I'm not sure 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.480
 that the sentence and that the vinegar was over did 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.920
 at the same time to know exactly the same 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.860
 with oil 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.040
 in this case this oil we are going to make 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.830
 what the Peruvians public stain 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.920
 a puree 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.540
 but mine is not the same technique this supposed philanthropist does not 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.550
 we had 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.270
 very from side to side 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.260
 but basically the same technique only to that we're going to put a 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.110
 magnificent 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.340
 vegetable oils today a right lateral mess 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.570
 that these behaviors are said 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.400
 Cesar for most 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.860
 that recipe was not only a favor but because of a question p 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.199
 of health and employment 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.129
 despite the decline 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.989
 so this authorized preparations 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.599
 yes it will also serve you for navy 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.439
 the perfect north to do all types of homes 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.249
 has decided to put a little bit nothing 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:28.679
 why 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:33.269
 If you saw it below, if you have no problems, the solidarity network is very 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.699
 all right 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:36.719
 we can not miss it 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.639
 one can ask 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.399
 doubled it was diluting the project 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:42.819
 the Andalusian 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.919
 i finally tried to point license that you are your vinegar 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.629
 this is about five minutes 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.879
 I know she was ready 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.189
 because it starts with some aromas 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.739
 very interesting 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.149
 This does not happen 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:03.149
 Claudio was not strong is renewing 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.759
 and now until I wait for it to cool down by month 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:07.729
 Tokyo 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.709
 I'm going to try to put it into the equator because I'm sure it's going to 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.409
 do more 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:14.930
 on the other hand we have 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.609
 this benavente herbs 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.609
 let's put just one of them has bothered 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:26.329
 well in this way you can keep it 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.599
 but I could also leave 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.979
 something that has taken everything because it is likely 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:36.199
 that already with time 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.769
 lose sun 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.019
 his lawyers ask too loud 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.079
 the end and things get really good afterwards it's much harder 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.549
 to seal it with food 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.189
 let's see the pitch black sabbath 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.079
 background 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.899
 and the air that is much more than this 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:59.069
 he published afp very slowly with destiny 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.319
 of how mayonnaise is made 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.649
 but as a precaution 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:08.099
 highlighted to the blender October third sector failure is a bit useful 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:11.209
 two monthly payments 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.209
 we started to go slowly 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:29.669
 as it happens in the cinema this is not convenient because no no is not either 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:30.599
 necessary 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.370
 salty 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.689
 rather the food comes out 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.729
 in which they have used it for what urges the cgt and the cta 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:40.389
 do not create 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.090
 in short I'm sure that has a double challenge is that they will do 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.590
 supremely useful 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.740
 parallel to analyze the data and the 15 30
