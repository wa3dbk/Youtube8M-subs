00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello good today we bring you all the 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:12.130
 change of model phone display to 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.850
 92 20 is also known to this 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:21.039
 phone as n 8 thousand I think 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:23.740
 the imitation of samsung galaxy note 1 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.460
 the invitation, what do you think? 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.500
 of Chinese phone ratings 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.300
 we started by removing the screws from the 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.520
 back side 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.190
 on the phone 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.890
 it's not something it 's a bit 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.260
 how complicated it takes six screws 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.949
 big bears 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.949
 we remove 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.520
 well we have already removed all the 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.520
 screws 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.580
 come on, this is a bit of something 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.010
 Now with the leak I'll call you 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.610
 guitars of a guitar the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.110
 we introduce from the front a lot 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.440
 careful if you can start with the same 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.909
 area that I started better 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.740
 with the front of the digitizer 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.979
 I shook the boas that starts 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.979
 jump the box little by little 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.620
 out there careful 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.450
 to the connector out there 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.450
 well we open and we look 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.290
 we have already separated the back cover and 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.290
 what he has done 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.140
 after removing the phone's motherboard 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.560
 that does not have a complication are three 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.409
 points three screws 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.310
 what we are applying with the dryer 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.310
 In the back 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.360
 and from the front 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.360
 the auditor 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.970
 good has already opened part and by far 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.130
 careful we are separating and we have this 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.660
 result we separated the digitizer and 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.760
 the lcd screen two points 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.880
 now we separate what is the 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.190
 lcd screen digitizer lo 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.340
 same as before with a 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.710
 dryer we apply enough heat to 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:38.950
 that the rubber joints that they bring 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:42.970
 expand and be easier to separate and with 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.220
 the plectrum little by little we separate the 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.470
 which is digitized from lcd I say that 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.140
 it cost me a lot, you have to have 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.570
 enough patience and a lot much much 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.490
 careful not to leave any of the 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.620
 two parts neither lcd nor the digitizer 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.290
 why 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.049
 complicated let's go on heat basis and a lot 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.480
 patience what comes out here we see how 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.190
 I am already separating the digitizer from 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.180
 the screen 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.180
 and this result 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.840
 in this case what I 'm going to talk about 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:20.930
 digitized the lsd was fine so 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:24.210
 now we have here the screen with 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.900
 the rubber conducive to glued 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.940
 and there we have the new digitizer there 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.600
 we have it already complete already well stuck the 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.550
 digitizer with the lsd and you're done 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.550
 already normal assembly and current
