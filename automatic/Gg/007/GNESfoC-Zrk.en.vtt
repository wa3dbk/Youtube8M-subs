a very special tool review for you I

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.249 
a very special tool review for you I
have<00:00:09.080> here<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.469> Brannock<00:00:11.210> 7600<00:00:12.210> strut<00:00:12.750> spring

have here the Brannock 7600 strut spring

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.410 
have here the Brannock 7600 strut spring
compressor<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.849> awesome

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
compressor and it is awesome

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.590 
compressor and it is awesome
in<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:16.139> past<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.590> see<00:00:16.830> me<00:00:17.010> almost<00:00:17.400> die<00:00:18.029> when

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
in the past you see me almost die when

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.540 
in the past you see me almost die when
replacing<00:00:18.900> coil<00:00:19.470> springs<00:00:19.770> or<00:00:20.010> struts<00:00:20.369> on

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
replacing coil springs or struts on

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:29.210 
replacing coil springs or struts on
other<00:00:20.789> vehicles<00:00:26.240> no<00:00:27.240> more<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.769> my

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
other vehicles no more this is in my

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.669 
other vehicles no more this is in my
opinion<00:00:29.640> probably<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.689> safest<00:00:31.109> way<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.349> deal

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
opinion probably the safest way to deal

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.850 
opinion probably the safest way to deal
with<00:00:32.030> struts<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.180> springs<00:00:33.540> now<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.559> still

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
with struts and springs now you still

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.190 
with struts and springs now you still
have<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.219> respect<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.820> there's<00:00:36.390> still<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> lot

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
have to respect it there's still a lot

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.869 
have to respect it there's still a lot
of<00:00:37.440> potential<00:00:37.829> energy<00:00:38.280> there<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.489> could

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
of potential energy there that could

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.880 
of potential energy there that could
release<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.540> what<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.750> does<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.500> could<00:00:40.710> have

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
release and what it does it could have

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.100 
release and what it does it could have
catastrophic<00:00:41.250> effects<00:00:41.969> however<00:00:42.660> there's<00:00:43.050> a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
catastrophic effects however there's a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.810 
catastrophic effects however there's a
lot<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.379> safety<00:00:43.530> features<00:00:44.010> built<00:00:44.040> within<00:00:44.610> this

few<00:00:58.050> days<00:00:58.260> ago<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.739> mounted<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> wall

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
few days ago I mounted this to the wall

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.900 
few days ago I mounted this to the wall
I<00:01:00.719> had<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> heck<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.829> time<00:01:02.010> finding<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.489> stud<00:01:02.789> if

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
I had a heck of a time finding a stud if

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.050 
I had a heck of a time finding a stud if
I'm<00:01:03.090> honest<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:04.350> once<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.680> did<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.820> able<00:01:05.939> to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
I'm honest but once I did I was able to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.210 
I'm honest but once I did I was able to
securely<00:01:06.479> mount<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.080> up<00:01:07.260> here<00:01:07.439> now<00:01:07.650> in

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
securely mount it it's up here now in

securely mount it it's up here now in
fact<00:01:08.490> when<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> do<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.090> I'm<00:01:09.900> shaking

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
fact when I do this I'm shaking

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.020 
fact when I do this I'm shaking
basically<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> whole<00:01:11.070> shop<00:01:11.369> wall<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.880> it's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
basically the whole shop wall so it's

struts and things that you may be using

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.740 
struts and things that you may be using
in<00:01:18.960> them<00:01:19.080> now<00:01:19.710> previously<00:01:20.700> I've<00:01:21.030> worked<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.450> my

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
in them now previously I've worked on my

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.080 
in them now previously I've worked on my
acura<00:01:22.380> vigor<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.009> replaced<00:01:23.400> those<00:01:23.700> small

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
acura vigor and I replaced those small

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.999 
acura vigor and I replaced those small
coil<00:01:24.420> springs<00:01:24.750> from<00:01:24.869> Honda<00:01:25.320> which<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.890> be

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
coil springs from Honda which can be

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.440 
coil springs from Honda which can be
really<00:01:26.369> difficult<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.970> these<00:01:27.150> smaller

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
really difficult with these smaller

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
really difficult with these smaller
spring<00:01:28.259> compressors<00:01:28.799> such<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.250> these<00:01:30.470> these

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
spring compressors such as these these

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.990 
spring compressors such as these these
things<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:32.070> yes<00:01:32.490> they're<00:01:32.729> readily

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
things here yes they're readily

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.450 
things here yes they're readily
available<00:01:33.090> they're<00:01:33.600> cheap<00:01:33.920> can<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.070> use<00:01:35.280> them

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
available they're cheap can you use them

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.660 
available they're cheap can you use them
yes<00:01:35.939> but<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.930> my<00:01:37.200> opinion<00:01:37.320> they<00:01:38.100> can<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
yes but in my opinion they can be the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.490 
yes but in my opinion they can be the
kiss<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.880> death<00:01:44.450> I'm<00:01:45.450> no<00:01:45.689> longer<00:01:45.930> gonna<00:01:46.200> even

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
kiss of death I'm no longer gonna even

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.469 
kiss of death I'm no longer gonna even
look<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.950> these<00:01:47.100> things<00:01:47.399> they're<00:01:48.180> gone

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
look at these things they're gone

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.780 
look at these things they're gone
forever<00:01:48.720> I've<00:01:49.320> also<00:01:49.530> used<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.399> tool<00:01:50.579> like<00:01:50.729> this

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
forever I've also used a tool like this

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.389 
forever I've also used a tool like this
in<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> past<00:01:51.360> which<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.500> said<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.189> these

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
in the past which like I said it's these

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.679 
in the past which like I said it's these
aren't<00:01:53.610> even<00:01:53.790> worth<00:01:53.939> mentioning<00:01:54.149> because

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
aren't even worth mentioning because

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.969 
aren't even worth mentioning because
this<00:01:54.869> tool<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.229> far<00:01:55.439> superior

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
this tool is far superior

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.340 
this tool is far superior
why<00:01:56.460> don't<00:01:56.610> we<00:01:56.640> demonstrate<00:01:57.180> its<00:01:57.299> use<00:01:57.509> right

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
why don't we demonstrate its use right

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.160 
why don't we demonstrate its use right
now<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:59.479> these<00:02:00.479> old<00:02:00.750> struts<00:02:01.170> off<00:02:02.070> of

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
now with these old struts off of

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
now with these old struts off of
Chrysler<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.229> worked<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.590> while<00:02:04.770> back

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.150 

what's<00:02:16.190> nice<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:17.170> these<00:02:18.170> ends<00:02:18.620> here<00:02:18.830> fully

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
what's nice is these ends here fully

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.330 
what's nice is these ends here fully
adjustable<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:19.819> for<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.209> spring<00:02:20.480> like<00:02:20.630> this

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
adjustable so for a spring like this

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.790 
adjustable so for a spring like this
it's<00:02:22.340> kind<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.640> perfect

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
it's kind of perfect

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.290 
it's kind of perfect
now<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.860> can<00:02:25.040> dial<00:02:25.310> in<00:02:25.489> exactly<00:02:25.519> where<00:02:26.180> you

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
now you can dial in exactly where you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.479 
now you can dial in exactly where you
want<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.989> supports<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.069> can<00:02:31.310> compress<00:02:31.610> it

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
want the supports so you can compress it

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.330 
want the supports so you can compress it
and<00:02:34.690> do<00:02:35.690> your<00:02:35.810> best<00:02:36.019> before<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.590> even<00:02:36.860> start

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
and do your best before you even start

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.360 
and do your best before you even start
compressing<00:02:38.260> get<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:39.440> thing<00:02:39.680> into<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:40.010> good

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
compressing get this thing into a good

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.960 
compressing get this thing into a good
position<00:02:42.940> where<00:02:43.940> it's<00:02:45.310> in<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.489> compressor

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
position where it's in the compressor

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.180 
position where it's in the compressor
solidly<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.930> also<00:02:48.080> comes<00:02:48.500> with<00:02:49.720> this<00:02:50.720> clamp

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
solidly it also comes with this clamp

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.580 
solidly it also comes with this clamp
which<00:02:52.190> can<00:02:52.430> be<00:02:52.549> used<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.930> hold<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.230> spring<00:02:54.500> in

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
which can be used to hold the spring in

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.660 
which can be used to hold the spring in
place<00:02:54.620> like<00:02:55.130> so

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
place like so

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.670 
place like so
hold<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.599> strut<00:02:56.840> in<00:02:56.959> place<00:02:57.170> while<00:02:57.410> you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
hold the strut in place while you

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.880 
hold the strut in place while you
perhaps<00:02:58.160> put<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:58.640> nut<00:02:58.819> up<00:02:59.090> in<00:02:59.299> the<00:02:59.390> top<00:02:59.799> so<00:03:00.799> you

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
perhaps put the nut up in the top so you

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.990 
perhaps put the nut up in the top so you
don't<00:03:01.040> have<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.250> hold<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.579> there<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.849> whole

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
don't have to hold it there the whole

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.449 
don't have to hold it there the whole
time<00:03:02.030> or<00:03:02.989> so<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.680> when<00:03:03.799> you<00:03:03.890> remove<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.310> nut

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
time or so that when you remove the nut

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.699 
time or so that when you remove the nut
it<00:03:04.940> doesn't<00:03:05.239> come<00:03:05.360> crashing<00:03:05.870> down<00:03:05.900> depending

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
it doesn't come crashing down depending

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.710 
it doesn't come crashing down depending
upon<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:07.040> strut<00:03:07.280> you're<00:03:07.430> working<00:03:07.760> on<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:08.690> can

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
upon the strut you're working on you can

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.610 
upon the strut you're working on you can
position<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:10.160> arms<00:03:11.230> in<00:03:12.230> a<00:03:12.350> couple<00:03:12.590> of

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
position the arms in a couple of

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.330 
position the arms in a couple of
different<00:03:12.769> ways<00:03:13.100> I<00:03:14.500> sometimes<00:03:15.500> go<00:03:15.920> for<00:03:16.130> just

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
different ways I sometimes go for just

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.670 
different ways I sometimes go for just
this<00:03:16.519> top<00:03:16.760> piece<00:03:17.030> but<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.720> seems<00:03:17.989> like<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.440> would

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
this top piece but it seems like I would

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.670 
this top piece but it seems like I would
be<00:03:18.799> more<00:03:19.010> secure<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:20.290> going<00:03:21.290> down<00:03:21.920> below<00:03:22.130> here

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
be more secure and going down below here

this<00:04:06.820> offset<00:04:07.360> a<00:04:07.390> little<00:04:07.660> bit<00:04:07.810> so<00:04:08.020> I<00:04:08.110> could<00:04:08.170> get

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
this offset a little bit so I could get

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.320 
this offset a little bit so I could get
my<00:04:08.770> socket<00:04:09.490> down<00:04:09.760> in<00:04:09.910> here<00:04:10.030> a<00:04:10.120> little<00:04:10.210> bit

but if I were going to replace it I

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:48.520 
but if I were going to replace it I
would<00:04:39.420> just<00:04:39.740> feed<00:04:40.740> it<00:04:40.890> up<00:04:41.040> through<00:04:41.070> like<00:04:41.520> so

spring<00:05:30.270> compression<00:05:30.810> in<00:05:31.770> my<00:05:31.980> opinion<00:05:32.340> there's

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
spring compression in my opinion there's

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.340 
spring compression in my opinion there's
no<00:05:32.550> substitute<00:05:33.210> for<00:05:33.240> spring<00:05:33.780> compressor<00:05:34.200> like

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
no substitute for spring compressor like

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.740 
no substitute for spring compressor like
this<00:05:34.580> when<00:05:35.580> dealing<00:05:35.790> with<00:05:35.940> these<00:05:36.180> things<00:05:36.240> now

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
this when dealing with these things now

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.330 
this when dealing with these things now
I've<00:05:37.260> talked<00:05:37.500> about<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.860> ease<00:05:37.980> of<00:05:38.010> use<00:05:38.310> of

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
I've talked about the ease of use of

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.100 
I've talked about the ease of use of
using<00:05:38.790> this<00:05:38.910> style<00:05:39.150> of<00:05:39.330> spring<00:05:39.600> compressor

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
using this style of spring compressor

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.650 
using this style of spring compressor
but<00:05:40.620> I<00:05:40.650> really<00:05:40.950> like<00:05:41.130> this<00:05:41.310> one<00:05:41.540> part<00:05:42.540> of<00:05:42.570> the

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
but I really like this one part of the

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.780 
but I really like this one part of the
reason<00:05:42.900> is<00:05:43.020> it<00:05:43.260> feels<00:05:43.860> solid<00:05:44.130> it's<00:05:44.490> made<00:05:44.670> out

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
reason is it feels solid it's made out
