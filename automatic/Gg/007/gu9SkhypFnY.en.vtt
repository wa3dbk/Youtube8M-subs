this this shows right here you screw

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.980 
this this shows right here you screw
your<00:02:22.650> drywall<00:02:23.120> right<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.450> block

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
concrete is the air barrier okay so you

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.670 
concrete is the air barrier okay so you
put<00:02:32.280> your<00:02:32.580> drywall<00:02:33.450> on<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.050> if<00:02:34.350> you're<00:02:34.500> going
