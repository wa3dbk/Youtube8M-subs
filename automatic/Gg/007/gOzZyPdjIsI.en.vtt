00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.350 
of collectible card games in the market
including<00:00:53.140> magic<00:00:53.559> and<00:00:53.739> my<00:00:54.729> first<00:00:54.969> set<00:00:55.180> was

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
including magic and my first set was

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.709 
including magic and my first set was
Tempest<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.460> I<00:00:57.489> think<00:00:57.789> that's<00:00:58.059> maybe<00:00:58.239> about<00:00:58.510> 10

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
Tempest so I think that's maybe about 10

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.149 
Tempest so I think that's maybe about 10
or<00:00:58.839> 11<00:00:58.869> years<00:00:59.229> now<00:00:59.379> that<00:00:59.799> I've<00:00:59.890> been<00:00:59.949> doing
