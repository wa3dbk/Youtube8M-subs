00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.920 
use the update with the world name like
pro<00:00:18.990> tip<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.350> guess<00:00:20.359> but<00:00:21.359> basically<00:00:21.600> if<00:00:21.840> you

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
pro tip I guess but basically if you

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.570 
pro tip I guess but basically if you
want<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.109> it's<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:22.949> basically<00:00:23.100> really<00:00:23.430> good

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
want to it's it's basically really good

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.310 
want to it's it's basically really good
seed<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.060> use<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.570> give<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> really<00:00:25.140> good

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
seed to use to give you a really good

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.200 
seed to use to give you a really good
band<00:00:25.529> Sublime's<00:00:26.130> or<00:00:26.340> yeah<00:00:26.490> really<00:00:26.730> good<00:00:26.880> stunk

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
band Sublime's or yeah really good stunk

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.390 
band Sublime's or yeah really good stunk
seed<00:00:27.539> boyd<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.560> having<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.890> get<00:00:29.010> really<00:00:29.220> bad

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
seed boyd you having to get really bad

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.070 
seed boyd you having to get really bad
seed<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.820> being<00:00:29.939> like<00:00:30.090> uno<00:00:30.539> using<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.900> one

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
seed and being like uno using this one

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.540 
seed and being like uno using this one
I'm<00:00:31.140> gonna<00:00:31.260> stop<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> world<00:00:31.740> again<00:00:31.949> so

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
I'm gonna stop the world again so

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.459 
I'm gonna stop the world again so
basically<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.270> best<00:00:33.480> state<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.750> use<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.410> a

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
basically the best state to use is a

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.310 
basically the best state to use is a
blank<00:00:35.070> seed<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:35.670> follow<00:00:35.969> me<00:00:36.120> here<00:00:36.200> so<00:00:37.200> if

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
blank seed and just follow me here so if

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.540 
blank seed and just follow me here so if
you<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.620> be<00:00:37.680> strong<00:00:37.890> new<00:00:38.040> world<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.489> you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
you just can be strong new world and you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.250 
you just can be strong new world and you
just<00:00:38.760> want<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.940> type<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.329> seed<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:39.899> happen

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
just want to type in a seed what happen

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.020 
just want to type in a seed what happen
is<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.829> seed<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.219> if<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.610> type<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.910> let's

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
is to that seed is if you type in let's

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.209 
is to that seed is if you type in let's
say<00:00:42.180> Tweaker<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.989> convert<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.620> seed<00:00:43.829> into<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
say Tweaker it convert the seed into a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.500 
say Tweaker it convert the seed into a
number<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> don't<00:00:44.730> know<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> exact<00:00:45.300> process

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
number I don't know the exact process

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.020 
number I don't know the exact process
it's<00:00:45.930> some<00:00:46.170> crazy<00:00:46.440> hashing<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.190> yeah<00:00:47.640> words

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
it's some crazy hashing and yeah words

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.810 
it's some crazy hashing and yeah words
and<00:00:48.239> stuff<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.370> turns<00:00:50.579> into<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
and stuff and then it turns into a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.479 
and stuff and then it turns into a
number<00:00:51.059> between<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.629> -<00:00:52.110> 49<00:00:52.530> quintillion<00:00:53.340> and

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
number between like - 49 quintillion and

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.990 
number between like - 49 quintillion and
plus<00:00:53.699> 49<00:00:54.180> quintillion<00:00:55.520> including<00:00:56.520> zero<00:00:56.820> in

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
plus 49 quintillion including zero in

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.330 
plus 49 quintillion including zero in
there<00:00:57.149> somewhere<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:58.129> basically<00:00:59.129> what

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
there somewhere and basically what

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.740 
there somewhere and basically what
happens<00:00:59.609> if<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.789> type<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.090> blank<00:01:00.329> seed<00:01:00.570> or

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
happens if you type in a blank seed or

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.920 
happens if you type in a blank seed or
zero<00:01:01.109> seed<00:01:01.550> what<00:01:02.550> will<00:01:02.670> happen<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.719> would

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
zero seed what will happen is it would

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.450 
zero seed what will happen is it would
usually<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.439> pick<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> random<00:01:04.769> see<00:01:05.129> between

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
usually just pick a random see between

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.770 
usually just pick a random see between
the<00:01:05.580> other<00:01:05.700> ones<00:01:05.850> because<00:01:06.060> 0<00:01:06.270> isn't<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.600> valid

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the other ones because 0 isn't a valid

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.830 
the other ones because 0 isn't a valid
seed<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.290> some<00:01:07.439> reason<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:09.330> we'll<00:01:09.420> look<00:01:09.600> what

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
seed for some reason and we'll look what

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.679 
seed for some reason and we'll look what
why<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> explained<00:01:10.320> some<00:01:10.619> more<00:01:11.270> yeah<00:01:12.270> what<00:01:12.540> do

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
why I explained some more yeah what do

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.570 
why I explained some more yeah what do
is<00:01:12.840> give<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.320> random<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:13.799> between<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.250> 49

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
is give you a random see between the 49

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.700 
is give you a random see between the 49
million<00:01:14.820> numbers<00:01:15.390> which<00:01:16.110> means<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.530> could

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
million numbers which means you could

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.260 
million numbers which means you could
get<00:01:16.890> any<00:01:17.070> seed<00:01:17.369> which<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.670> which<00:01:17.880> means<00:01:18.090> it's

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
get any seed which is which means it's

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.969 
get any seed which is which means it's
just<00:01:18.450> as<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:18.990> good<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.320> typing<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.770> tight

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
just as you know good as typing in tight

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.740 
just as you know good as typing in tight
as<00:01:20.250> good<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.729> know<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.420> could<00:01:21.570> get

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
as good for you know you could get

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.690 
as good for you know you could get
anything<00:01:21.900> random<00:01:22.350> which<00:01:22.799> means<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.340> usually

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
anything random which means it usually

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.490 
anything random which means it usually
just<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.880> better<00:01:24.090> off<00:01:24.210> typing<00:01:24.630> my<00:01:24.960> name<00:01:25.170> is

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
just be better off typing my name is

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.649 
just be better off typing my name is
also<00:01:25.950> more<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.460> know<00:01:26.580> tweak<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.299> scat

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
also more you know tweak out like scat

such<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.119> know<00:01:30.150> awful<00:01:30.509> examples<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:30.990> just

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
such you know awful examples but just

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.630 
such you know awful examples but just
just<00:01:31.530> type<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:31.979> own<00:01:32.070> seed<00:01:32.340> would<00:01:32.430> usually

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
just type in your own seed would usually

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.280 
just type in your own seed would usually
be<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.060> better<00:01:33.329> decision<00:01:33.810> because<00:01:34.079> at<00:01:34.200> least

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
be the better decision because at least

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.660 
be the better decision because at least
it's<00:01:34.500> personalized<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.520> replicate

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
it's personalized and you can replicate

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.370 
it's personalized and you can replicate
it<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:36.600> what<00:01:36.810> happens<00:01:37.020> if<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.140> type<00:01:37.259> in

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
it but now what happens if you type in

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.200 
it but now what happens if you type in

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the blank seed or the 0 see just type in

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.179 
the blank seed or the 0 see just type in
0

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189

a<00:01:43.110> random<00:01:43.320> good<00:01:43.829> seed<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.610> takes<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:45.000> all

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
a random good seed so it takes out all
