00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.259 
now on to the luster of the hair I would
consider<00:04:03.989> this<00:04:04.229> a<00:04:04.409> medium<00:04:04.919> to<00:04:05.609> high<00:04:05.849> luster

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
consider this a medium to high luster

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.379 
consider this a medium to high luster
because<00:04:07.229> this<00:04:07.379> hair<00:04:07.680> definitely<00:04:07.979> does<00:04:08.549> have<00:04:09.000> a

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
because this hair definitely does have a

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.559 
because this hair definitely does have a
nice<00:04:10.199> healthy<00:04:10.709> shine<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.849> glow<00:04:12.060> as<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.359> reason

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
nice healthy shine and glow as a reason

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.930 
nice healthy shine and glow as a reason
to<00:04:12.750> why<00:04:13.169> I<00:04:13.199> recommend<00:04:13.919> it<00:04:14.040> seriously<00:04:14.579> for

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
to why I recommend it seriously for

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.800 
to why I recommend it seriously for
women<00:04:15.209> who<00:04:15.329> have<00:04:15.540> relaxed<00:04:16.049> hair<00:04:16.260> because<00:04:17.220> I'm

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
women who have relaxed hair because I'm

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.180

it's very easy with blending with

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.629 
it's very easy with blending with
relaxed<00:04:20.760> hair<00:04:20.940> because<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.870> hair<00:04:22.049> is<00:04:22.079> so

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
relaxed hair because the hair is so

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.480
