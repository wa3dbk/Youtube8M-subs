00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.450
 Hi all guys and well found on AndroidMod, today I want to show you a ROM Lollipop recommended 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.880
 from one of you and that amazed me in every respect. It is based on Android 5.1.1 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.830
 and probably the best I've ever tried. 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.500
 This is the Flex OS, let's see it together after the intro. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.550
 Well, the aesthetic aspect is the classic one of Lollipop and all the settings implemented 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.890
 from the development team they were well integrated with those present in the original firmware 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.820
 of Google. Starting from the Device section, we find 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.940
 numerous additions in Sounds and Display &amp; Lights, as complete and customizable control 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.500
 of all the volumes in the first and the Ambient Display or the possibility of resizing 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.420
 PPE in the second; Themes is CyanogenMod's famous theme chooser with the possibility 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.160
 to customize all the aesthetic parts of the ROM in a complete way with downloadable packages 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.530
 from the Play Store * set cosmos *, on Notifications we can check and filter the alerts 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.090
 and Lock screen allows complete modification of the lockscreen. 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.450
 Through buttons we can customize the navbar (which can be replaced by the Pie 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.180
 control * replace *), the menu that is obtained by long pressing the Power button and the 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.820
 volume rocker, and on Gesture we can control the options connected to the Display 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.930
 Ambient that will allow us to activate the device when we pull it out of the pocket 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.430
 or simply when we shake our hands. In addition, on Battery, we can choose one 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.000
 mode between Energy Saving, Balanced and Performance to optimize the use of the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.270
 device. However, this does not end here because, 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.950
 in personal, in addition to Cyanogen System Profiles and Privacy, it is made available to us 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.840
 the FlexControl with several additional options: first of all the possibility to activate 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.100
 or not Heads up notifications. Furthermore we can act on the statusbar by modifying 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.189
 the icons, showing the name of the operator and activating the battery bar, customize 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.820
 the secondary curtain with the related tiles, the panel of recent applications that 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.579
 is the classic one of Lollipop * to show *, but which can be replaced if necessary 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.819
 from the OmniSwitch of the Omni ROM (equally complete and functional * leave that *) e 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.049
 system animations using the Animation control item. 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.769
 Finally, App circle bar allows you to insert some applications in a scrolling menu 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.760
 lateral callable with a swipe and Gesture anywhere to associate actions with gestures 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.129
 to then recall them by drawing on the panel you see on the screen. 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.069
 Last, but not in order of importance, is the item Performance that allows us to activate 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.480
 the profiles for the individual apps and to modify the scheduler. 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.219
 Let's now look at the default launcher or Trebuchet: this is the new one 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.779
 of CyanogenMod with the square preview of the folders, the opening animation 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:50.230
 full screen of the latter and the drawer of the vertical app similar to that of Android 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.889
 M. For those who do not like the style of this menu, 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.699
 holding down for a long time on an empty spot on the screen and then making a swipe 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:01.089
 upwards it will be possible to access the settings and, from here, modify it to do so 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:05.980
 get back to Lollipop. In addition there are several scroll effects and three modes 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.529
 sorting. The system applications are also those 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:14.699
 of CM but with some additions: in this case we are made available Audio FX for 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.969
 really check the sound in headphones, speaker, USB, Bluetooth and wireless 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:24.359
 complete, Documents or a file manager for multimedia files, Lantern which is a 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.469
 music player with nice graphics and all the necessary functions, the Messages, 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:34.699
 OmniSwitch that I showed you before * re-showing it *, the working Radio, a voice recorder, 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:40.059
 ROM Stats to send statistics on our use and themes to the team (already seen in 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:42.639
 settings). All are updated in Material Design and 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.669
 the only flaw is the lack of a file manager that can be slightly inconvenient 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:47.579
 at the first start. 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.209
 Now let's see the camera that is the classic one with the addition of three advanced settings 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.010
 for manual exposure, the shots with the On / Off button and the bright screen. 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.119
 Trying to take some pictures you can see that the speed of focus is 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:07.650
 shooting is really good. Let's do one without the flash ... and let's go 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.669
 to see the results obtained. These are quite sharp and well defined 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.509
 so everything is great and also with regards to the video part it works well and doesn't present 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:18.019
 bug. 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.789
 Ok, let's close a few applications and move on to the final considerations. 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.090
 As for energy management, it's something incredible, a few days 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.470
 ago I posted screenshots on the Facebook page (screenshots found in the description) 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.979
 as it really surprised me: I reached 32 hours of consecutive use with 5 of 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.560
 screen and a fairly intense use; a result to which, since I started G, I was not 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.720
 never arrived. Not to mention stability and fluidity 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.610
 which are just as good: in two weeks of testing I have never experienced spontaneous restarts 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.509
 nor have I ever been forced to forcibly reboot the device, nor have I noticed lag 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:58.979
 or various setbacks; also stressing it a lot with the mobile network, GPS and bluetooth always active, 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.590
 browsing, using several apps and playing the device has always responded more than good. 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.340
 To date, the Flex OS is probably the best custom firmware I have ever tried 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.639
 I can do nothing but recommend it; it is available for many models so if the 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.159
 you will test let me know what you think. 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:19.550
 Perfect, I have nothing else to add, except that the download links for the ROM 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.569
 and the Gapps can be found in the description, so this is all for today. 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.280
 If you liked the video, please, put a nice "like", share it 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.400

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:37.900
 video. Hello everyone!
