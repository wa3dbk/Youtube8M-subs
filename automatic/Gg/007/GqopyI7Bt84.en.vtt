and<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:01.200> feels<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.530> pretty<00:02:02.460> tacky<00:02:02.929> type

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
and it feels like a pretty tacky type

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.230 
and it feels like a pretty tacky type
base<00:02:04.950> here<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.249> it's<00:02:05.609> it<00:02:05.909> looks<00:02:05.969> like<00:02:06.149> it's

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
base here so it's it looks like it's

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
base here so it's it looks like it's
gonna<00:02:06.479> actually<00:02:06.869> sit<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.229> your<00:02:07.439> table<00:02:07.799> quite

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
gonna actually sit on your table quite

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.089 
gonna actually sit on your table quite
nicely<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.090> it's<00:02:10.020> not<00:02:10.229> really<00:02:10.380> going<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.679> move

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
nicely and it's not really going to move

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.530 
nicely and it's not really going to move
around<00:02:11.220> much<00:02:11.519> I<00:02:11.700> mean<00:02:11.819> I'm<00:02:11.970> actually<00:02:12.209> putting

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
around much I mean I'm actually putting

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.699 
around much I mean I'm actually putting
a<00:02:12.629> pretty<00:02:12.810> decent<00:02:13.110> amount<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.319> force<00:02:13.530> and

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
a pretty decent amount of force and

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.380 
a pretty decent amount of force and
that's<00:02:13.769> not<00:02:13.980> going<00:02:14.220> anywhere<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.730> that's<00:02:15.239> a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
that's not going anywhere so that's a

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.770 
that's not going anywhere so that's a
nice<00:02:15.510> little<00:02:15.659> feature

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
nice little feature

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.420 
nice little feature
I'll<00:02:16.840> set<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.320> aside<00:02:19.950> put<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.130> styrofoam

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
I'll set that aside put that styrofoam

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.490 
I'll set that aside put that styrofoam
out<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.150> way<00:02:22.300> actually<00:02:22.750> let's<00:02:23.200> go<00:02:23.260> ahead

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
out of the way actually let's go ahead

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.730 
out of the way actually let's go ahead
and<00:02:23.620> take<00:02:23.770> this<00:02:23.920> off<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.340> table<00:02:24.700> here<00:02:25.740> the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
and take this off of the table here the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.400 
and take this off of the table here the
next<00:02:26.920> thing<00:02:27.100> that<00:02:27.130> we'll<00:02:27.340> pull<00:02:27.550> out

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
next thing that we'll pull out

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.449 
next thing that we'll pull out
looks<00:02:29.410> like<00:02:29.650> our<00:02:29.950> individual<00:02:30.670> satellites

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
looks like our individual satellites

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.040 
looks like our individual satellites
nice<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:33.700> neatly<00:02:33.910> packaged<00:02:34.480> turns<00:02:34.810> and

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
nice and neatly packaged turns and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:45.980 
nice and neatly packaged turns and
protective<00:02:35.470> styrofoam<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:40.240> there<00:02:40.630> we<00:02:40.720> go

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.030 

trying<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.080> get<00:02:47.170> this<00:02:47.290> off<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.530> here<00:02:47.770> as<00:02:47.860> neatly

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
trying to get this off of here as neatly

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.250 
trying to get this off of here as neatly
as<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:48.370> can

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
as I can

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.280 
as I can
sits<00:02:50.260> up<00:02:50.470> nice<00:02:51.010> little<00:02:51.900> satellite<00:02:52.900> speaker

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
sits up nice little satellite speaker

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.140 
sits up nice little satellite speaker
that's<00:02:56.290> on<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.560> desk<00:02:56.770> like<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.970> that'll

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
that's on the desk like so and that'll

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.699 
that's on the desk like so and that'll
plug<00:02:58.330> into<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.630> Cousteau<00:02:58.989> mask<00:02:59.170> so<00:02:59.350> it<00:02:59.470> gets<00:02:59.620> it

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
plug into a Cousteau mask so it gets it

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.229 
plug into a Cousteau mask so it gets it
up<00:02:59.800> off<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.010> desk<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.459> it<00:03:00.520> has<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.640> slight<00:03:00.940> up

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
up off the desk and it has a slight up

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.030 
up off the desk and it has a slight up
angle<00:03:01.690> which<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.230> nice<00:03:02.500> because<00:03:02.680> typically

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
angle which is nice because typically

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.280 
angle which is nice because typically
your<00:03:03.250> heads<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.520> little<00:03:03.700> higher<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.570> hopefully

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
your heads a little higher so hopefully

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.650 
your heads a little higher so hopefully
that<00:03:05.440> will<00:03:05.530> project<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:06.040> sound<00:03:06.480> into<00:03:07.480> our

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
that will project that sound into our

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.720 
that will project that sound into our
into<00:03:08.620> our<00:03:08.680> ears<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.130> little<00:03:09.190> bit<00:03:09.430> better<00:03:09.550> and

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
into our ears a little bit better and

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.610 
into our ears a little bit better and
kind<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:09.970> more<00:03:10.600> direct<00:03:10.900> in<00:03:11.020> your<00:03:11.140> face<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:11.590> a

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
kind of more direct in your face and a

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.440 
kind of more direct in your face and a
lot<00:03:11.770> of<00:03:11.800> your<00:03:12.100> speaker<00:03:12.760> systems<00:03:13.120> that<00:03:13.300> just

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
lot of your speaker systems that just

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.770 
lot of your speaker systems that just
kind<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.690> point<00:03:13.930> straight<00:03:15.360> which<00:03:16.360> typically

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
kind of point straight which typically

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.260 
kind of point straight which typically
is<00:03:17.020> toward<00:03:17.590> your<00:03:17.680> chest<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.790> this<00:03:18.940> should

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
is toward your chest so this should

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.759 
is toward your chest so this should
provide<00:03:19.480> some<00:03:19.690> pretty<00:03:19.810> good<00:03:19.989> audio<00:03:20.290> imaging

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
provide some pretty good audio imaging

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.070 
provide some pretty good audio imaging
and<00:03:21.010> sound<00:03:21.940> quality<00:03:22.390> on<00:03:22.600> our<00:03:22.780> laptop<00:03:24.330> I'm<00:03:25.330> very

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
and sound quality on our laptop I'm very

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.930 
and sound quality on our laptop I'm very
curious<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:26.709> looking<00:03:27.340> forward<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:27.700> getting<00:03:27.880> a

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
curious and looking forward to getting a

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.550 
curious and looking forward to getting a
real-world<00:03:28.330> test<00:03:28.630> of<00:03:28.780> these<00:03:28.900> speakers<00:03:29.290> as

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
real-world test of these speakers as

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.380 
real-world test of these speakers as
opposed<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.400> display<00:03:30.730> unit<00:03:31.060> which<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.299> all

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
opposed to the display unit which is all

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.330 
opposed to the display unit which is all
hooked<00:03:31.510> up<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.840> computer<00:03:32.019> system<00:03:32.650> in<00:03:32.799> the

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
hooked up to a computer system in the

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.789 
hooked up to a computer system in the
stores<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:34.140> see<00:03:35.140> what<00:03:35.260> this<00:03:35.380> system<00:03:35.650> actually

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
stores and see what this system actually

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.920 
stores and see what this system actually
sounds<00:03:36.220> like<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.670> hopefully<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.330> is<00:03:37.510> will

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
sounds like and hopefully it is will

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.270 
sounds like and hopefully it is will
perform<00:03:38.290> as<00:03:38.500> good<00:03:38.620> as<00:03:38.709> advertised

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
perform as good as advertised

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.590 
perform as good as advertised
now<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:40.120> acoustic<00:03:41.160> bass<00:03:42.160> system<00:03:42.760> here<00:03:43.180> is

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
now the acoustic bass system here is

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.170 
now the acoustic bass system here is
actually<00:03:43.959> kind<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.260> hefty<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.790> I'll<00:03:45.940> put<00:03:46.150> that

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
actually kind of hefty so I'll put that

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.380 
actually kind of hefty so I'll put that
out<00:03:46.480> pull<00:03:46.720> that<00:03:46.810> out<00:03:46.989> a<00:03:47.019> little<00:03:47.170> bit<00:03:47.290> gingerly

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
out pull that out a little bit gingerly

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:56.949 
out pull that out a little bit gingerly
and<00:03:49.390> son<00:03:50.170> wrap<00:03:50.350> this<00:03:50.530> see<00:03:51.430> what<00:03:51.549> we<00:03:51.640> have

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.600 

let's<00:03:57.959> see<00:03:58.200> back<00:03:58.530> of<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.769> system<00:03:58.980> looks<00:03:59.489> like

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
let's see back of the system looks like

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.949 
let's see back of the system looks like
I<00:03:59.700> got<00:03:59.819> it<00:03:59.909> upside<00:04:00.180> down<00:04:00.390> here<00:04:04.250> so<00:04:05.810> back<00:04:06.810> of

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
I got it upside down here so back of

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.539 
I got it upside down here so back of
this<00:04:07.019> system<00:04:07.379> here<00:04:07.620> we've<00:04:08.129> got<00:04:08.310> our<00:04:08.400> power

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
this system here we've got our power

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.110 
this system here we've got our power
