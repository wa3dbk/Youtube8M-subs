00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
this side I have scraped all the rocks

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.690 
this side I have scraped all the rocks
away<00:00:45.960> using<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.890> shovel<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.250> used<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.489> flat

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
away using that shovel I used a flat

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.010 
away using that shovel I used a flat
shovel<00:00:47.969> which<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.390> thought<00:00:48.510> was<00:00:48.629> good<00:00:48.840> and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
shovel which I thought was good and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.200 
shovel which I thought was good and
again<00:00:49.649> all<00:00:49.770> these<00:00:49.950> rocks<00:00:50.340> most<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.000> them<00:00:51.090> are

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
again all these rocks most of them are

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.590 
again all these rocks most of them are
left<00:00:51.360> over<00:00:51.539> from<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.020> construction<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
left over from the construction of the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.939 
left over from the construction of the
stamped<00:00:54.600> concrete<00:00:54.960> pad<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.590> see<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
stamped concrete pad you see to the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.130 
stamped concrete pad you see to the
right<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.329> that's<00:00:57.420> all<00:00:57.660> gone<00:00:57.809> now<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
right and so that's all gone now and

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.420 
right and so that's all gone now and
there's<00:00:58.260> also<00:00:58.410> some<00:00:58.680> other<00:00:58.739> rocks<00:00:59.039> there<00:00:59.280> too

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
there's also some other rocks there too

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.490 
there's also some other rocks there too
I<00:00:59.460> got<00:00:59.760> I'm<00:01:00.239> actually<00:01:00.449> new<00:01:00.690> now<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.170> take<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
I got I'm actually new now is take a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.310 
I got I'm actually new now is take a
rake<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.489> sort<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.480> level<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.840> off

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
rake to it and sort of level it off

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.630 
rake to it and sort of level it off
be<00:01:04.559> nice<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.739> add<00:01:04.890> some<00:01:05.070> extra<00:01:05.250> dirt<00:01:05.460> but<00:01:05.610> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
be nice to add some extra dirt but I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.830 
be nice to add some extra dirt but I
think<00:01:05.820> actually<00:01:05.970> there's<00:01:06.210> some<00:01:06.299> high<00:01:06.450> spots

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
think actually there's some high spots

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.620 
think actually there's some high spots
I'll<00:01:07.619> use<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.950> dirt<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.340> sort<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.880> fill<00:01:09.540> in

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
I'll use that dirt to sort of fill in

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.630 
I'll use that dirt to sort of fill in
the<00:01:09.659> low<00:01:09.810> spots<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.409> also<00:01:11.070> raking<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.490> good

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the low spots and also raking is good

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.670 
the low spots and also raking is good
too<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.030> before<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.299> put<00:01:12.450> down<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.689> sod<00:01:12.930> just

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
too just before we put down the sod just

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.820 
too just before we put down the sod just
sort<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.070> prep<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> area<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.530> I'm<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.740> to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
sort of prep the area of it I'm going to

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
sort of prep the area of it I'm going to
raked<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.340> actually<00:01:17.430> find<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.729> lot<00:01:17.759> more

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
raked it and actually find a lot more

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.370 
raked it and actually find a lot more
rocks<00:01:18.180> there<00:01:18.390> than<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.570> thought<00:01:18.810> there's<00:01:19.229> quite

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
rocks there than I thought there's quite

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.300 
rocks there than I thought there's quite
a<00:01:19.409> lot<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.560> rocks<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> dairy<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.189> that's

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
a lot of rocks in the dairy but that's

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.070 
a lot of rocks in the dairy but that's
okay<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.580> what<00:01:20.790> intrigued<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.450> then<00:01:21.960> what

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
okay so what intrigued it and then what

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.690 
okay so what intrigued it and then what
I<00:01:22.110> wanted<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.650> before<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.100> actually<00:01:23.490> water

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
I wanted to do before I actually water

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.969 
I wanted to do before I actually water

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
here with that so that's pretty

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.890 
here with that so that's pretty
straightforward<00:02:41.069> pretty<00:02:41.340> easy<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.670> do<00:02:41.900> yeah

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
straightforward pretty easy to do yeah

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.210 
straightforward pretty easy to do yeah
there's<00:02:43.080> one<00:02:43.200> spot<00:02:43.470> right<00:02:43.650> here<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:44.130> isn't

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
there's one spot right here that isn't

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.830 
there's one spot right here that isn't
making<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.610> nice<00:02:44.760> edge<00:02:45.030> wasn't<00:02:45.569> laying<00:02:45.690> up

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
making a nice edge wasn't laying up

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.449 
making a nice edge wasn't laying up
really<00:02:46.050> nicely<00:02:46.200> with<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.590> side<00:02:46.800> so<00:02:47.280> what<00:02:47.370> I've

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
really nicely with the side so what I've

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.640 
really nicely with the side so what I've
done<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.910> just<00:02:48.090> used<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:48.569> edger<00:02:48.840> see<00:02:49.410> using

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
done is I just used this edger see using

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.750 
done is I just used this edger see using
a<00:02:49.709> knife<00:02:49.830> or<00:02:49.860> something<00:02:50.069> this<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.400> actually

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
a knife or something this is actually

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.930 
a knife or something this is actually
the<00:02:50.819> perfect<00:02:50.970> tool<00:02:51.330> just<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.110> get<00:02:52.290> nice<00:02:52.440> square

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
the perfect tool just to get nice square

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.420 
the perfect tool just to get nice square
flat<00:02:53.940> edges<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.780> then<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.410> turf<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.280> just

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
flat edges and then that turf is just

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.699 
flat edges and then that turf is just
gonna<00:02:56.580> roll<00:02:56.760> right<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.090> there<00:02:57.209> perfectly<00:02:57.709> I'll

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
gonna roll right in there perfectly I'll

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.170 
gonna roll right in there perfectly I'll
share<00:02:58.950> anybody<00:02:59.250> rolling<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.640> see<00:02:59.819> just<00:02:59.970> right

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
share anybody rolling and see just right

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.120 
share anybody rolling and see just right
there<00:03:00.390> just<00:03:00.510> flops<00:03:00.900> in<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.530> it's<00:03:01.920> gonna<00:03:02.010> make

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
there just flops in and it's gonna make

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.770 
there just flops in and it's gonna make
a<00:03:02.160> bit<00:03:02.370> leveler<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.730> then<00:03:03.120> it's<00:03:03.269> perfect<00:03:03.630> and

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
a bit leveler and then it's perfect and

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.449 
a bit leveler and then it's perfect and
then<00:03:03.989> again<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.380> just<00:03:04.410> need<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.739> cut<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:04.950> bit<00:03:05.220> more

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
then again I just need to cut a bit more

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.390 
then again I just need to cut a bit more
of<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.049> turf<00:03:07.049> off<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.500> then<00:03:07.799> it's<00:03:07.950> done<00:03:08.130> and

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
of the turf off and then it's done and

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.890 
of the turf off and then it's done and
then<00:03:08.760> it's<00:03:08.880> going<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.030> get<00:03:09.209> lots<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.630> lots<00:03:09.780> of

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
then it's going to get lots and lots of

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.509 
then it's going to get lots and lots of
water

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
water

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.009 
water
and<00:03:11.519> one<00:03:11.670> last<00:03:11.819> thing<00:03:12.000> before<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.420> water<00:03:12.630> what

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
and one last thing before you water what

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.449 
and one last thing before you water what
you<00:03:13.080> want<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.319> do<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:13.590> basically<00:03:13.799> just<00:03:14.040> tamp

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
you want to do is basically just tamp

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.850 
you want to do is basically just tamp
down<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.730> sod<00:03:15.090> especially<00:03:16.019> long<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.319> edges<00:03:16.650> I

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
down the sod especially long the edges I

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.500 
down the sod especially long the edges I
just<00:03:17.100> use<00:03:17.190> my<00:03:17.220> foot<00:03:17.580> I<00:03:17.730> mean<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.000> could<00:03:18.150> use<00:03:18.299> an

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
just use my foot I mean you could use an

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.810 
just use my foot I mean you could use an
actual<00:03:18.900> tamper<00:03:19.380> but<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.010> sort<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.430> basically

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
actual tamper but I sort of basically

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.060 
actual tamper but I sort of basically
just<00:03:20.880> tamp<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.630> down<00:03:21.690> with<00:03:21.840> my<00:03:21.930> foot<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.380> I

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
just tamp it down with my foot and I

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.090 
just tamp it down with my foot and I
think<00:03:23.250> that's<00:03:23.370> looking<00:03:23.579> really<00:03:23.609> great<00:03:25.100> this

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
think that's looking really great this

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.210 
think that's looking really great this
is<00:03:26.220> me<00:03:26.370> now<00:03:26.489> soaking<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.940> area<00:03:27.829> nice<00:03:28.829> and<00:03:29.040> wet

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
is me now soaking the area nice and wet

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.880 
is me now soaking the area nice and wet
and<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.760> course<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.060> can<00:03:30.180> have<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.420> do<00:03:30.570> this

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
and of course I can have to do this

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.780 
and of course I can have to do this
probably<00:03:31.890> every<00:03:32.100> day<00:03:32.220> for<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.519> next<00:03:32.609> little

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
probably every day for the next little

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.520 
probably every day for the next little
while<00:03:32.910> just<00:03:33.329> to<00:03:33.420> make<00:03:33.450> sure<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:34.019> this<00:03:34.230> gets

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
while just to make sure that this gets

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.680 
while just to make sure that this gets
lots<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.040> lots<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.310> water<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:35.880> those<00:03:36.390> roots

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
lots and lots of water so those roots

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.289 
lots and lots of water so those roots
and<00:03:36.900> start<00:03:37.079> to<00:03:37.200> grow<00:03:37.320> into<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.799> soil<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.340> then

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
and start to grow into the soil and then

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.870 
and start to grow into the soil and then
we're<00:03:39.510> done<00:03:39.950> it's<00:03:40.950> about<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.130> week<00:03:41.310> since<00:03:41.579> I<00:03:41.700> put

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
we're done it's about a week since I put

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.640 
we're done it's about a week since I put
the<00:03:41.910> sod<00:03:42.180> down<00:03:42.209> now<00:03:42.840> as<00:03:43.019> you<00:03:43.140> can<00:03:43.260> see<00:03:43.320> it's

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
the sod down now as you can see it's

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.440 
the sod down now as you can see it's
actually<00:03:43.739> seen<00:03:44.070> quite<00:03:44.310> good<00:03:44.549> so<00:03:45.239> I'm<00:03:45.299> pretty

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
actually seen quite good so I'm pretty

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.690 
actually seen quite good so I'm pretty
happy<00:03:45.570> with<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.079> I<00:03:46.440> noticed<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:47.400> in<00:03:47.519> one

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
happy with that I noticed that in one

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.759 
happy with that I noticed that in one
corner<00:03:48.299> by<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.540> post<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:49.260> seemed<00:03:49.440> just<00:03:49.500> sunk

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
corner by the post it seemed just sunk

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.380 
corner by the post it seemed just sunk
down<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:49.980> bit<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.820> probably<00:03:51.030> should've<00:03:51.269> put<00:03:51.359> a

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
down a bit so I probably should've put a

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.680 
down a bit so I probably should've put a
bit<00:03:51.540> more<00:03:51.570> dirt<00:03:51.959> there<00:03:52.260> underneath<00:03:53.000> but<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.420> was

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
bit more dirt there underneath but I was

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.150 
bit more dirt there underneath but I was
looking<00:03:54.750> good<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.320> I<00:03:55.380> can<00:03:55.560> just<00:03:55.680> do<00:03:55.799> some<00:03:55.950> top

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
looking good and I can just do some top

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.770 
looking good and I can just do some top
dressing<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.790> sort<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.090> pull<00:03:57.269> that<00:03:57.299> up<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.600> bit

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
dressing and sort of pull that up a bit

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.000 
dressing and sort of pull that up a bit
so<00:03:58.049> anyway<00:03:58.470> that's<00:03:58.620> yeah<00:03:59.430> looking<00:03:59.850> great
