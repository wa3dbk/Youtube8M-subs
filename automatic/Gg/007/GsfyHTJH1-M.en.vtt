growing you can still find morels around

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.280 
growing you can still find morels around
old<00:02:42.480> elm<00:02:42.840> trees<00:02:43.200> for<00:02:44.210> five<00:02:45.210> years<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.900> would<00:02:46.080> say

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
old elm trees for five years I would say

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.630 
old elm trees for five years I would say
at<00:02:46.440> least<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:47.960> sometimes<00:02:48.960> on<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.530> third<00:02:50.310> to

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
fifth year after the tree has died you

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.050 
fifth year after the tree has died you
will<00:02:54.480> get<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.690> huge<00:02:55.320> fruiting<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.220> morels<00:02:56.580> and

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.770 
will get a huge fruiting of morels and
that<00:02:58.050> will<00:02:58.230> signal<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.830> end<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.700> you<00:03:00.390> likely

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
that will signal the end and you likely

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.880 
that will signal the end and you likely
won't<00:03:00.930> find<00:03:01.260> many<00:03:01.590> after<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:03.530> one<00:03:04.530> thing<00:03:04.770> to

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
won't find many after that one thing to

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.010 
won't find many after that one thing to
remember<00:03:05.130> about<00:03:05.280> morels<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.390> really<00:03:06.840> any

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
remember about morels and really any

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.110 
remember about morels and really any
other<00:03:07.230> wild<00:03:07.470> animals<00:03:08.040> but<00:03:08.190> especially<00:03:08.430> morel

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
other wild animals but especially morel

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.110 
other wild animals but especially morel
mushrooms<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:10.290> just<00:03:11.130> because<00:03:11.460> their<00:03:11.700> fruiting

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
mushrooms is just because their fruiting

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.730 
mushrooms is just because their fruiting
in<00:03:12.270> one<00:03:12.450> area<00:03:12.690> doesn't<00:03:12.840> mean<00:03:13.320> they<00:03:13.470> will<00:03:13.590> on

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
in one area doesn't mean they will on

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.130 
in one area doesn't mean they will on
the<00:03:13.860> next<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.940> area<00:03:15.270> here<00:03:15.570> has<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.840> lot<00:03:16.080> of

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
the next this area here has a lot of

the next this area here has a lot of

filtered Sun coming through on the

filtered Sun coming through on the
ground<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:19.080> that's<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.220> good<00:03:20.400> sign<00:03:20.730> that's

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
ground and that's a good sign that's

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.750

another<00:03:21.870> good<00:03:22.140> habitat<00:03:22.830> for<00:03:23.040> mushrooms<00:03:23.520> is

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
another good habitat for mushrooms is

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.260 
another good habitat for mushrooms is
seeing<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:24.870> filtered<00:03:25.560> Sun<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:26.760> forest

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
seeing that filtered Sun on the forest

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.230 
seeing that filtered Sun on the forest
floor<00:03:28.010> they<00:03:29.010> like<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.310> have<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.460> little<00:03:29.670> Sun<00:03:30.030> but

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
floor they like to have a little Sun but

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.650 
floor they like to have a little Sun but
not<00:03:30.450> complete<00:03:31.200> direct<00:03:31.530> Sun

because<00:03:33.930> if<00:03:34.080> you're<00:03:34.230> hunting<00:03:34.530> in<00:03:34.590> an<00:03:34.740> area

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
because if you're hunting in an area

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.310 
because if you're hunting in an area
like<00:03:35.100> this<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:36.360> all<00:03:36.570> you're<00:03:36.780> finding<00:03:37.170> is

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
like this and all you're finding is

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.470 
like this and all you're finding is
little-bitty<00:03:37.800> morels<00:03:38.220> or<00:03:38.760> perhaps<00:03:39.150> you're

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
little-bitty morels or perhaps you're

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.410 
little-bitty morels or perhaps you're
not<00:03:39.510> finding<00:03:40.050> anywhere<00:03:40.410> else<00:03:40.620> yeah<00:03:41.240> but<00:03:42.240> you

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
not finding anywhere else yeah but you

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.210 
not finding anywhere else yeah but you
hear<00:03:42.630> people<00:03:43.020> giving<00:03:43.320> reports<00:03:43.800> that<00:03:44.040> they're

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
hear people giving reports that they're

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.400 
hear people giving reports that they're
finding<00:03:44.520> them<00:03:44.820> then<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.660> just<00:03:45.840> need<00:03:46.020> to<00:03:46.140> find

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
finding them then you just need to find

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.570 
finding them then you just need to find
an<00:03:46.770> area<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:48.180> has<00:03:48.480> warmed<00:03:48.900> up<00:03:49.050> enough<00:03:49.580> to

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
an area that has warmed up enough to

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.860 
an area that has warmed up enough to
support<00:03:51.000> them<00:03:51.680> which<00:03:52.680> in<00:03:52.860> this<00:03:53.010> case<00:03:53.280> would<00:03:53.580> be

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
support them which in this case would be

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.560 
support them which in this case would be
some<00:03:54.870> small<00:03:55.200> shrubs<00:03:55.740> or<00:03:56.280> an<00:03:56.940> open<00:03:57.270> field

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
some small shrubs or an open field

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.630 
some small shrubs or an open field
because<00:03:57.990> that's<00:03:58.200> about<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.860> only<00:03:59.430> thing

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
because that's about the only thing

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.190 
because that's about the only thing
you're<00:03:59.940> gonna<00:04:00.030> find<00:04:00.150> that's<00:04:00.660> gonna<00:04:00.780> give<00:04:01.080> you

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
you're gonna find that's gonna give you

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.030 
you're gonna find that's gonna give you
more<00:04:01.380> sunlight<00:04:01.770> and<00:04:02.100> warmth<00:04:02.520> than<00:04:03.740> this<00:04:04.740> type

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
more sunlight and warmth than this type

I'm<00:04:12.950> not<00:04:13.160> all<00:04:13.310> about<00:04:13.459> numbers<00:04:13.970> when<00:04:14.180> I<00:04:14.270> hunt

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
I'm not all about numbers when I hunt

I'm not all about numbers when I hunt
morels<00:04:14.840> though<00:04:15.140> I<00:04:15.290> did<00:04:16.100> it<00:04:16.250> for<00:04:16.459> a<00:04:16.519> couple

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
morels though I did it for a couple

morels though I did it for a couple
years<00:04:16.970> I<00:04:17.419> was<00:04:17.680> just<00:04:18.680> wanting<00:04:18.950> to<00:04:18.980> see<00:04:19.190> how<00:04:19.400> many

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
years I was just wanting to see how many

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.150 
years I was just wanting to see how many
I<00:04:19.669> could<00:04:20.000> get<00:04:20.269> and<00:04:20.600> then<00:04:20.930> I<00:04:21.850> realized<00:04:22.850> that<00:04:23.150> I

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
I could get and then I realized that I

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.430 
I could get and then I realized that I
had<00:04:25.160> lost<00:04:25.460> what<00:04:25.970> my<00:04:26.480> original<00:04:26.960> intent<00:04:27.350> was

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
had lost what my original intent was

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.620 
had lost what my original intent was
which<00:04:27.919> was<00:04:28.130> just<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.580> go<00:04:28.730> out<00:04:28.880> and<00:04:29.150> have<00:04:29.330> fun
