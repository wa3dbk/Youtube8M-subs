them
so<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.649> actually<00:01:56.250> first<00:01:56.880> bought<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.420> cuff<00:01:57.780> in

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
so I actually first bought this cuff in

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.889 
so I actually first bought this cuff in
the<00:01:58.649> large<00:01:58.950> size<00:01:59.369> that<00:02:00.360> was<00:02:00.450> my<00:02:00.630> experience

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
the large size that was my experience

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.399 
the large size that was my experience
from<00:02:01.380> Barney's<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.880> had<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.840> return<00:02:04.229> it

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
from Barney's and I had to return it

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.580 
from Barney's and I had to return it
because<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.890> looked<00:02:05.159> ridiculous<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.450> me

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
because it looked ridiculous on me

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.130 
because it looked ridiculous on me
if<00:02:08.160> you're<00:02:08.429> probably<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.539> know<00:02:10.190> 510<00:02:11.190> 511

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
if you're probably you know 510 511

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.600 
if you're probably you know 510 511
maybe<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.319> large<00:02:13.560> cuff<00:02:13.920> will<00:02:14.069> look<00:02:14.220> really

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
maybe the large cuff will look really

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.520 
maybe the large cuff will look really
really<00:02:15.150> great<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.690> or<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.959> have<00:02:16.110> larger

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
really great on you or you have larger

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.030 
really great on you or you have larger
wrists<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.069> hands<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:18.030> arms<00:02:18.349> but<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.770> large

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
wrists and hands and arms but the large

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.370 
wrists and hands and arms but the large
size<00:02:20.370> looked<00:02:20.760> really<00:02:21.120> overpowering<00:02:21.930> on<00:02:22.230> me

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
size looked really overpowering on me

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.050 
size looked really overpowering on me
and<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.680> was<00:02:22.830> slightly<00:02:23.069> disappointed<00:02:23.250> because

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
and I was slightly disappointed because

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.630 
and I was slightly disappointed because
I<00:02:24.269> was<00:02:24.510> really<00:02:24.690> into<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.140> large<00:02:25.410> one<00:02:25.650> but<00:02:25.890> when

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
I was really into the large one but when

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.460 
I was really into the large one but when
I<00:02:26.670> saw<00:02:26.970> this<00:02:27.150> 3<00:02:27.480> wrap<00:02:27.690> one<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:27.989> thought<00:02:28.260> well

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
I saw this 3 wrap one I thought well

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.990 
I saw this 3 wrap one I thought well
maybe<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.890> would<00:02:28.980> be<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.160> better<00:02:29.370> choice<00:02:29.459> so<00:02:29.910> I

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
maybe that would be a better choice so I

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.089 
maybe that would be a better choice so I
waited<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.360> couple<00:02:30.690> months<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.890> one

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
waited a couple months and this one

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.000 
waited a couple months and this one
popped<00:02:32.400> up<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.849> I<00:02:33.510> snaked<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.380> it's<00:02:34.709> much

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
popped up and I snaked it and it's much

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.890 
popped up and I snaked it and it's much
lighter<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.760> it's<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.150> perfect<00:02:36.599> size<00:02:36.870> and

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
lighter and it's the perfect size and

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.039 
lighter and it's the perfect size and
proportion<00:02:37.860> for<00:02:38.519> me<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.630> just<00:02:39.870> wraps

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
proportion for me so it just wraps

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.890 
proportion for me so it just wraps
around<00:02:40.260> three<00:02:40.709> times<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.580> it's<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.720> much

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
around three times and it's just a much

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.840 
around three times and it's just a much
better<00:02:43.110> fit<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.739> it's<00:02:43.920> not<00:02:44.160> quite<00:02:44.489> as<00:02:44.640> heavy

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
better fit and it's not quite as heavy

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.759 
better fit and it's not quite as heavy
the<00:02:45.150> other<00:02:45.299> one's<00:02:45.540> really<00:02:45.810> much<00:02:46.230> larger<00:02:46.650> than

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
the other one's really much larger than

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.740 
the other one's really much larger than
it<00:02:46.890> looks<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:47.640> make<00:02:47.970> sure<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.299> see<00:02:48.569> it<00:02:48.660> in

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
it looks so make sure you see it in

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.140 
it looks so make sure you see it in
person<00:02:48.959> or<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:50.100> know<00:02:50.220> try<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:50.790> guess<00:02:50.970> in

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150
