00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
should look pretty messy and that's

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.240 
should look pretty messy and that's
because<00:02:05.960> they<00:02:06.080> are<00:02:06.260> because<00:02:07.010> they're<00:02:07.160> not

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
because they are because they're not

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.870 
because they are because they're not
mounted<00:02:07.670> on<00:02:07.760> anything<00:02:08.119> exactly<00:02:08.750> yet<00:02:09.759> but<00:02:10.759> now

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
mounted on anything exactly yet but now

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.580 
mounted on anything exactly yet but now
you<00:02:10.940> want<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.239> plan<00:02:11.510> out<00:02:11.540> where<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.290> want<00:02:12.470> the

you want to plan out where you want the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.250 
you want to plan out where you want the
bumps<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.890> go<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.480> like<00:02:14.480> one<00:02:14.690> close<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.050> the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
bumps to go I like one close to the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.949 
bumps to go I like one close to the
metal<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.709> two<00:02:16.070> close<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:16.610> blade<00:02:16.959> then

about the consistency of a very daily
thick<00:02:42.640> oatmeal<00:02:43.640> it's<00:02:44.450> ready<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.769> anyway<00:02:46.040> you

thick oatmeal it's ready so anyway you

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
want to figure out some way and I use

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.340 
want to figure out some way and I use
the<00:02:48.230> measuring<00:02:48.799> tool<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:50.420> help<00:02:50.570> me<00:02:50.810> make<00:02:51.200> the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
the measuring tool to help me make the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.710 
the measuring tool to help me make the
bumps<00:02:51.739> on<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.130> claws<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:53.120> want<00:02:53.299> to<00:02:53.360> mark<00:02:53.570> out

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
bumps on the claws you want to mark out

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.870 
bumps on the claws you want to mark out
exactly<00:02:54.110> where<00:02:54.320> they<00:02:54.440> go<00:02:54.470> with<00:02:55.459> I<00:02:55.700> would

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
exactly where they go with I would

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.670 
exactly where they go with I would
recommend<00:02:56.269> a<00:02:56.330> sharpie<00:02:56.690> marker<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:57.290> used<00:02:57.560> the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
recommend a sharpie marker I used the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.350 
recommend a sharpie marker I used the
red<00:02:57.860> one<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.160> went<00:02:58.340> through<00:02:58.640> eventually<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.299> I

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
red one it went through eventually so I

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.840 
red one it went through eventually so I
had<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.570> repaint<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:01.280> just<00:03:01.459> want<00:03:01.700> to

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
had to repaint it and you just want to

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.900 
had to repaint it and you just want to
evenly<00:03:02.720> add<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.320> bumps<00:03:03.739> not<00:03:04.100> very<00:03:04.340> evenly<00:03:04.700> it

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
evenly add the bumps not very evenly it

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.430 
evenly add the bumps not very evenly it
doesn't<00:03:05.180> really<00:03:05.269> matter<00:03:05.570> it's<00:03:06.079> supposed<00:03:06.380> to

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
doesn't really matter it's supposed to

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.860 
doesn't really matter it's supposed to
look<00:03:06.590> like<00:03:06.680> bone<00:03:07.070> and<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:08.180> like<00:03:08.329> to<00:03:08.480> dry<00:03:08.810> brush

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
look like bone and I like to dry brush

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.750 
look like bone and I like to dry brush
around<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.590> bumps<00:03:09.890> because<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.220> really<00:03:10.549> gives

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
around the bumps because it really gives

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.850 
around the bumps because it really gives
it<00:03:10.940> more<00:03:11.120> detail<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:11.900> makes<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.350> little<00:03:12.620> fairy

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
it more detail and makes a little fairy

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.949 
it more detail and makes a little fairy
poet<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:16.730> once<00:03:17.269> you've<00:03:17.450> done<00:03:17.540> that<00:03:17.600> one

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
poet and once you've done that one

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.480 
poet and once you've done that one
o'clock<00:03:18.260> go<00:03:19.190> on<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.549> other<00:03:19.700> two<00:03:19.970> paws

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.720 

and<00:03:25.920> this<00:03:26.920> is<00:03:27.100> a<00:03:27.130> very<00:03:27.370> time-consuming

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
and this is a very time-consuming

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.160 
and this is a very time-consuming
process<00:03:28.330> I'll<00:03:28.720> tell<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:28.990> that

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
process I'll tell you that

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.620 
process I'll tell you that
once<00:03:29.770> you're<00:03:29.890> done<00:03:30.010> all<00:03:30.160> three<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.490> have<00:03:31.450> to

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
once you're done all three you have to

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.840 
once you're done all three you have to
leave<00:03:31.810> them<00:03:32.020> and<00:03:32.980> you<00:03:33.220> got<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.490> work<00:03:33.580> on<00:03:33.700> the

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
leave them and you got to work on the

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.000 
leave them and you got to work on the
base<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.570> handle<00:03:35.050> so<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.740> base<00:03:35.980> is

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
base and the handle so the base is

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.550 
base and the handle so the base is
basically<00:03:36.640> what<00:03:36.850> holds<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.240> claws<00:03:37.510> in<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.350> way

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
basically what holds the claws in a way

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.100 
basically what holds the claws in a way
or<00:03:39.160> when<00:03:39.340> you<00:03:39.430> talk<00:03:39.610> move<00:03:39.940> them<00:03:40.090> together

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
or when you talk move them together

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.820 
or when you talk move them together
try<00:03:41.770> to<00:03:41.830> stay<00:03:42.130> in<00:03:42.160> that<00:03:42.430> way<00:03:43.350> I've<00:03:44.350> already

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
try to stay in that way I've already

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.920 
try to stay in that way I've already
made<00:03:45.100> a<00:03:45.130> base<00:03:45.400> for<00:03:45.760> my<00:03:45.910> pals<00:03:46.210> but<00:03:46.420> I<00:03:46.480> decided<00:03:46.750> to

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
made a base for my pals but I decided to

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.470 
made a base for my pals but I decided to
make<00:03:47.050> another<00:03:47.080> one<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.910> reason<00:03:49.240> you<00:03:49.330> want

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
make another one and the reason you want

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.910 
make another one and the reason you want
this<00:03:49.660> just<00:03:49.840> because<00:03:50.020> you<00:03:50.110> can<00:03:50.260> pull<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.530> up<00:03:50.710> and

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
this just because you can pull it up and

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.400 
this just because you can pull it up and
down<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.190> claws<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:52.060> decide<00:03:52.450> what<00:03:53.050> kind<00:03:53.320> of

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
down the claws to decide what kind of

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.590 
down the claws to decide what kind of
claws<00:03:53.620> won't<00:03:53.890> have<00:03:54.040> x-men<00:03:54.520> origins<00:03:54.700> Days<00:03:55.570> of

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
claws won't have x-men origins Days of

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.170 
claws won't have x-men origins Days of
Future<00:03:55.750> past<00:03:55.990> whichever<00:03:56.620> way<00:03:56.890> you<00:03:57.730> can<00:03:57.880> space

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
Future past whichever way you can space

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.380 
Future past whichever way you can space
them<00:03:58.420> correctly<00:03:58.930> with<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.290> base<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:01.120> anyway
