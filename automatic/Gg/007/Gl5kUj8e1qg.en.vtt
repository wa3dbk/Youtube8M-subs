00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
class and that is where we mostly

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.770 
class and that is where we mostly
focused<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:46.219> well<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.610> was<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> hard<00:00:48.120> work<00:00:48.329> hard

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
focused and well it was a hard work hard

winter for all the guys in many areas

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.700 
winter for all the guys in many areas
mainly<00:00:52.890> focus<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.489> arrow<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.500> we<00:00:55.500> hope<00:00:55.680> that

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
mainly focus on arrow and we hope that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.459 
mainly focus on arrow and we hope that
it<00:00:55.980> pays<00:00:56.129> out<00:00:56.309> well<00:00:57.210> my<00:00:57.420> personal<00:00:58.079> feeling

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.639 
it pays out well my personal feeling
obviously<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.820> on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.199> positive<00:01:01.620> side

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
obviously is on the positive side

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.039 
obviously is on the positive side
because<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.219> see<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.030> beauty<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> car<00:01:03.780> and

because I see the beauty of the car and
it's<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.559> new<00:01:04.710> car<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.250> know<00:01:05.519> how<00:01:05.670> much<00:01:05.820> work<00:01:06.030> is

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
it's a new car you know how much work is

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.740 
it's a new car you know how much work is
is<00:01:06.689> put<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.350> know<00:01:07.380> all<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.939> features<00:01:08.939> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
is put in you know all the features and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.140 
is put in you know all the features and
the<00:01:09.900> improvement<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.680> done<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.150> yes

the improvement you have done and yes
indeed<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.479> mean<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.990> feel<00:01:13.200> some<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.010> those

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
indeed I mean I can feel some of those

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.270 
indeed I mean I can feel some of those
it's<00:01:14.880> important<00:01:15.509> obviously<00:01:16.130> against<00:01:17.130> our

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it's important obviously against our

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.649 
it's important obviously against our
opponent<00:01:17.820> what<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.500> feel<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.130> what

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
opponent what is it that I feel and what

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.060 
opponent what is it that I feel and what
sort<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.720> advantage<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.710> will<00:01:22.860> give<00:01:23.040> us

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
sort of advantage it will give us

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.100 
sort of advantage it will give us
compared<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.909> what<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.210> had<00:01:24.330> previously<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
compared to what we had previously and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.260 
compared to what we had previously and
this<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.770> exactly<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.369> point<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.759> mean<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.060> want

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this is exactly the point I mean we want

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.179 
this is exactly the point I mean we want
to<00:01:27.330> improve<00:01:27.600> our<00:01:27.780> game<00:01:28.080> compared<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> last

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
to improve our game compared to the last

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.300 
to improve our game compared to the last
22<00:01:29.640> years<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.210> that's<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> target<00:01:31.380> well

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
22 years and that's the target well

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.340 
22 years and that's the target well
there<00:01:32.520> are<00:01:32.549> quite<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.000> few<00:01:33.090> new<00:01:33.659> rule<00:01:33.900> changes

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
there are quite a few new rule changes

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.679 
there are quite a few new rule changes
one<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.460> obviously<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.000> reason<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:36.540> have

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
one is obviously the reason that we have

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.640 
one is obviously the reason that we have
the<00:01:38.119> different<00:01:39.119> shape<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.810> nose<00:01:40.049> because

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
the different shape on the nose because

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.950 
the different shape on the nose because
it<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.920> an<00:01:41.040> FAA<00:01:41.310> regulation<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.390> McLain<00:01:42.780> has

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
it is an FAA regulation that McLain has

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.749 
it is an FAA regulation that McLain has
found<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.439> different<00:01:43.740> way<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.100> interpreting

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
found a different way of interpreting

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.170 
found a different way of interpreting
this<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:46.439> keep<00:01:47.220> saying<00:01:47.399> as<00:01:47.640> many<00:01:47.820> ways<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
this and I keep saying as many ways to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.050 
this and I keep saying as many ways to
Rome<00:01:48.390> then<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.130> obviously<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> rule

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
Rome then you have obviously the rule

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.389 
Rome then you have obviously the rule
changes<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.869> for<00:01:52.200> driver<00:01:52.439> behavior<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:53.130> track

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
changes for for driver behavior on track

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.580 
changes for for driver behavior on track
and<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.450> not<00:01:54.540> really<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> rule<00:01:55.049> change<00:01:55.079> it's

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and it's not really a rule change it's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.429 
and it's not really a rule change it's
just<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.920> clarification<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:57.049> precision<00:01:58.049> rule

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
just a clarification and precision rule

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.800 
just a clarification and precision rule
2<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.610> everybody<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.090> understand<00:02:00.479> what
