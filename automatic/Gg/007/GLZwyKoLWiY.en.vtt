00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
it is a useful survival tool but it can

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.679 
it is a useful survival tool but it can
also<00:00:14.780> be<00:00:15.019> used<00:00:15.169> for<00:00:15.440> fun<00:00:16.189> shooting<00:00:16.730> but<00:00:17.390> keep

also be used for fun shooting but keep
in<00:00:17.840> mind<00:00:18.080> that<00:00:18.470> the<00:00:18.650> rock<00:00:19.220> sling<00:00:19.490> was<00:00:19.820> used<00:00:20.119> in

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
in mind that the rock sling was used in

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.729 
in mind that the rock sling was used in
warfare<00:00:21.259> through<00:00:21.980> history<00:00:22.369> and<00:00:23.110> it<00:00:24.110> can<00:00:24.380> cause

used against them

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.430 
used against them
to<00:00:30.880> start<00:00:31.150> off<00:00:31.330> we're<00:00:31.570> going<00:00:31.720> to<00:00:31.810> take<00:00:31.900> some

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.440 
to start off we're going to take some

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.029 
to start off we're going to take some
paracord<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:33.370> make<00:00:33.940> an<00:00:34.150> S<00:00:34.420> shape

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
paracord and make an S shape

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.950 
paracord and make an S shape
then<00:00:36.850> take<00:00:37.120> our<00:00:37.329> bottom<00:00:37.809> end<00:00:37.960> and<00:00:38.579> wrap<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
then take our bottom end and wrap the

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:49.280 
then take our bottom end and wrap the
top<00:00:41.199> end<00:00:41.469> around

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.950 

then<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.650> to<00:00:49.830> place<00:00:50.070> our<00:00:50.400> end<00:00:51.330> through<00:00:51.810> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
then going to place our end through the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.639 
then going to place our end through the
loop

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.380 

and<00:00:55.550> this<00:00:55.760> creates<00:00:56.510> one<00:00:56.690> part<00:00:56.960> of<00:00:57.170> our<00:00:57.440> pouch

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
and this creates one part of our pouch

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.590 
and this creates one part of our pouch
after<00:00:59.390> tightening<00:00:59.809> we're<00:01:00.170> going<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.500> flip<00:01:00.770> our

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
after tightening we're going to flip our

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.670 
after tightening we're going to flip our
rock<00:01:02.600> pouch<00:01:02.870> around<00:01:04.000> and<00:01:05.080> do<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.200> exact<00:01:06.590> same

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
rock pouch around and do the exact same

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.420 
rock pouch around and do the exact same
thing<00:01:07.130> wrap<00:01:07.970> it<00:01:08.000> around<00:01:11.710> then<00:01:12.710> feed<00:01:13.009> the<00:01:13.220> end

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
thing wrap it around then feed the end

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.240 
thing wrap it around then feed the end
through<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.270> hole<00:01:14.899> that<00:01:15.320> we<00:01:15.470> make<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:18.250> this

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
through the hole that we make and this

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.810 
through the hole that we make and this
creates<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:20.360> pouch<00:01:24.430> we're<00:01:25.430> going<00:01:25.610> to<00:01:25.759> need
