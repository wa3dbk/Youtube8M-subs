that's<00:03:05.430> normal<00:03:06.000> yes<00:03:06.360> depending<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.560> where<00:03:07.739> you

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.180 
that's normal yes depending on where you
live<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.250> how<00:03:08.400> hot<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.819> is<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:10.140> we<00:03:10.709> took<00:03:10.920> those

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
live and how hot it is so we took those

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.759 
live and how hot it is so we took those
leaves<00:03:11.579> off<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.090> I've<00:03:12.209> replaced<00:03:12.660> them<00:03:12.959> for

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
leaves off and I've replaced them for

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.440 
leaves off and I've replaced them for
today<00:03:14.069> so<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.370> can<00:03:14.579> still<00:03:14.910> get<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.209> feel<00:03:15.420> for

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
today so you can still get the feel for

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.819 
today so you can still get the feel for
how<00:03:15.870> it's<00:03:16.079> supposed<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.560> look

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
how it's supposed to look

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.039 
how it's supposed to look
and<00:03:17.069> then<00:03:17.639> we<00:03:17.790> scooped<00:03:18.150> down<00:03:18.329> a<00:03:18.359> couple<00:03:18.750> inches

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
and then we scooped down a couple inches

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.759 
and then we scooped down a couple inches
below<00:03:19.859> that<00:03:20.280> mold<00:03:20.579> on<00:03:20.910> on<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:22.109> cabbage<00:03:22.500> leaves

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
below that mold on on the cabbage leaves

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.039 
below that mold on on the cabbage leaves
so<00:03:23.069> that<00:03:23.100> we<00:03:24.000> were<00:03:24.180> sure<00:03:24.359> that<00:03:24.569> we<00:03:24.660> got<00:03:24.810> all<00:03:24.930> the

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
so that we were sure that we got all the

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.840 
so that we were sure that we got all the
bad<00:03:25.200> stuff<00:03:25.380> off<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.889> you<00:03:26.220> can<00:03:26.430> tell<00:03:26.670> because

bad stuff off and you can tell because
the<00:03:27.150> color<00:03:27.359> will<00:03:27.540> be<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.690> little<00:03:27.900> bit<00:03:28.109> different

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
the color will be a little bit different

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.750 
the color will be a little bit different
on<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.680> top<00:03:28.889> remember<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.370> was<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.489> little

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
on the top remember it was a little

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.430 
on the top remember it was a little
lighter<00:03:30.299> color<00:03:30.660> than<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.079> regular

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
lighter color than the regular

lighter color than the regular
sauerkraut<00:03:32.040> right<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.700> we<00:03:32.970> took<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:33.840> off

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
sauerkraut right and we took that off

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.280 
sauerkraut right and we took that off
and<00:03:34.410> we<00:03:34.500> tasted<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.370> few<00:03:36.090> days<00:03:36.239> ago<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:37.049> it

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
and we tasted it a few days ago and it

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.430 
and we tasted it a few days ago and it
was<00:03:37.440> perfect<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.329> so<00:03:39.329> we<00:03:39.900> just<00:03:40.079> put<00:03:40.290> some
