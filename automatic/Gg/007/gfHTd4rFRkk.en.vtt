00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
do get it which I usually do because

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.260 
do get it which I usually do because
they<00:02:02.930> stress<00:02:03.229> out<00:02:03.440> quite<00:02:03.710> easily<00:02:04.190> you<00:02:04.940> just<00:02:05.180> do

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:09.889 
these guys and basically all that is

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.759 
these guys and basically all that is
taking<00:02:10.819> a<00:02:10.939> slick<00:02:11.659> a<00:02:11.689> salt<00:02:12.019> solution<00:02:12.170> from

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
taking a slick a salt solution from

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:13.910 
taking a slick a salt solution from
aquarium<00:02:13.040> salt

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
aquarium salt

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.620 
aquarium salt
fixing<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.250> up<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.580> then<00:02:14.849> adding<00:02:15.209> them<00:02:15.300> into

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
fixing it up and then adding them into

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.210 
fixing it up and then adding them into
it<00:02:15.750> what<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.110> does<00:02:16.319> this<00:02:16.740> all<00:02:17.010> actually

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
it what this does this all actually

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.880 
it what this does this all actually
kills<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.910> ick<00:02:18.060> that's<00:02:18.750> on<00:02:18.959> them<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.500> it

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
kills the ick that's on them and it

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.710 
kills the ick that's on them and it
helps<00:02:20.010> reduce<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.610> population<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:21.360> ik<00:02:21.510> and

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
helps reduce the population of ik and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.559 
helps reduce the population of ik and
the<00:02:21.780> extra<00:02:22.050> aquarium<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.459> that's<00:02:23.700> one<00:02:24.330> key

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
the extra aquarium so that's one key

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.479 
the extra aquarium so that's one key
thing<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.870> keep<00:02:24.989> in<00:02:25.230> mind<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.890> medication

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
thing to keep in mind is the medication

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.150 
thing to keep in mind is the medication
watch<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:27.060> even<00:02:27.450> if<00:02:27.840> you're<00:02:27.959> doing<00:02:28.200> copper<00:02:28.650> I

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
watch it even if you're doing copper I

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.309 
watch it even if you're doing copper I
really<00:02:30.000> recommend<00:02:30.450> not<00:02:30.569> doing<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.260> just

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
really recommend not doing it and just

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.809 
really recommend not doing it and just
doing<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.770> saltwater<00:02:32.100> bath<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.670> usually

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
doing the saltwater bath it's usually

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.880 
doing the saltwater bath it's usually
the<00:02:33.030> best<00:02:33.209> way<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.450> do<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.870> but<00:02:34.620> like<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.770> said

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
the best way to do it but like I said

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.890 
the best way to do it but like I said
with<00:02:35.160> diet<00:02:35.430> with<00:02:35.640> these<00:02:35.790> guys<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.600> do<00:02:36.750> these

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
with diet with these guys the do these

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.860 
with diet with these guys the do these
snails<00:02:37.200> bloodworms<00:02:37.980> brine<00:02:38.400> shrimp<00:02:38.870> pretty

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
snails bloodworms brine shrimp pretty

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.110 
snails bloodworms brine shrimp pretty
much<00:02:40.019> anything<00:02:40.319> but<00:02:41.280> their<00:02:41.459> favorite<00:02:41.910> is

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
much anything but their favorite is

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.229 
much anything but their favorite is
usually<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.630> blood<00:02:42.810> worms<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.500> snails

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
usually the blood worms and the snails

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.520

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
is a little bit tricky and it takes a

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.240 
is a little bit tricky and it takes a
little<00:03:06.180> bit<00:03:06.299> of<00:03:06.840> looking<00:03:07.709> at<00:03:07.860> quite<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.160> few

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
little bit of looking at quite a few

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.860 
little bit of looking at quite a few
different<00:03:08.700> ones<00:03:08.760> actually<00:03:09.209> realize<00:03:09.540> what<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
different ones actually realize what the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.479 
different ones actually realize what the
difference<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.440> with<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.799> males<00:03:11.069> are<00:03:11.370> gonna

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
difference is with the males are gonna

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.630 
difference is with the males are gonna
see<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.730> longer<00:03:12.000> fork<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.750> tail<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:14.040> back

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
see a longer fork in the tail the back

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.720 
see a longer fork in the tail the back
fin<00:03:15.170> basically<00:03:16.170> with<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.860> females<00:03:17.220> gonna<00:03:17.580> be

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
fin basically with the females gonna be

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.580 
fin basically with the females gonna be
a<00:03:17.760> little<00:03:17.940> bit<00:03:18.090> plumper<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.690> as<00:03:19.140> long<00:03:19.350> as<00:03:19.380> the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
a little bit plumper and as long as the

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.500 
a little bit plumper and as long as the
tail<00:03:19.799> so<00:03:20.370> if<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.549> get<00:03:20.670> about<00:03:20.850> six<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.329> them<00:03:21.480> you

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
tail so if you get about six of them you

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.270 
tail so if you get about six of them you
can<00:03:21.720> pretty<00:03:21.930> much<00:03:22.019> pair<00:03:22.440> them<00:03:22.590> off<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:23.100> way

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
can pretty much pair them off that way

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.610 
can pretty much pair them off that way
or<00:03:24.209> they'll<00:03:24.420> naturally<00:03:24.600> pair<00:03:25.049> off<00:03:25.230> but<00:03:25.590> I

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
or they'll naturally pair off but I

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.620 
or they'll naturally pair off but I
don't<00:03:25.859> believe<00:03:26.160> these<00:03:26.340> guys<00:03:26.579> are<00:03:27.000> all<00:03:27.359> that

don't believe these guys are all that

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.660 
don't believe these guys are all that
