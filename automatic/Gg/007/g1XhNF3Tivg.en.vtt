 next I will give you some resources the most interesting that 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.140

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.869
 so I hope you're comfortable with your computers because we're going to start 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.899
 the largest collection of game consoles has the German rené 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.699
 meyer has approximately 2 174 consoles 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.500

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.530
 It was created in 1972 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.490
 another is the first console to conspire nuclear missiles in December 2000 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.750
 lcd and I was investigating approximately 4 thousand units of 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.390
 playstation 2 for the potential and just like the console had 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.830
 in irak it was forbidden to sell equipment and computers and the playstation came in 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.300
 in the market as a simple plus toy 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.380
 This measure was taken as a preventive measure against the use of technology 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.450
 terrorist 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.170

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.020
 was the fighting game that there was a lot of the genre offering with various commands 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.130
 determined 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.180

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:15.899

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:18.899
