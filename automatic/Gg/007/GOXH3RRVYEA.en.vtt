00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 the girls and girls that as you are 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.910
 Well not many months ago 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.760
 I was uploading a video about a makeup 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.349
 look any little thing of these and said 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.509
 Well, I'm going to do a make-up, 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.969
 makeup that is what I usually do 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.609
 most days is now mostly 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.010
 in summer I do not feel like it between 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.010
 week to put base because I find 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.019
 very uncomfortable I do not get spit 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.370
 the base and nothing since my base of 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.330
 summer 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.100
 You will see it in my July favorites 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.410
 Well, this problem does not happen to me, but good 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.020
 the days I do not feel like putting on makeup 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.660
 much and look more skin my skin does not 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.760
 let's say in quotes because that's what 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.410
 what do I do so I hope you love 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.530
 know what you find especially very 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.970
 useful if you like it and see you during the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.350
 end of the video 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.600
 so I start in the first 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.489
 preparing my face to part of me 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.380
 moisturizer with this make up corrector 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.600
 forever that is ideal for enzymes 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.280
 waterproof so in summer endures 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.980
 much more and the only thing I do with him 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.620
 is to cover up well small machines 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.480
 I may have acne but nothing 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.080
 I'm going to hide my nuggets because I 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.080
 they love 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.040
 next what I'm going to do is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.640
 correct the contour area of ​​the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.530
 and with this salmon color and 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.270
 well so that there is not a patch 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.430
 right in that area because as you can see what 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.010
 I'm going to do is blur it down 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.950
 by the room wall of the nose and 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.930
 taking it a little bit the head of the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.960
 eyebrow to see something so good 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.510
 degraded and not patches that are very 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.030
 bad apart this proofreader I really like it 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.979
 because apart from correcting me what it does 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.500
 It is also to give a little bit of light so 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.690
 that then I will also work 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.690
 taking it a little towards the temple 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.020
 and this same concealer as you see what 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.240
 work in the area of ​​the rictus for 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.050
 lift that area and give light right in the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.050
 center of the face 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.790
 then with these wonderful powders of 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.680
 glass tuberose and the help of this little ball 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.720
 take a little bit of product and I'm going to 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:16.210
 follow right where I placed this 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.210
 corrector that we just worked 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.980
 and after applying these powders 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.260
 Mac suntan lotions that were one 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.420
 collection have a little bit of zimmer 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.240
 but nothing very disguised and the truth that 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.160
 they hardly have mine anymore they just have 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.650
 and as you see I'm going to apply it just 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.700
 below the cheekbone areas of the forehead 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.700
 taking it to the temple and chin 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.090
 ah 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.790
 and to finish with the face what I'm going 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.890
 to do is apply me this multiple of 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.280
 I love it with the help of 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.379
 This brooch of synthetic hair from soeva 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.900
 and well I applied it the manzanitas and 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:11.250
 I'm blurring it 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.250
 outward 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.590
 friends 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.970
 yes 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.450
 like shadows or what the paint uses 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.299
 post 20 of mac to give you good a 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.220
 little bit of color to the eyelid and as you can see 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.610
 it got him under the eyebrow because 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.650
 there I will place a tiny shadow 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.510
 but a little eyebrows to remove the 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.590
 product that may have fallen while 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.740
 that we have been applying the 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.330
 bronzer stuffing nothing very little 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.420
 because I just have to fill in the 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.840
 true and I comb again to dry 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.840
 more natural 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.700
 and apart the paint pot pinter law of mac 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.220
 I'm going to make a stroke of eyeliner in 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.550
 black color taking it to the outside 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.850
 what eye refers simply I carry 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.850
 this 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.450
 of course apply a good mask 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.489
 of eyelashes in black color that 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.209
 my eyelashes and that the eyes are not so 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.209
 poor 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.419
 and of course apply these 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.569
 illuminators well known by all with 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.580
 the help of this brochita in the 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.499
 over the cheekbone bringing it to the temple and 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.180
 a little bit on top of the apple tree for 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:43.190
 create relief 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.289
 and to finish I use the prep amp 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.620
 prime of the lips to then place 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.360
 a right lip of kiko and a shadow 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.009
 vanilla just below the arch of the 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.009
 eyebrows to create light 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.080
