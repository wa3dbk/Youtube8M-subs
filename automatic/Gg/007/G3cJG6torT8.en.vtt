when you're trying to do an ollie you
have<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.860> think<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.220> two<00:01:29.430> movements<00:01:29.700> you're

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
have to think of two movements you're

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.240 
have to think of two movements you're
actually<00:01:30.570> trying<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.110> combine<00:01:31.439> two<00:01:31.979> movements

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
actually trying to combine two movements

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.880 
actually trying to combine two movements
to<00:01:32.610> make<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.329> they're<00:01:33.840> almost<00:01:34.079> done<00:01:34.710> at

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
to make one and they're almost done at

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.190 
to make one and they're almost done at
the<00:01:34.950> same<00:01:35.250> time<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.180> first<00:01:36.509> movement<00:01:36.840> is

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the same time the first movement is

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.530 
the same time the first movement is
snapping<00:01:37.950> your<00:01:38.250> tail<00:01:38.520> down<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> ground<00:01:39.299> as

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
snapping your tail down to the ground as

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.039 
snapping your tail down to the ground as
hard<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.259> as<00:01:40.350> fast<00:01:40.409> as<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:42.780> see

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
hard and as fast as you can you see

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.800 
hard and as fast as you can you see
that's<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.159> way<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.549> has<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.759> snap<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.659> know

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
that's the way it has to snap you know

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.780 
that's the way it has to snap you know
so<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.380> wait<00:01:46.680> all<00:01:46.860> your<00:01:47.070> back<00:01:47.310> foot<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.729> the

so you wait all your back foot on the
tail<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:49.500> jump<00:01:49.829> into<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.250> air<00:01:50.369> at<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
tail and you jump into the air at the

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.080 
tail and you jump into the air at the
same<00:01:50.850> time<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.659> other<00:01:51.869> movement<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:53.090> rubbing

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
same time the other movement is rubbing

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.510
