00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.430
 hi to all and fits little video 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.439
 pvp so the coccyx looks at you 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.820
 episode 2 numbers I do not know how much 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.349
 because that's good I did not do 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.490
 So it's gone for a live 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.470
 steamer casus raemdonck on our 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.720
 server not the cia against xx and 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.340
 so is a tram pretty good we're going 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.540
 say and the fashion bow like many 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.160
 Once we will say a twice I think 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.840
 with networks but good with the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.450
 scrabble steamer good it's a little bit 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.190
 shit so there's no sia who faces x 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.930
 and his ds with two sarpaux my general 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.430
 faso strap I play really safe 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.940
 now I'm done we'll say 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.350
 play we will say in the mode the buyer 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.249
 since it's early with the air more 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.309
 for rush et cetera 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:56.149
 but facing a new tram we will say 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.199
 use the real banat taxi since 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.300
 must really play sky because 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.980
 the extreme in general it is absolutely necessary 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.089
 the pursuers but after that depends on 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.589
 the chandeliers intersil scrabble strategy 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.510
 games like x and his debt that will do it 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.190
 together to play it a network snippet he 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.540
 concentrated all over there there 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.180
 just make a placement mistake 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.960
 and we're dead because because good 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.090
 it's a little shit 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.770
 a simple face to a style less because 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.000
 that will be can easily neutralize 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.680
 overtaking six deaths each 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.810
 bridge two countries one must take inspiration from 4 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.890
 pm and there we can not agree it 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.189
 must really anticipate the movements 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.689
 of the sras etc and it's a little shit 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.219
 So good when made of RaphaÃ«l 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.840
 placement is not great so me 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.100
 frankly I prefer two months with 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.090
 the attak tyrrell time of an attack 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.700
 tyrrell it's still a turret 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.740
 which helps to transport tightens to 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.610
 anywhere on the map is 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.110
 without limits 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.609
 that is to say that basically you place 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.719
 your turret at a corner then you 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:42.770
 received towards the simple to hit him 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.509
 some small damage this summer with some 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.009
 inks in gideon view so I glued them 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.990
 coiba back two damage centers 300 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.490
 damage sir gervais kouassi iii without 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.469
 damage already he can heal himself or less 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.380
 treacherous every two rounds with my 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.880
 father did kind of 50 health but 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.409
 we will say that in the long run will say 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.479
 that I had everything going super long my 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.909
 strategy and they are all that over the 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.560
 hard fight and more tram ya risks 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.119
 that it will not make us say who sticks to us 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.369
 a network but we must also think about 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.410
 does that bill she's going to us 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.090
 to be able to use the network 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.560
 against him ie the stadium is going 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.300
 literally change sicily was played 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.800
 six votes convenes the yal tax because 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.730
 that in fact we will not be able to rush 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.680
 it's only for a pin 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.019
 quickly he is invisible he wins 2 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.489
 pm he has repulsive feet for himself 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.349
 bring closer so to be able to rush the 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.930
 steamer when we play rush on him it's 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.549
 a little sea 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.319
 this campus when invisible the simple 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.170
 we stick poison with poison 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.920
 begins to fade pieces of silence and the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.859
 insidious poison 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.269
 so it's a bit of a hassle and it's 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.579
 really not obvious so play 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.750
 against a contrast oars for a 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.769
 steamer waited to no then 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.620
 decided how to write to find 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.079
 invisible quantity the sadidas one is 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.540
 really pure galley mode so 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.329
 frankly it's not great so 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.829
 then how to say that he will surely 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.209
 focus all his network yet 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.469
 I find that face for astra milian 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.930
 test this idea to beat a streamer 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:59.040
 his two and we 'll say fashion at the beginning of 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.139
 switch to invisible mode 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.519
 then places a small network to make 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.319
 believe in little marc hello having done 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.540
 is really play drive up a 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.370
 small network is imparted moment timor 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.319
 we dressings and good just appears to 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.480
 next to him and from there we get him 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.760
 did we say in striking him 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.689
 misdirection for the coc and erosion and 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.419
 when he takes an erosion 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.919
 we are recovering invisible on turn 7 because 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.569
 in general the Saturday against dijon 1 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.620
 and he comes back by auto sakali sail to 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.409
 the school of erosion 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.419
 yes there he will stick to erosion and to 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.090
 from this erosion there will be power 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.379
 invade the tear slowly fire con 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.729
 I do not know if he'll do this plot 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.560
 he cuts down there the networks he has 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:36.599
 cost happily with a fucking network 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.530
 here he managed to rip him apart 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.510
 it is still not fast 2007 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.340
 overweight imax he was first the guy 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.019
 he's already dead he has exactly what 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.699
 I thought it was to break hours 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.349
 they made the glory since the 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.370
 steamer if very badly placed and there he laughed 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.379
 so many reeds he had hurt himself 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.609
 when we have one huge lap 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.959
 nothing to say it's great a soul this 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.389
 that they want to do with a crew with 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.750
 erosion that hurts for 135% + 5 years 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.159
 it has 40% erosion and this network point 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.949
 like that so binds to no embarrassing lottery 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.780
 because the wendy maxi steamer there then 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.889
 So he died there there are missions 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.919
 not the void it will certainly generate just 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.810
 200 250 points 10 maximum is not it 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.430
 will finish with 10.3 rice without too much 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.319
 difficulties so you'll see there 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.030
 it's almost finished 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.789
 will be that nice team and flexibility of 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.750
 silence and that's good 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.269
 frankly nothing to say that we will do 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.479
 fast for Sat in one reason in one round 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.200
 in town with blow capitalism he 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.930
 ay ay there he destroyed 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.390
 ac the standards and so there the fight has 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.650
 makes five laps so five rounds of ecofys 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.700
 looking at you on the brain billion that 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.110
 is pleased to see a little thicker 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.460
 are good it's true that we are only pdp 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.570
 is a little dead worthy of the coup I had 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.610
 nothing done for that tdp are put to 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.170
 comfortable and years with the beta offers more than 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.700
 opportunities versus opponents 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.990
 have by cons ads did a welcome 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.520
 for the contents of the signal heap pile 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.080
 and he lost because hey we did not 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.220
 managed to do what he wanted and that's it 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.870
 it is still well managed his hallway 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.330
 So that's all for this little girl 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.400
 video so he stopped this magnificent 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.340
 little in fact he has there is exactly one 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.410
 will say do what I fear the most 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.820
 a tram must be placed so 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.170
 not enough to account so because the 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.740
 chelles station pasta network with 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.690
 erosion 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.130
 this is all this little video if 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.900
 you have twitter questions youtube 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.640
 do not hesitate to ask questions about 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.640
 this I disconnect to the next video
