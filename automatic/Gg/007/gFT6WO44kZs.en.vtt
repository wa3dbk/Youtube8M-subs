00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.135
What’s up?

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:04.137
Hi, honey, 
how’s it going?

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:06.673
– How are you?
– I’m great, where have you been?

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:14.481
I was having some beer 
with my work colleagues.

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:16.182
What’s going on, Jorge?

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:17.484
What do you mean?

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.719
What’s going on, 
why are talking weird?

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:21.154
I’m not talking weird…

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:24.090
Why were you talking weird when 
I asked you where have you been?

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:29.429
I wasn’t talking weird, 
I was talking normal.

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:32.499
Jorge, you know 
that you cannot lie.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:35.969
Of course I can lie! 

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.538
Fine, I cannot lie, honey. 

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.274
You’re right. 
But when you asked…

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:45.045
…I was telling you the truth!

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:50.350
You can really tell the difference 
between you telling the truth and a lie. 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.152
It's really dramatic.

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:53.486
I’m sorry, honey. 

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:57.524
It’s hard for me to tell the truth, 
‘cause it's kinda embarrasing…

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:03.596
I was in a whorehouse with my colleagues
 fucking some whores.

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.067
Please, tell me the truth, Jorge.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.303
I was playing Counter Strike 
with my friends at a LAN center.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.205
– Oh…
– Sorry.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.274
There's no need to lie to me...

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:17.944
There’s nothing wrong with playing 
Counter Strike, aside from being ridiculous.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.448
Sorry. 
I lied just because I love you.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:22.515
Oh… 

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:26.186
I love you too.

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:28.555

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:32.725
So, did you like the video? 

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.395
Me too… 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.031
I’d like to congratulate 
our beloved director… 

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:40.433
...Fernando Meirelles. 

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:47.674
And also our wonderful cast...
Dani Calabresa and Paulo Gustavo. 

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:52.245
The script was written 
by the dearest... Bruno de Luca. 

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:57.150
And of course, our incredible 
producers… who are virgins! 

00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:03.223
They’re Nataly Mega, 
Bianca Caetano and Ohana... Girl! 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.996
I couldn't forget about Luanne Araujo, 
who is… very hygienic!

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:15.268
And the super... qualified 
Gustavo Chagas, our boom operator. 

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:19.072
And the ever incredible 
cinematography by Gui Machado… 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.375
...who's never had sexual 
intercourse with animals!
