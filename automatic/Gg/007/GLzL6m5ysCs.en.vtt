00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
least or why of you so if you can't make

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.300 
least or why of you so if you can't make
out<00:01:50.729> you've<00:01:51.060> got<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> Eagle<00:01:51.840> here<00:01:52.159> you<00:01:53.159> go

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
out you've got the Eagle here you go

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.670 
out you've got the Eagle here you go
ahead<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.149> wings<00:01:54.390> that's<00:01:55.290> why<00:01:55.409> they<00:01:55.560> call

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
ahead and the wings that's why they call

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.749 
ahead and the wings that's why they call
it<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.799> Beagle<00:01:56.310> because<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.700> very<00:01:56.909> spread

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
it the Beagle because it's very spread

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.039 
it the Beagle because it's very spread
so<00:01:59.759> I'm<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.149> trying<00:02:00.299> ere<00:02:00.570> we<00:02:00.750> go<00:02:00.840> that's

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
so I'm just trying ere we go that's

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:01.310 
so I'm just trying ere we go that's
better

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
better

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.929 
better
try<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.890> find<00:02:02.070> better<00:02:02.219> lying<00:02:02.520> hopefully<00:02:02.880> you

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
try to find better lying hopefully you

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.339 
try to find better lying hopefully you
can<00:02:03.060> see<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.870 

it's<00:02:08.349> quite<00:02:08.560> small<00:02:08.770> so<00:02:08.920> obviously<00:02:09.399> if<00:02:09.550> I<00:02:09.700> get

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
it's quite small so obviously if I get

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.210 
it's quite small so obviously if I get
closer<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.630> kind<00:02:10.959> of<00:02:11.020> blurs<00:02:11.349> so<00:02:12.010> you've<00:02:12.130> got

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
closer it kind of blurs so you've got

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.000

around the simulated lever that goes all

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.759 
around the simulated lever that goes all
around<00:03:33.840> literally<00:03:34.840> all<00:03:35.019> around<00:03:35.290> even<00:03:35.440> at<00:03:35.680> the

edges and then comes back down along the
bond<00:03:40.500> okay<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:42.220> around<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.640> edges<00:03:42.910> from<00:03:43.060> here

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
bond okay and around the edges from here

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.590 
bond okay and around the edges from here
up<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.470> here<00:03:44.820> so<00:03:45.820> just<00:03:45.850> from<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.239> side<00:03:46.390> place

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
up to here so just from the side place

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.650 
up to here so just from the side place
you've<00:03:46.750> got<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:46.959> W<00:03:47.260> logo<00:03:47.940> that's<00:03:48.940> upside<00:03:49.359> down

so here you go hopefully you can see

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.830 
so here you go hopefully you can see

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
like us something I should point out the

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.240 
like us something I should point out the
leather<00:05:37.430> cut<00:05:37.760> here<00:05:38.630> between<00:05:39.169> the<00:05:39.740> main<00:05:39.979> plate

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
leather cut here between the main plate

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.920 
leather cut here between the main plate
and<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:40.460> side<00:05:40.669> place<00:05:40.880> is<00:05:41.030> a<00:05:41.060> bit<00:05:41.240> fickle<00:05:41.539> right

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
and the side place is a bit fickle right

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.020 
and the side place is a bit fickle right
here<00:05:42.229> and<00:05:43.070> here

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
here and here

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.570 
here and here
I<00:05:44.090> suppose<00:05:44.870> that's<00:05:45.080> just<00:05:45.139> to<00:05:45.950> be<00:05:46.099> able<00:05:46.190> to<00:05:46.310> hold

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
I suppose that's just to be able to hold

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.240 
I suppose that's just to be able to hold
the<00:05:46.820> actual<00:05:46.970> plates<00:05:47.450> on<00:05:47.750> the<00:05:48.590> a<00:05:48.620> dog<00:05:48.830> replica

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
the actual plates on the a dog replica

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.640 
the actual plates on the a dog replica
isn't<00:05:49.840> like<00:05:50.840> that<00:05:51.020> so<00:05:51.139> there's<00:05:51.289> not<00:05:51.410> a<00:05:51.470> lot<00:05:51.620> of

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
isn't like that so there's not a lot of

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.950 
isn't like that so there's not a lot of
black<00:05:51.950> space<00:05:52.370> I<00:05:52.760> mean<00:05:53.150> that's<00:05:53.360> probably<00:05:53.720> the

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
black space I mean that's probably the

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.980 
black space I mean that's probably the
only<00:05:53.990> fault<00:05:54.770> or<00:05:55.130> not<00:05:55.430> fault<00:05:56.150> or<00:05:56.330> you<00:05:56.870> know

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
only fault or not fault or you know

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.650 
only fault or not fault or you know
problem<00:05:57.410> I<00:05:57.560> would<00:05:57.800> have<00:05:58.070> with<00:05:58.610> this<00:05:58.760> belt<00:05:59.090> the

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
problem I would have with this belt the

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.540 
problem I would have with this belt the
leather<00:05:59.840> cuts<00:06:00.080> a<00:06:00.169> bit<00:06:00.320> chunky<00:06:00.830> compared<00:06:01.460> to

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
leather cuts a bit chunky compared to

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.890 
leather cuts a bit chunky compared to
the<00:06:01.639> place<00:06:01.849> but<00:06:02.180> I<00:06:02.210> suppose<00:06:02.419> it's<00:06:02.599> just<00:06:02.810> to

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
the place but I suppose it's just to

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.460 
the place but I suppose it's just to
hold<00:06:03.020> them<00:06:03.200> on<00:06:03.289> there<00:06:03.530> so<00:06:05.050> yeah<00:06:06.050> that's<00:06:06.289> the

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
hold them on there so yeah that's the

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.279 
hold them on there so yeah that's the
belt<00:06:07.210> give<00:06:08.210> you<00:06:08.330> one<00:06:08.510> last<00:06:08.690> look<00:06:08.960> over<00:06:09.200> the

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
belt give you one last look over the

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:23.970 
belt give you one last look over the
whole<00:06:09.410> thing

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.390 

and<00:06:24.910> now<00:06:25.420> I<00:06:25.450> just<00:06:25.630> sort<00:06:26.110> of<00:06:26.170> show<00:06:26.380> you<00:06:26.440> the<00:06:27.130> size

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
and now I just sort of show you the size

and free male snaps and hopefully this

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.410 
and free male snaps and hopefully this
is<00:06:54.280> on<00:06:54.460> camera<00:06:56.130> they<00:06:57.130> just<00:06:57.160> line<00:06:57.550> them<00:06:57.670> up<00:06:57.790> so

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 
is on camera they just line them up so

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.910 
is on camera they just line them up so
this<00:06:58.930> is<00:06:58.990> like<00:06:59.200> watching<00:06:59.470> paint<00:06:59.620> dry

00:06:59.910 --> 00:06:59.920 
this is like watching paint dry

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.060 
this is like watching paint dry
there<00:07:00.010> we<00:07:00.070> go<00:07:00.400> got<00:07:00.670> mine<00:07:00.850> up<00:07:01.030> so<00:07:02.340> pretty<00:07:03.340> well

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070 
there we go got mine up so pretty well

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.350 
there we go got mine up so pretty well
that's<00:07:06.070> it<00:07:06.250> snapped<00:07:06.520> up<00:07:06.700> I<00:07:06.820> like<00:07:06.970> the<00:07:07.090> look<00:07:07.210> of

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 
that's it snapped up I like the look of

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.440 
that's it snapped up I like the look of
that<00:07:07.480> it's<00:07:07.750> pretty<00:07:07.960> nice<00:07:08.970> you<00:07:09.970> know<00:07:10.060> obviously

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:10.450 
that it's pretty nice you know obviously

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.270 
that it's pretty nice you know obviously
the<00:07:10.600> only<00:07:10.810> thing<00:07:10.990> is<00:07:11.110> is<00:07:11.350> the<00:07:11.530> lever<00:07:11.740> cut<00:07:12.010> here

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 
the only thing is is the lever cut here

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.150 
the only thing is is the lever cut here
around<00:07:12.990> main<00:07:13.990> plate<00:07:14.290> and<00:07:14.500> the<00:07:14.620> smaller<00:07:14.860> plates

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 
around main plate and the smaller plates

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.920 
around main plate and the smaller plates
is<00:07:15.280> a<00:07:15.310> bit<00:07:15.520> thick<00:07:15.790> but<00:07:16.060> it's<00:07:16.330> a<00:07:16.420> mini<00:07:16.600> bar<00:07:16.840> I

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:16.930 
is a bit thick but it's a mini bar I

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.610 
is a bit thick but it's a mini bar I
guess<00:07:18.150> bit<00:07:19.150> too<00:07:19.990> big<00:07:20.200> to<00:07:20.320> wear<00:07:20.440> on<00:07:20.500> your<00:07:20.560> wrist

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
guess bit too big to wear on your wrist

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.010 
guess bit too big to wear on your wrist
although<00:07:21.010> I<00:07:21.040> have<00:07:21.280> got<00:07:21.490> them<00:07:21.640> all<00:07:21.870> snapped<00:07:22.870> up

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.020 
although I have got them all snapped up

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.420 
although I have got them all snapped up
on<00:07:23.140> their<00:07:23.320> actual<00:07:23.620> snaps<00:07:24.010> rather<00:07:24.250> than

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430 
on their actual snaps rather than

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.180 
on their actual snaps rather than
tighter<00:07:24.910> they<00:07:25.270> can<00:07:25.420> go<00:07:25.570> tighter<00:07:25.840> so<00:07:26.740> that's

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:27.190 
tighter they can go tighter so that's

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.260 
tighter they can go tighter so that's
that<00:07:27.690> unsnapping<00:07:28.690> it's<00:07:28.870> pretty<00:07:29.080> well<00:07:30.270> and

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.270 
that unsnapping it's pretty well and

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.920 
that unsnapping it's pretty well and
that's<00:07:31.360> about<00:07:31.510> it

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930 
that's about it

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.310 
that's about it
so<00:07:32.140> I<00:07:32.170> hope<00:07:32.470> you<00:07:32.620> enjoyed<00:07:32.860> that<00:07:33.040> video<00:07:33.160> um<00:07:33.670> I

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.320 
so I hope you enjoyed that video um I

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.960 
so I hope you enjoyed that video um I
guess<00:07:35.320> I<00:07:35.440> was<00:07:35.590> very<00:07:35.740> lucky<00:07:35.980> to<00:07:36.100> get<00:07:36.550> my<00:07:36.700> hand<00:07:36.880> on

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:36.970 
guess I was very lucky to get my hand on

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.270 
guess I was very lucky to get my hand on
one<00:07:37.090> of<00:07:37.120> these<00:07:37.620> because<00:07:38.620> these<00:07:38.860> were<00:07:39.070> made<00:07:39.250> in

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 
one of these because these were made in

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.460 
one of these because these were made in
2001<00:07:40.030> with<00:07:40.270> the<00:07:40.360> original<00:07:40.750> replica<00:07:41.110> belts<00:07:41.380> I

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:41.470 
2001 with the original replica belts I

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.200 
2001 with the original replica belts I
believe<00:07:41.710> so<00:07:42.070> you<00:07:42.550> know<00:07:42.640> obviously<00:07:42.910> they<00:07:43.030> won't

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.210 
believe so you know obviously they won't

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.730 
believe so you know obviously they won't
make<00:07:43.330> them<00:07:43.480> to<00:07:43.660> double<00:07:43.810> hug<00:07:44.200> and<00:07:44.350> I<00:07:44.380> don't<00:07:44.590> even

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:44.740 
make them to double hug and I don't even

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.340 
make them to double hug and I don't even
think<00:07:44.890> they<00:07:44.980> make<00:07:45.480> big<00:07:46.480> Eagle<00:07:46.840> mini-boss

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:47.350 
think they make big Eagle mini-boss

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:48.900 
think they make big Eagle mini-boss
anymore<00:07:47.740> so<00:07:47.860> if<00:07:47.980> you<00:07:48.070> can<00:07:48.280> get<00:07:48.460> your<00:07:48.550> hands<00:07:48.820> on

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:48.910 
anymore so if you can get your hands on

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.790 
anymore so if you can get your hands on
one<00:07:48.970> of<00:07:49.120> these<00:07:49.240> it<00:07:49.480> would<00:07:49.570> be<00:07:49.660> very<00:07:49.810> good<00:07:49.960> very

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 
one of these it would be very good very

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.850 
one of these it would be very good very
