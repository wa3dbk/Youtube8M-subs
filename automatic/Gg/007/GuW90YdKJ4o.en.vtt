00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
like that I probably just hacked the

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.640 
like that I probably just hacked the
 out<00:04:39.000> this<00:04:39.240> world<00:04:39.480> and<00:04:39.810> this<00:04:40.290> is<00:04:40.470> what<00:04:40.620> I

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
 out this world and this is what I

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.060 
 out this world and this is what I
get<00:04:40.770> for<00:04:41.040> it<00:04:41.100> I<00:04:41.370> had<00:04:41.669> it<00:04:41.820> coming<00:04:41.850> so<00:04:42.950> there<00:04:43.950> you

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
get for it I had it coming so there you

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.379 
get for it I had it coming so there you
go<00:04:45.230> anyway<00:04:46.230> I<00:04:46.550> guess<00:04:47.550> I'll<00:04:47.729> make<00:04:47.940> cannons

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
go anyway I guess I'll make cannons

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.870 
go anyway I guess I'll make cannons
elsewhere<00:04:48.870> now<00:04:49.110> that's<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.889> last<00:04:50.130> sunset<00:04:50.490> in

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
elsewhere now that's the last sunset in

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.820 
elsewhere now that's the last sunset in
this<00:04:51.060> world<00:04:51.979> so<00:04:53.750> with<00:04:54.750> that<00:04:54.900> being<00:04:55.139> said<00:04:55.260> this

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
this world so with that being said this

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.990 
this world so with that being said this
