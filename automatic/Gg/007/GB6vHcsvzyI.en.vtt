00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 I welcome lovers of all iron 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.170
 and islands today under the heading hi from 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.969
 the USSR 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:16.619
 I would like to introduce you to the knife 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:22.380
 fisherman this knife was bought first 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.960
 half eighties by me I'm still then 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.939
 went to school very fond of fishing 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.649
 and I was attracted by this knife since he 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:38.219
 name knife fisherman means 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:40.680
 constructively it is made something similar 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.649
 on the moru here on the modern model 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.800
 for example mora fishing comfort 896 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.530
 he has a plastic sheath 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.860
 than he surprised me at that moment and 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:59.820
 now, too, that is, he has such 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.090
 very comfortable moments for the Soviet 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.090
 union it was very convenience 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.220
 use of any item left 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.960
 to the background so to the fore 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.210
 there was cheapness being advanced 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.270
 mass production yes here but here 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.620
 Here are some nuances like this 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.790
 triangle yes he 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.790
 thanks to him, you are there for yourselves. 1 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.390
 further what else do you need plastic here 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.590
 there is a belt clip 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:43.480
 Well, as the sea ​​is very similar to the sea 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:49.780
 the knife itself means here we have the price of 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:58.660
 he was five rubles this moment 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:02:07.660
 it was pretty expensive steel means here 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:09.340
 stainless either 4012 or 65 x 12 to 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.770
 it was clear this is something 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.070
 either s 420 modern or 440 i.e. 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.460
 I can’t determine exactly here 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.460
 we have 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.480
 inscription 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.590
 stainless steel 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.860
 she is a little blurry read stamps 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:44.790
 and denev that is to become really 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:47.790
 stainless in size then we are now 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.790
 measure 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:03:01.800
 his handle is about a hundred 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:08.160
 thirty five millimeters blade length 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:11.459
 about 15 blades like tammy downs 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.380
 clearly audible 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.260
 Well, that is, the riza has a good part of it 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:22.170
 there is this so-called fisherman knife 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:25.300
 Now it is positioned as a filet nickname 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.380
 that is, we have to catch a fish afterwards 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.840
 must be cut accordingly 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.720
 fillet to do that is to say he owes it 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.200
 help and therefore generally fishing 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:43.230
 in should help 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:47.160
 structurally plastic handle means 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.530
 the blade itself is glued in the handle somewhere here 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.370
 by this here is the distance he's captured on 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.299
 epoxy 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.540
 but not broke like all he had 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:04.540
 working on the handle can still be said 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:10.260
 what is under the finger grooves here 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:15.120
 accordingly so that he does not slip out 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:18.489
 such as slots 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.100
 Respectively from fish work very 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.110
 slippery all this should help 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:29.280
 so here too there are these 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.350
 accordingly so that the knife does not slip out 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:38.210
 what else does interestingly mean to him 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:42.080
 the moment it was unusual is he supplied 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:45.090
 a container of us so called this 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.550
 emergency reserve here 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.910
 Focus I would like to show here I am review 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.880
 I make a knife in my hands like this 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.520
 I open this container 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:04.560
 so poured them some water that is, he 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:08.010
 completely sealed so if you 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.160
 there something put water will not get 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:17.130
 container respectively as a child there I 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:21.140
 lied the hooks of the fishing line there is something else now 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:24.710
 I'd probably put some matches 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:29.479
 SLR for them there is a thread with a needle 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:32.639
 Well, what is needed is it suddenly 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.979
 will need it next to no and she will 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:40.260
 lie here if even you 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:43.950
 our drop the water then everything will not get wet 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:47.340
 will be dry what else is interesting 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:52.620
 tried it checked means tightness 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.960
 this container here it is if you drop 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.700
 him in the water 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.479
 this knife will swim like this 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:04.110
 about here and so stuck out of the water like 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:06.479
 float and respectively red 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.450
 cork cap she will you 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.550
 point she rush you his eyes 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:16.020
 pick up because if you float on 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:19.160
 the boat is likely to lose this knife 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:23.129
 sense of dropping water is very easy it 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.889
 that's why it was also for 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:29.220
 I'm surprised it's me by the way now 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:31.949
 thought about it and now tried 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:36.979
 really swims it what it holds 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:41.370
 water if these thoughts didn't come to me 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:44.310
 that means what struck him when 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:48.120
 bought he was very stupid 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:50.870
 he was very hard to drag now 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.880
 stood tidied cuts perfectly 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:57.389
 by the way tidied up with will give 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:00.080
 video glasses you about him and about her probably 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:04.169
 already seen that is toast point works 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:08.280
 it may be hard to live about what's such 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:12.080
 Obzorchik wanted to make for you to new 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.080
 goodbye
