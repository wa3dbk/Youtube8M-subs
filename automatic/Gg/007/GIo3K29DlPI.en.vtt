00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:33.379
 hello welcome to the world of linda today 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.699
 I'm going to show you how to prepare a 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:40.719
 delicious flan Neapolitan very easy as well 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.039
 that then receive me for dad 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.769
 those are the materials that we are going to 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.010
 use for the preparation of this 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.010
 delicious 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.710
 I already have everything ready to show you 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.309
 the step by step in this video 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.690
 we need a blender too and the 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.690
 materials that I already taught 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.640
 in the blender we are going to add 4 eggs 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.650
 we're going to add a can to those eggs 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.840
 full of condensed milk if you want 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.410
 that is more of diet because you put a 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.090
 low condensed milk sugar or is 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.090
 with 50% less sugar 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.800
 then we're going to add in a box 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.390
 evaporated milk or a milk can 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.390
 evaporated the one of your choice 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.979
 I'm going to add a quarter of cheese 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.979
 philadelphia 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.350
 oh yes where you live there is no cheese 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.680
 philadelphia because you can put cheese 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.680
 cream 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.850
 and we are going to put a teaspoon of 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.850
 vanilla 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.310
 and ready 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.230
 we proceed to liquefy it for about 5 or 10 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.510
 minutes for all the ingredients 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.510
 incorporate very well 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.090
 while let's go read when we can go 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.600
 preparing the mold where we are going to 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:37.730
 put our plan in this case I covered 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.730
 my mold with cajeta or arequipa 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.480
 they can be very very generous 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.180
 and lis is my mold ready to 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.980
 incorporate the mixture so that they are not 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.690
 is going to be a hole in the background for the 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.730
 strength of the mix I suggest that 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.160
 put a spoonful teaspoon of 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.140
 stick and let the mixture fall on it 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.140
 so they do not damage the bottom of the mold 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.210
 in a pot we put to heat water and 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.670
 we can catch our mold with paper 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.800
 aluminum with the opaque part towards the 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.810
 plan and the bright part out 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.650
 so that it helps us produce a lot 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.650
 much more heat 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.720
 already with our plan covered I'm going to 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.840
 help with some laces or laces 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.280
 to hold our mold and be able to 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.140
 put in the hot water without burning 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.030
 because this plan is going to be prepared in a bathroom 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.170
 de marÃ­a without an oven, we're going to do it in 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.050
 the super comfort of our case 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.450
 already put the mold in the hot pot 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.239
 we remove the laces with care 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.120
 our mold is already inside the pot 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:01.230
 with hot water does not go up top goes 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.709
 until half of our mold there already 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:08.310
 see how the water is boiling and what 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.709
 we left for an hour like that was already my 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.650
 plan if they were offered to remove the water as 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:17.720
 it happened to me by on a plate towards a 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.280
 side and they drop the water so they are 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.930
 filling the pot with water and in asking 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.470
 the water between the flan that is not going of year 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.470
 the recipe 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:34.390
 and ready after one hour of cooking 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:37.000
 we have left a delicious flan 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.940
 We hope to cool cools 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.610
 moss and ready a delicious dessert for 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.860
