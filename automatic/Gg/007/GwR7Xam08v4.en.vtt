00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.120
 to send us to the corner and when I 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.700

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.360
 history of having the average but not 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.340
 to have the same note lower than 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.780
 valentin him is the intellectual that I 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.700
 departure is on time it's him he is 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.170
 empty on hand and he 's in the process of 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.940
 broom in his Basque copy normally 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.460

 nothing via the note tony 0 to copy on his 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:54.550
 fellow valentine high school good it was a 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.310
 other period but I think level 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.690
 fun one of the best courses 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:04.420
 from French to high school because it was 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.280
 just and makes it but really I believe 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.990
 that idea that you can not even imagine 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.350
 not everything we did in the room 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.030
 and the teacher that you know nothing feet on 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.210
 the table the music thoroughly 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.260
 the Greeks are at the table the boulevard the 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:22.360
 bull of a fearsome 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.800
 you see and the teacher he does not care 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.190
 not that he knows who they do not care 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.600
 and we just did not care about him 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.170
 knew it was an hour when he was 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.960
 like that 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:35.950
 the black gold we had never 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.970
 quietly control quiet guy 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.580

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.590
 it was all too well these two bodies 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.820
 French pomp a little like that for me 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.900
