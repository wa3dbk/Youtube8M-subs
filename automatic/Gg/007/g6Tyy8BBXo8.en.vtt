00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
I use the dark brown and I I kind of

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.220

fade<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.059> past<00:00:57.059> city<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.449> what<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.629> don't<00:00:57.780> know

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
fade the past city of what I don't know

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.660

if<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.350> said<00:00:58.530> right<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.160> thirty<00:00:59.340> eight<00:00:59.460> percent

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
if I said right to thirty eight percent

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.760 
if I said right to thirty eight percent
because<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.840> raise<00:01:00.989> our<00:01:01.199> way<00:01:01.320> up<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.620> looks

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
because if you raise our way up it looks

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.030 
because if you raise our way up it looks
way<00:01:02.250> too<00:01:02.280> dark<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:04.320> giving<00:01:04.650> some<00:01:04.799> little

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
way too dark and giving some little

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.190 
way too dark and giving some little
raccoon<00:01:05.309> eyes<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> said<00:01:06.630> gave<00:01:06.780> him<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> three

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
raccoon eyes so I said gave him a three

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.020 
raccoon eyes so I said gave him a three
percent<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.280> seems<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.549> blend<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.880> pretty

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
percent and it seems to blend in pretty

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.010 
percent and it seems to blend in pretty
well<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:10.350> saw<00:01:10.850> made<00:01:11.850> one<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.540> copy<00:01:12.869> it

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.260 
well I just saw made one and I copy it
now<00:01:13.290> mates<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.740> other<00:01:13.860> later<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:15.000> other<00:01:15.090> one

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
now mates the other later the other one

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.920 
now mates the other later the other one
I<00:01:15.299> used<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.920> little<00:01:16.920> eyebrow<00:01:17.130> looking<00:01:17.930> emblem

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930

brown<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.049> think<00:01:25.500> I've<00:01:25.590> faded<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> opacity

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
brown and I think I've faded the opacity

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.179 
brown and I think I've faded the opacity
to<00:01:26.580> sixty<00:01:27.210> nine<00:01:27.360> percent<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.560> did<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> copy

to sixty nine percent and I did a copy

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.149 
to sixty nine percent and I did a copy
and<00:01:29.579> flip<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.150> do<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> other<00:01:30.689> eyes<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.110> that

and flip to do to the other eyes so that

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.780 
and flip to do to the other eyes so that
exactly<00:01:32.159> mimicked<00:01:34.009> for<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> eyes<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> actually

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
greed and to make a stretch out that

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.609 
greed and to make a stretch out that
much<00:02:03.180> he<00:02:03.329> actually<00:02:03.630> have<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.930> use<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> free

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
much he actually have to use a free

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.649 
much he actually have to use a free
scale

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
scale

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.199 
scale
you<00:02:07.469> can<00:02:07.619> make<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.890> however<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.459> want<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.879> but

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
you can make it however you want it but

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.750 
you can make it however you want it but
just<00:02:09.840> don't<00:02:10.019> overdo<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.160> make<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.400> too<00:02:11.550> thin

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
just don't overdo it to make it too thin

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.360 
just don't overdo it to make it too thin
or<00:02:11.910> too<00:02:11.940> fat<00:02:12.239> cuz<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.599> know<00:02:12.720> he<00:02:12.840> has<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.959> little

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
or too fat cuz you know he has a little

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.920 
or too fat cuz you know he has a little
small<00:02:14.370> nose<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.269> got<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.480> make<00:02:15.599> it<00:02:15.750> just

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
small nose but you got to make it just

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.020 
small nose but you got to make it just
right<00:02:16.349> so<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.650> almost<00:02:17.099> connects<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.670> both<00:02:17.790> eyes

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
right so it almost connects to both eyes

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.710 
right so it almost connects to both eyes
and<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:20.010> went<00:02:20.250> ahead<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.430> copied<00:02:21.299> that<00:02:21.450> too

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
and I went ahead and copied that too

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.369 
and I went ahead and copied that too
over<00:02:21.959> here<00:02:22.019> and<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.620> used<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.330> black<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.720> I

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
over here and I used the black and I

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.740 
over here and I used the black and I
used<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.680> opacity<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.190> 24<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.540> gives<00:02:27.660> it

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
used the opacity to 24 so it gives it

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.759 
used the opacity to 24 so it gives it
that<00:02:27.780> nice<00:02:28.019> shade<00:02:28.349> on<00:02:28.500> his<00:02:28.620> nose<00:02:29.629> um<00:02:30.680> for<00:02:31.680> the

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
too thick like that kind like that and I

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.210 
too thick like that kind like that and I
use<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.079> him<00:03:34.910> link<00:03:35.910> them<00:03:36.060> below<00:03:37.220> the

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
use that to him link them below the

I<00:03:43.230> actually<00:03:44.230> used<00:03:44.590> them<00:03:44.739> again<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.310> do<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.939> 3d

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
I actually used them again to do the 3d

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.250 
I actually used them again to do the 3d
effect<00:03:46.930> on<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.170> lenses<00:03:48.510> in<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.750> user<00:03:49.959> here

just a regular round square for his lens
and<00:03:55.329> I<00:03:55.510> copied<00:03:56.379> it<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:56.650> I<00:03:56.709> made<00:03:57.489> it<00:03:57.519> smaller<00:03:59.549> to

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
and I copied it and I made it smaller to

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.960 
and I copied it and I made it smaller to
give<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.629> that<00:04:01.659> blue<00:04:01.989> lens<00:04:02.670> makes<00:04:03.670> it<00:04:03.819> the
