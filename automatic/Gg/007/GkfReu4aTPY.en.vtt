to use this machine and it'll be really

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.990 
to use this machine and it'll be really
nice<00:00:13.469> particularly<00:00:14.160> when<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.370> use<00:00:14.549> your<00:00:14.759> own

to<00:00:17.070> do<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.699> take<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> bowl<00:00:18.240> like<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.510> we'll<00:00:19.470> put

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
to do is take a bowl like this we'll put

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.550 
to do is take a bowl like this we'll put
in<00:00:19.800> our<00:00:19.949> sugar<00:00:20.660> about<00:00:21.660> three<00:00:21.960> quarters<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
in our sugar about three quarters of a

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.450 
in our sugar about three quarters of a
cup<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.100> then<00:00:24.090> we<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.619> one<00:00:25.619> vanilla<00:00:26.039> bean

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.700 
cup and then we have one vanilla bean
the<00:00:26.730> insides<00:00:27.180> from<00:00:27.449> one<00:00:27.599> vanilla<00:00:27.779> bean<00:00:28.170> will

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the insides from one vanilla bean will

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.769 
the insides from one vanilla bean will
use<00:00:28.890> our<00:00:29.039> whisk<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.550> scrape<00:00:29.970> all<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.599> in

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
start whisking this together and then we

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.350 
start whisking this together and then we
have<00:00:42.149> two<00:00:42.450> cups<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.140> heavy<00:00:43.829> cream<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:45.239> is

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
all organic so we just want to whisk

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.660 
all organic so we just want to whisk
this<00:00:51.600> stuff<00:00:52.020> up<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> buying<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.460> won't

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
this stuff up to the buying it we won't

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.459 
this stuff up to the buying it we won't
put<00:00:53.879> any<00:00:54.000> strawberries<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.870> until<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.320> ice

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
put any strawberries in it until the ice

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.240

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
cream starts to firm up and you could

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.360 
cream starts to firm up and you could
certainly<00:00:59.670> use<00:00:59.820> one<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.329> those<00:01:01.370> hands

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
certainly use one of those hands

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.009 
certainly use one of those hands
spinning<00:01:02.789> ice<00:01:02.940> cream<00:01:03.210> machines<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.899> to

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
spinning ice cream machines we have to

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.289 
spinning ice cream machines we have to
use<00:01:04.170> rock<00:01:04.500> salt<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.189> ice<00:01:05.339> those<00:01:05.729> work<00:01:05.970> fine

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
use rock salt and ice those work fine

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.660 
use rock salt and ice those work fine
but<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.170> case<00:01:07.409> I've<00:01:07.650> got<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.040> really<00:01:08.400> nice

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
but in this case I've got a really nice

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.090 
but in this case I've got a really nice
machine<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.080> has<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> compressor<00:01:10.890> right

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
machine and it has a compressor right

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.260 
machine and it has a compressor right
inside<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.840> that's<00:01:13.049> all<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.409> need<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.799> do<00:01:14.270> we'll

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
inside so that's all we need to do we'll

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.920 
inside so that's all we need to do we'll
take<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.020> carefully<00:01:16.590> pour<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.930> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
take this and carefully pour it in the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.740 
take this and carefully pour it in the
ice<00:01:19.110> cream<00:01:19.470> maker<00:01:19.759> and<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.450> want<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> be

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
ice cream maker and you want to be

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.030 
ice cream maker and you want to be
careful<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.259> get<00:01:22.650> all<00:01:22.950> those<00:01:23.310> vanilla<00:01:23.640> seeds

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
careful to get all those vanilla seeds

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.210 
careful to get all those vanilla seeds
so<00:01:26.299> we'll<00:01:27.299> turn<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.570> over<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.880> scrape<00:01:29.880> them<00:01:30.060> in

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
so we'll turn it over and scrape them in

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.730 
so we'll turn it over and scrape them in
and<00:01:31.670> now<00:01:32.300> you<00:01:32.360> take<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:32.960> which<00:01:33.380> is<00:01:33.530> called

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
and now you take this which is called

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.150 
and now you take this which is called
the<00:01:33.920> dasher<00:01:34.810> put<00:01:35.810> it<00:01:35.930> in<00:01:36.050> there<00:01:36.320> hopefully<00:01:37.070> it

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
the dasher put it in there hopefully it

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.000 
the dasher put it in there hopefully it
will<00:01:37.280> stand<00:01:37.640> up<00:01:37.960> take<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.200> top<00:01:41.860> just<00:01:42.860> like

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
will stand up take the top just like

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.640 
will stand up take the top just like
that<00:01:43.160> this<00:01:44.090> like<00:01:44.480> I<00:01:44.600> said<00:01:44.660> has<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.020> compressor

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
that this like I said has a compressor

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.590 
that this like I said has a compressor
in<00:01:45.800> it<00:01:45.920> it'll<00:01:46.100> take<00:01:46.280> about<00:01:46.430> 35<00:01:47.030> minutes<00:01:47.330> so

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
in it it'll take about 35 minutes so

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.450 
in it it'll take about 35 minutes so
we'll<00:01:47.750> turn<00:01:47.960> it<00:01:48.020> on<00:01:48.200> I'll<00:01:48.680> show<00:01:49.010> you<00:01:49.070> it<00:01:49.250> looks

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
we'll turn it on I'll show you it looks

00:01:49.460 --> 00:02:02.770 
we'll turn it on I'll show you it looks
like<00:01:49.670> in<00:01:50.000> 35<00:01:50.450> minutes<00:02:00.730> okay<00:02:01.730> our<00:02:02.000> ice<00:02:02.270> cream<00:02:02.540> is
