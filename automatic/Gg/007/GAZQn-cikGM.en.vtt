00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.499
 hello good in the previous video les 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.269
 I said that I was going to show you how 

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:09.730
 kingdoms worked and how to get 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:11.080
 the dragon that is one of the most titans 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.660
 important that we are going to get in 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.160
 this game 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.200
 and this time I'm going to show you how 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.570
 get the dragon and other details 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.480
 important that I have discovered measured 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.699
 and come playing 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.530
 well on the map we can find a 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.260
 campaign that is not multiplayer 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.600
 It called for finding forever 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.600
 the dragon is called forever here we can 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.060
 see all these points all are 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.680
 battles to get the dragon 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.860
 we have to spend all these 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.170
 battles until you reach the latter the 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.150
 first battles are going to be 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.190
 relatively easy 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.100
 the latter these two that are before 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.720
 of the last one are the only ones that I 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.400
 they made it a bit difficult for me at the level of 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.190
 troops that he had at the time he comes 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.170
 face it and the last one is the one that 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.940
 has been scary because I said here I'm going to 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.449
 come to be stamped on a wall but 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.310
 it's easy enough why 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.469
 in this battle we simply can not 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.960
 face the dragon and with only that we 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:12.760
 let's take one let's say two units of 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.970
 ballester as 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.520
 and two units 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.409
 of lips of manager 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.820
 I'll show you each one later 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.850
 of the troops 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.570
 we can easily beat the dragon and 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.940
 get it to put an extra in 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.740
 our village 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.760
 when we have already won it 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.070
 will appear here in 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.010
 in defense I think it appears to us 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.470
 the nest appears so that it will be placed 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.080
 here in any part of the village that 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.700
 We want to have a world to serve 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.970
 for defense is only going to serve us for 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.700
 have the dragon and to be able to take it to 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.250
 the battle another of the utilities that 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.630
 many great ones still know that he has and 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.230
 that I just discovered 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:05.800
 and it has a similar function 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.740
 to the actuary in the sanctuary 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.080
 we choose which one will be the titan that 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.760
 let's take the battle to be able 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.490
 use the three powers that killed them that 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.730
 do them in the previous video in this 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.960
 level you had had we chose that dragon 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.950
 we are going to carry because I have just discovered 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.030
 what 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:32.660
 if you win another titan that is of the type 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.060
 dragon for example I won 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.870
 in one of the chests this titan that 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.250
 call in seeing cloud and being a dragon if 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.250
 I give him to choose at the level 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.620
 l understood 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:53.200
 it goes by bill and it appears in see clear 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.730
 appears as a replacement what it means 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.590
 that when in battle 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.799
 and whoever is going to appear to fight is going to 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.510
 be this dragon and it will not be strong 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.710
 in the previous one I showed you in the video 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.840
 previous a battle 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.640
 and where it is strong 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.190
 it was the one he had selected in the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.090
 nest and now I'm going to another color 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.090
 Now I 'm going to show it to you 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.030
 the dragon that is going to appear is going to be the 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.830
 that I just selected 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.920
 as you see here in the bottom part is 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.290
 I can give you change troops but only now 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.480
 I can only change 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.670
 the smaller troops I can not change 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.640
 the Dragon 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.110
 well let's attack with this dragon to 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.660
 see how it because I did not used 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.480
 still for battle since I prefer the 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.459
 another for its freezing power good 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.370
 let's enter the same as last time 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.510
 as I said we're going to go into the in the 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.510
 part that can do us more harm 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.520
 to avoid problems 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.750
 ah 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.750
 how to accelerate the legs 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.890
 two 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.350
 well here you can see that the powers 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.210
 that I was using were the deformed 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.400
 it was the one he had selected in the 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.249
 sanctuary to come but as in the 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.259
 nest had the other dragon selected 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:52.419
 it was the one that appeared on the other side ikea 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.609
 flying to attack then the 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.569
 sanctuary will serve us to choose 

00:04:54.609 --> 00:05:01.059
 the powers that titan need in 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:03.909
 the battle and the nest to choose what 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:08.189
 dragon is going to come to battle then 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:08.189
 they are quite different 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.870
 let's see 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.870
 the last 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.610
 well that's basically how it works 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.860
 tried 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.099
 just to select the dragons 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.659
 now how many dragons can we have 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:32.310
 so far so far I only have 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:35.660
 two but 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.689
 here we can see where are we going to see 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.460
 here are the titans 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:42.740
 everyone 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.940
 I currently have about nine 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:50.270
 titans 2 are dragons that are ford bill 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:53.120
 in seeing clan and apparently until the 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.710
 moment we can only have this other 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.540
 dragon 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.820
 that by its classification of epic 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.080
 I suppose it's going to be much more powerful 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.660
 that in fertile berkeley 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.870
 but winning 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:12.330
 to be able to see how powerful 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:14.670
 according to what has been said now, he hopes that 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.160
 be only 18 titans but increase 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:20.280
 quite the amount of titans 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.810
 so it's possible that we have more than 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.730
 three dragons 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.260
 soon he will be explaining how 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.990
 the kingdom works I hope you have them 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.550
 liked the video and have found what 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.740
 who were looking to subscribe to see more 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.820
 videos soon I will be uploading 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.820
 thank you for your visits
