early<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> season<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:19.170> was<00:01:19.820> it<00:01:20.820> was<00:01:21.030> shown

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
early in the season it was it was shown

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.390 
early in the season it was it was shown
as<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.479> had<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> bit<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.869> bite<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.200> him<00:01:22.350> which<00:01:23.220> was

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
as it had a bit of bite to him which was

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.770 
as it had a bit of bite to him which was
surprising<00:01:23.820> because<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.420> thought<00:01:24.570> he<00:01:24.689> was

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
surprising because I thought he was

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.120 
surprising because I thought he was
gonna<00:01:24.869> be<00:01:24.960> fairly<00:01:25.320> lightweight<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:25.979> he's

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
gonna be fairly lightweight but he's

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.490 
gonna be fairly lightweight but he's
actually<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.670> fairly<00:01:27.090> big<00:01:27.330> lot<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.750> he's<00:01:28.290> got<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
actually a fairly big lot and he's got a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.440 
actually a fairly big lot and he's got a
bit<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.770> aggression<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.250> him<00:01:29.369> he's<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.299> he's

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
bit of aggression in him he's and he's

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.510 
bit of aggression in him he's and he's
just<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.869> quality<00:01:31.470> footballer<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> things

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.550 
he literally forced these things to
happen<00:01:38.670> because<00:01:38.970> he<00:01:39.180> doesn't<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.630> do<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> pass

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
happen because he doesn't just do a pass

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.440 
happen because he doesn't just do a pass
to<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> passing<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:42.210> did<00:01:42.299> two

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
to a passing and be like just did two

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.210 
to a passing and be like just did two
passes<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.229> makes<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> pass<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.860> he<00:01:43.950> makes<00:01:44.070> a

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
passes it makes the pass and he makes a

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.649 
passes it makes the pass and he makes a
move<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.640> that's<00:01:45.030> what<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.210> really<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.630> about

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
move and that's what I really like about

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.050 
move and that's what I really like about
him<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.200> think<00:01:46.259> if<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:47.100> had<00:01:47.250> two<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:47.880> three

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
him and I think if you had two or three

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.359 
him and I think if you had two or three
more<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.170> midfield<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:50.189> would

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
more like that in the midfield we would

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.100 
more like that in the midfield we would
completely<00:01:50.970> dominate<00:01:51.360> games<00:01:51.540> he's<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> only

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
completely dominate games he's the only

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.780 
completely dominate games he's the only
one<00:01:52.290> that's<00:01:52.320> currently<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.100> locking<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.729> that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
one that's currently on locking in that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.789 
one that's currently on locking in that
final<00:01:54.600> third<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.079> us<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.409> think<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.710> when

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
final third for us and I think and when

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.499 
final third for us and I think and when
he's<00:01:55.950> been<00:01:56.159> moved<00:01:56.399> back<00:01:56.610> we've<00:01:57.149> seen<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
he's been moved back we've seen the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.819 
he's been moved back we've seen the
effect<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.020> had<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.409> score<00:01:58.649> line

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
effect that it's had on the score line

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.850 
effect that it's had on the score line
under<00:01:59.640> Herrera<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.119> me<00:02:00.240> has<00:02:00.420> been<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.860> surprise

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
under Herrera for me has been a surprise

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.280 
under Herrera for me has been a surprise
but<00:02:02.280> also<00:02:02.520> not<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> surprise<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.170> he's

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
but also not a surprise and he's

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.230 
but also not a surprise and he's
definitely<00:02:04.560> my<00:02:04.979> clodia<00:02:05.460> what<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> love<00:02:06.119> about
