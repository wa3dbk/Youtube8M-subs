last<00:01:41.009> year<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.310> think<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:42.180> big<00:01:42.390> factor<00:01:42.750> was

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
last year I think the big factor was

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.780 
last year I think the big factor was
like<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.470> heat<00:01:43.680> played<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> huge<00:01:44.100> factor<00:01:44.549> I

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
like the heat played a huge factor I

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.770 
like the heat played a huge factor I
mean<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.119> don't<00:01:45.210> want<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.450> make<00:01:45.509> any<00:01:45.720> excuses

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
mean I don't want to make any excuses

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.600 
mean I don't want to make any excuses
but<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.500> was<00:01:46.619> hard<00:01:46.829> going<00:01:46.979> from<00:01:47.250> zero<00:01:47.549> degrees

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
but it was hard going from zero degrees

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.440 
but it was hard going from zero degrees
to<00:01:48.119> 87<00:01:48.689> or<00:01:49.079> whatever<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.799> was<00:01:49.920> last<00:01:50.189> year<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:51.149> I

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
to 87 or whatever it was last year but I

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.330 
to 87 or whatever it was last year but I
think<00:01:51.780> last<00:01:52.619> year<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.829> went<00:01:52.979> out<00:01:53.040> pretty<00:01:53.220> hard

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
think last year I went out pretty hard

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.520 
think last year I went out pretty hard
also<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.360> kind<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.720> kind<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.259> drained

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
also so that I kind of kind of drained

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.740 
also so that I kind of kind of drained
me<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.159> think<00:01:56.460> I'm<00:01:56.700> not<00:01:56.850> conservative<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
me so I think I'm not conservative and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.840 
me so I think I'm not conservative and
not<00:01:58.409> trying<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.710> take<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> lead<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.340> just

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
not trying to take the lead just just

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.459
