00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
um i have it on 12 pounds of boost i

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.150 
um i have it on 12 pounds of boost i
hooked<00:04:23.900> up<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.169> wastegate<00:04:24.440> reference<00:04:24.949> I

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
hooked up the wastegate reference I

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.890 
hooked up the wastegate reference I
didn't<00:04:25.699> have<00:04:25.789> a<00:04:25.849> vacuum<00:04:26.030> line<00:04:26.300> long<00:04:26.510> enough<00:04:26.539> so

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
didn't have a vacuum line long enough so

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.390 
didn't have a vacuum line long enough so
what<00:04:27.020> I<00:04:27.050> did<00:04:27.139> is<00:04:27.289> I<00:04:27.410> put<00:04:27.560> rubber<00:04:27.770> hose<00:04:28.010> here<00:04:28.280> and

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
what I did is I put rubber hose here and

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.339 
what I did is I put rubber hose here and
then<00:04:28.490> this<00:04:28.610> is<00:04:28.789> push<00:04:29.419> lock<00:04:29.690> for<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:29.930> methanol

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
then this is push lock for the methanol

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:31.360 
then this is push lock for the methanol
and<00:04:30.500> runs<00:04:30.710> all<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:30.889> way<00:04:31.010> down<00:04:31.190> to<00:04:31.220> the

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
and runs all the way down to the

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.120 
and runs all the way down to the
wastegate<00:04:32.320> about<00:04:33.320> underneath<00:04:33.770> there

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
wastegate about underneath there

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.790 
wastegate about underneath there
somewhere<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.900> only<00:04:36.110> thing<00:04:36.229> I<00:04:36.320> need<00:04:36.380> to<00:04:36.530> do

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
now is put the fuel pump in it because

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.379 
now is put the fuel pump in it because
it's<00:04:39.500> out<00:04:39.620> of<00:04:39.650> fuel<00:04:39.889> pump<00:04:40.220> you<00:04:40.789> can't<00:04:41.030> go<00:04:41.150> over

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
it's out of fuel pump you can't go over

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.490 
it's out of fuel pump you can't go over
a<00:04:41.419> certain<00:04:41.599> amount<00:04:41.720> of<00:04:41.900> throttle<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.410> a

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
certain amount of boost that just starts

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.089 
certain amount of boost that just starts
running<00:04:44.090> lean<00:04:44.300> but<00:04:45.229> here's<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:45.530> forelady

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:08.659 
so we'll do the fuel pump and 40 late EE

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.409 
so we'll do the fuel pump and 40 late EE
and<00:05:09.139> the<00:05:09.320> converter<00:05:09.680> all<00:05:10.159> in<00:05:10.669> one<00:05:10.909> day<00:05:11.090> and

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
and the converter all in one day and

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.750 
and the converter all in one day and
then<00:05:11.979> crank<00:05:12.979> the<00:05:13.280> out<00:05:13.400> of<00:05:13.430> this<00:05:13.610> thing

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
then crank the out of this thing

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.279 
then crank the out of this thing
and<00:05:13.820> see<00:05:14.060> how<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:14.330> does<00:05:14.479> pretty<00:05:14.900> neat<00:05:15.139> the

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
and see how it does pretty neat the

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:15.920 
and see how it does pretty neat the
turbos<00:05:15.620> are

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
turbos are

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.490 
turbos are
blue<00:05:16.259> from<00:05:17.220> heat<00:05:17.960> drove<00:05:18.960> it<00:05:19.050> around<00:05:19.139> a<00:05:19.320> bunch

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
blue from heat drove it around a bunch

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.680 
blue from heat drove it around a bunch
of<00:05:19.590> times<00:05:19.650> working<00:05:20.280> on<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.460> tune<00:05:20.639> and<00:05:20.880> it's

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
of times working on the tune and it's

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.290 
of times working on the tune and it's
doing<00:05:21.900> really<00:05:21.930> good<00:05:22.380> so<00:05:23.180> other<00:05:24.180> than<00:05:24.240> that

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
doing really good so other than that

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.120 
doing really good so other than that
it's<00:05:24.479> ready<00:05:24.630> to<00:05:24.720> go<00:05:24.780> I<00:05:25.110> think<00:05:25.740> I'll<00:05:25.830> do<00:05:26.009> the

it's ready to go I think I'll do the

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.550 
it's ready to go I think I'll do the
methanol<00:05:26.550> kit<00:05:26.789> here<00:05:27.120> I<00:05:27.270> just<00:05:27.720> I<00:05:27.870> threaded<00:05:28.470> it

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
methanol kit here I just I threaded it

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.950 
methanol kit here I just I threaded it
and<00:05:28.650> tapped<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:29.070> I<00:05:29.160> just<00:05:29.190> put<00:05:29.490> a<00:05:29.520> piece<00:05:30.449> of<00:05:30.479> the

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
and tapped it I just put a piece of the

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.680 
and tapped it I just put a piece of the
push-lock<00:05:31.470> hose<00:05:31.889> and<00:05:32.250> then<00:05:32.370> capped<00:05:32.850> it<00:05:33.090> for

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
push-lock hose and then capped it for

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.360 
push-lock hose and then capped it for
now<00:05:33.780> so<00:05:34.020> it<00:05:34.080> doesn't<00:05:34.320> leak<00:05:34.470> it<00:05:34.979> would<00:05:35.100> really

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
now so it doesn't leak it would really

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.999 
now so it doesn't leak it would really
leak<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:35.789> much<00:05:36.000> boost<00:05:36.270> but<00:05:36.630> I<00:05:36.870> did<00:05:37.800> it<00:05:37.919> anyway

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
leak that much boost but I did it anyway

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.150 
leak that much boost but I did it anyway
and<00:05:38.490> then<00:05:38.820> I<00:05:38.970> will<00:05:39.320> install<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.440> methanol<00:05:40.889> kit

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.180 
drill the bottom out it goes all the way
down<00:05:45.900> to<00:05:46.050> hear<00:05:46.320> it<00:05:46.380> holds<00:05:46.620> like<00:05:46.710> almost<00:05:46.979> two
