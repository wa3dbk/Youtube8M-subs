 In Mexico there are all the ingredients that were later delivered 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:23.949
 because I discovered in Peru 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.680
 once it was worth having assumed a wealth of flavors and aromas and essences of 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.599
 traffickers species 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.930

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.580
 they dictate complete 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.530

 p in the kitchen in Argentina and Chile where they will join the kitchen 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.610
 from costa rica p the cuisine of colombia the closest relatives 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.560

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.520
 cases of mexico 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.520
 until they did not see or better that I did not discover the possible 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.309
 ricky the producers 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:01.299
 we already get the doctors products to be able to make it possible 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.520

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.749
 of different Mexican chili to achieve the favor 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.449
 the east our Peruvian seasoning but not always maintaining the stimuli 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.969
 so using Mexican inputs 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:25.180
 but there are some products but we are importing for example 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.520
 for dessert it is impossible to make it with a fruit 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.379
 gamal a theme that we are bringing age blame she 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.509

 despite the stoppage altogether pisco is Peruvian 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.340
 the grape brandy that arrives late pique col is a brave to play 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:07.180
 his name is omitted by the end of a street in a city south of the day 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.680
 plus 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.169
 that is called pisco d in this place is that it is original name 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:16.469
 of this brandy ee uu aa that is now hilario many years ago the area and 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.810
 emblematic of Peru and that accentuates the cocktails and the famous physical flavor 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.309
 but we have in the second dock 

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:27.899
 on that occasion kg alcohol I think the cheapest and unable in c-lm with the 

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:29.400
