simply just take the wide end and we

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.280 
simply just take the wide end and we
pass<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.340> back<00:01:29.549> through<00:01:30.000> again<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:33.780> now<00:01:33.960> we've

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
pass it back through again so now we've

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.719 
pass it back through again so now we've
made<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> larger<00:01:35.040> knot<00:01:35.220> than<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.549> normally

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
made a larger knot than we normally

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.469 
made a larger knot than we normally
would<00:01:36.000> have<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> full<00:01:36.840> Windsor<00:01:38.479> then
