driving<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:13.980> an<00:00:14.129> RC<00:00:14.429> circuit<00:00:15.139> because<00:00:16.139> I'm

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
driving on an RC circuit because I'm

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.640 
driving on an RC circuit because I'm
three<00:00:16.710> times<00:00:16.950> a<00:00:17.100> week<00:00:17.280> at<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.520> she<00:00:17.910> club<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.650> yes

great are the aluminium
I<00:00:46.199> felt<00:00:46.590> shock<00:00:46.980> absorbers<00:00:47.629> there<00:00:48.629> are<00:00:49.250> yes

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
I felt shock absorbers there are yes

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.119 
I felt shock absorbers there are yes
perfectly<00:00:52.160> for<00:00:53.160> using<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.960> roads<00:00:55.260> another

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
perfectly for using but on roads another

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.580 
perfectly for using but on roads another
upgrade<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.239> removed<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> plastic

upgrade is that I removed the plastic
chorim<00:00:58.980> chef<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.670> aluminium<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.989> did<00:01:01.949> it

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
chorim chef for aluminium one I did it

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.420 
chorim chef for aluminium one I did it
this<00:01:02.550> one<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> make<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.690> powerful<00:01:04.199> engine<00:01:04.739> when<00:01:05.400> I

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
this one I make a powerful engine when I

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.210 
this one I make a powerful engine when I
put<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.910> in<00:01:06.090> then<00:01:06.870> the<00:01:07.110> best<00:01:07.560> upon<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.040> gonna

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
put it in then the best upon is gonna

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.070 
put it in then the best upon is gonna
break<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.970> isn't<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.900> is

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
break and this isn't because this is

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.330 
break and this isn't because this is
much<00:01:10.650> better<00:01:11.090> material<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:13.100> it's<00:01:14.100> also

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
much better material and it's also

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
much better material and it's also
drives<00:01:14.759> very<00:01:14.970> well

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
drives very well

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.350 
drives very well
another<00:01:16.080> upgrades<00:01:16.799> are<00:01:17.100> some<00:01:17.549> ball<00:01:17.880> bearings

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
another upgrades are some ball bearings

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.960 
another upgrades are some ball bearings
you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:19.110> see<00:01:19.409> them<00:01:19.650> because<00:01:19.950> they<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.250> behind

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
you can see them because they are behind

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.710 
you can see them because they are behind
the<00:01:21.150> wheels<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> cables<00:01:22.700> they<00:01:23.700> yes<00:01:24.479> I

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the wheels and in the cables they yes I

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.530 
the wheels and in the cables they yes I
did<00:01:24.960> put<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> name<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:25.890> some<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:27.090> smoother

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
did put a name for some that smoother

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.980 
did put a name for some that smoother
driving<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.579> the<00:01:29.579> car<00:01:29.610> makes<00:01:30.090> about<00:01:30.450> no<00:01:30.659> noise

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
driving and the car makes about no noise

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.539 
driving and the car makes about no noise
when<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.560> Drive<00:01:31.950> very<00:01:32.220> fast<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:35.340> gone

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
when I Drive very fast so and it's gone

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.539 
when I Drive very fast so and it's gone
a<00:01:35.579> little<00:01:35.880> bit<00:01:36.119> faster<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:36.930> I'm<00:01:37.890> also<00:01:38.159> thinking

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
a little bit faster so I'm also thinking

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.260 
a little bit faster so I'm also thinking
about<00:01:38.970> putting<00:01:39.630> another<00:01:39.799> motor<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.430> this

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
about putting another motor in it this

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.230 
about putting another motor in it this
is<00:01:42.420> still<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> stock<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.729> think<00:01:44.790> I'm

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
is still the stock one and I think I'm

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.130 
is still the stock one and I think I'm
gonna<00:01:45.420> put<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> 25<00:01:46.950> turns<00:01:47.310> engine<00:01:47.610> or<00:01:48.030> 23<00:01:48.869> turns

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
gonna put a 25 turns engine or 23 turns

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.850 
gonna put a 25 turns engine or 23 turns
engine<00:01:49.549> with<00:01:50.549> 25<00:01:51.450> turns<00:01:51.869> engine<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.649> it's

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
engine with 25 turns engine I think it's

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.730 
engine with 25 turns engine I think it's
go<00:01:53.040> about<00:01:53.810> 7000<00:01:54.810> or<00:01:54.930> faster

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
go about 7000 or faster

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.109 
go about 7000 or faster
alright<00:01:56.689> 23<00:01:57.689> turns<00:01:58.409> engine<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.890> think<00:01:58.920> about<00:01:59.399> 12

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
alright 23 turns engine I think about 12

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.249 
alright 23 turns engine I think about 12
months<00:02:00.420> no<00:02:00.630> faster<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:02.299> think<00:02:03.299> I'm<00:02:03.659> gonna<00:02:03.990> do

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
months no faster so I think I'm gonna do

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.279 
months no faster so I think I'm gonna do
that<00:02:04.500> very<00:02:04.710> soon<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.539> for<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> upgrades

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
that very soon so this for the upgrades

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.580 
that very soon so this for the upgrades
for<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:07.710> far<00:02:08.149> as<00:02:09.149> Casilla<00:02:09.600> got<00:02:09.899> still<00:02:10.170> many

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
for so far as Casilla got still many

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.050 
for so far as Casilla got still many
reserve<00:02:11.130> wheels<00:02:11.960> I<00:02:12.960> don't<00:02:13.530> use<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.980> old<00:02:14.130> one

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
reserve wheels I don't use the old one

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.229 
reserve wheels I don't use the old one
they<00:02:15.270> actually<00:02:16.020> don't<00:02:16.800> have<00:02:17.160> much<00:02:17.610> grip<00:02:18.000> it's

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
they actually don't have much grip it's

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.250 
they actually don't have much grip it's
like<00:02:19.110> drifting<00:02:19.709> in<00:02:19.830> every<00:02:20.099> corner<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:21.260> this

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
like drifting in every corner and this

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.030 
like drifting in every corner and this
one<00:02:22.560> are<00:02:22.739> just<00:02:22.770> two<00:02:23.340> times<00:02:23.610> better

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
one are just two times better
