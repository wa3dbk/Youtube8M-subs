storms<00:01:47.229> rolling<00:01:47.500> through<00:01:47.650> it<00:01:48.040> was<00:01:48.159> cold<00:01:48.490> so

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
storms rolling through it was cold so

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.910 
storms rolling through it was cold so
we've<00:01:49.270> still<00:01:49.450> got<00:01:49.630> really<00:01:50.080> stained<00:01:50.470> water

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
even though it's starting to warm up in

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.990 
even though it's starting to warm up in
temperature<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.530> fish<00:01:53.740> are<00:01:53.920> moving<00:01:54.040> in<00:01:54.400> so

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
temperature the fish are moving in so

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.969 
temperature the fish are moving in so

baits<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.580> springtime<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.150> jerk<00:02:31.450> bait<00:02:31.690> I

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
baits in the springtime the jerk bait I

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.320 
baits in the springtime the jerk bait I
guess<00:02:33.040> what<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.220> like<00:02:33.460> about<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.850> jerk<00:02:34.060> bait<00:02:34.210> is

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
guess what I like about the jerk bait is

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.930 
guess what I like about the jerk bait is
you<00:02:34.450> can<00:02:34.630> cover<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:34.990> lot<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.560> water<00:02:35.770> but<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.760> can

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
you can cover a lot of water but you can

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.790 
you can cover a lot of water but you can
also<00:02:37.090> really<00:02:37.840> slow<00:02:38.230> down

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
also really slow down

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.470 
also really slow down
so<00:02:38.890> once<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.220> find<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.880> fish<00:02:40.090> you're<00:02:40.330> not

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
so once you find the fish you're not

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.510 
so once you find the fish you're not
just<00:02:40.720> flying<00:02:41.230> through<00:02:41.500> them<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:42.190> can<00:02:42.340> work

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
just flying through them you can work

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.100 
just flying through them you can work
that<00:02:42.760> bait<00:02:42.940> quickly<00:02:43.480> but<00:02:43.660> once<00:02:43.840> you're<00:02:43.990> on<00:02:44.020> a

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
that bait quickly but once you're on a

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.200 
that bait quickly but once you're on a
school<00:02:44.380> of<00:02:44.500> fish<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:45.280> can<00:02:45.460> really<00:02:45.940> slow<00:02:46.180> down

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
school of fish you can really slow down

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.260 
school of fish you can really slow down
just<00:02:46.600> rip<00:02:46.840> pause<00:02:47.280> rip<00:02:48.280> rip<00:02:48.490> pause<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.120> just

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
just rip pause rip rip pause and just

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.120 
just rip pause rip rip pause and just
wait<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.810> know<00:02:49.930> wait<00:02:50.080> two<00:02:50.380> seconds<00:02:50.890> five

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
wait you know wait two seconds five

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.580
