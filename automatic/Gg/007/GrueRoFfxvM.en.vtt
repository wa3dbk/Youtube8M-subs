00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.950 
realized I have a screen bottom board on
this<00:00:13.830> box<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.429> stuck<00:00:15.330> my<00:00:15.480> head<00:00:15.570> under<00:00:15.719> there

this box so stuck my head under there

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.439 
this box so stuck my head under there
and<00:00:16.019> I<00:00:16.199> could<00:00:16.349> see<00:00:16.590> up<00:00:17.039> both<00:00:17.460> sides<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
and I could see up both sides of the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.829 
and I could see up both sides of the
frame<00:00:19.349> but<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.769> eggs<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.339> there's<00:00:20.880> plenty

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:21.839 
frame but the eggs that there's plenty

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.829 
frame but the eggs that there's plenty
of<00:00:21.869> be<00:00:22.349> activities<00:00:23.689> hopefully<00:00:24.689> they're

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:24.839 
of be activities hopefully they're

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:30.109 
of be activities hopefully they're
looking<00:00:25.140> after<00:00:25.439> those<00:00:25.560> eggs<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:29.059> producing<00:00:30.059> a

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
looking after those eggs and producing a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:01:16.690 
looking after those eggs and producing a
new<00:00:30.149> queen

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.330 

haven't<00:01:17.390> seen<00:01:17.570> any<00:01:17.719> more<00:01:18.200> bees<00:01:18.530> going<00:01:19.100> back

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
haven't seen any more bees going back

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.920 
haven't seen any more bees going back
into<00:01:19.579> the<00:01:19.729> end<00:01:19.969> of<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.149> hive<00:01:20.299> and<00:01:20.689> saw<00:01:20.899> that

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
into the end of the hive and saw that

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.490 
into the end of the hive and saw that
one<00:01:21.289> be<00:01:21.500> yesterday<00:01:22.270> but<00:01:23.270> haven't<00:01:24.049> seen<00:01:24.259> any

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
one be yesterday but haven't seen any

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:51.110 
one be yesterday but haven't seen any
more<00:01:25.990> stories<00:01:26.990> coming<00:01:27.229> here<00:01:27.740> as<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:27.979> can<00:01:28.039> see

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.810 

so<00:01:51.660> I<00:01:51.690> could<00:01:51.990> see<00:01:52.170> breathes<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.280> under

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
so I could see breathes going in under

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.180 
so I could see breathes going in under
the<00:01:53.940> current<00:01:54.180> layer<00:01:54.570> but

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
the current layer but

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.160 
the current layer but
I<00:01:56.280> think<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.940> screen<00:01:57.180> mesh<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.810> just

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
I think the screen mesh is just

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.470 
I think the screen mesh is just
squashed<00:02:00.040> in

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:34.740 

spicer<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.620> kind<00:02:06.860> of<00:02:06.950> should<00:02:07.100> get<00:02:07.250> back<00:02:07.490> in

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.630 

keep<00:02:35.170> an<00:02:35.320> eye<00:02:35.410> on<00:02:35.440> on<00:02:35.950> them<00:02:36.190> for<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.400> rest<00:02:36.490> of

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
keep an eye on on them for the rest of

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.830 
keep an eye on on them for the rest of
the<00:02:36.730> day<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:38.500> know<00:02:38.590> how<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.740> goes
