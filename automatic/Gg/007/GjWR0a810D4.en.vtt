two<00:05:49.160> locks<00:05:49.310> apart<00:05:49.670> but<00:05:50.330> is<00:05:50.480> this<00:05:50.630> that's<00:05:51.200> right

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
two locks apart but is this that's right

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.660 
two locks apart but is this that's right

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
going to be a loose natural for poly

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.390 
going to be a loose natural for poly
anywhere<00:06:43.790> between<00:06:43.910> three<00:06:44.680> months<00:06:45.680> to<00:06:45.890> maybe<00:06:46.220> a

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
anywhere between three months to maybe a

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.130 
anywhere between three months to maybe a
year<00:06:46.670> probably<00:06:47.000> no<00:06:47.420> more<00:06:47.450> than<00:06:47.660> a<00:06:47.810> year<00:06:47.840> though

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.140 
year probably no more than a year though

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.100 
year probably no more than a year though
and<00:06:48.440> then<00:06:49.100> go<00:06:49.250> back<00:06:49.280> to<00:06:49.490> latch<00:06:49.790> unlocking<00:06:50.420> love

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
and then go back to latch unlocking love

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.160 
and then go back to latch unlocking love
them<00:06:51.320> smaller<00:06:51.710> I<00:06:52.190> am<00:06:52.850> probably<00:06:53.390> going<00:06:53.960> to

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.170 
them smaller I am probably going to

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.690 
them smaller I am probably going to
latch<00:06:54.590> them<00:06:54.860> whenever<00:06:55.040> you<00:06:55.220> want<00:06:55.280> from<00:06:55.550> you

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700 
latch them whenever you want from you

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.980 
latch them whenever you want from you
that's<00:06:55.880> just<00:06:55.910> the<00:06:56.150> fastest<00:06:56.510> way<00:06:56.540> to<00:06:56.630> give<00:06:56.840> this

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
that's just the fastest way to give this

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.900 
that's just the fastest way to give this
to<00:06:57.410> stay<00:06:57.830> probably

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:58.910 
to stay probably

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.490 
to stay probably

I've<00:07:03.500> been<00:07:03.680> kind<00:07:03.860> of<00:07:03.920> thinking<00:07:03.980> about<00:07:04.250> maybe

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
I've been kind of thinking about maybe

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.410 
I've been kind of thinking about maybe
like<00:07:07.070> mess<00:07:07.280> around<00:07:07.430> with<00:07:07.640> two<00:07:07.760> strand<00:07:08.030> twists

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:08.420 
like mess around with two strand twists

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.060 
like mess around with two strand twists
and<00:07:08.570> seeing<00:07:08.870> you<00:07:09.020> know<00:07:09.080> sometimes<00:07:09.710> I<00:07:09.860> can<00:07:10.010> how

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.070 
and seeing you know sometimes I can how

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.850 
and seeing you know sometimes I can how
to<00:07:10.130> get<00:07:10.280> get<00:07:11.120> in<00:07:11.210> my<00:07:11.360> head<00:07:11.510> that<00:07:11.690> size<00:07:12.650> is

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860 
to get get in my head that size is

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.440 
to get get in my head that size is
everyone<00:07:13.130> so<00:07:13.370> maybe<00:07:13.550> doing<00:07:13.790> some<00:07:13.970> small<00:07:14.240> two

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:14.450 
everyone so maybe doing some small two

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.480 
everyone so maybe doing some small two
strand<00:07:14.720> twists<00:07:15.020> to<00:07:15.080> see<00:07:15.230> 25<00:07:15.470> x<00:07:15.650> one<00:07:15.680> and<00:07:16.040> then

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.490 
strand twists to see 25 x one and then

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.100 
strand twists to see 25 x one and then
if<00:07:16.640> that<00:07:16.910> works<00:07:16.940> out<00:07:17.270> just<00:07:17.390> keeping<00:07:17.780> those<00:07:17.870> it
