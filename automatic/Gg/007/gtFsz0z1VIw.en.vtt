00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.929
 for this project we need rule 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.670
 indelible marker and cutter the sweets and 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.230
 chocolates with those who are going to fill 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.230
 the box an acetate 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.020
 and the mold that can be obtained in my 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.210
 facebook page tiny thani 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.840
 the first thing they are going to do is print 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.840
 Template 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.720
 and tracing it on a piece of cardboard 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.150
 so they can use it several times 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.550
 now we are going to position it in our 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.940
 acetate sheet letter size if they put it 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.650
 well it will not fit is bigger if it 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.600
 they realize 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.300
 so what they have to do is 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.450
 put it diagonally to fit 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.760
 totally when it is already in the way 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.630
 in which they fit the acetate let's start 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.630
 to mark it 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.360
 As you can see I have already marked the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.560
 outline so the next thing we're going 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.560
 to do is cut it 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.560
 now with the help of our rule and the 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.560
 cutter let's make the slot 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.870
 and we do the same thing on the other side 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.890
 now let's take a tip or something 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.720
 sharp but do not cut and we're going to 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.600
 mark the doubles we just go to 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.160
 gather these points and in the center we 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.160
 it's going to have to be a square 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.670
 we are also going to mark this fold and 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.670
 this fold 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.830
 and we bend out 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.210
 and these we bend inwards 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.290
 it's almost ready, we're just going to 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.660
 take a cotton with a little alcohol 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.670
 to be able to clean both the surface 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.670
 how to erase the lines of the marker 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.910
 now to assemble the box is very very 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.790
 very easy 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.790
 let's take these two up 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:08.670
 those who have the little eyelash and we carry 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.670
 one of these we assembled here in 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:18.440
 and here we are going to put our candy or 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.250
 chocolates and then we're just going to 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.250
 finish closing 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.180
 and you only have to decorate for 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.240
 decorate we can use stamps we can 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.400
 use slats and monkeys even 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.470
 we can do the acetate meetings with 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.900
 the acetate that was left over from all the 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.000
 shores is also a good idea to 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:50.810
 decorate see looks super good 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.200
 but this I'm going to decorate with a 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.200
 stamp 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.730
 and a nice 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.730
 What do you think 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.020
 and so we finish these beautiful boxes and 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.970
 this is the last special of san 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.530
 valentine so I hope you tell me 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.720

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:24.139
 Transparent mini acetate pins 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.569
