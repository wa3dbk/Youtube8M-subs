lift<00:01:36.570> as<00:01:36.750> well<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.770> start<00:01:37.950> with

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
lift as well so I like to start with

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.069 
lift as well so I like to start with
volume<00:01:38.520> all<00:01:38.759> over<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.240> I'm<00:01:39.360> building<00:01:39.570> an<00:01:39.750> updo

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
volume all over if I'm building an updo

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.530 
volume all over if I'm building an updo
so<00:01:40.680> go<00:01:41.100> ahead<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.369> spray<00:01:41.909> either<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> get

side take the clip out of the hair that

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.780 
side take the clip out of the hair that
you<00:04:27.080> divide<00:04:27.350> it<00:04:27.500> off<00:04:27.620> earlier<00:04:28.010> and<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:28.550> can<00:04:28.700> do

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
you divide it off earlier and you can do

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.280 
you divide it off earlier and you can do
one<00:04:28.940> of<00:04:28.970> two<00:04:29.090> things<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.600> can<00:04:29.840> do<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.020> regular

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
one of two things you can do a regular

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.620 
one of two things you can do a regular
braid<00:04:30.530> and<00:04:31.010> then<00:04:31.639> just<00:04:31.850> bring<00:04:32.030> that<00:04:32.180> over<00:04:32.360> and

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
braid and then just bring that over and

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.570 
braid and then just bring that over and
incorporate<00:04:33.080> it<00:04:33.200> into<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:33.530> updo<00:04:33.860> or<00:04:34.130> you<00:04:34.460> can

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
incorporate it into the updo or you can

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.400 
incorporate it into the updo or you can
do<00:04:34.669> a<00:04:34.700> fishtail<00:04:34.970> today<00:04:35.870> for<00:04:36.110> something

to<00:05:09.840> finish<00:05:10.020> it<00:05:10.170> will<00:05:10.530> end<00:05:10.650> up<00:05:10.740> taking<00:05:10.920> this<00:05:11.220> out

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
to finish it will end up taking this out

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.000 
to finish it will end up taking this out
before<00:05:11.610> you<00:05:11.850> pin<00:05:12.060> it<00:05:12.090> but<00:05:12.840> what<00:05:13.560> I<00:05:13.620> want<00:05:13.800> you<00:05:13.920> to

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
so it doesn't look so tight and it will

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.990 
so it doesn't look so tight and it will
fit<00:05:19.950> in<00:05:20.070> a<00:05:20.190> little<00:05:20.400> bit<00:05:20.490> better<00:05:20.610> with<00:05:20.790> the<00:05:20.820> up

a good placement for it put a few pins
in<00:05:47.880> it<00:05:48.030> and<00:05:48.240> then<00:05:48.420> don't<00:05:48.540> forget<00:05:48.720> to<00:05:48.960> take<00:05:49.140> out

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.660 

and<00:06:25.470> then<00:06:26.470> to<00:06:26.590> finish<00:06:26.740> I'm<00:06:27.070> going<00:06:27.130> to<00:06:27.340> use<00:06:27.490> the

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:27.670 
and then to finish I'm going to use the

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.210 
and then to finish I'm going to use the
big<00:06:27.820> sexy<00:06:28.090> hair<00:06:28.240> spring<00:06:28.780> play<00:06:29.080> hairspray<00:06:29.590> this

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
big sexy hair spring play hairspray this

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.120 
big sexy hair spring play hairspray this
is<00:06:30.460> a<00:06:30.790> firm<00:06:31.660> hold<00:06:31.990> but<00:06:32.290> it's<00:06:32.440> a<00:06:32.560> little<00:06:33.040> bit

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
is a firm hold but it's a little bit

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.590 
is a firm hold but it's a little bit
flexible<00:06:33.310> and<00:06:33.820> has<00:06:33.940> a<00:06:33.970> little<00:06:34.180> bit<00:06:34.330> of<00:06:34.420> give<00:06:34.570> in

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
flexible and has a little bit of give in

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.720 
flexible and has a little bit of give in
it<00:06:34.960> so<00:06:35.230> it's<00:06:35.800> not<00:06:36.010> the<00:06:36.160> kind<00:06:36.310> of<00:06:36.370> hairspray

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.730 
it so it's not the kind of hairspray

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.130 
it so it's not the kind of hairspray
that<00:06:36.760> once<00:06:37.060> you<00:06:37.150> spray<00:06:37.480> you're<00:06:37.690> just<00:06:37.990> gonna

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
that once you spray you're just gonna

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.660 
that once you spray you're just gonna
have<00:06:38.290> to<00:06:38.320> wait<00:06:38.710> through<00:06:39.010> it<00:06:39.130> to<00:06:39.280> get<00:06:39.430> it<00:06:39.550> out

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
have to wait through it to get it out

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.730 
have to wait through it to get it out
and<00:06:39.970> I<00:06:40.180> like<00:06:40.450> that<00:06:40.660> about<00:06:40.720> the<00:06:41.050> hairspray<00:06:41.530> I

prefer<00:06:42.430> to<00:06:42.580> use<00:06:42.610> a<00:06:42.760> firm<00:06:43.120> hold<00:06:43.300> hairspray<00:06:43.600> and

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
prefer to use a firm hold hairspray and

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.770 
prefer to use a firm hold hairspray and
do<00:06:44.560> light<00:06:44.890> soft<00:06:45.400> layers<00:06:45.760> of<00:06:46.090> it<00:06:46.240> then<00:06:46.480> really

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780 
do light soft layers of it then really

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.380 
do light soft layers of it then really
focus<00:06:47.710> it<00:06:47.890> too<00:06:48.070> closely<00:06:48.370> so<00:06:48.910> make<00:06:49.090> sure<00:06:49.120> you're

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.390 
focus it too closely so make sure you're

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.420 
focus it too closely so make sure you're
holding<00:06:49.720> your<00:06:49.810> arm<00:06:50.050> a<00:06:50.380> little<00:06:51.070> bit<00:06:51.190> further

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
holding your arm a little bit further

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.700 
holding your arm a little bit further
away<00:06:51.610> than<00:06:51.940> probably<00:06:52.390> you<00:06:52.540> would<00:06:52.930> think<00:06:53.230> when

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
away than probably you would think when

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.200 
away than probably you would think when
you're<00:06:53.830> spraying<00:06:54.130> hairspray<00:06:54.310> so<00:06:54.700> you<00:06:55.000> don't

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
you're spraying hairspray so you don't

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.690 
you're spraying hairspray so you don't
get<00:06:55.330> that<00:06:55.480> concentrated<00:06:56.170> jet<00:06:56.470> stream<00:06:56.860> but

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:57.700 
get that concentrated jet stream but

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.490 
get that concentrated jet stream but
enough<00:06:58.480> to<00:06:58.750> where<00:06:58.900> you're<00:06:59.020> getting<00:06:59.290> a<00:06:59.350> nice

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
enough to where you're getting a nice

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:07.230 
enough to where you're getting a nice
veil<00:06:59.890> over<00:07:00.280> the<00:07:00.640> whole<00:07:00.790> updo<00:07:05.940> and<00:07:06.940> make<00:07:07.090> sure

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 
veil over the whole updo and make sure

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:16.620 
veil over the whole updo and make sure
you<00:07:07.330> spray<00:07:07.570> the<00:07:07.690> braids<00:07:07.870> too

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:16.630 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.180 

so<00:07:17.630> this<00:07:17.810> is<00:07:17.930> the<00:07:18.050> kind<00:07:18.170> of<00:07:18.290> updo<00:07:18.620> that<00:07:18.890> looks

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190 
so this is the kind of updo that looks

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.700 
so this is the kind of updo that looks
very<00:07:19.400> professionally<00:07:20.210> done<00:07:20.240> but<00:07:21.110> you<00:07:21.350> saw<00:07:21.530> how

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.710 
very professionally done but you saw how

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.500 
very professionally done but you saw how
basic<00:07:22.130> it<00:07:22.250> is<00:07:22.400> when<00:07:22.610> you<00:07:22.730> just<00:07:22.760> split<00:07:23.150> it<00:07:23.360> into

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:23.510 
basic it is when you just split it into

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.990 
basic it is when you just split it into
three<00:07:23.870> steps<00:07:24.170> and<00:07:24.500> if<00:07:25.250> you<00:07:25.280> haven't<00:07:25.730> tried<00:07:25.940> it

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 
three steps and if you haven't tried it

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.850 
three steps and if you haven't tried it
fishtailing<00:07:26.660> I<00:07:27.020> would<00:07:27.200> challenge<00:07:27.380> you<00:07:27.560> to<00:07:27.650> do

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:27.860 
fishtailing I would challenge you to do

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.220 
fishtailing I would challenge you to do
so<00:07:28.100> the<00:07:28.340> braid<00:07:28.550> is<00:07:28.730> safe<00:07:28.970> but<00:07:29.570> I<00:07:29.780> really<00:07:30.050> like

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:30.230 
so the braid is safe but I really like

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.690 
so the braid is safe but I really like
the<00:07:30.470> way<00:07:30.590> the<00:07:30.740> fishtail<00:07:31.130> it<00:07:31.280> adds<00:07:31.430> a<00:07:31.550> nice

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:31.700 
the way the fishtail it adds a nice

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.390 
the way the fishtail it adds a nice
amount<00:07:31.970> of<00:07:32.090> texture<00:07:32.540> and<00:07:32.750> sort<00:07:33.050> of<00:07:33.190> blends<00:07:34.190> in

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 
amount of texture and sort of blends in

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.430 
amount of texture and sort of blends in
nicely<00:07:34.460> with<00:07:35.030> that<00:07:35.180> initial<00:07:35.660> twist<00:07:35.930> that<00:07:36.320> we

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440 
nicely with that initial twist that we

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.040 
nicely with that initial twist that we
put<00:07:36.650> in<00:07:36.770> the<00:07:36.860> top<00:07:37.270> so<00:07:38.270> I<00:07:38.300> do<00:07:38.540> have<00:07:38.780> a<00:07:38.840> tutorial
