00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
against all the games will be done but a

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.120 
against all the games will be done but a
nice<00:00:17.850> first<00:00:18.390> up<00:00:18.630> very<00:00:19.260> tough<00:00:19.500> one<00:00:19.710> they<00:00:19.920> used

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130
