00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 what wave band here again the efe the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.730
 wine chat in this new tutorial of 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.649
 decoration and this time we are going to make a 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.750
 small built tutorial for these 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.519
 small sugarcane crops that 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.679
 the truth this tutorial first of all 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.690
 and a super important thing is just to 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.730
 crops that are going to be aesthetic to 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.890
 what do I mean with aesthetics I mean 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.660
 that they are not going to be able to change 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.369
 you are going to re-cultivate or nothing is to say 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.619
 you will not destroy us again from this 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.689
 way are you going to leave us as they are 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.730
 next way grown in three 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.260
 blocks so you 're going to leave it and if the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.450
 you do not really want to have a culture of 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.100
 this way, I recommend that you 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.230
 remove the video because this is a 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.690
 decoration tutorial for crops that 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.040
 they are going to leave how they are and no longer 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.260
 you're going to do nothing but it's pretty 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.719
 nice as for I do not know if that is is a 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.789
 very large construction although it is like this 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.980
 leave this little decoration since 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.320
 it looks pretty pretty and good what 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.239
 you have to do first of all that you should 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.460
 have a crop of any size in 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.170
 my case I have a 5 x 5 which is 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.440
 the smallest I think good there is another 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.140
 smaller that is the 3 x 5 that would be 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.210
 one here but good you're going to have to 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.710
 have a water groove 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.810
 clearly needed to be able to 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.510
 grow sugar cane is going to have 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.030
 to put a groove with water in the middle and 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.280
 they will be full if you can not leave 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.020
 without water anywhere they should be 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.970
 full to work for you if you're not going to 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.520
 cause total chaos and the truth is not 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.130
 we want that in no world now that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.899
 follow once done this let's put 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.880
 a block anywhere in the cane 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.979
 of sugar and you're going to put it now so 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.840
 the blocks above the water grooves 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.149
 in this way that they are here aligned 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.759
 with the water groove and now what's next 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.500
 well let's say suppose you have a 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.000
 row of 100 blocks and these 100 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.009
 blocks have cane crops 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.899
 sugar good if you want to apply this 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.600
 tutorial then what you have to do is 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.450
 the following you are going to have to fill 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.880
 all the cultivation avoiding putting blocks 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.920
 in the first block of the crop in this 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.810
 let's say if I had 100 in the block 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.300
 number 1 with culture you could not a 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.130
 block above and in block number 100 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.319
 or the last block you would not either 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.390
 doing the following structure that is 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.640
 this one that I'm showing on the screen 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.320
 Now, in this way, it would be 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.150
 now we would only put buckets of water 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.370
 on top of these blocks good rather 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.370
 below these 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.860
 and now it would be these crops of this 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.290
 way and I loved how it was 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.209
 love how it looks and tone but how do you 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.190
 I say this is only for aesthetics, not the 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.260
 you're going to play again because if you play them 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.000
 or destroy any block the water will 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.819
 goes there for all sides and will cause a 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.560
 total chaos and I really do not feel like it 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.959
 do that and I really liked it 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.739
 how it was and I recommend them very much 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.409
 this more than anything would be done more than 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.349
 everything in constructions since in 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:47.150
 constructions now yes very large 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.280
 things are not altered you leave them as 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.049
 they are already that way that gives them a 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.420
 more beautiful touch to these constructions 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.310
 but in cases of survival and things 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.049
 well unless you already have millions of 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.700
 sugar cane stakes then you can 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.620
 do this little tutorial but if you go 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.409
 to grow a lot of sugarcane and 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.909
 re-cultivate and cultivate it 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.780
 I really do not recommend you to do this 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:10.730
 This tutorial bone decoration and 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.730
 I had a stroke and I stayed 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.079
 as well then well then I hope that 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.139
 they liked the truth is a 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.790
 little thing that insignificant but 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.489
 for me it made me something very nice 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.409
 it looks pretty good and he wanted them 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.180
 share more than anything good if someone 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:30.230
 you want this structure that I just 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.959
 do here is more than anything left 7 x 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.950
 7 now so the fences the crop is 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.739
 5 x 5 and this would be 9 x 9 here 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.359
 this up here would be 5 and then 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.700
 nothing else closed day after day of the next 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.099
 way one more block becomes here 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.650
 up and still so here we would put 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.750
 fences to make it look a little better and 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.519
 so would everything but the truth 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.590
 I recommend that they do so in worlds in the 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.030
 which have constructions and not in worlds 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.099
 of survival because if you are not going to 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.139
 cause total chaos this decoration well 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.030
 that nothing I hope you liked that 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.859
 I have had a great time that always 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.200
 is the intention in all the videos and 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.819
 that if you can give a like comment or 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.829
 share the video I would appreciate it 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.480
 very much and that we will see each other until 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:16.090
 next channel video so I'm sending you 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.090
 a very big greeting we see you goodbye
