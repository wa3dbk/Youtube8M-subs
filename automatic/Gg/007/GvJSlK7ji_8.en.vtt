00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 without the ailing marc philippi 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.060
 from kl gold, the huskies went into the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.859
 Oberliga finals at the start 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.769
 guest was the well-known herner ev 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.259
 the fifth place finals for 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.910
 the huskies group qualified there 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.830
 every point plus in this mode 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.359
 could be painfully mittun the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.760
 huskies what the hour beaten 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.400
 So she arrived from the first bully 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.800
 Full throttle continues after nice preparation 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.230
 from metzinger and has black jerseys 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.519
 next to the first or fourth minute the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.279
 guidance on the racket 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.770
 The herner ev , however, hid in 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.989
 the initial phase did not last yesterday 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.700
 but always the overview after just under ten 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.110
 minutes it was finally over 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.030
 cut round against earned in front 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.980
 after wonderful preparation by manuel 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.020
 blade hit dry for hanka 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.000
 direct shot to the 10th 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.969
 Advantage is the huskies no chances 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.230
 more and contributed in excess 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.940
 four against three testify to a 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.800
 put on a powerful power play 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.930
 ettinger and blade met within 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.680
 47 seconds to 2 0 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.680
 and 13 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.000
 The break was even the 4 0, however 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.160
 happy in the emergence of costumes 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.170
 faked a bouncer from thomas 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.670
 kohler untenable from who thought that the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.220
 huskies after the clear leadership one 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.430
 switching back gears was deceiving 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.860
 the exact opposite was the case 23 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.140
 manuel blade scored in 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.450
 He is irresistible in front of the gate 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.050
 contributed to zero and only 26 seconds later 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.370
 met costumes under the latte for the 60th 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.900
 also the fast switching game 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.479
 The huskies worked on this 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.430
 evening was a brilliant example of this 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.140
 the genesis is only seven to zero after 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.150
 counter and input from chris 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.130
 had space metzinger only the 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.080
 stick to a racket and also simple 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.360
 Gates fell on this evening as well 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.640
 minute wet net hit sven valenti 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.979
 increased by rebound lingering shot 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.750
 at 18 o'clock at the latest from this 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.740
 At the time of this year something was said 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.390
 approach easier 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.370
 coach jÃ¼rgen rumrich put on four 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.530
 Storm rows and changing taxes around 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.510
 nine minutes somehow so no hit 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.850
 to alex angel outnumbered by the 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.950
 blue line the puck to the 0 0 in the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.720
 angle set and also the ps today 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.170
 strong manuel blade had not yet 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.420
 enough 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.160
 train after exactly 37 minutes over the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.680
 right wing of it and made per 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.180
 shallow shot the ten full the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.209
 conclusion under the second third 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.430
 put east and west shortly before 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.470
 thwarted birthday girl christa 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.780
 a triple advisor is still the best 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.130
 chance of the guests attack-like 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.230
 retreat of the huskies 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.600
 the german canadian to 11 10 0 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.310
 break of the evening we with 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.709
 Ladens will mr o ton or little 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.580
 should follow the last third 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.310
 make an early evening 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.350
 wolf went in and box for him 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.850
 certainly benefited from the fact that 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.340
 huskies now at least one course 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.540
 switched back and they still met 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.550
 twice in the stitches 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.830
 a 43 minutes landed 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.350
 fake shot at 12 10 o'clock 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.410
 mentor the cheap scored from short 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.570
 distance in the 57 minute number 13 and 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.760
 meanwhile uses twelve to one 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.950
 the overwhelming majority of people did not do much 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.239
 never the kassel huskies have that 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.700
 Backwind from last sunday 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.769
 taken along and with this clear 13 2 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.660
 1 victory to the final round of a 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.150
 defiance of the financial 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.310
 problems shown on Sunday will be 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.959
 then go on the journey to the 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.959
 Rostock piranhas to the baltic sea
