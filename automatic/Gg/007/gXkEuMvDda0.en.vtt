00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.610
 look for the partition where we have 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.060

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.130

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.640
 we give an intro 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.799
 asks us if we want to overwrite if 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.030

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.090
 we left successes 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.450
 and we are going to restart this again in 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.450
 our system 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.620
 well once we are already in 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:03.190
 the login as you can see 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.650

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:10.240

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.720
 control a being 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.430
 peace word 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.340
 2 and we give an intro 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.370
 this opens the window of users of 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.200
 user accounts ok then let's go to 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.799

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.799
 password 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.510
 very well here as in the video of 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.520
 windows vista preference already exists 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.040
 of each you can not put a new 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.630
 password or you can leave it blank and 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.990
 we give ok 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.730
 we close the window we leave the 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.830
 windows console 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.459
 and it is enough for us to press the button 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.459
 to enter 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.720
 As you can see it is very easy and it is not 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.290
 need to occupy any Linux distro 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.050
 not even another type of programs that 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.269
 they are very famous in the network but not 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.670
 finally we see that it is quite 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:23.010
 simple good I hope you in the blog
