let's<00:00:02.129> talk<00:00:02.340> about<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.820> use<00:00:03.000> of<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.360> tuning

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
let's talk about the use of the tuning

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.579 
let's talk about the use of the tuning
protocol<00:00:04.310> for<00:00:05.960> professional<00:00:06.960> development<00:00:07.080> of

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
protocol for professional development of

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.770 
protocol for professional development of
teachers<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.370> others<00:00:08.730> this<00:00:09.420> was<00:00:09.599> developed

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
teachers and others this was developed

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:20.080 
teachers and others this was developed
by<00:00:10.139> Joseph<00:00:10.620> McDonald<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.550> David<00:00:12.360> Allen

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.310 

let's<00:00:20.720> first<00:00:20.990> talk<00:00:21.200> about<00:00:21.260> some<00:00:22.160> background

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
let's first talk about some background

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.750 
let's first talk about some background
and<00:00:24.320> then<00:00:24.470> we'll<00:00:24.619> get<00:00:24.770> to<00:00:24.920> the<00:00:25.070> tuning

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
and then we'll get to the tuning

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.960 
and then we'll get to the tuning
protocol<00:00:26.180> itself<00:00:27.100> so<00:00:28.100> what<00:00:28.310> is<00:00:28.460> coaching

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
protocol itself so what is coaching

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.620 
protocol itself so what is coaching
coaching<00:00:29.630> was<00:00:29.990> originally<00:00:30.590> designed<00:00:31.150> to<00:00:32.150> be<00:00:32.390> a

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
now what did the researcher of Joyce and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.730 
now what did the researcher of Joyce and
showers<00:01:16.340> find<00:01:16.690> well<00:01:17.690> they<00:01:17.899> found<00:01:18.229> that<00:01:18.590> the
