00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
it these days of course this kind of

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.750 
it these days of course this kind of
competitions<00:02:31.230> are<00:02:31.440> very<00:02:31.710> really<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.400> level

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
competitions are very really the level

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.430 
competitions are very really the level
is<00:02:32.880> really<00:02:33.090> really<00:02:33.390> high<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.260> said

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
is really really high and like you said

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.760 
is really really high and like you said
a<00:02:34.500> lot<00:02:34.740> of<00:02:34.830> NBA<00:02:35.160> players<00:02:36.080> participated<00:02:37.080> there

a lot of NBA players participated there

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.260 
a lot of NBA players participated there
so<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:39.290> think<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.890> was<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.130> good<00:02:41.400> test<00:02:41.610> for<00:02:41.790> me<00:02:42.030> too

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
so I think it was a good test for me too

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.150 
so I think it was a good test for me too
but<00:02:42.680> it's<00:02:43.680> not<00:02:43.800> really<00:02:44.280> how<00:02:44.840> like<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.920> can

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
but it's not really how like you can

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.820 
but it's not really how like you can
really<00:02:47.400> understand<00:02:47.910> how<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.210> really<00:02:49.170> how

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
really understand how the really how

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.890 
really understand how the really how
really<00:02:50.250> high<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.760> level<00:02:51.060> until<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:51.630> get

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
really high is the level until you get

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.720 
really high is the level until you get
here<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.260> know<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.680> mean<00:02:53.070> everybody<00:02:53.310> keeps

players now in the NBA like you say it's

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.460 
players now in the NBA like you say it's
Yanis<00:03:26.700> it's<00:03:26.910> an<00:03:27.090> asus<00:03:27.450> it's<00:03:27.630> my<00:03:27.780> cell<00:03:28.080> but<00:03:28.260> it's

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
Yanis it's an asus it's my cell but it's

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.229 
Yanis it's an asus it's my cell but it's
also<00:03:28.650> like<00:03:28.980> Kosta<00:03:29.400> Koufos<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.910> Nick<00:03:30.030> Calathes

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
also like Kosta Koufos and Nick Calathes

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.890 
also like Kosta Koufos and Nick Calathes
in<00:03:30.510> Memphis<00:03:31.010> so<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.580> don't<00:03:33.209> think<00:03:33.300> that<00:03:33.420> Greece

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
in Memphis so I don't think that Greece

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.080 
in Memphis so I don't think that Greece
has<00:03:33.930> before<00:03:34.590> like<00:03:34.770> five<00:03:35.070> Greek<00:03:35.520> guys<00:03:35.760> in<00:03:36.000> the

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
has before like five Greek guys in the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.030 
has before like five Greek guys in the
NBA<00:03:36.390> so<00:03:36.750> that's<00:03:36.959> where<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.440> mean<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.770> the<00:03:37.860> same

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
NBA so that's where I mean in the same

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.640 
NBA so that's where I mean in the same
time<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:39.600> think<00:03:39.750> that's<00:03:40.020> very<00:03:40.290> important

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
time and I think that's very important

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.400 
time and I think that's very important
for<00:03:40.680> our<00:03:41.250> Greek<00:03:41.610> basketball<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.360> for<00:03:43.290> our

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
for our Greek basketball and for our

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.250
