00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
 ap 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.950
 everything 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.950
 So 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.889
 as part of the transition to modern 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.869
 economy companies are increasingly having to 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.089
 collide 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:17.189
 with growth 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:18.300
 pc costs 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.929
 with increasing costs, absolutely any 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.140
 production sites with growth 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.509
 costs on the market loksa cost increase 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.769
 so it seems to me that these are just words and 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:29.439
 of this connection in order to survive in 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:30.579
 competitive struggle 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.660
 companies need to be in rubles 

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.630
 qualities of final consumers 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.260
 it is on the one hand and on the other hand also 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.410
 employees own more 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.750
 active in the production process 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.800
 product it to us all levels it can 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.670
 be like 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.180
 the simplest options 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.880
 probably enough known in format 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.620
 custom contest when people 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.019
 proposed for example 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.230
 product purchase development 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.280
 and much more complicated much more 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.810
 interesting and much more useful for 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.070
 company options 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.260
 for example 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.970
 interest history from start comstar survived 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.490
 states there is a network for visitor which 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.540
 conclusions he's called on starbucks pavement 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.690
 and grandfathers com 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.230
 in the capital in the framework of the campaign visited any 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.510
 what visitor is not 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.800
 may come leave an idea for improvement 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.020
 job seekers 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.270
 anything it can be changes niu 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.020
 change of decoration as 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.520
 and will not change the gamma and behavior 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.110
 attendant staff and then there 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.570
 like all other visitors 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.630
 coffee shops get the opportunity to go 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.250
 writing network or capital idea either 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.660
 appreciate what you saw by assigning them absolutely 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.660
 simple own system either ok 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.990
 every week the company assesses 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.700
 and which 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.180
 india collected the most like that 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.370
 ratings good 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.590
 really embodies the drake which on 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.110
 can actually translate since 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.720
 it is clear that some amount of ideas 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.700
 how beautiful they were 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.850
 refinement process embodied 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.670
 sleep that you can make it real 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.580
 embodies then reports 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.540
 daily we monthly format 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.439
 in front of the community members 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.830
 allows the company not only and even 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.320
 probably not so much 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.229
 feedback from their 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.140
 consumers 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.979
 and realize 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.120
 how much is the most important form in 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.279
 loyalty educational programs 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:17.729
 as it is known to man is much more interesting 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.739
 about myself and in that sense the company 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.189
 which is ready to show people that 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:21.879
 she is 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.790
 tends to change tends to change 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.279
 accordance with their aspirations 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:26.959
 consumers will undoubtedly be 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.650
 worth broom far more success than 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.680
 campaign back and flexible 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.090
 the boat company is not ready 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.950
 transform companies that 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.370
 most essentially demonstrates 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.650
 consumers are ready to report as 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.210
 minimum 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.689
 at the same time 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.999
 well worth noting and in increasing 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.299
 the importance of employee engagement is pretty 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.229
 You can often hear the opinion that 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:49.249
 story concerning the end fascination 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:51.069
 consumers rather specific 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.400
 seriously limited in terms of spheres 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.629
 industry and wreck 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.129
 yes so for example you can often hear that he 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.939
 say there 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:58.829
 percent 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.769
 resource extraction is enough 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.769
 resource extraction market more difficult 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.420
 apply this kind of practice 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.310
 nevertheless jsc mostotrest 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.080
 appeal to quite interesting and and in general 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.029
 narrow circles known case 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:14.079
 given the professors so cattle 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.099
 We will come out in his book Vitya hinting people 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.129
 Canadian stories 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.389
 gold mining company which 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.110
 mines exhausted 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.700
 that is, you need the key itself 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.810
 gutter hours 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.900
 this is followed by the arm of the company response 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.639
 on a graphic survey of the area 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.319
 supposedly lived the geologists 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.579
 Service offered to everyone to satisfy 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.179
 companies suggest and mark it on the map 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:36.429
 one place harder poet those who 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:37.539
 versed in the article 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.919
 topographic data in baku on the map 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.419
 points where to mine gold after 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.579
 analyzed the resulting data 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.199
 began to mine all the points that were 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.559
 most often indicated 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.889
 which is significant yes there was gold and more 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:50.939
 addition made minority 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.080
 shareholders of all 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.430
 who rendered to these points 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.349
 Speaking at the evening whose Russia 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.839
 it is really reasonable to assume 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.059
 what 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.639
 many casus companies are not flexible enough 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.739
 for applying this kind of practice 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:05.599
 manager 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.880
 xii for making these kinds of decisions 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.440
 Of course you need to note that it will tame 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.320
 single swallows of this kind already 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.440
 appear but of course 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.090
 Predominantly Russian division from 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.550
 national corporations in 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.840
 particular you can remember the story 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.070
 let's say from the site than yes and the story of beer 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.900
 billions and with a number of other brands 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.370
 which are never human and 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.330
 consumers 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.629
 process at least developing and 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:30.030
 appearance 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.290
 then the car who will doubt the cans 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.790
 Alcohol products subject 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.139
 like such cases actually 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.100
 more and more as for 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.270
 full engagement 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.940
 people in some kind there twice easy 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.970
 anjors process yes for now 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:45.930
 of course 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.050
 so far there is no such thing though if 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.050
 we say look at 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.560
 in the education industry we will see that everything 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.090
 more her great popularity 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.279
 are gaining 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.319
 nicknames form no other day which 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:00.649
 formed within what is called k 

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:02.770
 deceased 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.530
 and the resources of the crowd really show anyone 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.389
 for example though with genuine reservations 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.770
 already said Moscow school 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.370
 business which is very actively developing 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.039
 possible additional 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.349
 programs where essentially any person 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:15.320
 possessing there 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.449
 some kind of knowledge about 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.409
 areas and in particular business and 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.559
 psychology can come in principle to you 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:22.639
 hobby to grow 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.039
 rector of schools disposable and and there on 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.319
 throughout the whole series of lectures 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.129
 Well, yes it is generally enough to show 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.099
 No reported due to another very important 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:33.889
 trend is seriously irreplaceable in 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.179
 Education which in general Council of Ministers 

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:37.719
 happens as a chain 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:39.279
 standardization response 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:41.899
 way what is the urgency that we are bologna 

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:42.580
 process 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.409
 It is generally understood that the topic is for a separate 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.860
 no one to discuss but somehow but 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.050
 as the number grows 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.449
 private universities and 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:51.930
 not even as much as the whole 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.319
 chillie wait wait to communicate in polarity 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.800
 Czech face formation battalion of image 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.789
 this area is still seen best 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.069
 what else can you say it again by 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.639
 staff thousands of indicative example 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.139
 procter gamble procter gamble has a social 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.020
 network for your employees around 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.069
 the world of those employees who are engaged 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:12.020
 ats possible creative things 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.479
 capital designer ii 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.449
 and where the operator and then compotes 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.620
 the company comes from how it seems to me that 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.559
 this does not sound about what 

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:21.590
 usually people of creative professions 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.650
 was finishing the work day coming home and 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.020
 and 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.280
 And for the target chtk in this regard within 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.849
 Stalin networks company officially 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:31.270
 offering a cufflink payment 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.169
 company 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.150
 that is, one way or another, the company is officially 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.189
 City offers other their 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:37.979
 offices of their other countries 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:40.960
 experts can 40 that for intel company 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.740
 Well, for example, ill there South Africa 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.610
 designer need urgently tsareva she 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.520
 took chicago russia could weaken 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.069
 africa for breaking money this bank itself 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:51.220
 This undoubtedly allows much 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.259
 better employees and fend off the environment 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:54.470
 the company allows it 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.169
 employees and much better involved all 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:58.319
 the processes 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:01.439
 it allows ultimately the case 

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:02.879
 so even unpaid in person 

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.560
 Rome employees turns
