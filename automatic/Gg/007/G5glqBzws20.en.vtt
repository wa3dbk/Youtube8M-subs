and vineyards but coming as it does just

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.490 
and vineyards but coming as it does just
over<00:02:34.580> 30<00:02:34.850> miles<00:02:35.240> into<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.810> state<00:02:36.110> the

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
over 30 miles into the state the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.200 
over 30 miles into the state the
likelihood<00:02:37.100> is<00:02:37.130> that<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.520> breakaway<00:02:37.970> will<00:02:38.090> be

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
likelihood is that the breakaway will be

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.030 
likelihood is that the breakaway will be
well<00:02:38.450> established<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.650> vector

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
well established and so the vector

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.860 
well established and so the vector

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
points on offer and the bonus seconds

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.770 
points on offer and the bonus seconds
will<00:02:42.170> be<00:02:42.200> contested<00:02:42.920> amongst<00:02:43.550> them<00:02:43.780> following

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
Falcon Canyon Road now it's an S initial

Falcon Canyon Road now it's an S initial
section<00:04:07.599> after<00:04:08.019> you<00:04:08.409> turn<00:04:08.650> right<00:04:08.920> it's

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
section after you turn right it's

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.880 
section after you turn right it's
reasonably<00:04:10.000> easy<00:04:10.090> grade<00:04:10.810> it<00:04:10.930> around<00:04:11.200> about<00:04:11.379> 3%

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
reasonably easy grade it around about 3%

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.160 
reasonably easy grade it around about 3%
but<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.310> really<00:04:12.519> belies<00:04:12.940> what<00:04:13.510> faces<00:04:13.989> them

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
but it really belies what faces them

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:33.330 
but it really belies what faces them
ahead

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.439 

now<00:04:34.340> this<00:04:34.639> climb<00:04:34.999> is<00:04:35.439> actually<00:04:36.439> so<00:04:36.710> steep<00:04:37.099> a

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
now this climb is actually so steep a

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.809 
now this climb is actually so steep a
lot<00:04:38.449> of<00:04:38.539> the<00:04:38.599> local<00:04:38.990> cyclists<00:04:39.590> will<00:04:40.520> try<00:04:40.759> to

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
lot of the local cyclists will try to

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.230 
lot of the local cyclists will try to
avoid<00:04:41.270> it<00:04:41.539> all<00:04:41.810> cut<00:04:42.319> this<00:04:43.279> really<00:04:43.610> is<00:04:43.939> like<00:04:43.969> a

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
avoid it all cut this really is like a

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.629 
avoid it all cut this really is like a
wall<00:04:44.539> here<00:04:44.779> now<00:04:45.020> really<00:04:45.979> glad<00:04:46.219> that<00:04:46.370> I've<00:04:46.460> got

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
wall here now really glad that I've got

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.300 
wall here now really glad that I've got
a<00:04:46.669> compact<00:04:47.300> chain<00:04:47.539> set<00:04:47.810> on<00:04:48.529> this<00:04:48.740> bike

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
a compact chain set on this bike

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.640 
a compact chain set on this bike
now<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.150> race<00:04:50.300> itself<00:04:50.659> has<00:04:50.930> used<00:04:51.139> this<00:04:51.259> client

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
now the race itself has used this client

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.559 
now the race itself has used this client
on<00:04:51.740> a<00:04:51.770> number<00:04:52.009> of<00:04:52.039> occasions<00:04:52.219> but<00:04:52.819> normally
