you<00:01:49.310> know<00:01:49.430> it's<00:01:49.550> not<00:01:49.700> a<00:01:49.730> very<00:01:49.910> difficult<00:01:49.970> part

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
you know it's not a very difficult part

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.120 
you know it's not a very difficult part

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
but by the time it gets to speed up

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.160 
but by the time it gets to speed up
trying<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.030> layer<00:01:53.180> them<00:01:53.390> all<00:01:53.570> together<00:01:53.750> and

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
trying to layer them all together and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.100

that's<00:01:57.560> can<00:01:57.890> be<00:01:58.070> difficult<00:01:58.640> someone<00:02:03.250> okay

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
that's can be difficult someone okay

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.980

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
then you've got the course which is F

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
a couple things with this rhythm part is

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.850 
a couple things with this rhythm part is
when<00:02:25.690> you're<00:02:25.840> doing<00:02:26.050> this<00:02:26.170> little<00:02:26.380> riff<00:02:26.680> right

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860

here<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.860> subtle<00:02:30.430> points<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.360> rhythm

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
here the the subtle points of rhythm

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.520 
here the the subtle points of rhythm
guitar<00:02:32.200> plane<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:33.990> there's<00:02:34.990> a<00:02:35.080> little<00:02:35.350> bit<00:02:35.440> of

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
guitar plane is there's a little bit of

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.730 
guitar plane is there's a little bit of
a<00:02:35.620> pull<00:02:35.950> on<00:02:36.280> that<00:02:36.910> now<00:02:40.290> kind<00:02:41.290> of<00:02:41.320> like<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.470> blues

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
a pull on that now kind of like a blues

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:55.520 
a pull on that now kind of like a blues
like<00:02:42.010> kind<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.280> like<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.520> cream

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.290 

the<00:02:56.530> other<00:02:56.680> thing<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:57.130> when<00:02:57.550> I<00:02:57.580> do<00:02:57.700> this<00:02:57.970> cord

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.140 
that I've been working on for years I
call<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.770> wave<00:03:05.980> okay<00:03:06.550> I<00:03:06.580> like<00:03:06.820> to<00:03:06.940> put<00:03:07.120> a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
call it the wave okay I like to put a

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.140 
call it the wave okay I like to put a
little<00:03:07.300> wave<00:03:07.660> on<00:03:08.530> my<00:03:09.130> cord<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:09.700> rather<00:03:09.910> than

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
little wave on my cord so rather than

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:27.580 
little wave on my cord so rather than
hearing<00:03:10.480> something<00:03:10.840> like<00:03:10.960> this

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.460 

see<00:03:28.490> I<00:03:28.520> like<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.270> put<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.450> little<00:03:29.569> motion<00:03:29.900> so

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
see I like to put a little motion so

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.940 
see I like to put a little motion so
everything<00:03:30.830> is<00:03:30.920> always<00:03:31.190> moving<00:03:31.550> forward<00:03:32.950> and

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
everything is always moving forward and

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.280 
everything is always moving forward and
getting<00:03:34.610> that<00:03:34.790> little<00:03:35.030> vibrato<00:03:35.569> technique<00:03:35.959> on

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
getting that little vibrato technique on

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.720 
getting that little vibrato technique on
your<00:03:36.440> cords<00:03:36.740> if<00:03:36.860> you've<00:03:36.980> never<00:03:37.190> done<00:03:37.550> it

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
your cords if you've never done it

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.730 
your cords if you've never done it
before<00:03:37.850> there's<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.510> bit<00:03:38.810> of<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.990> trick<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.530> so

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
before there's a bit of a trick to it so

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.210 
before there's a bit of a trick to it so
you<00:03:39.800> have<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.069> kind<00:03:40.340> of<00:03:40.400> work<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:40.970> out<00:03:42.220> and

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
you have to kind of work that out and

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.240 
you have to kind of work that out and
then<00:03:43.580> even<00:03:43.940> especially<00:03:44.690> when<00:03:45.110> you're<00:03:45.410> when

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
then even especially when you're when

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.830 
then even especially when you're when
you're<00:03:46.280> layering<00:03:46.640> guitars<00:03:47.150> together<00:03:47.390> to<00:03:47.750> get

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
you're layering guitars together to get

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.570 
you're layering guitars together to get
the<00:03:47.959> waves<00:03:48.170> to<00:03:48.470> move<00:03:48.620> all<00:03:48.920> at<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.100> same<00:03:49.280> time

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
the waves to move all at the same time

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.720 
the waves to move all at the same time
that<00:03:50.090> is<00:03:50.410> difficult<00:03:51.410> for<00:03:52.280> me<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:52.550> was

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
that is difficult for me it was

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.330 
that is difficult for me it was
difficult<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.180> learn<00:03:53.300> because<00:03:53.959> if<00:03:54.080> they<00:03:54.200> start

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
difficult to learn because if they start

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.410 
difficult to learn because if they start
crossing<00:03:55.340> each<00:03:55.700> other<00:03:55.910> then<00:03:56.120> they<00:03:56.209> start

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
crossing each other then they start

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.940 
crossing each other then they start
canceling<00:03:56.930> it<00:03:57.080> out<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.470> it<00:03:57.590> sounds<00:03:57.860> like

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
canceling it out and it sounds like

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.290 
canceling it out and it sounds like
you've<00:03:58.100> just<00:03:58.280> got<00:03:58.430> cut<00:03:58.640> our<00:03:58.790> cords<00:03:59.090> that<00:03:59.209> are

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
you've just got cut our cords that are

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.390 
you've just got cut our cords that are
out<00:03:59.390> of<00:03:59.420> tune<00:04:00.340> so<00:04:01.340> anyways<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:02.030> small<00:04:02.630> point<00:04:02.959> but

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
out of tune so anyways a small point but

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.100 
out of tune so anyways a small point but
in<00:04:04.400> your<00:04:04.580> rhythm<00:04:04.850> playing<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.420> can<00:04:05.630> make<00:04:05.989> a<00:04:06.019> big

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
in your rhythm playing it can make a big

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:15.319 
in your rhythm playing it can make a big
difference

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.009 

so<00:04:16.329> when<00:04:16.480> you're<00:04:16.570> doing<00:04:16.660> this<00:04:16.840> little

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
so when you're doing this little

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.310 
so when you're doing this little
chugalug<00:04:17.410> down<00:04:17.920> here<00:04:18.160> you<00:04:18.989> gotta<00:04:19.989> be<00:04:20.110> careful

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
chugalug down here you gotta be careful

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.710 
chugalug down here you gotta be careful
with<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:20.829> get<00:04:21.790> the<00:04:21.910> palm<00:04:22.090> meeting<00:04:22.450> together

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
with that get the palm meeting together

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.760 
with that get the palm meeting together
so<00:04:22.960> it's<00:04:23.110> nice<00:04:23.230> and<00:04:23.290> tight<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:23.980> snappy
