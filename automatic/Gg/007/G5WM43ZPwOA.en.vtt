consistent<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:05.220> if<00:04:05.340> they<00:04:05.700> do<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:06.209> then<00:04:06.810> it's

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
consistent and if they do that then it's

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.809 
consistent and if they do that then it's
just<00:04:07.379> going<00:04:07.500> to<00:04:07.590> be<00:04:07.680> powerful<00:04:08.040> for<00:04:08.730> the
