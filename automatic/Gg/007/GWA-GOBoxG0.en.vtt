00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.600 
due to its SSD power it has a relatively
nice<00:02:17.700> camera<00:02:18.060> um<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.680> also<00:02:19.950> really<00:02:20.430> like

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
nice camera um and I also really like

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.450 
nice camera um and I also really like
the<00:02:20.730> trackpad<00:02:21.240> that's<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.720> product<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.460> I

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
the trackpad that's on the product and I

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.210 
the trackpad that's on the product and I
also<00:02:23.880> like<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.510> upgradable<00:02:25.170> Ram<00:02:25.350> option<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.950> 4

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
also like the upgradable Ram option of 4

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.920 
also like the upgradable Ram option of 4
gigabytes<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.790> RAM<00:02:27.060> because<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.510> makes<00:02:27.720> your

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
gigabytes of RAM because that makes your

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.620 
gigabytes of RAM because that makes your
macbook<00:02:28.290> air<00:02:28.500> pretty<00:02:28.950> much<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.190> powerhouse<00:02:29.850> the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
only con I have with this laptop is the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.130 
only con I have with this laptop is the
graphics<00:02:33.600> processor<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.350> is<00:02:34.650> an<00:02:34.860> Intel<00:02:35.600> 3008<00:02:36.600> d

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
graphics processor it is an Intel 3008 d

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.410 
graphics processor it is an Intel 3008 d
graphics<00:02:37.590> card<00:02:37.890> now<00:02:38.460> this<00:02:38.700> graphics<00:02:39.150> card

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
graphics card now this graphics card

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.990 
graphics card now this graphics card
does<00:02:39.600> not<00:02:39.990> handle<00:02:40.410> processes<00:02:41.160> very<00:02:41.490> well<00:02:41.760> if

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
does not handle processes very well if

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.090 
does not handle processes very well if
your<00:02:42.480> fan<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.960> at<00:02:43.080> full<00:02:43.320> speed<00:02:43.590> running

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
your fan is at full speed running

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.150 
your fan is at full speed running
applications<00:02:44.850> then<00:02:45.750> your<00:02:46.440> graphics<00:02:47.010> will

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
applications then your graphics will

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.940 
applications then your graphics will
glitch<00:02:47.400> up<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.820> several<00:02:48.560> screen<00:02:49.560> glitches

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
glitch up and several screen glitches

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.340 
glitch up and several screen glitches
will<00:02:50.100> occur<00:02:50.400> like<00:02:50.670> these<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.780> ones<00:02:51.960> you<00:02:52.110> see

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
will occur like these the ones you see

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.470
