00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
looked at the classes and for example

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.300 
looked at the classes and for example
the<00:01:08.640> Republic<00:01:08.970> cited<00:01:09.240> must<00:01:09.420> mean<00:01:09.600> smashing

those classes have to fill different
roles<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:32.680> that's<00:01:32.800> because<00:01:32.920> of<00:01:33.100> our<00:01:33.190> advanced

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
roles and that's because of our advanced

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.340 
roles and that's because of our advanced
classes<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.570> advanced<00:01:34.870> classes<00:01:35.140> actually

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
classes the advanced classes actually

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.730 
classes the advanced classes actually

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
so they've got are they or is it what's

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.470 
so they've got are they or is it what's
the<00:04:34.490> difference<00:04:34.730> between<00:04:34.760> these<00:04:35.030> two<00:04:35.090> that

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
the difference between these two that

makes<00:04:35.630> them<00:04:35.780> so<00:04:35.960> distinct<00:04:36.470> because<00:04:36.680> beyond

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
makes them so distinct because beyond

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.350 
makes them so distinct because beyond
beyond<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.580> fact<00:04:37.760> that<00:04:37.820> obviously<00:04:38.120> they<00:04:38.270> have

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
beyond the fact that obviously they have

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.659 
beyond the fact that obviously they have
completely<00:04:38.660> unique<00:04:38.960> stories<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:39.669> things
