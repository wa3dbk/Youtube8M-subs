00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 I'll talk about health now, how's it going? 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.000
 eat and a slimming 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.759
 the brand is possible with food 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.870
 thermogenic now I see that food 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.150
 are these 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.760
 Thermogenic foods are those 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.500
 that help you lose weight because it speeds up 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.260
 the energy metabolism metabolism 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.539
 other perform to keep the body alive 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.789
 so when you eat a food 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.980
 thermogenic you are providing the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.110
 body to spend more energy and 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.370
 consequently who the fat that is 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.739
 stored 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.719
 but for thermogenic foods 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.910
 help yourself to lose weight you need to 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.640
 they are always consumed by 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.460
 preferably at least twice per 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.219
 day and gives to be creative when it comes to 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.140
 include these ingredients in the diet as 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.120
 is that ginger should be consumed 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.399
 ginger is very versatile because you 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.320
 can use it both by seasoning meats 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.289
 for example how can you make tea 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.570
 How can you put it in your little bottle? 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.369
 of water you carry throughout the day 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.080
 are you consuming these 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.330
 properties of ginger 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.240
 throughout the day two thin chips 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.189
 ginger a day is sufficient 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.950
 cinnamon that a good amount of 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.080
 consume half a teaspoon 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.420
 you can use both cinnamon in shell 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.310
 to make a tea for example or 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.580
 seasoning a meat the cinnamon sticks 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.799
 excellent in the seasoning of meats the signal is 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.840
 and you can use that too 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.570
 half a spoonful of tea in the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.659
 cinnamon powder on fruit salads 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.479
 fruit a banana with cinnamon with once 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.880
 a focus for example of green tea you 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.790
 should drink three cups a day 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.079
 Another idea is to use tea as a basis for 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.299
 juices in place of water is the so-called suchÃ¡ 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.240
 ideal is to take 15 minutes before 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.939
 Pepper meals just consume 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.380
 about half a teaspoon per day 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.140
 studies show that I wanted people to 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.020
 can reduce up to 200 calories a day 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.869
 eating a healthy diet with 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.280
 insertion of thermogenic foods 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.460
 It's logical that we will not vary. 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.830
 eat every day all food 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.660
 at least two of them a day there you 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.370
 can have a good result that is 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.230
 ensure a greater fat burning 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.160
 It's still just eating the food. 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.710
 before physical activity 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.810
 because in addition to making you more active more 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.760
 excited for physical activity it goes 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.650
 potentiate the fat burning that has 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.860
 would happen during activity 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.590
 physics and on our website 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.110
 you find two recipes one of xuxa 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.210
 is a tea-based juice and the other is a 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.050
 Thermogenic snack to be consumed 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.050
 between meals
