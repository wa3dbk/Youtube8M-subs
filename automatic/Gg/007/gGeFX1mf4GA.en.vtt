00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.790
 I had people, I'm speaking so well. 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.500
 detailed because there are always people who 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.240
 they ask why there is always someone 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.590
 has a little more difficulty always 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.590
 there is someone who has difficulty 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:28.830
 the result of the draw will come out on day 3 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:32.250
 August then valid registrations until the 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:34.080
 day 2 and day 2 is not worth happier 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.870
 if you were you here after the 2 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.360
 passed and day 3 will output the result and 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:42.750
 You can be a good book winner . 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.030
 Look, I 'm just going to look at this. 

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.620
 Who kicked the May ball so that's it? 

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:52.160
 Personal details are already there 

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.160
 spread and that's it, it's good and it's Czech 

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.850
