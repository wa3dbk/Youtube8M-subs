00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.370
 hi everyone, past you know others say video game commentator 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.299
 video immediately welcome to the new review we talk about video games 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.599
 today we are going to face a jumper shooter with a comic jumper 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.680
 where the action takes place along a linear path that does not provide for life 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.089
 pass the story as stated in the subtitle 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.539
 narrates the events of bad happenings 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.980
 a superhero of comics who has suddenly seen his namesake erased 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.620
 series due to poor sales 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.700
 therefore our goal will be to jump 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.340
 among alternative comic book series sites to earn enough money 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.219
 and he restarts his comic book again I appreciated the idea that the 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.989
 Our digital alter-ego works for kristen &amp; pics developers to appear 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.839
 in different cinematic sequences 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.140
 it was even with the smart bumblebee 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.550
 in addition to the comic shoulder of the protagonist the surly was a star 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.330
 literally stuck to the chest presentation to non-popularitÃ© returns 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.439
 sma licks the many squabbles 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:10.810
 game controls 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.870
 with hints shoot at 360 degrees and swarms of enemies 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.040
 by using analog sticks and believe me it should be 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.580
 very fast 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.120
 in fact during the course of the adventure 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.090
 there is no object to restore our health 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.920
 Digital alter ego progressively disconnects at any cost 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.600
 once the energy is exhausted the adventure will start again from the check point 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.830
 closer 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.550
 if only they were not few and poorly distributed 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.970
 better management of the latter would certainly have benefited the experience 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.530
 of overall play 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.460
 in fact they are not rare in the moments when dozens of enemies appear on the screen 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.969
 simultaneously without any safe corner of the screen you can escape 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.020
 and sometimes even accompanied by an intermediate boss forcing us to 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.860
 repeat the entire section over and over again 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.350
 until we get the reflections of an inger comic jumper only offers 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.300
 four settings that include some types of comics 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.679
 I believe the modern fantastic the silva reis and the manga 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:20.039
 each setting is in turn divided into three numbers of the relative 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.419
 if I can do comics 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.509
 that we will have to face this subdivision in succession results very 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:30.179
 original due to the different graphic style that characterized nisseno ad 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.909
 example in the world of maniacs will move from right to left 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.909
 the dialogues that are always consistent with the context. 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:42.569
 this is however completely ruined by an excessive use of the same 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.079
 backgrounds and from the little variety of enemies try admission the other is possible 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.939
 move the capitan smally headquarters 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.319
 talking to the gewiss characters turns out to be outdated by choosing the next one 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.829
 host mission to face 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.010
 buying various upgrades that increase the chance of 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.459
 Supernova survival and unlockable extras 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.449
 and thanks to the power of marketing to download the other products of Christ and 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:08.360
 topics 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.160
 collectable plate not only the usual junk end in itself but 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.480
 instead they play a decisive role in the economy of the game once 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.780
 in fact you get a keandra bonus percentages added to 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.260
 that giotto enuta like more this will be high episode we will keep completing 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.089
 md missions cannot even animate the protagonist the dubbing 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:35.040
 unfortunately only in English although there are subtitles 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.929
 Italian 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:40.519
 in any case it does not look bad compared to other games for the market 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.119
 of the great distribution 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:46.779
 the game's dialogues are crackling and full of demented humor as well as 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:49.379
 present different situations that explicit 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.829
 alessia I have to dress that more famous if not even the same developers 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.979
 of the game by drawing the comic jam part sums. pleasant but not for everyone 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:00.119
 bonfiglio 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:03.119
 for lovers of the shooter genre or American comics 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:08.099
 and also to all those who are looking for immediate experiences 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.519
 fun and challenging 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.760
 as long as you are willing to pay out as many as 1200 Microsoft points, that's all for today 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.030
