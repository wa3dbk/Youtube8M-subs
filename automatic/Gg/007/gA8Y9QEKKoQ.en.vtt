believe that's testing this for people

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.470 
believe that's testing this for people
with<00:02:48.080> depression<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.920> having<00:02:49.670> fantastic

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.020 
with depression and having fantastic
results<00:02:51.349> so<00:02:52.040> that's<00:02:52.220> also<00:02:52.430> something<00:02:52.610> to

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030
