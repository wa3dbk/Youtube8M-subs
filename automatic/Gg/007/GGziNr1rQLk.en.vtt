00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hey you dear people outside I am 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.060
 they are never easy from the channel and the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.010
 An insider's tip is about how 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.870
 you can hold the eyelashes up nicely 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.179
 without eyelash curler because I personally 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.130
 the feeling of the eyelash curly eye 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.809
 I absolutely can not stand it 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.510
 I'm not the only one I always have 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.699
 the feeling my tears himself that out or 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.230
 you somehow disappear in the eyeball 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.269
 I do not like that at all and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.010
 I just have to keep my fingers off 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.800
 User and there is the technology 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.960
 actually quite simple and that use 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.940
 I have the pressure of my own eyelashes 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.550
 wreath in which I then just with the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.860
 press kali against it and in the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.290
 I just point something upwards 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.960
 and then try the eyelashes a little bit 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.559
 inside in this curved shape too 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.270
 get 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.489
 some like it when they are steep 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.250
 Above , I do not like that personally 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.260
 I like it because I think it's too 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.910
 then it can not look like spinning 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.620
 fast but with substances that is 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.000
 By the way, a tip like the one 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.079
 can hide a bit by the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.449
 Just lash out a little bit 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.129
 Upstairs does that for me that he does not like me 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.080
 that it may spider legs 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.850
 but i could do it 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.369
 Just so that I can layer after each 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.810
 mascara apply this trick and 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.240
 by letting my fingers over 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.250
 namely the eyelashes scratch it 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.720
 That excess product just starts 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.570
 and that makes you essential too 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.460
 more tables than usual because otherwise 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.869
 you have too much mascara and you know 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 yes then the eyelashes stick fast 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.500
 but if you do that with the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.299
 Just finger through , then know 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.220
 one does not have that and can shower more 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.200
 and as I said I just take that 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.299
 pressure of your own eyelash wreath and 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.159
 press against it I felt that too 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.259
 that there is such a back pressure here and there 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.079
 can you most form the quasi the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.090
 pushes me there rather longer and then 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.159
 delete and delete 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.869
 the mascara also dries a bit 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.590
 faster and you are not forever too 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.810
 was going on 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.700
 if it is dry then the holds 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.280
 effect, of course, the longest as if 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.780
 you let go then if the mascara is still 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.759
 wet and then it goes back so 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.380
 slow down and best 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.630
 to use this trick if you 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.820
 waterproof mascara used because there 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.189
 it dries a bit faster 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.180
 through this maxime consistency and this 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.830
 momentum will be maintained in any case 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.570
 because through the waterproof mascara 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.490
 simply always a general one 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.560
 stays a little better because she is easy 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.130
 harder it dries and thus simply a 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.840
 a little bit better 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.490
 everything seals and all that 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.650
 better holds who really number 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.690
 want to go safe and not that 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.150
 It is enough to make a lash forma 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.670
 grab that looks like this is just one 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.230
 smaller came quasi and that one switches 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.750
 then just enter here 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.459
 and while that was going to be easy 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.630
 By the way, it does not get hot because you need it 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.130
 Do not worry that you are 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.320
 it burns into the eyelid 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.030
 You can really warm only slightly 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.040
 meanwhile , apply the call 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.170
 or something and in any case after 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.510
 it is about 20 seconds on each 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.730
 case already warm and I have the hand 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.600
 just like fingering I hold it 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.700
 below at the neck of the wreath rather 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.860
 pressed and press against my own 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.560
 eyelash wreath I ask this again 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.930
 back pressure and upwards so 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.700
 direction tip would be easy with it 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.770
 just a little, and I do that 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.220
 so I always go in the direction of 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.080
 So Auges would come up to the side because 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.120
 the eyelashes are still tight 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.430
 a little further on and see through it 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.019
 the eyelashes are a bit too 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.330
 more voluminous and fuller because you like her 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.100
 she just fanned and so on 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.410
 the eyelashes forma here is that too 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.060
 practically that her stubborn eyelashes 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.610
 somehow in all sorts of ways 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.739
 directions show quite well with it 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.570
 I have the control down below 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.880
 sometimes the problem that i have at this 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.220
 corner in front so have a small vortex 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.100
 and I just do it that way I 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.930
 the eyelashes noble and pressed against it 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.120
 until it was easy what the eyelashes and 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.860
 then just come down and thereby 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.110
 somehow it dissolves this confusion 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.970
 a lash and eyelashes are in 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.470
 row and limb and that supports that 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.090
 Just a little bit more and I am 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.380
 really happy with it and that 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.880
 has everything still a bit 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.750
 what I support with the fingers 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.610
 have made 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.100
 that would be the subject of eyelashes 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.959
 but what I also noticed and 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.730
 you can find it here in my 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.290
 eyelash routine i wanted the tip here 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.780
 really just referring to the swing 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.970
 and otherwise I wish you on 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.220

 It 's a great secret you 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.730
