 all said even though these mammals and the dinosaurs were 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.809
 separated by millions of years still played in the same function and nothing 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.489
 less it is easy to compare the mega lion with a new news 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:14.879
 video neither of them was very big 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.570
 but they will be equipped with the weapons and the musculature necessary to subdue 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.570
 prices much higher than them 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.759
 navantía if we look now at the bear his counterpart would be the tiranosaurus 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.909
 just like him the bear could hunt at will and they had nothing to which 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.200
 fear came out on shoulders or bigger 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.890
 it is difficult to say if he did not want to hunt he used his size and his 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.790
 power to steal food from other predators carlos ahumada 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.990
 the market subjected to three and a half meters high 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.690
 they entered one thousand 100 kilograms 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.750
 their carps were the size of a human head 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.750
 and his words had a length of 20 centimeters 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.030
 to complement these weapons had a crushing denture 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.480
 the mounds of a turn form 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.890
 very few survivors of the war 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.200
 Canary Islands without being a hunting and predator predator better 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.960
 that you do not cross your path because it has an imposing size 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.060
 we have a huge head, a powerful musculature and a penetrating gaze 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.080
 his presence alone intimidates most of the animals 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.520
 from how modern lions attack 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.900
 we know that the mega lion was an aggressive predator enough 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.900
 smart to be the first to hit a compact 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 any species uses the body as a whole 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.370
 is the dream in the case of lion gifted with careers and jaws we are so 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.060
 probably approached their prey in the same way that data does 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.630
 today downhill 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.750
 I introduce myself 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.750
 basically he was pouncing on his prey 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.310
 and resort to his jaws to gag his neck like his counterpart 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.310
 any other part of the body 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:13.499
 Daniel Osorno is one of the few predators that attack another 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.109
 predator 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:18.829
 you have to fight against a presence something very different to fight against another 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.199
 predator 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:24.509
 barreda veloso can go where a dam is and steal it from the other 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:25.479
 predator 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:29.859
 that is, wait until he is in the windbreaker and then go to steal 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.109
 the chihuahua dam 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.189
 in it could have been the bully of the plains was facing others 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.189
 predators to a greater extent than the lion 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.379
 the bear with his coat coat 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.379
 it is much more vulnerable to global warming 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.269
 xinhua geological tests verifies 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.340
 although the earth is experiencing a drastic climate change they are holy and 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.379
 that there are things that are changing 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.870
 He worked at the time of describing what a combat between the 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.700
 animals like the bear and in lion the water came in 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.250
 we have to analyze the behavior of their modern counterparts to be able to 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.369
 well recreating what happened I am an actress 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:14.199
 red we use all available scientific data sharaf well 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:18.469
 as the behaviors of modern animals to recreate a fight and what 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.469
 Deeper to enroll possible failed 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:26.839
 normally the lion would marry at night to be able to ambush its prey and to 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.179
 save energy 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:30.909
 but hunger has forced him to hunt for life 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.909
 when the month of August is awake and hunting 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:39.019
 the increase in temperatures has caused limit behavior in 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.589
 these two creatures 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:43.589
 the Swedish will resonate throughout 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:56.209
 the rising temperatures have reached 32 degrees in the plains 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.429
 a gale of extinction is to travel the planet 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:05.839
 very few herbivores survive 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.439
 volcanoes we are reaching the end of the Pleistocene 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.159
 and in pages of the ice age in summer the environment is changing and the 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.440
 animals suffer the consequences agencies lift finds 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.500
 difficulties to stock up on enough food daley country has had 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.450
 luck that a bison has crossed his path for his capture has been vital 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.529
 because the lion is literally under minimal 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.249
 the lion is mainly an ambush predator by July give the impression 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:39.400
 that its large size does not allow it to hide 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.659
 but its colors fit perfectly in the environment 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.659
 and escaped to remain motionless for hours 

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:50.809
 when he attacks he does it at the speed of light 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:57.180
 the mega bear 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.180
 aol gone to the dam first 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.569
 once the view do 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.569
 wait to enter the scene 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.490
 although the bear took advantage of the wind because it blows in his direction 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.020
 there is no before the lion does not perceive its Nahua smell does not suspect that it is being 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.039
 beleaguered 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.830
 I think they or we are and stealthily using the trees to disguise 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.759
 its silhouette 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:26.080
 the use moves and giving small accelerations 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.370
 they allow you to evaluate the situation 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.370
 and make sure he's not going to be ambushed 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:36.489
 also it is not prepared for long accelerations when it is hot 

00:05:36.489 --> 00:05:41.089
 your first option is to scare off your rival and appropriate the prey 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:48.969
 Guiana the lion can not lose the prey depends on her 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.970
 efe-afp ​​the bear emerges from behind some bushes roaring loudly 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.360
 today at a speed greater than that of a current horse 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.330
 equally lion turns towards his attacker 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.860
 it is expected that the lion ulloa but the lion does not move from the site 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.740
 the current bears are designed to hibernate 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.399
 but in the ice age there were no seasons 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:20.249
 of the social and mental sickle goes from the same amount to 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:21.490
 all year 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.490
 what makes him an insatiable hunter 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.669
 now it stands on the lion 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:33.499
 Honey this bear is almost three and a half meters tall perhaps a colossal animal 

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:35.719
 intimidating the air 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:39.399
 Like yesterday, in a normal situation this would have been enough for the lion 

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:43.259
 he did not run away but this time he can not afford to lose the prey 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:50.580
 the last stage of the ice age witnessed great migrations 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.860
 the animals of cold climates 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.740
 they moved north 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.660
 while others smaller and faster took the place of Athens 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:03.969
 when the bear faces another predator 

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:07.759
 deploy your limbs forward to intimidate as much as possible 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:08.659
 possible 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:11.659
 but this posture exposes the stomach 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.900
 as well as the lion has been unable to take advantage of this circumstance and 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.000
 he can only stick his huge claws into the back of the bear 

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:34.650
 ironworks but this one is so corpulent and his layer of bloody fat that hardly 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.830
 causes the previous year it hurts but it does not mean a serious injury 

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:42.359
 the bear escapes to be stripped of lion and to recover the balance 

00:07:44.429 --> 00:07:48.379
 the thick layer of fat to fight the cold makes it difficult to maintain the 

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:51.379
 Balance 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:57.160
 there is no lion takes the initiative and performs a threat of attack waiting 

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.840
 that the osella vega on its hind legs 

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.840
 and to be able to access the always go out to play 

00:08:03.719 --> 00:08:08.069
 a pepe a ozone squatter stands but simply steps back 

00:08:08.069 --> 00:08:11.529
 and seeks to balance to launch the attack as it has done is to increase 

00:08:12.249 --> 00:08:15.059
 this time the bear pounces and does not stop
