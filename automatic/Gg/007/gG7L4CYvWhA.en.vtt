 you asked me for a touch this time 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.250
 suitable for those who are blond and have eyes 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.930
 blue 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.150
 I tried to do 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.820
 a make up is quite simple then 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.140
 to be able to realize all the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.990
 mornings quickly and easily 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.150
 so i hope you like it and that you 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.260
 may be useful as I will explain everything to you 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.330

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.850

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.850
 hello see you next Friday bye 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.190
 the blond woman with blue eyes is from 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.649
 always an emblem of femininity 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.020
 if we want to go to value these 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.979
 beautiful eyes the colors with which one does not 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.070
 never wrong 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.830
 they are the warm tones like for example them 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.820
 all the shades of orange the 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.070
 copper but also bronze then 8 for a 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.680
 make-up very effective and easy to 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:52.950
 make using the colors gold and copper 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:56.369
 that will illuminate the iris then 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.159
 let's start as a base, use a concealer 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.229
 della e chen zhen and spread it over all 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.090
 the mobile eyelid is under the arch 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.369
 eyebrow 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.240
 now with a flat tongue brush 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.459
 of cat 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.040
 I take my first color a rave 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.430
 shimmer from the duochrome palette of 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.420
 stand snow cosmetics on more than 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.420
 half of the eyelid 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:37.430
 and with a small brush I blow the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.520
 burgundy now dark brown matte 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.610
 of the palette of e chen zhen and I bring it 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.740
 on the upper lash line 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.930
 from half eye to outside corner e 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.930
 los smoke inward 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:01.280
 after which I pass it even under the eye 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.890
 but this time without fading now 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.920
 I take a cream scimÃ© always from the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.680
 ecm palette and I apply it under all 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.360
 the eyebrow arch down also 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:19.400
 sideways towards the inner corner 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:22.400
 of the eye with the brush 224 of the 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.549
 mac this time I get a gold from 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.560
 artistry and I bring it between copper and 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.560
 shimmer cream fading 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:51.040
 repeats this passage more than one 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:53.440
 once black eyeliner 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:04:07.290
 I used the marker pen of the e 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:07.290
 chen zhen I apply false eyelashes 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.549
 black mascara 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.549
 here I used the beautycycle one 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.210
 with a flat corner brush e 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.990
 I bring copper under all the edge 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.990
 lower eye 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:44.360
 in the internal rhyme I use a pencil for 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.310
 dark brown eyes and finally saw that 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.560
 I don't have blue eyes I decide to 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.060
 compensate by applying a beautiful 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.060
 bindi of this color 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:02.090
 well this trick is fine for the 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.940
 day for the evening instead replaced the 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.940
 copper with black and gold with a silver 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:38.200
 hello, girls, I wait for you to make up 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.200
 with me in the next video 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.530
 people think the worst thing is 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:53.560
 lose a person you love 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.360
 you are wrong the worst thing to lose if 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.349
 same while you want too well a 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.270
 someone 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.900
 forgetting that we are too 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.900
 important
