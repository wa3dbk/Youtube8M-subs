00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello my name is now an introduction 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.420
 on prisoners 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.630
 this because to fix some 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.059
 fundamental concepts to know 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.259
 when it comes to carbohydrates 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.809
 especially the new one 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.199
 which we now say above all 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.660
 carbohydrate classification and understanding 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.460
 the names that are used when yes 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.949
 talk about carbohydrates now let's see 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.930
 then then immediately what positive 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.779
 carbohydrates are carbohydrates tenors 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.540
 they are indeed very rich molecules 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.980
 of carbon hydrogen and oxygen i 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.590
 remembered carbohydrates that come 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.250
 called in many different names burned by 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.680
 lucidi uk saccharides ie practiced 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.719
 indexes close many jesmines though 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.340
 the same thing is always micro 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.469
 an important thing to remember that 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.140
 precisely glucides derives from the Greek cucos 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.239
 which means sweet therefore of sugars 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.420
 therefore they are sweet for this reason 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.120
 they are called that for this reason 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.820
 another thing that is fundamental to 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.119
 knowing is that carbohydrates are called 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.210
 so precisely because they are with layers 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.100
 carbon hydrates ie what it means 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.840
 means that they are rich in coal d 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.210
 oxygen for this reason are called 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.580
 irate carbon because of this 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.500
 reason therefore when talking about 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.899
 carbohydrates you have to remember these two 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.450
 concepts carbohydrates are very rich 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.610
 of camus hydrogen earthquake the carbohydrates 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.920
 they are called carbohydrates because from there 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.229
 record drift with a council is sweet and 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.300
 they are called artists because they are rich 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.490
 carbon hydrogen office said 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.259
 this we see now that it works to no 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.729
 it is how they are classified in 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.440
 general 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.190
 then the ones have precisely 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.990
 carbohydrate carbohydrates if it should 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.780
 ask any person the first one 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.409
 what he says is precisely that of one 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.850
 energy function ie practically 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.860
 we eat or concertini has an energy 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.880
 however, this is not the only function 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.759
 of carbohydrates 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.189
 so no carbohydrate functions us 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.320
 we would never have important errors 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.750
 then the biological functions of the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.960
 carbohydrates are various we find the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.119
 energy reserve function 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.770
 and indeed also of energy therefore very much 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.319
 important the function the objects that 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.120
 for example, it will give more starch 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.430
 the recall are all functional 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.860
 energy then have a function 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.160
 structural for example cellulose 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.930
 in plants and cartilage example 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.069
 in animals therefore they have a function 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.870
 structural therefore essential because the 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.050
 Plant cell wall formed 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.239
 cellulose then we will find what the 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.069
 role in the immune system 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.670
 this is because this happens 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.510
 because precisely the immune system 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:50.320
 recognizes as a foreign component e 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:53.290
 antigenic a thick component one 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.840
 Libyan bag ie for example if we 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.850
 in short, when you have a lot of bacteria 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.070
 often the bacterium presents on his 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.420
 mammary surface of the drives of 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.269
 carbohydrates and these come 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.190
 recognized as strangers then plays a 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.810
 important role in fertility throughout 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.400
 because it is often found 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.000
 their important for example in the 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.110
 semen the rich in carbohydrates 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.260
 etc. and those biological development 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.760
 so this the four melted a 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.410
 very important and very important that 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.620
 you liquid and above all the function 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.900
 energy the structural function and the 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.250
 function of the immune system 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.310
 those are the three most functions 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.410
 important we see now in general 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.370
 how they are classified then we will see them 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.650
 in the most specific one one then i 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.260
 prisoners are classified into two 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.019
 main groups simple carbohydrates 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.989
 and complex carbohydrates carbohydrates 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.110
 simple are the one saccardi of saccardi 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.120
 the complex carbohydrates are the 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.280
 oligosaccharides and polysaccharides this the 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.019
 feature that must be clear 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.660
 so when we have not only 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.459
 saccardi will be one, dear de qua non 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.130
 we have two saccharides will be 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:08.330
 disaccharides when we have more 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:11.000
 precisely of two bags, from 3 to 20 arenas 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.459
 a biologist at saqqara oligo means 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.519
 little saccharides means sugar 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.479
 therefore few sugars bound together 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.479
 when we talk about polysaccharides 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.989
 instead we will go more myopic bound to 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.390
 together 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.140
 so we will have the simple jury i 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.780
 complex sugars then monosaccharides 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.840
 saccharides oligosaccharides police ht 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.720
 so they recapitulate we can say two things 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.880
 basic carbohydrates are of 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.240
 hydrates carbon because they are rich 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.070
 of carbon hydrogen and oxygen have a 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.919
 three main functions 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.650
 the energy function is the function of 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.310
 bullies and protective and structural is 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.919
 a function of unitary systems 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.600
 are classified according to 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.000
 essentially the number of molecules 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.880
 precisely which constitute the structure 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.310
 of carmine side if there is sugar 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.229
 they will skip if there are two will be 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.889
 of safari if there are from 3 to 20 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:12.910
 I will say to jump if there are more than 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:16.729
 twenty carbohydrates bound together 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.499
 we will speak instead of polysaccharides then 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.240
 juckers are divided simple and 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:22.699
 complex based on the number of molecules 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.069
 which constitute a thing 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:26.960
 very important as to conclude from 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:30.020
 remember that link between these calls 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.659
 pirates will be called metric silico e 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.759
 is made by various enzymes and is 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.599
 fundamental as a concept for the 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.309
 digestion 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.669
 because precisely in digestion they come 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:43.339
 cut these ties through a 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.499
 hydrolysis process to put on 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:48.919
 point the digestion of these compounds 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:50.599
 when it is possible to digest them then 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.339
 even for this video it's all now 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:55.930
 with the video we will see 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:57.259
 in general the characteristics of the various 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.080
 carbohydrates 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.759
 if instead complex then however paradise 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.059
 important to remember these elements 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:06.979
 characteristic is as always if you video 

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:08.599
 liked put it in like if I don't know 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.069
 which written to the local sign up for 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:13.279
 what I do other videos immediately 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:16.279
 updated visit my channel for 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:18.050
 precisely see all the playlists with 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:20.599
 all the arguments for destiny 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.959
 ticino and I'll wait for the next video 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.959
 bye, see you soon
