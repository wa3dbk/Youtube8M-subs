brown in all the shaded areas used this
white<00:00:55.319> and<00:00:55.789> this<00:00:56.789> kind<00:00:56.999> of<00:00:57.120> fleshy<00:00:57.390> color<00:00:57.649> in

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
white and this kind of fleshy color in

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.919 
white and this kind of fleshy color in
the<00:00:58.890> lighter<00:00:59.129> areas<00:00:59.569> following<00:01:00.569> the<00:01:00.690> same

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
the lighter areas following the same

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.370 
the lighter areas following the same
concept<00:01:01.589> I<00:01:01.969> also<00:01:02.969> used<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.449> black<00:01:03.629> marker<00:01:04.140> to

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:04.380 
concept I also used a black marker to

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.260 
concept I also used a black marker to
kind<00:01:04.590> of<00:01:04.650> go<00:01:04.800> ahead<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.220> get<00:01:05.340> into<00:01:05.760> all<00:01:05.910> of<00:01:05.940> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
kind of go ahead and get into all of the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.620 
kind of go ahead and get into all of the
the<00:01:07.460> areas<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.790> eyelashes<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the areas like that eyelashes the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.680 
the areas like that eyelashes the
eyebrows<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.950> some<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> outlining<00:01:12.060> but

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
eyebrows and some of the outlining but

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.450 
eyebrows and some of the outlining but
you'll<00:01:12.840> notice<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.500> didn't<00:01:14.010> outline

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you'll notice that I didn't outline

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.240 
you'll notice that I didn't outline
around<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.750> edge<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.410> hair<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.190> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
around the edge of the hair and the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.790 
around the edge of the hair and the
reason<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.120> I<00:01:18.390> think<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.530> gives<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
reason for that is I think it gives a

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.950 
reason for that is I think it gives a
nicer<00:01:20.130> look<00:01:20.370> if<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.120> little<00:01:21.330> bit<00:01:21.480> softer

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
nicer look if it's a little bit softer

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.430 
nicer look if it's a little bit softer
so<00:01:22.440> let's<00:01:22.740> go<00:01:22.980> ahead<00:01:23.010> and<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.520> started<00:01:23.760> I<00:01:24.750> did

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
so let's go ahead and get started I did

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.580 
so let's go ahead and get started I did
use<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.800> pencil<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.610> kind<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.940> just<00:01:27.470> kind<00:01:28.470> of

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
use a pencil and kind of just kind of

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.530 
use a pencil and kind of just kind of
barely<00:01:28.920> outline<00:01:29.460> where<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.730> think<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.150> want<00:01:30.450> to

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
barely outline where I think I want to

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.750 
barely outline where I think I want to
the<00:01:30.660> hair<00:01:30.870> to<00:01:31.020> flow<00:01:31.260> my<00:01:31.920> plan<00:01:32.190> is<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.640> her

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.840 
the hair to flow my plan is to have her
hair<00:01:33.000> look<00:01:33.690> like<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:33.990> kind<00:01:34.230> of<00:01:34.490> behind<00:01:35.490> her

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
hair look like it's kind of behind her

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.490 
hair look like it's kind of behind her
neck<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.450> side<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.990> kind<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.260> flowing

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
neck on this side and kind of flowing

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.620 
neck on this side and kind of flowing
off<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.070> direction<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.640> we'll<00:01:38.970> we'll<00:01:39.600> see

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
off in this direction so we'll we'll see

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.870 
off in this direction so we'll we'll see
how<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:39.990> works<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.620> don't<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> lot<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.550> pan

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
how that works I don't have a lot of pan

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.000 
how that works I don't have a lot of pan
pastel<00:01:42.300> tools<00:01:42.600> I've<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.560> started<00:01:43.740> playing

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
pastel tools I've just started playing

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.830

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.050 
with using them to smear the wax pastels
but<00:02:17.350> i<00:02:17.380> did<00:02:17.590> find<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:18.040> if<00:02:18.190> i<00:02:18.280> cut<00:02:18.520> off<00:02:18.670> an<00:02:18.880> edge

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
but i did find that if i cut off an edge

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.900 
but i did find that if i cut off an edge
I<00:02:19.390> had<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.900> little<00:02:20.110> small<00:02:21.100> piece<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.670> could

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
I had a little small piece that I could

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.430 
I had a little small piece that I could
use<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.180> kind<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.600> get<00:02:22.720> into<00:02:23.020> some<00:02:23.230> of<00:02:23.350> the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
use to kind of get into some of the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.980 
use to kind of get into some of the
tighter<00:02:23.680> little<00:02:24.070> areas<00:02:24.460> I<00:02:25.330> may<00:02:25.780> or<00:02:25.840> may<00:02:25.960> not

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
tighter little areas I may or may not

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.230 
tighter little areas I may or may not
use<00:02:26.320> that<00:02:26.350> but<00:02:27.190> what<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.340> have<00:02:27.610> been<00:02:27.850> finding

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
use that but what I have been finding

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.960 
use that but what I have been finding
that<00:02:28.330> I'm<00:02:28.450> really<00:02:28.750> liking<00:02:28.960> is<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:30.370> tool<00:02:30.610> that

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
that I'm really liking is this tool that

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.470 
that I'm really liking is this tool that
has<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:32.110> very<00:02:32.680> sharp<00:02:32.770> square<00:02:33.520> edge<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.120> then<00:02:34.450> a

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
has a very sharp square edge and then a

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.110 
has a very sharp square edge and then a
nicely<00:02:34.960> rounded<00:02:35.140> edge<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.740> I<00:02:35.770> find<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.490> I'm

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
nicely rounded edge and I find that I'm

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.750 
nicely rounded edge and I find that I'm
liking<00:02:37.570> these<00:02:37.690> two<00:02:38.020> edges<00:02:38.170> more<00:02:38.740> than<00:02:38.950> the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
liking these two edges more than the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.280 
liking these two edges more than the
majority<00:02:39.880> of<00:02:40.210> the<00:02:40.300> other<00:02:40.390> tools<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:40.870> let's<00:02:41.080> go

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
majority of the other tools so let's go

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.730 
majority of the other tools so let's go
ahead<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:41.560> get<00:02:42.300> going<00:02:43.300> on<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.660> hair<00:02:43.870> as<00:02:44.680> i

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
ahead and get going on the hair as i

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.740 
ahead and get going on the hair as i
only<00:02:45.130> have<00:02:45.310> limited<00:02:45.550> colors<00:02:46.120> i<00:02:46.330> will<00:02:46.480> be<00:02:46.600> using

only have limited colors i will be using

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.590 
only have limited colors i will be using
the<00:02:47.020> colors<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.530> i<00:02:47.590> do<00:02:47.680> have<00:02:48.180> i'm<00:02:49.180> not<00:02:49.420> really

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
the colors that i do have i'm not really

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.050 
the colors that i do have i'm not really
mixing<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.320> colors<00:02:50.610> except<00:02:51.610> for<00:02:51.850> what

mixing the colors except for what

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.720 
mixing the colors except for what
already<00:02:52.450> happens<00:02:52.930> in<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.160> hair<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:54.580> we'll

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
already happens in the hair so we'll

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.330 
already happens in the hair so we'll
talk<00:02:54.910> about<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.300> highs<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.480> lows<00:02:55.960> of<00:02:56.340> what

of the limited color palette that I have
I<00:03:44.110> could<00:03:44.530> do<00:03:44.800> some<00:03:45.220> sort<00:03:45.490> of<00:03:46.110> reddish<00:03:47.110> brown

color that this is but you'll see by the

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
was falling kind of naturally it would

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.020 
was falling kind of naturally it would
start<00:05:09.259> to<00:05:09.500> have<00:05:10.099> some<00:05:10.340> movement<00:05:10.699> more<00:05:10.820> like

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
start to have some movement more like

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:18.279 
start to have some movement more like
this<00:05:15.699> okay<00:05:16.699> so<00:05:16.759> we<00:05:17.030> have<00:05:17.060> a<00:05:17.150> lot<00:05:17.449> of<00:05:17.479> black<00:05:17.900> now

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
this okay so we have a lot of black now

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.460 
this okay so we have a lot of black now
and<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:20.180> next<00:05:20.330> color<00:05:20.659> I'm<00:05:20.840> going<00:05:20.870> to<00:05:21.199> put<00:05:21.349> in

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470

and the next color I'm going to put in
here<00:05:21.500> is<00:05:21.740> green<00:05:22.250> and<00:05:22.639> you<00:05:23.060> might<00:05:23.210> ask<00:05:23.389> why<00:05:23.720> is

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
bringing and I just think because that's

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.649 
bringing and I just think because that's
the<00:05:26.690> colors<00:05:26.930> I<00:05:27.020> have<00:05:27.139> to<00:05:27.229> play<00:05:27.349> with<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:28.659> since

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
whatever color I want it also makes for

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.950 
whatever color I want it also makes for
some<00:05:34.430> interesting<00:05:34.550> tones<00:05:35.180> in<00:05:35.449> the<00:05:35.570> final

kind<00:06:18.110> of<00:06:18.169> amp<00:06:18.349> up<00:06:18.590> the<00:06:19.900> saturation<00:06:20.900> of<00:06:21.139> the

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
kind of amp up the saturation of the

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:23.499 
kind of amp up the saturation of the
colors<00:06:22.460> because<00:06:22.729> it<00:06:22.849> helps<00:06:23.150> the<00:06:23.300> layers

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:23.509 
colors because it helps the layers

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:25.870 
colors because it helps the layers
underneath<00:06:23.900> pop<00:06:24.409> I<00:06:24.740> tend<00:06:25.430> to<00:06:25.490> do<00:06:25.610> a<00:06:25.639> lot<00:06:25.729> of

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
underneath pop I tend to do a lot of

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.829 
underneath pop I tend to do a lot of
layers<00:06:26.840> underneath<00:06:27.349> the<00:06:27.680> face<00:06:27.889> and<00:06:28.630> in<00:06:29.630> this

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
one you can kind of see along the edge
