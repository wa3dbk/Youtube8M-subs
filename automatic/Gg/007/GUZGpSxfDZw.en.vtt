composite<00:00:42.930> decking<00:00:43.079> material<00:00:43.649> again<00:00:44.190> it's

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
composite decking material again it's

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.290

what<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.489> had<00:00:44.640> laying<00:00:44.789> around<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.149> house

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
what I had laying around the house

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.069 
what I had laying around the house
happen<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.289> be<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> perfect<00:00:46.800> little<00:00:46.890> sliver<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
happen to be a perfect little sliver and

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.900 
happen to be a perfect little sliver and
these<00:00:49.079> are<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.620> finishing<00:00:49.980> screws<00:00:50.399> now

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
these are just for finishing screws now

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.560 
these are just for finishing screws now
I'd<00:00:51.030> suggest<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.930> keep<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:52.649> screws

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
I'd suggest that you keep your screws

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.209 
I'd suggest that you keep your screws
shorter<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.750> started<00:00:55.350> out<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.559> longer<00:00:55.980> screws

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
shorter I started out with longer screws

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.740 
shorter I started out with longer screws
in<00:00:56.370> here<00:00:56.610> but<00:00:56.789> i<00:00:56.820> think<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.239> shorter<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
in here but i think the shorter the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.689 
in here but i think the shorter the
screw<00:00:58.050> somewhere<00:00:58.980> between<00:00:59.129> an<00:00:59.399> inch<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
screw somewhere between an inch and a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.430 
screw somewhere between an inch and a
half<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.000> two<00:01:00.090> inches<00:01:00.390> seems<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.199> be<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
half and two inches seems to be the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.160 
half and two inches seems to be the
right<00:01:01.620> length<00:01:01.890> any<00:01:02.879> longer<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.719> gets<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.049> be

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
right length any longer just gets to be

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.190 
right length any longer just gets to be
a<00:01:04.199> little<00:01:04.379> bit<00:01:04.500> ridiculous<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.750> yeah<00:01:06.750> about<00:01:06.900> an

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
a little bit ridiculous so yeah about an

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.600 
a little bit ridiculous so yeah about an
inch<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> half<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.920> two<00:01:07.950> inches<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
inch and a half to two inches on the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.780 
inch and a half to two inches on the
screws<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.900> also<00:01:10.229> make<00:01:10.530> sure<00:01:10.560> that

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
screws and then also make sure that

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.090 
screws and then also make sure that
whatever<00:01:11.790> size<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.450> screw<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:13.080> use<00:01:13.380> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
whatever size of screw you do use you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.700

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
screw will fit inside and that will help

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.240 
screw will fit inside and that will help
prevent<00:01:22.979> scratches<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.560> aidan<00:01:25.560> friction<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
prevent scratches and aidan friction so

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.560 
prevent scratches and aidan friction so
the<00:01:26.400> ipod<00:01:26.759> will<00:01:26.970> stay<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.240> there<00:01:27.420> nice<00:01:27.540> and
