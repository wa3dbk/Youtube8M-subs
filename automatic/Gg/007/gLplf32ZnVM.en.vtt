00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
radio glitch is happening so except for

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.800 
radio glitch is happening so except for
that<00:01:09.750> radio<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.590> comes<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.820> HPI<00:01:12.299> baja

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that radio that comes with the HPI baja

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
that radio that comes with the HPI baja
the<00:01:13.320> newer<00:01:13.560> ones<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:15.320> Super<00:01:16.320> Bee<00:01:16.439> will<00:01:16.650> work

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the newer ones the Super Bee will work

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.859 
the newer ones the Super Bee will work
with<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.549> you've<00:01:17.700> got<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.570> stock

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
with that so if you've got the stock

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.120 
with that so if you've got the stock
ready<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.350> run<00:01:19.530> HPI

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130

to<00:01:20.820> channel<00:01:21.180> radio<00:01:21.299> you're<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.500> to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
to channel radio you're going to want to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.020 
to channel radio you're going to want to
buy<00:01:22.710> something<00:01:23.009> else

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
buy something else

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.280 
buy something else
Futaba<00:01:25.640> or<00:01:26.640> something<00:01:27.450> nicer<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.110> is

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
Futaba or something nicer like that is

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.149 
Futaba or something nicer like that is
what<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.470> recommend<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> three<00:01:31.860> channel

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
what I recommend this is a three channel

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.830 
what I recommend this is a three channel
receiver<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:33.090> pretend<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.630> third

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
receiver but just pretend this third

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.289 
receiver but just pretend this third
channel<00:01:34.200> isn't<00:01:34.439> there<00:01:35.000> because<00:01:36.000> I'm<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.210> to

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
channel isn't there because I'm going to

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.840 
channel isn't there because I'm going to
show<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.479> how<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.840> plug<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:38.400> a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
show you how to plug this in on a

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.530 
show you how to plug this in on a
two-channel<00:01:39.509> radio<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:41.369> what<00:01:42.240> we're<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.479> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
two-channel radio so what we're going to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.889 
two-channel radio so what we're going to
do<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:44.000> first<00:01:45.000> we're<00:01:45.180> going<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.390> flip<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
do is first we're going to flip down the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.690 
do is first we're going to flip down the
number<00:01:46.770> one<00:01:46.950> dip<00:01:47.250> switch<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:48.979> that<00:01:49.979> turns<00:01:50.340> off

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
number one dip switch and that turns off

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.389 
number one dip switch and that turns off
the<00:01:51.500> auxilary<00:01:52.520> function<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.689> Super<00:01:55.049> Bee

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
the auxilary function of the Super Bee

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.429 
the auxilary function of the Super Bee
that's<00:01:56.420> flipping<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.509> down<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.990> what<00:01:58.170> lets

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
that's flipping that down is what lets

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.800 
that's flipping that down is what lets
this<00:01:58.939> function<00:01:59.939> with<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> two-channel<00:02:00.780> radio

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
this function with a two-channel radio

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.920 
this function with a two-channel radio
so<00:02:01.409> we've<00:02:01.530> got<00:02:01.710> number<00:02:02.009> one<00:02:02.189> down<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.930> number

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
so we've got number one down and number

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.410 
so we've got number one down and number
two<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:05.159> because<00:02:05.850> we<00:02:06.000> don't<00:02:06.119> have<00:02:06.240> an

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
two up and because we don't have an

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.529 
two up and because we don't have an
auxilary<00:02:06.810> channel<00:02:07.380> we're<00:02:07.770> gonna<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.539> use

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
auxilary channel we're gonna have to use

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.020 
auxilary channel we're gonna have to use
a<00:02:09.569> splitter<00:02:10.140> cable<00:02:10.379> like<00:02:11.129> this<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.670> got<00:02:11.819> one

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
a splitter cable like this it's got one

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.220 
a splitter cable like this it's got one
male<00:02:12.270> 2

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
male 2

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.490 
male 2
female<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.659> the<00:02:15.659> Super<00:02:15.989> Bee<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.260> going<00:02:16.409> to

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
female and the Super Bee is going to

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.030 
female and the Super Bee is going to
have<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.800> share<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.400> steering<00:02:18.000> channel<00:02:19.040> so

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
have to share the steering channel so

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.559 
have to share the steering channel so
we're<00:02:20.129> going<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.310> plug<00:02:20.519> this<00:02:20.670> into<00:02:20.940> channel

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
we're going to plug this into channel

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.180 
we're going to plug this into channel
one<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:24.420> servo<00:02:24.900> steering<00:02:25.680> servo<00:02:26.040> would

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
one and the servo steering servo would

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.710 
one and the servo steering servo would
go<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.459> one<00:02:26.670> end<00:02:26.879> and<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:28.799> Super<00:02:29.400> Bee<00:02:29.580> will<00:02:30.540> go

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
go in one end and the Super Bee will go

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:40.460 
go in one end and the Super Bee will go
in<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.349> other<00:02:31.620> end<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:35.420> like<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:39.110> I've<00:02:40.110> got<00:02:40.319> my

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
in the other end and like so I've got my

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.319 
in the other end and like so I've got my
transmitter<00:02:41.040> over<00:02:41.250> here<00:02:41.579> I've<00:02:42.030> got<00:02:42.209> the

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
transmitter over here I've got the

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.830 
transmitter over here I've got the
transmitter<00:02:42.810> power<00:02:43.019> turned<00:02:43.379> on<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:45.480> now<00:02:45.750> I'm

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
transmitter power turned on and now I'm

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.869 
transmitter power turned on and now I'm
gonna<00:02:46.019> turn<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.739> receiver<00:02:47.489> on<00:02:52.670> okay

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
gonna turn the receiver on okay

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.750 
gonna turn the receiver on okay
that<00:02:54.090> gave<00:02:54.959> us<00:02:54.989> all<00:02:55.319> our<00:02:55.530> low<00:02:56.069> voltage<00:02:56.489> cutoff

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
that gave us all our low voltage cutoff

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.059 
that gave us all our low voltage cutoff

unplugged these superbee would still

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.360 
unplugged these superbee would still
kill<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.870> engine<00:03:46.260> even<00:03:46.380> without<00:03:46.980> battery

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
your receiver and you lose power a

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.819 
your receiver and you lose power a
regular<00:04:02.879> servo<00:04:03.299> failsafe<00:04:03.569> would<00:04:04.260> not<00:04:04.500> work

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
regular servo failsafe would not work

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.890 
regular servo failsafe would not work
you<00:04:05.669> wouldn't<00:04:05.910> have<00:04:06.000> anything<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.510> power<00:04:06.720> your

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
you wouldn't have anything to power your

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.800 
you wouldn't have anything to power your
servo<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.500> close<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.220> carburetor<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:09.000> your

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
servo to close the carburetor and your

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.759 
servo to close the carburetor and your
engine<00:04:10.019> will<00:04:10.139> just<00:04:10.319> stay<00:04:10.790> running<00:04:11.790> wide<00:04:12.180> open

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
engine will just stay running wide open

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.750 
engine will just stay running wide open
but<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:14.129> Super<00:04:14.459> Bee<00:04:14.669> when<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.419> lose<00:04:15.750> power

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
but the Super Bee when you lose power

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.900 
but the Super Bee when you lose power
because<00:04:17.760> it's<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:18.000> normally<00:04:18.419> closed<00:04:18.720> device<00:04:19.910> it

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
because it's a normally closed device it

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.060 
because it's a normally closed device it
will<00:04:21.150> ground<00:04:21.570> out<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.989> ignition<00:04:22.409> coil<00:04:22.680> and

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
will ground out the ignition coil and

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.930 
will ground out the ignition coil and
stop<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.940> engine

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
stop the engine

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.580 
stop the engine
so<00:04:25.300> if<00:04:25.870> I<00:04:25.960> did<00:04:26.170> this<00:04:26.910> we<00:04:27.910> lost<00:04:28.150> power<00:04:28.420> the<00:04:29.200> Super

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
so if I did this we lost power the Super

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.140 
so if I did this we lost power the Super
Bee<00:04:29.740> would<00:04:30.010> have<00:04:30.160> just<00:04:30.490> killed<00:04:30.790> the<00:04:30.940> engine

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
Bee would have just killed the engine

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.620 
Bee would have just killed the engine
and<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:32.620> car<00:04:32.830> would<00:04:33.010> have<00:04:33.100> stopped<00:04:33.630> instead

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
and the car would have stopped instead

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.590 
and the car would have stopped instead
of<00:04:34.750> running<00:04:34.990> away<00:04:35.850> so<00:04:36.850> that's<00:04:37.120> how<00:04:37.360> these

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
of running away so that's how these

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.950 
of running away so that's how these
Super<00:04:38.050> Bee<00:04:38.200> works<00:04:38.530> on<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:39.930> two-channel<00:04:40.930> radio

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
Super Bee works on a two-channel radio

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.250 
Super Bee works on a two-channel radio
you<00:04:41.770> just<00:04:41.800> need<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.190> Super<00:04:42.640> Bee<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.300> a<00:04:44.080> y

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
you just need the Super Bee and a y

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.620 
you just need the Super Bee and a y
splitter
