00:00:03.354 --> 00:00:06.692
 Hello, everyone, welcome to watch Tech a Look. I am Kevin. 

00:00:06.692 --> 00:00:11.828
 Today, I want to open a box with everyone to introduce the new FSP 

00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:15.060
 Power Supply Products AURUM PRO 1200 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.852
 Is this black box on my desktop. 

00:00:16.852 --> 00:00:19.195
 Actually this AURUM PRO 1200 is outside of it 

00:00:19.195 --> 00:00:21.605
 In fact, there is a very beautiful packaging. 

00:00:21.605 --> 00:00:25.272
 But our staff did not borrow, so I am sorry. 

00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:27.976
 So we will add subtitles next to it. 

00:00:27.976 --> 00:00:30.530
 Let everyone know that it is AURUM PRO 1200 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.847
 This AURUM PRO 1200 offers a very high wattage 

00:00:33.847 --> 00:00:35.361
 Power supply product 

00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:38.275
 And it's perfect for high-end users who are overclocking players. 

00:00:38.275 --> 00:00:40.329
 Or the game player is very suitable 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.058
 Now, we don’t talk much about opening it first. 

00:00:43.058 --> 00:00:46.111
 See what it has inside this time. 

00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:48.609
 In fact, this black box is the second layer of packaging material inside it. 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.281
 So in terms of this packaging material 

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:53.275
 We can see that there are also a lot of cartons inside it. 

00:00:53.275 --> 00:00:57.293
 Come to protect it 

00:00:57.293 --> 00:01:02.244
 We first saw that this is the manual. 

00:01:02.244 --> 00:01:08.945
 This AURUM PRO 1200 has passed the 80PLUS Gold certification. 

00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:13.054
 So better in the efficiency of power supply 

00:01:13.054 --> 00:01:15.944
 And its use temperature will be lower 

00:01:15.944 --> 00:01:21.024
 We now see that it uses a black gold color scheme. 

00:01:21.024 --> 00:01:26.362
 The front side saw a fan of a 13.5 cm FDB liquid bearing 

00:01:26.362 --> 00:01:27.863
 So more durable 

00:01:27.863 --> 00:01:32.574
 And we can see that it uses industrial grade materials as a whole. 

00:01:32.574 --> 00:01:35.138
 And materials for Japanese capacitors 

00:01:35.138 --> 00:01:38.859
 Is the appearance of a matte material 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.197
 We saw the design of its vents 

00:01:42.197 --> 00:01:44.863
 Is a very unique vent of the arrow type 

00:01:44.863 --> 00:01:46.857
 And on the plug of its main power supply 

00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:49.649
 Also used is not the same as the general 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.614
 Is a rectangular hole 

00:01:53.614 --> 00:02:00.561
 We now see this AURUM PRO 1200 

00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:03.527
 It is also very rich in this wiring. 

00:02:03.527 --> 00:02:07.116
 We see a very intimate name below 

00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:10.423
 Tell us what the corresponding plug is. 

00:02:10.423 --> 00:02:13.279
 Then we see that there are two on the side next to it. 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:15.338
 Extra fan connector 

00:02:15.338 --> 00:02:19.781
 So you can connect up to 4 additional fans. 

00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:24.424
 Now let's open this side with us this AURUM PRO 1200 

00:02:24.424 --> 00:02:27.612
 It is a semi-module design 

00:02:27.612 --> 00:02:32.115
 We see some of the main power holes available on the main side. 

00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:37.111
 This 24PIN is connected to the motherboard 

00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:42.940
 And we see that this is 6+2PIN PCIe 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.691
 Can pick up our display card 

00:02:46.691 --> 00:02:52.475
 And we see that this is 4+4PIN 

00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:57.027
 A very exclusive design from this AURUM PRO 1200 FSP 

00:02:57.027 --> 00:02:59.948
 Is the design of the two-group transformer 

00:02:59.948 --> 00:03:02.488
 So it is better to supply this power supply better. 

00:03:02.488 --> 00:03:06.732
 Can provide stability to our system and more durable 

00:03:06.732 --> 00:03:14.010
 The life expectancy is better and the heat is greatly improved. 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.577
 Finally, let's see this package inside. 

00:03:16.577 --> 00:03:17.634
 Very large box 

00:03:17.634 --> 00:03:23.928
 This is the accessory that comes with it, which is very rich in wiring. 

00:03:23.928 --> 00:03:25.199
 We just mentioned 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.681
 Wiring, we see that the AURUM PRO 1200 is available. 

00:03:28.681 --> 00:03:31.332
 A lot of COMBO combinations 

00:03:31.332 --> 00:03:37.450
 Can provide a variety of users different needs to choose the wiring material 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.444
 Not much to say that we are opening now 

00:03:41.444 --> 00:03:44.867
 The first thing we see is the main power cord. 

00:03:44.867 --> 00:03:49.002
 We just mentioned that the interface part of it is different. 

00:03:49.002 --> 00:03:56.858
 This main power cord provides 16A 250V very high wattage 

00:03:56.858 --> 00:03:58.244
 Power Supplier 

00:03:58.244 --> 00:04:02.701
 So it’s very good on the materials. 

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:06.662
 And the additional power supply holes for the two fans we mentioned earlier. 

00:04:06.662 --> 00:04:09.108
 So it can connect up to 4 fans 

00:04:09.108 --> 00:04:16.025
 This is the wiring of its power supply 

00:04:16.025 --> 00:04:20.198
 Next we see that there are a lot of noodles here. 

00:04:20.198 --> 00:04:24.109
 No matter which provides up to 10 SATA interfaces 

00:04:24.109 --> 00:04:28.082
 And up to 8 6+2PIN power jacks 

00:04:28.082 --> 00:04:35.367
 You can pick up your extra card device 

00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:36.982
 Now we open this one 

00:04:36.982 --> 00:04:40.487
 We see that it is quite long 

00:04:40.487 --> 00:04:44.450
 This one is one of the COMBO combinations 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.326
 We saw this is there are two SATA lines 

00:04:47.326 --> 00:04:53.034
 Then there are two Molex power jacks 

00:04:53.034 --> 00:04:58.425
 Take this phone over the power cord. 

00:04:58.425 --> 00:05:02.530
 We saw that its wire is very thin 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.701
 I don’t know how much thinner than my mobile phone. 

00:05:04.701 --> 00:05:07.174
 So when installing your computer 

00:05:07.174 --> 00:05:09.978
 If you want to go back the plate wire 

00:05:09.978 --> 00:05:12.867
 This wire is very convenient when walking away. 

00:05:12.867 --> 00:05:16.685
 I am not afraid that your back cover will not cover. 

00:05:16.685 --> 00:05:21.525
 Sorry forgot to introduce this package with the gift inside. 

00:05:21.525 --> 00:05:26.395
 Very special universal power socket adapter 

00:05:26.395 --> 00:05:29.131
 We see this very special 

00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:33.806
 There are three socket heads after the total can be disassembled. 

00:05:33.806 --> 00:05:36.451
 I have introduced this power supply before. 

00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:39.307
 We saw that this socket is very special and is square 

00:05:39.307 --> 00:05:42.043
 And this plug is a 220V plug. 

00:05:42.043 --> 00:05:44.388
 So if you use it in Taiwan, 

00:05:44.388 --> 00:05:47.968
 Use this universal socket adapter 

00:05:47.968 --> 00:05:52.713
 You can easily use it. 

00:05:52.713 --> 00:05:54.054
 That is the introduction today. 

00:05:54.054 --> 00:05:57.687
 So overall this FSP AURUM PRO 1200 

00:05:57.687 --> 00:06:02.221
 Really, I think its material is very good with the design above it. 

00:06:02.221 --> 00:06:06.883
 Then come back to its security protection and provide a lot of multiple protection mechanisms. 

00:06:06.883 --> 00:06:11.239
 So if your temperature is too high it may turn on 

00:06:11.239 --> 00:06:14.210
 This security protection is very intimate. 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.150
 This is the introduction of today. 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.544
