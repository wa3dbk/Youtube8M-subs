00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
pretty fast I was a little bit skeptical

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.980 
pretty fast I was a little bit skeptical
because<00:00:19.800> during<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.000> holidays<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.420> saw<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> lot

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
ended up using a code and I got honey I

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.650 
ended up using a code and I got honey I
think<00:00:55.379> $100<00:00:56.160> off<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.699> use<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> code<00:00:57.329> I've<00:00:57.510> got

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
think $100 off I use the code I've got

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.580 
think $100 off I use the code I've got
hundred<00:00:57.960> dollars<00:00:58.289> off<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.340> so<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.480> opened<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
hundred dollars off and so I opened the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.950 
hundred dollars off and so I opened the
package<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.280> was<00:01:02.399> expecting<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.629> guess

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
package and I was expecting that I guess

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.310 
package and I was expecting that I guess
a<00:01:03.989> different<00:01:04.320> type<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:06.020> traveling<00:01:07.020> case

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
a different type of traveling case

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.710 
a different type of traveling case
because<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.460> everyone<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:08.790> YouTube<00:01:09.330> with

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
because I see everyone on YouTube with

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.080 
because I see everyone on YouTube with
the<00:01:09.990> cylinder<00:01:10.380> looking<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.820> came

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the cylinder looking one but this came

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.490 
the cylinder looking one but this came
in<00:01:12.299> less<00:01:13.700> rectangle<00:01:14.700> box<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.780> how<00:01:16.470> I

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
in less rectangle box and this is how I

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.490 
in less rectangle box and this is how I
guess<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.280> new<00:01:17.549> cases<00:01:18.210> where<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.259> hold

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
guess the new cases where you just hold

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.190 
guess the new cases where you just hold
it<00:01:20.180> with<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.840> handle<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.720> there's<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.810> zipper

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.300 

so<00:01:28.670> it's<00:01:29.670> hard<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.939> know<00:01:30.060> one<00:01:30.509> hand<00:01:31.100> comes<00:01:32.100> out

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
so it's hard to know one hand comes out

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.800 
so it's hard to know one hand comes out
like<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.210> black<00:01:34.310> it<00:01:35.310> has<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.630> new<00:01:36.630> me

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
like this and it's black it has a new me

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:53.929 
like this and it's black it has a new me
sign<00:01:44.810> okay<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:48.229> it's<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.470> pretty<00:01:52.939> pretty

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
sign okay so it's a pretty pretty

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.120 
sign okay so it's a pretty pretty
troubling<00:01:54.780> case

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
troubling case

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.950 
troubling case
it<00:01:56.250> feels<00:01:56.640> nice<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> laptop<00:01:59.390> like<00:02:00.390> those

it feels nice like a laptop like those

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.109 
it feels nice like a laptop like those
laptop<00:02:01.409> cases<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:04.310> there's<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.369> zipper<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.970> has

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
it's nice and tidy and it fits in one

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.440 
it's nice and tidy and it fits in one
area<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:23.069> could<00:03:23.310> just<00:03:23.609> slip<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.180> under<00:03:24.420> the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
area you could just slip it under the

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.300 
area you could just slip it under the
sink<00:03:25.340> or<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.639> side<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.840> your<00:03:28.049> counter<00:03:28.680> and

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
it zips up and it has these little I

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.729 
it zips up and it has these little I
guess<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:34.880> think<00:03:35.880> it's<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.120> flexible<00:03:37.579> material

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
guess I think it's a flexible material

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.020 
guess I think it's a flexible material
so<00:03:40.739> that<00:03:40.799> you<00:03:40.980> could<00:03:41.630> take<00:03:42.630> out<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.650> one

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
so that you could take out the one

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.530 
so that you could take out the one
attachments<00:03:45.030> easily<00:03:46.730> so<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:48.000> has<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.209> five

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
attachments easily so it has a five

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.720

millimeter the rivers and the pearl wand
so<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:09.019> could<00:04:09.170> see<00:04:09.379> the<00:04:09.590> three<00:04:10.629> barrels<00:04:11.629> here

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
so you could see the three barrels here

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.860 
so you could see the three barrels here
the<00:04:12.610> 1925<00:04:13.610> and<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.060> 32<00:04:14.750> millimeter<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:16.870> also

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
the 1925 and the 32 millimeter and also

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.270 
the 1925 and the 32 millimeter and also
on<00:04:17.959> this<00:04:18.109> side<00:04:18.380> you<00:04:18.620> can<00:04:18.769> see<00:04:20.829> you<00:04:21.829> can<00:04:22.010> see<00:04:22.160> the

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
on this side you can see you can see the

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.590 
on this side you can see you can see the
reverse<00:04:22.720> it's<00:04:23.720> hard<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.050> take<00:04:24.229> it<00:04:24.350> up<00:04:25.449> well<00:04:26.449> not

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
reverse it's hard to take it up well not

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.570 
reverse it's hard to take it up well not
hard<00:04:26.870> you<00:04:27.050> just<00:04:27.260> need<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.710> have<00:04:27.979> both<00:04:28.250> hands

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
hard you just need to have both hands

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.310 
hard you just need to have both hands
would<00:04:28.820> be<00:04:28.850> way<00:04:29.600> easier<00:04:30.220> so<00:04:31.540> there<00:04:32.540> is<00:04:32.960> the

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
would be way easier so there is the

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.969 
would be way easier so there is the
reverse<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:34.280> it's<00:04:34.400> a<00:04:34.490> nice<00:04:34.699> material

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
reverse and it's a nice material

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.689 
reverse and it's a nice material
it's<00:04:36.979> all<00:04:37.070> black<00:04:37.510> we're<00:04:38.510> smooth<00:04:38.960> very<00:04:39.290> shiny

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
it's all black we're smooth very shiny

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:56.070 
it's all black we're smooth very shiny
and<00:04:40.699> then<00:04:48.400> it<00:04:49.400> slips<00:04:49.789> right<00:04:50.060> in<00:04:53.199> right<00:04:54.199> in

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
and then it slips right in right in

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.909 
and then it slips right in right in
that's<00:04:57.080> so<00:04:57.350> nice

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
that's so nice

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:08.350 
that's so nice
nice<00:04:58.550> and<00:04:58.760> tidy<00:04:58.940> and<00:04:59.870> then<00:05:00.110> this<00:05:00.610> is<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:07.360> we

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
nice and tidy and then this is the we

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
nice and tidy and then this is the we
handle<00:05:08.840> part<00:05:09.080> but<00:05:09.889> it's<00:05:10.039> hard<00:05:10.280> to<00:05:10.340> remove<00:05:10.760> that

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.300 

there<00:05:18.380> we<00:05:18.500> go<00:05:19.330> okay<00:05:20.330> so<00:05:20.560> this<00:05:21.560> is<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.919> new<00:05:22.130> me

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
there we go okay so this is the new me

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.040 
there we go okay so this is the new me
handle<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:23.840> five<00:05:24.229> says<00:05:24.950> five<00:05:25.280> and<00:05:25.550> one<00:05:26.050> and

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
handle the five says five and one and

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.390 
handle the five says five and one and
there's<00:05:27.260> the<00:05:27.620> lock<00:05:28.610> and<00:05:28.940> unlock<00:05:30.280> for<00:05:31.280> the

there's the lock and unlock for the

there's the lock and unlock for the
attachment<00:05:31.970> and<00:05:32.720> then<00:05:32.960> you<00:05:33.139> have<00:05:33.410> the<00:05:33.919> on<00:05:34.340> and
