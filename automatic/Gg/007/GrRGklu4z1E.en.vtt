our aerial footage on the reviews we do
for<00:00:20.730> nitro<00:00:21.060> planes<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.570> i<00:00:22.289> don't<00:00:22.470> like<00:00:22.560> using

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
for nitro planes and i don't like using

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.830 
for nitro planes and i don't like using
the<00:00:23.250> new<00:00:23.430> samples<00:00:24.240> we<00:00:24.330> get<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.570> just<00:00:24.750> because

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
the new samples we get it just because

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.810 
the new samples we get it just because
it<00:00:25.170> really<00:00:25.380> destroys<00:00:25.920> every<00:00:26.189> time<00:00:26.369> i<00:00:26.400> take<00:00:26.670> off

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
it really destroys every time i take off

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.269 
it really destroys every time i take off
the<00:00:26.970> camry<00:00:27.359> there<00:00:27.510> peels<00:00:27.810> off<00:00:27.990> paint<00:00:28.349> peels

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
the camry there peels off paint peels

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.070 
the camry there peels off paint peels
off<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.670> feels<00:00:30.060> off<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.840> pretty

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
off this feels off that so it pretty

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.100 
off this feels off that so it pretty
much<00:00:31.250> destroys<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.550> foam<00:00:32.850> painted<00:00:33.270> planes<00:00:33.570> we

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
much destroys the foam painted planes we

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.740 
much destroys the foam painted planes we
get<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.469> for<00:00:34.649> sample<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.460> found<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.390> display

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
get in for sample so I found the display

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.209 
get in for sample so I found the display
now<00:00:36.930> I'm<00:00:36.989> going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> designate<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.950> for<00:00:38.190> that

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
now I'm going to designate just for that

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.940 
now I'm going to designate just for that
it's<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.030> 60<00:00:39.390> size<00:00:39.570> trainer<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.200> found<00:00:40.739> laying

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
it's a 60 size trainer I found laying

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.340 
it's a 60 size trainer I found laying
around<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:42.450> being<00:00:42.690> sickly<00:00:43.050> size

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
around for it being sickly size

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.049 
around for it being sickly size
obviously<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:44.010> gonna<00:00:44.100> be<00:00:44.219> very<00:00:44.280> stable<00:00:44.850> up

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
obviously it's gonna be very stable up

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.970 
obviously it's gonna be very stable up
in<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> air<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.140> could<00:00:46.260> carry<00:00:46.410> tons<00:00:46.770> of

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
in the air and it could carry tons of

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.069 
in the air and it could carry tons of

esc is an ad ftse should be more than

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.679 
esc is an ad ftse should be more than
enough<00:01:04.890> power<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.760> show<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.330> guys<00:01:06.420> it's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
at 3,300 sky lipo 40 c 6 l so she would

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.100 
at 3,300 sky lipo 40 c 6 l so she would
be<00:01:13.710> way<00:01:13.979> way<00:01:14.220> more<00:01:14.250> than<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.700> power<00:01:15.060> i<00:01:15.330> really

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110

want<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> see<00:01:16.530> what<00:01:16.920> Marshall<00:01:17.340> flight<00:01:17.549> time<00:01:17.790> is

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
want to see what Marshall flight time is

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.609 
want to see what Marshall flight time is
so<00:01:18.180> that's<00:01:18.390> why<00:01:18.600> I'm<00:01:18.869> bringing<00:01:19.020> her<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.320> today

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
so I could actually see how much fly

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.570 
so I could actually see how much fly
time<00:01:21.750> i'll<00:01:21.960> be<00:01:21.990> getting<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.590> her<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.950> for

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.109 
time i'll be getting out of her and for
sure<00:01:23.790> knows<00:01:23.939> i<00:01:24.150> got<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.750> t<00:01:25.229> pro<00:01:25.580> sg50<00:01:26.580> tens<00:01:26.850> I

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
sure knows i got for t pro sg50 tens I

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.780 
sure knows i got for t pro sg50 tens I
test<00:01:27.869> them<00:01:28.020> out<00:01:28.259> back<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.799> office<00:01:29.040> seem

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
test them out back in the office seem

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.359 
test them out back in the office seem
great<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.810> believe<00:01:31.380> they<00:01:31.500> should<00:01:31.560> handle

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
great so I I believe they should handle

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.249 
great so I I believe they should handle
great<00:01:32.579> here<00:01:32.820> they're<00:01:33.450> pretty<00:01:33.600> much<00:01:33.720> your

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
great here they're pretty much your

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.890 
great here they're pretty much your
standard<00:01:34.439> servo<00:01:35.040> other<00:01:35.610> than<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> put<00:01:36.720> my

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
standard servo other than that I put my

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.289 
standard servo other than that I put my
own<00:01:37.049> radio<00:01:37.350> system<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.979> there<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.850> just

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
own radio system in there and I just

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.060 
own radio system in there and I just
can't<00:01:39.780> wait<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.049> flyer<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.500> let's<00:01:40.680> plug<00:01:40.890> her<00:01:41.040> in

maybe i guess i would be some good shot
maybe<00:06:15.550> showing<00:06:15.940> how<00:06:16.210> inverted<00:06:16.779> looks<00:06:17.020> on<00:06:17.770> a

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
maybe showing how inverted looks on a

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.399 
maybe showing how inverted looks on a
plane<00:06:18.190> or<00:06:18.580> knife<00:06:18.849> edge<00:06:19.120> whatever<00:06:19.509> but<00:06:19.810> aren't

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:20.409
