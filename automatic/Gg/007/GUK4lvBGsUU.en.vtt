00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.650
 summary I have now 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.720

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.060

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.040
 yet I have that is streamed and 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.300
 I'll show you something but managed 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.379
 I have two hours or are you looking in 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.030
 I still have yours 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.230
 I had to stream then but 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.449
 no more desire I still have no 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.120
 By the way, jetpack is what it's all about 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:46.059
 simply tell you with missing 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.350
 I have two dates I have I show you 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.710
 that's what you have here I only have 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.870
 watched how to do that first I go 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.239
 Sometimes commute over something comes to me 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.940
 really only two leathers are missing 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.140
 People I'll show you something here 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.340
 everything still built but i want now 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.840
 let me show you for a moment 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.489
 here 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.780
 At first I wanted to have it jetpack 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.399
 I'll do that correctly 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.970
 many things already done so in 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.320
 I've got the flight skepis offenders 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.110
 I have everything in the trunk 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.789
 the only thing missing was what 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.560
 can not get done if these are impulses 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.350
 item daktiker I just did not know 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.119
 like they go here, you have one 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.009
 Break on fans and flood french moser 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.509
 for that you need then but still energy 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.829
 is a monastery and then you need it 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:31.360
 again magna crucible like that is 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.070
 then we need gusto and such 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.000
 then you get somehow energy loses 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.150
 sound out or something 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.460
 So I have everything very complicated 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.530
 I could not manage when 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.880
 you needed for the magna crucible 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.000
 lands brakes and i had no me 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.290
 could not the Lower Bavaria for nice 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.460
 happen I need just a jetpack 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.320
 so and then I wanted this one here 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.060
 make dearest and jetpack and I have 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.409
 all I really see here the 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.060
 I am pleased that this here 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.229
 dearest and what I have and lies 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.159
 to the flight skepis offenders where is there beating 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.469
 skepticism 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.840
 I have these two runways which I have for 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.770
 the other jetpack needed to do that 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.149
 I me then but eventually I was 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.340
 can also do the liter and jpeg for that 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.780
 use and have the is already on 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.160
 any case better than this electric 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.079
 jetpack so I he made 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.019
 is a bit worse yet 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:18.489
 we can just improve and you see 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.900
 I already have a few doctors and such 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.160
 I have a bit of what had gone 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.230
 I still there 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.000
 but less here I have this flood 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.000
 flood forced break trade just stopped 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.110
 not because of this market cristÃ³bal 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.300
 compression your times I have because I 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.550
 that needed the hard thing for that 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.190
 hunting 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.370
 yes and I have many things right 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.820
 the only thing missing is so here 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.320
 this flight is skeptical and is the first one 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.590
 only thing missing is lee is one 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.550
 nice tuning breakthrough eight I have 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.380
 By the way, six leathers are the six stores of 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.840
 I hope you will do that 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.100
 this was okay if i can you yes 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.930
 still take back I still have 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.310
 not used and i just have 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.540
 no cow found I can not stop 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.860
 I can not fly 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.520
 now so many doctors actually drive 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.350
 can 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.790
 he just did not go then I did 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.960
 but somewhere ruby then found 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.180
 I did not stop my ruby 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.500
 a bit over at the end you see or 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.940
 I 've got quite a few doctors 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.710
 little body left 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.150
 the pulse rider I have then so 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.600
 I have the stream is his name 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.860
 done with hits from energy conduits 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.570
 I connected that and here at the 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.760
 save and furnish connected the power 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.350
 That's why faster than that 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.670
 normal fairness and brad has just that 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.800
 I show you this powder very briefly 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.350
 that is really faster always 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.390
 three left you can see that it goes 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.690
 really zack zack gives that and he has 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.590
 everything made ready immediately and yes 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.060
 I do not know what I mean now 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.440
 I'll make next partner because I 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.420
 that was first what to make them 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.440
 everyone wanted to watch tv like that 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.240
 then maybe 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.300
 So I will eventually get up 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.290
 connect or so with this clock 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.000
 conecon joke but I need the new one 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.980
 magic server earlier 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.270
 I look at that I figured out it myself 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.260
 but if you know how that works 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.270
 will you have the time please in the 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.560
 Comments how to do that 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.910
 then so I've also been the 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.640
 Ranch done a lot then you have to yes 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.160
 somehow I have must have to mean 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.330
 Here then sun and that was 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.500
 actually for the rough thing I did 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.150
 I've got a lot of white too 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.920
 pied if you know that here 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.320
 you can really get it all over again 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.640
 at some point I'm still thinking soon 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.070
 I hear my opinion and put here 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.300
 somewhere that drive the machine 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.220
 because I'm there I definitely need 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.650
 was 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.600
 So I need some physicians still 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.850
 but as I said first jetpack stands 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.980
 in the foreground and this thing thing 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.140
 I would need to recharge for the jet 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.820
 I already have a pack 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.290
 written that stands with and at 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.040
 less or so and there I can do that 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.810
 through use 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.010
 later he still has a detective because of 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.790
 Exaggerated as the stuff I think 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.980
 also come out 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.050
 and yes, maybe I'll see 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.320
 Two leather from somewhere and then I can 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.830
 finally make something cool 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.060
 the best would be if now even if i did 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.650
 not even a consumption and loads 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.790
 but also something else I went 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.400
 really does not want iron for it now 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.050
 but honestly, just waste it 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.270
 then we will do that 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.530
 Someday else write something 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.210
 I can somehow still do that because 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.700
 I do not really know myself 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.510
 blatant and maybe write 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.010
 me too with the others maybe 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.360
 have the one task what I do 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:17.280
 could or was watching something 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.740
 I watch how I really have to look like 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.970
 I can fill this space so that I 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.710
 but the pope does a bit 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.830
 I also want to be productive or 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.419
 until then and yes I think there is 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.800
 times more often see live stream so in the 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.780
 week, I may a right and is primus 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.340
 I think then will initiate, too 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.510
 I give the week after do it 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.620
 why did I think twice? 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.510
 no idea he has a bit different 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.160
 in review comments from see you 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.160
 eventually go again
