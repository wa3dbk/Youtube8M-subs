00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.430
 with over six and a half billion 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.600
 people on earth we have one 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.589
 reached the limit 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.309
 we have to change something we can not 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.570
 continue as before 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.899
 because of our abuse of 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.119
 resources of the outbreak of epidemics 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.909
 global warming of shortage 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.680
 fossil energy sources due to 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.960
 war hunger weather disasters 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.850
 heart attacks suicides and one 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.130
 creeping economic collapse 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.259
 Let us approach ecological collapse 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.270
 how can we solve all these problems? 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.820
 what is the answer to this 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.899
 challenges from where will the 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.360
 answers come 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.550
 in the course of history are always 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.170
 again real knowledge explosions 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.530
 occurred the life of the people 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.300
 fundamentally revolutionized 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.340
 how can the explosive 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.710
 evolution of primitive prehistoric man 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.740
 explain about 100,000 years ago 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.380
 tremendous progress in architecture 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.969
 mathematics and astronomy made 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.189
 such a sudden increase in knowledge 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.110
 and information are always in 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.130
 great epochs of civilization 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.799
 occurred 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.680
 apparently just in time for bigger ones 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.759
 to prevent disasters 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.710
 from the ancient 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.410
 astronomy about the religion until the 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.720
 Law of the sculpture of the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.610
 art of renaissance from the advent of 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.560
 Shipping for the use of electricity 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.230
 to the light bulb and the 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.989
 Turntable of film and television 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.079
 on the atomic bomb of automobiles and 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.549
 planes to space travel 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.549
 computers and internet 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.900
 One thing is for sure the explosion of the 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.150
 knowledge is growing exponentially 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.409
 In the last 100 years we have more 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.450
 know accumulated 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.999
 as in the entire history of 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.920
 humanity with this tremendous knowledge 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:44.560
 we can either destroy ourselves or 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.959
 Enlightenment will be the next 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.329
 wave of new knowledge usher in which 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.730
 to save mankind 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:55.419
 there is hope for mankind and 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.590
 if so where does she come from and will she 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.590
 be there in time 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.510
 No no 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.310
 in the sixties has nasa 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.930
 people sent to the moon 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.549
 but still we have no planets in 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.080
 our galaxy discovered on those 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.080
 human life would be possible 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.700
 the earth is the precious jewel of the earth 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.740
 we are really known cosmos 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.130
 ready for the loss of our home 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.130
 take risk 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.640
 a 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.030
 the earth will be forthcoming 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.570
 environmental collapse survive 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.860
 but what about us this is maybe 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.350
 our last chance the 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.040
 challenges us to be imminent 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.260
 master 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.040
 every day will be talented children 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.810
 born 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.790
 it only takes a little bit 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.280
 awesome i am around the world too 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.989
 revolutionize 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.030
 if we understand how we do this 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.540
 best promote talented children 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.030
 can 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.030
 then maybe there is hope
