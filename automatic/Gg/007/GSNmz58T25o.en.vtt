00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
and different and I'm not just saying

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.359 
and different and I'm not just saying
that<00:01:50.659> because<00:01:50.899> I'm<00:01:51.110> terrible<00:01:51.470> at<00:01:51.590> Battlefield

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.770 

door<00:01:55.369> right<00:01:55.549> maybe<00:01:55.729> as<00:01:55.880> part<00:01:55.909> of<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.479> reason

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
door right maybe as part of the reason

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.180 
door right maybe as part of the reason
we<00:01:57.140> already<00:01:57.380> know<00:01:57.470> that<00:01:57.500> battlefront<00:01:58.070> does

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190

we already know that battlefront does
away<00:01:58.310> with<00:01:58.430> aiming-down-sights<00:01:58.880> something

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
away with aiming-down-sights something

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.060 
away with aiming-down-sights something
that's<00:01:59.869> integral<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.619> battlefield

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
that's integral to the battlefield

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.859 
that's integral to the battlefield
experience<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:01.790> already<00:02:02.149> we're<00:02:02.450> on<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.720> right

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
experience so already we're on the right

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.419 
experience so already we're on the right
