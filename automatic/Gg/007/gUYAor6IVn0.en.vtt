00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
don't think anyone should ever try to

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:10.700 
don't think anyone should ever try to
swing<00:00:10.019> my<00:00:10.170> cocaine

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
swing my cocaine

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.370 
swing my cocaine
I<00:00:10.740> mean<00:00:11.700> Hogan<00:00:12.420> didn't<00:00:12.660> swing<00:00:12.870> like<00:00:13.019> anybody

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
I mean Hogan didn't swing like anybody

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.650 
I mean Hogan didn't swing like anybody
else<00:00:13.610> and<00:00:14.610> he<00:00:14.670> had<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.000> best<00:00:15.120> swing<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:15.599> I

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
else and he had the best swing so I

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.570 
else and he had the best swing so I
think<00:00:15.929> everyone's<00:00:16.650> an<00:00:16.830> individual<00:00:17.279> and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
think everyone's an individual and

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.849 
think everyone's an individual and
everyone<00:00:17.940> should<00:00:18.380> build<00:00:19.380> differently<00:00:19.800> in

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
everyone should build differently in

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.200 
everyone should build differently in
different<00:00:19.920> body<00:00:20.279> shapes<00:00:20.580> different<00:00:20.850> athletic

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
different body shapes different athletic

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.939 
different body shapes different athletic
ability<00:00:21.480> different<00:00:21.720> flexibility<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.920> you

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
ability different flexibility so you

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.580 
ability different flexibility so you
have<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.369> take<00:00:23.970> advice<00:00:24.390> swing<00:00:24.960> advice<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.439> my
