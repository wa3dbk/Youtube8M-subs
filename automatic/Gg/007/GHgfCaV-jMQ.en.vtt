00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
so we're seeing quite a bit of gameplay

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.250 
so we're seeing quite a bit of gameplay
right<00:00:29.369> off<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.699> get-go<00:00:29.880> machine<00:00:30.720> guns<00:00:30.960> were

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
right off the get-go machine guns were

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.650 
right off the get-go machine guns were
seeing<00:00:31.590> rifles<00:00:32.099> we're<00:00:32.430> seeing<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.030> beautiful

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
seeing rifles we're seeing the beautiful

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.990 
seeing rifles we're seeing the beautiful
new<00:00:34.260> particle<00:00:34.800> effects<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> engine<00:00:35.700> has

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
new particle effects that the engine has

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.569 
new particle effects that the engine has
one<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> most<00:00:37.170> interesting<00:00:38.100> things<00:00:38.340> I

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
one of the most interesting things I

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.770 
one of the most interesting things I
think<00:00:38.850> about<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.510> they're

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
think about this is that they're

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.740 
think about this is that they're
bringing<00:00:40.140> back<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.649> rocket<00:00:41.100> launcher<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.750> no

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
bringing back the rocket launcher and no

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.090 
bringing back the rocket launcher and no
this<00:00:42.960> isn't<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.320> rocket<00:00:43.649> launcher<00:00:43.950> you're

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
this isn't a rocket launcher you're

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.950 
this isn't a rocket launcher you're
thinking<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.670> we're<00:00:45.360> talking<00:00:45.629> about<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
thinking of it we're talking about the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.160 
thinking of it we're talking about the
rock<00:00:46.170> dash<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.980> launcher<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.910> what<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.960> does

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
rock dash it launcher and what it does

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.799 
rock dash it launcher and what it does
it's<00:00:49.469> pretty<00:00:49.710> much<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> catapult<00:00:50.879> gun<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
it's pretty much a catapult gun it

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.299 
it's pretty much a catapult gun it
shoots<00:00:52.079> anything<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.829> pick<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
shoots anything that you pick up in the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.010 
shoots anything that you pick up in the
world<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.090> even<00:00:54.239> see<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:54.989> that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
world and we can even see here that

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.660
