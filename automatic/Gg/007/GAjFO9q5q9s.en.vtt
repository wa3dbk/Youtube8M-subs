00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.089 

again<00:00:23.400> there's<00:00:23.640> four<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:25.320> kit<00:00:25.590> we<00:00:25.619> use

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
again there's four in the kit we use

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.300 
again there's four in the kit we use
three<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.910> make<00:00:27.720> our<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.289> use<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.800> make<00:00:29.009> three

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
three to make our we use we make three

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.790 
three to make our we use we make three
gastropexy

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
gastropexy

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.400 
gastropexy
so<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.160> safe<00:00:32.400> track<00:00:32.669> technique<00:00:33.379> where<00:00:34.379> we

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
so this is safe track technique where we

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.990 
so this is safe track technique where we
advance<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.250> needle<00:00:35.370> giving<00:00:35.850> negative

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
advance the needle giving negative

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.420 
advance the needle giving negative
pressure<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.720> as<00:00:36.840> soon<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.260> see<00:00:37.500> air<00:00:38.040> in

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
pressure and as soon as we see air in

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.500 
pressure and as soon as we see air in
the<00:00:38.670> syringe<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.809> want<00:00:40.019> to<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.260> air<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.510> we

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the syringe we want to see air in the we

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.119 
the syringe we want to see air in the we
want<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.720> see<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> needle<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.470> the<00:00:43.680> bowel

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
want to see the needle in the bowel

00:00:44.129 --> 00:01:00.530 
want to see the needle in the bowel
lumen<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:55.369> we<00:00:56.369> release<00:00:56.729> the<00:00:57.000> suture<00:00:59.360> pull<00:01:00.360> down

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
lumen so we release the suture pull down

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.740 
lumen so we release the suture pull down
on<00:01:00.720> the<00:01:00.869> wing<00:01:01.369> advance<00:01:02.369> the<00:01:02.610> plunger<00:01:03.059> delivers

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
on the wing advance the plunger delivers

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:14.190 
on the wing advance the plunger delivers
the<00:01:03.989> T<00:01:04.320> fastener

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.990 

down<00:01:15.200> on<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:15.470> wing<00:01:15.770> release<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.490> suture

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
down on the wing release the suture

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.590 
down on the wing release the suture
advance<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.260> plunger<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:19.180> then<00:01:20.180> pull<00:01:20.420> the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
advance the plunger and then pull the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
advance the plunger and then pull the
needle<00:01:20.900> out

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.720 

so<00:01:37.810> release<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.080> suture<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:40.250> you<00:01:40.340> just<00:01:40.520> fold

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
so release the suture and you just fold

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.420 
so release the suture and you just fold
this<00:01:40.940> down<00:01:41.000> snap<00:01:41.780> it<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.140> that<00:01:42.710> pops<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.220> t

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
this down snap it and that pops the t

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.870 
this down snap it and that pops the t
