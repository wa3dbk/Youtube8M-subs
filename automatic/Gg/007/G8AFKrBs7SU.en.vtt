00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello people from the underworld and beyond 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.770
 maybe thousand 389 commenting this video of 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.950
 minecraft and as you read in the 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.980
 video title this video will do 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.719
 lucky blocks without mods but first of all 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.609
 I would like to explain more or less of what 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.650
 my channel is going to go because if not on youtube 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.869
 this base in the first video and I 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.900
 I would like to explain that my channel is going to be 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.500
 especially gaming and I'm going to upload 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.750
 minecraft gta iv several things more than me 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.450
 like to upload to my channel because I think 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.710
 that are going to be pretty fun like that 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.489
 let's come, let's start with the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.920
 video and how to make look and blog without mods 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.399
 it's pretty easy if we need a 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.309
 rif block or gold bullion and most 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.840
 important a block of commands that the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.640
 block of commands would be considered of 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.300
 way we put bar give us and writer 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.649
 space 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.200
 eg minecraft space two points and what 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.970
 we put command block enter 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.290
 and it will give us as you see the block of 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.380
 commandos well we're going to place the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.970
 command block here is worth and a 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.730
 Once we have it in place, we click on it 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.650
 right and in the description of the video 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.410
 you will see a link that will take a page 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.270
 where you can copy the mode there is the mod 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.350
 I forgive the command once you have it 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.170
 copied you come here and put it this is 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.300
 the whole command is super long so that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.500
 you go to the page, the copies and because if 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.860
 not writing the good thing is that we 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.050
 we would die done and there was next to 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.330
 chandon will come out that has already been well 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.400
 the command well we come here we leave the 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.530
 command block and we take the block 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.180
 from redstone the reston block 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.920
 it simply serves to make 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.240
 work all the command that we have there 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.200
 you have to give it energy then 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.720
 we put to one of the sides whatever the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.750
 reston block or qásim crushes and 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.670
 will begin to generate this and then 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.580
 generate this machine from here you see this 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.420
 they are generating there are a lot of things 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.720
 everything and the machine is already set 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.390
 ok here we go to the posters and it puts 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.540
 looking blocks command created by ai ja 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.640
 minecraft that is the creator of the command 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.550
 and jet items get the items we give you 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.850
 and they will give us these things then the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.410
 down we'll see what it's good for 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.560
 this we simply expose here the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.330
 kettle for example here and we have to 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.090
 put this gold block inside the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.060
 cauldron 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.470
 is that I forgive him very well defender 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.019
 but very manco was kicked out of the team 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.050
 basketball because because very bad or good and 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.209
 will put us this kind of campfire so 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.629
 rare so it seems of these camping 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.730
 where they're going to fry clouds and all that weird 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:49.250
 and that's it, this is simply our 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.930
 lucky machine to make the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.510
 front and then what is the 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.730
 paper because the paper serves to destroy 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.260
 this machine because if we give it with a 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.420
 punch or with a pick or something or 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.849
 destroying what we have below are 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.470
 we trace what you have below so 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.000
 is floating and will not be destroyed for 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.549
 destroy the machine it is necessary to throw 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.930
 the paper this and automatically the 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.079
 machine will be destroyed and will leave you another 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.230
 everything you had good time to see 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:19.190
 let's put this back this way and let's go for 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.690
 gold gold is simply the material 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.440
 what we need to build our 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:28.060
 lucky blogs so let's go here and let's 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.069
 the gold with the cv and this will give us this 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.040
 ladies and gentlemen is already the look and blogs 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.110
 so we take it and put it on the ground 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.140
 and here we have the look 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.310
 and this when more alone we will go 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.290
 leaving us what does not need to 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.660
 for what we are going to give to the 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.760
 chest but we are throwing gold and 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.430
 the lucky ones are automatically coming out 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.320
 blogs we take them and we can follow them 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.940
 putting this is fine to do 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.840
 competitions with your friends in 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.000
 plan to see who breaks the fight or 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.370
 We break to see what things die more times 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.350
 well and now I'm going to break a few 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.130
 to measure more or less the things that you 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.840
 can go well we'll start here 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.670
 another thing that you do not break from above or 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.560
 very close to them since they are like 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.000
 half bug ice cream and there are times that if you 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.489
 you approach a lot you like, it does not leave you 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.790
 break them so you have to leave a 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.930
 distance and we're going to start breaking 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.370
 experience you can see things can go 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.520
 random from call me take a 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.960
 sponge experience is like this and a 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.110
 horse armor are things totally 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.990
 different we keep breaking oysters a 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.830
 look and bou with recoil fire power 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.330
 infinity and a clear arrow 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.330
 well see 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.740
 and if it is too far 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.810
 do not move 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.340
 do not come back 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:56.940
 take and good breaking a bucket of water 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.340
 we will surprise and go surprise has 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.990
 stuck this you do for mega gal 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.530
 fence tub 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:08.540
 we go a little pulling with good arrows 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:12.540
 and we keep breaking an ipic ax look 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:16.200
 which has efficiency 10 and luck 3 d 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.880
 to bite today this baba yagá this I think 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.470
 that was the name of a famous witch 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.070
 that all frictions had to be done 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:27.850
 that did something like that to see diamond 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.340
 the lucky is work that comes with sharp 5 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.870
 push 5 aspects and 15 and looting 5 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.540
 equalities this yes that is incredible in 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.450
 they are really a blow not now has given me 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.460
 a hit but it was very effective to see there 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.160
 and things look and it seems that 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.190
 they did not leave you for the blocks a horse 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.500
 well I have my horse takes horse to 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.070
 you 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.680
 to which dates and do not escape to see and 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.270
 another what is good and I said that 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.630
 is all the cobat or is it simply 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.160
 it was that and now once to destroy the 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.380
 machine we come here we click on 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.440
 right to destroy the flour moves 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.170
 well and automatically it will disappear and 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.720
 Well I think the truth is not 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.490
 convenient to destroy it because I do not know 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.170
 how does not bother to town so low 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.820
 land and have it there to be able 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.710
 put it on blogs and that 's it I think 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.690
 It would not bother you very much but well that every 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.669
 one that does it as it wants and now 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.710
 we see that it stays here floating and 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:25.350
 it is not destroyed because this is inactive 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.390
 is now from here it 's as if as if 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.710
 did not exist and another thing we do if 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.110
 we remove the machines is that we no longer 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.480
 let the arms put the profits the 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.370
 the squids will come out with the name of 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.100
 lucky block and that's because 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.670
 this is a word bag of squid and 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.830
 clear will come out of this and you're 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.090
 they will not leave either for every time 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.690
 we are a block and what we will have 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.289
 that generate the machine so let my 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.289
 horse 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:54.800
 taking 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:57.289
 so well that would be all basically 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.309
 and these are the nuclei you make the 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:00.770
 machine the command is in the 

00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:02.629
 description and all that and well I hope 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.699
