00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:34.270 
so I'm just gonna pin a bobby pin
straight<00:02:24.849> across

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:58.910 

saying<00:02:35.280> here<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.970> feel<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> loose<00:02:37.140> piece<00:02:57.920> okay

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
now for the front all you have to do is

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.240 
now for the front all you have to do is
separate<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.180> air<00:03:06.389> as<00:03:06.540> much<00:03:06.780> as<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.109> want<00:03:07.409> and

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
separate the air as much as you want and

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.180 
separate the air as much as you want and
they're<00:03:08.489> not<00:03:08.639> already<00:03:08.849> separate<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:10.319> shape

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
they're not already separate and shape

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.690 
they're not already separate and shape
it

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
it

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:26.000 
it
I<00:03:11.730> usually<00:03:12.629> just<00:03:12.840> separate<00:03:24.470> even<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.560> pieces

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
I usually just separate even the pieces

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.000 
I usually just separate even the pieces
that<00:03:26.189> hang<00:03:26.430> in<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.639> back<00:03:26.819> -<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:27.239> PC<00:03:27.680> will<00:03:28.680> hang

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
that hang in the back - so PC will hang

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.949 
that hang in the back - so PC will hang
a<00:03:29.159> little<00:03:29.489> bit<00:03:29.639> but<00:03:29.819> I<00:03:29.849> don't<00:03:30.120> mind<00:03:30.299> it<00:03:30.540> but

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
a little bit but I don't mind it but

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.759
