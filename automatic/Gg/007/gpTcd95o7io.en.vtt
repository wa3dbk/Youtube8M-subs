00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
planet than a Volvo or a Saab seat so as

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.670 
planet than a Volvo or a Saab seat so as
we<00:01:54.119> go<00:01:54.240> along<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.720> back<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> interior

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
we go along to the back of the interior

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.660 
we go along to the back of the interior
lots<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.729> room<00:01:57.119> inside<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:58.579> station<00:01:59.579> wagon

and of course we got the whole aerial of

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.339 
and of course we got the whole aerial of
cargo<00:02:12.390> that

like on the Mercedes e-class wagons that

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.869 
like on the Mercedes e-class wagons that
you<00:02:18.780> can<00:02:18.959> put<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.769> about<00:02:19.890> 15<00:02:20.219> different

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
you can put it in about 15 different

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.759

they make it's just right into the DNA
of<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.090> curve<00:03:39.329> so<00:03:39.720> one<00:03:39.930> of<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.079> things<00:03:40.260> we're

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
of the curve so one of the things we're

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.589 
of the curve so one of the things we're
going<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.500> demonstrate<00:03:41.069> now<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.669> this<00:03:42.150> blind

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
going to demonstrate now is this blind

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.349 
going to demonstrate now is this blind
spot<00:03:42.870> detection<00:03:43.530> system<00:03:44.340> which<00:03:44.489> is<00:03:44.639> very<00:03:44.669> very

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
spot detection system which is very very

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.420 
spot detection system which is very very
handy<00:03:45.840> should<00:03:46.440> be<00:03:46.560> on<00:03:46.680> all<00:03:46.829> cars<00:03:47.099> in<00:03:47.310> my

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
handy should be on all cars in my

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.710 
handy should be on all cars in my
opinion<00:03:47.729> you<00:03:47.819> see<00:03:47.940> that<00:03:48.060> little<00:03:48.269> light<00:03:48.479> going

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
opinion you see that little light going

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.890 
opinion you see that little light going
on<00:03:48.989> as<00:03:49.229> the<00:03:49.709> chase<00:03:49.979> car<00:03:50.280> passes<00:03:50.849> us<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.299> gives

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
on as the chase car passes us it gives

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.530 
on as the chase car passes us it gives
you<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.079> light<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.470> nice<00:03:52.769> indicator<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:54.090> allows

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
you a light a nice indicator that allows

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.020 
you a light a nice indicator that allows
you<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.440> be<00:03:55.709> able<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:55.949> know<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.489> car<00:03:56.790> is

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
you to be able to know that a car is

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.520 
you to be able to know that a car is
coming<00:03:57.359> up<00:03:57.629> on<00:03:57.780> your<00:03:57.930> left<00:03:58.169> or<00:03:58.349> your<00:03:58.409> right

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
coming up on your left or your right

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.170 
coming up on your left or your right
side<00:03:58.949> there's<00:03:59.250> also<00:03:59.340> one<00:03:59.729> here<00:03:59.939> there's

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
side there's also one here there's

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.969 
side there's also one here there's
cameras<00:04:00.659> mounted<00:04:00.870> under<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.409> mirror<00:04:01.739> and

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
cameras mounted under the mirror and

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.890 
cameras mounted under the mirror and
it's<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.549> great<00:04:02.760> safety<00:04:03.120> feature<00:04:03.540> because

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
it's a great safety feature because

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.950 
it's a great safety feature because
sometimes<00:04:04.319> you're<00:04:04.470> not<00:04:04.500> paying

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
sometimes you're not paying

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
tension and you start to drift out into

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.090 
tension and you start to drift out into
a<00:04:06.640> lane<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.600> of<00:04:07.780> course<00:04:08.020> it's<00:04:08.530> always<00:04:08.770> at<00:04:08.980> the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
a lane and of course it's always at the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.840 
a lane and of course it's always at the
wrong<00:04:09.250> time

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
wrong time

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.480 
wrong time

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
way the navigation system activates here

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.520 
way the navigation system activates here
on<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:57.670> new<00:04:57.790> Volvo<00:04:58.180> xc70<00:04:58.840> just<00:04:59.050> kind<00:04:59.200> of<00:04:59.230> pops

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.040 
on the new Volvo xc70 just kind of pops
out<00:04:59.770> like<00:04:59.830> in<00:05:00.130> a<00:05:00.190> James<00:05:00.520> Bond<00:05:00.850> movie<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.510> show

out like in a James Bond movie and show

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.470 
out like in a James Bond movie and show
the<00:05:02.350> navigation<00:05:02.500> is<00:05:03.070> sent<00:05:04.020> so<00:05:05.040> we're

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
the navigation is sent so we're

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.820 
the navigation is sent so we're
basically<00:05:07.480> tracking<00:05:07.780> our<00:05:08.020> position<00:05:08.500> is<00:05:08.650> there

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
basically tracking our position is there

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.920 
basically tracking our position is there
anything<00:05:09.040> specially<00:05:09.760> on<00:05:09.910> that<00:05:10.360> we<00:05:10.750> should

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
anything specially on that we should

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.870 
anything specially on that we should
know<00:05:11.050> about<00:05:11.290> this<00:05:11.410> navigation<00:05:11.920> system<00:05:12.460> yeah<00:05:12.640> I

know about this navigation system yeah I
think<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.630> big<00:05:13.870> thing<00:05:13.900> is<00:05:14.350> that<00:05:14.380> it's<00:05:15.040> very

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
think the big thing is that it's very

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.230 
think the big thing is that it's very
much<00:05:16.300> in<00:05:16.600> line<00:05:16.840> with<00:05:16.900> my<00:05:17.680> four

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
much in line with my four

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.230 
much in line with my four
you<00:05:19.840> you<00:05:20.050> know<00:05:20.229> it's<00:05:20.680> coming<00:05:20.979> out<00:05:21.250> and<00:05:22.060> it's

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.320 
right my mindset they drive
nice<00:06:11.620> all<00:06:11.890> right<00:06:12.520> and<00:06:12.730> then<00:06:12.820> when<00:06:13.000> you<00:06:13.090> don't

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
nice all right and then when you don't

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.780 
nice all right and then when you don't
want<00:06:13.570> it<00:06:13.750> basically<00:06:14.590> it<00:06:14.710> can<00:06:14.800> be<00:06:14.950> put<00:06:15.160> away<00:06:15.280> and

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
want it basically it can be put away and

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.880 
want it basically it can be put away and
you<00:06:16.570> don't<00:06:16.720> have<00:06:16.810> to<00:06:16.990> have<00:06:17.140> it<00:06:17.170> there<00:06:17.530> and<00:06:17.680> so

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
you don't have to have it there and so

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.890 
you don't have to have it there and so
it's<00:06:18.040> a<00:06:18.130> nice<00:06:18.310> integration<00:06:18.850> and<00:06:19.270> of<00:06:19.660> course

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
it's a nice integration and of course

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.900 
it's a nice integration and of course
the<00:06:20.080> motorized<00:06:20.530> coming<00:06:21.070> up<00:06:21.190> and<00:06:21.340> down<00:06:21.460> just
