00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
on my Spinosaurus skeleton sculpture

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.859 
on my Spinosaurus skeleton sculpture
once<00:00:19.770> I've<00:00:19.980> sculpted<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.790> neck<00:00:21.000> vertebra<00:00:21.599> I

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
once I've sculpted the neck vertebra I

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.040 
once I've sculpted the neck vertebra I
used<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.710> dremel<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.340> carve<00:00:24.529> lots<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.740> detail

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
used a dremel to carve lots of detail

and shape it fantastic stuff so once I
get<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.050> detail<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.760> drill<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
get the detail in it can I drill a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.270 
get the detail in it can I drill a
series<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.600> holes<00:00:43.730> in<00:00:44.730> each<00:00:45.079> in<00:00:46.079> each<00:00:46.290> bone<00:00:46.739> in

series of holes in each in each bone in
the<00:00:47.460> neck<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.950> glue<00:00:50.250> wire<00:00:50.870> into<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.899> holes

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
the neck and I glue wire into the holes

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.880 
the neck and I glue wire into the holes
see<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.129> see<00:00:54.260> I've<00:00:55.260> drilled<00:00:55.680> all

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
shoulders back and then the arms back

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.580 
shoulders back and then the arms back
and<00:01:50.010> it'll<00:01:50.520> sit<00:01:50.820> more<00:01:52.040> all<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.220> way<00:01:54.410> so<00:01:55.410> that

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and it'll sit more all that way so that

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.050 
and it'll sit more all that way so that
it'll<00:01:55.800> be<00:01:55.890> closer<00:01:56.160> to<00:01:56.370> the<00:01:56.460> ground<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:56.880> though

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
it'll be closer to the ground as though

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.610 
it'll be closer to the ground as though
the<00:01:57.630> spinosaurus<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.470> just<00:01:58.710> about<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.130> grab

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
the spinosaurus is just about to grab

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.530 
the spinosaurus is just about to grab
big<00:02:01.620> fish<00:02:04.520> so<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.729> see<00:02:05.940> I've<00:02:06.060> started<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
big fish so you can see I've started the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.930 
big fish so you can see I've started the
spines<00:02:07.280> they<00:02:08.280> won't<00:02:10.310> they<00:02:11.310> won't<00:02:11.340> get<00:02:11.670> much

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
spines they won't they won't get much

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.490 
spines they won't they won't get much
higher<00:02:12.390> than<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:15.020> there's<00:02:16.020> four<00:02:16.260> arm

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
higher than that so there's four arm

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.980 
higher than that so there's four arm
bones<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.850> things

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.630 

yeah<00:02:21.560> they<00:02:21.740> won't<00:02:21.890> get<00:02:22.130> much<00:02:22.340> higher<00:02:22.580> than

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
yeah they won't get much higher than

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.160 
yeah they won't get much higher than
that<00:02:24.100> they<00:02:25.100> kind<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.490> taper<00:02:25.730> off<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.150> then<00:02:26.300> and

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
that they kind of taper off and then and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.870 
that they kind of taper off and then and
then<00:02:27.910> taper<00:02:28.910> back<00:02:29.210> down<00:02:29.570> when<00:02:30.140> they<00:02:30.290> go<00:02:30.880> past

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
then taper back down when they go past

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.670 
then taper back down when they go past
the<00:02:32.290> hip<00:02:33.290> bone<00:02:34.900> into<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.020> base<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.190> tail

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
the hip bone into the base of the tail

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.780 
the hip bone into the base of the tail
well<00:02:39.680> I'll<00:02:39.770> keep<00:02:39.920> going<00:02:40.130> with<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.670> I'll

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
well I'll keep going with it and I'll

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.680 
well I'll keep going with it and I'll
have<00:02:40.820> another<00:02:41.300> video<00:02:41.450> for<00:02:41.990> you<00:02:42.140> all<00:02:42.170> soon
