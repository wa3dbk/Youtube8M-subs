00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
up yesterday was 2997 at walmart see

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:44.000 
up yesterday was 2997 at walmart see
this<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:41.570> it<00:00:42.570> uses<00:00:42.809> different<00:00:43.230> frequencies

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
this and it uses different frequencies

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.389 
this and it uses different frequencies
flow<00:00:44.550> them<00:00:44.760> all<00:00:44.940> three<00:00:45.780> at<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.930> same<00:00:46.050> time<00:00:46.559> so

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
flow them all three at the same time so

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.010 
flow them all three at the same time so
it's<00:00:47.520> channel<00:00:47.820> B<00:00:48.030> there's<00:00:48.360> channel<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.469> C

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
it's channel B there's channel a and C

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.549 
it's channel B there's channel a and C

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
gum there actually is working quite well

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.320 
gum there actually is working quite well
it's<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:39.010> actually<00:02:40.050> flies<00:02:41.050> like<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.470> now

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
it's it actually flies like this now

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.740 
it's it actually flies like this now
instead<00:02:43.330> of<00:02:43.600> more<00:02:43.840> like<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.800> got<00:02:45.580> some<00:02:46.570> no

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
instead of more like that I got some no

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.370 
instead of more like that I got some no
soul<00:02:47.170> flies<00:02:47.560> like<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:51.660> so<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.840> actually<00:02:52.989> does

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
soul flies like that so it actually does

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.240 
soul flies like that so it actually does
work<00:02:53.680> which<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.940> remote<00:02:55.239> here<00:02:56.040> really<00:02:57.040> didn't

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
work which the remote here really didn't

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.210 
work which the remote here really didn't
like<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.580> throttle<00:02:58.060> gets<00:02:58.800> like<00:02:59.800> spring

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
like this throttle gets like spring

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.729 
like this throttle gets like spring
every<00:03:00.910> time<00:03:01.239> you<00:03:01.360> push<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.810> pull<00:03:02.200> right<00:03:02.470> back

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
every time you push it pull right back

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.720 
every time you push it pull right back
so<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:04.470> took<00:03:05.470> all<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.800> screws<00:03:06.130> out<00:03:06.370> of<00:03:06.520> here<00:03:06.700> I

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
so I took all the screws out of here I

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.370 
so I took all the screws out of here I
won't<00:03:07.030> show<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.239> how<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.420> do<00:03:07.750> it's<00:03:08.110> really

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
won't show you how to do it's really

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.220 
won't show you how to do it's really
easy<00:03:08.590> though<00:03:09.120> just<00:03:10.120> take<00:03:10.299> all<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.690> screws<00:03:10.959> out

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
easy though just take all the screws out
