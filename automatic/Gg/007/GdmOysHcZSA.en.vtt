00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.900
 wall street presents itself on the market 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.490
 Italian with a range of machines for 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.280
 wood with ample capacity of 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.480
 processing 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.800
 the combined k 210k 260 are machines 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.590
 that can perform different processes 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.240
 in order to allow the operator to 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.450
 make the finished product without 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.759
 the use of more machinery the workings 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.079
 which can be performed are 5 per 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:36.210
 the k 210 and 7 model for the k model 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.880
 260 and include the planing wire and ea 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.309
 thickness the squaring of the panels the 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.309
 cutting drilling is milling 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.109
 model k 210 has small dimensions ed 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.739
 a single-phase cation motor to all 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.790
 usable tools 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.040
 the machine is supplied with 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.540
 pedestal for positioning and set 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.489
 of wheels that make it easy 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.489
 handling inside the workshop 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.710
 the structure of the machines is in cast iron 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.420
 in order to give adequate robustness e 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.700
 all machining precision 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.710
 functions and adjustments are simple 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.810
 and accessible and allow little 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.940
 space to have the functionalities of 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.940
 much larger joinery machines 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.050
 the k 260 model with higher capacities e 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.159
 works thanks to two single - phase motors that 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.600
 they give movement to the various tools 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.490
 thanks to this project the machine 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.500
 also the pipe and vertical to run 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.550
 horizontal milling operations e 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.410
 copying 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.970
 this model also comes with 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.210
 pedestal st of wheels for the 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.210
 handling 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.310
 the k 210 and k 260 machines are aimed 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.050
 to a demanding clientele who needs 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.670
 to work professionally and 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.670
 it does not give up power and precision 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.850
 from today with others it is possible to have a 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.850
 complete laboratory at home
