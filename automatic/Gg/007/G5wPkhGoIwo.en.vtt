00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.789
 go to boys 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.130
 Welcome to this new video of how 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.140
 break the posts in this case on 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.750
 stand off then always the usual ones 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.340
 competitive tips for league on 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.289
 poor on location 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.929
 now if maybe the game starts if I press 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.910
 the ok button now I will show you 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.010
 location by location the most ways 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.329
 simple to break it or more ways 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.680
 however effective then we see then 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.160
 immediately from the central one 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.450
 initial show said maradona 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.910
 first to break this 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.100
 location my main advice is 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:56.820
 when you leave if you run races on 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:59.879
 timer first thing is to try to 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.710
 near you and the tanque area that one 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.809
 near the state to the state area e 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.330
 to check that area for that 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.070
 you also have the chance to spawn them 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.070
 to transport distant opponents not 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.750
 so in green this is the thing 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.310
 easy to get there if you have the spawn 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.810
 ugly however always use maybe 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.930
 smoke in this area so as not to make you 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.970
 see here on the wall etcetera and so on 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.290
 try to make a combined move 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.939
 because how much it really is 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.520
 difficult since there is perhaps an enemy 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.680
 positioned here to observe another 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.060
 above and so on or maybe one watching 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.979
 behind then always try to 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.900
 combined training such as one 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.210
 person enters in front one from behind a 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.280
 another broken wall or the two fall one 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.900
 as soon as you enter the setting it runs right away 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.110
 under wood to stop the enemies that 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.259
 expose here to the right or which hangs 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.790
 however, this is what it is about 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.979
 the first station for the second 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.790
 position the green one the most thing 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.140
 easy to do is keep the gas area 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.000
 since the adversaries will be this 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.350
 area can arrive from the left must 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.450
 always use in this case 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.280
 ie smoke and so on and then cover 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.979
 this part so as not to make it understood 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.990
 if you are about to climb over or go around 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.110
 in beccalli as dogs lands in the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.610
 alleyway behind that then pass 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.350
 for the main door go through 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.760
 spouts and climb over 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.650
 these already but the simplest method 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.710
 because surely you will have people 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.420
 who will watch you from there back from 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.120
 there will be someone hidden in here 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.070
 so in the packages that you don't see then 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.680
 the best thing to always enter times 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.660
 purely these are all we say 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.120
 that is, all workstations in which one must 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.580
 be coordinated and especially are 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.120
 all smg stations except the one 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.040
 central 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.410
 as regards the third a 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.600
 home we don't do what we do with tribes 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.240
 storm badly instead of bouchard e 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.310
 always from water kebabs behind we do 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.690
 like sponges I can burn 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.400
 of water behind my farm 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.640
 also spread here with two 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.740
 maybe in this little alleyway here 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.720
 then maybe one here from the center that like that 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.240
 eliminates the enemy who is stalled and yes 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.040
 he climbs or if he does only this 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.050
 because only doing this changes 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.270
 shady makes its enemies sound 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.070
 down there so far he sees the whole 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.720
 time to break it the best method for 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.480
 however, break them up onto the cart 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.670
 armed and water maybe not from here in 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.550
 something that not all do and when 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.830
 there is a person who is contending for 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.420
 then the back post maybe at 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.960
 place for buccelli to stay 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.270
 hide here and wait for the opponent 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.280
 or here so that the opponent so 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.930
 must lose seconds or come towards 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.590
 of you and your companions have time 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.390
 to reach you another thing 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.160
 therefore always important and to pass by 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.200
 above, however, the problem is when yes 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.910
 step over try not to climb over here 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.950
 but down here because many people 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.860
 climb over here and there 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.240
 seen climbing over here maybe you are lucky 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.470
 he managed to run in here like this 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.660
 quickly to kill the person 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.060
 however, the yes to the a 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.390
 fine I am very simple to explain 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.550
 because only coordination is needed for 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.320
 to break this the mainly one must 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.390
 be located as usual 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.970
 coordinated will not stop repeating it 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.220
 because these are all locations where 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.800
 you need to be close and short range 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.130
 clashes with smg so it's always better 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.480
 be coordinated 12 people from here one 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.160
 person who maybe go to the broken wall 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.750
 always using moggi in this 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.940
 area so as not to sit by who in 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.750
 green or who is hiding behind that 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.510
 here guys to find listening centers 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.920
 people team up there inside people 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.320
 everywhere 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.920
 so here too you can find them 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.240
 everywhere back here here as I am 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.500
 put that in this position a 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.450
 visited from the left but you can 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.740
 see the people that come in there 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.410
 you can find anywhere so always 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.940
 maybe use a smoke bomb in here 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.040
 so that as a visual pass this way 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.010
 and from here therefore always in two or in 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.930
 two from behind in this case the enemies 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.850
 spongano not spono in tractor 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.220
 if there are people in castles but 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.930
 they play directly in kebab then 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.690
 very far you have all the time 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.780
 go slowly and take the 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.640
 location here the advice is if 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.620
 you get water in two or three anyway 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.940
 to try to climb the states 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.280
 beware of this corner because people 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.540
 here lies behind a lousy I have here 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.760
 so be careful and try anyway 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.460
 to enter ie if a stop is found 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.340
 we say of your companions here and you 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.900
 you are at the door simultaneously 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.570
 because maybe the opponent here 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.070
 could kill the comrade get up 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.340
 kill you so always better 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.530
 go together so these are the 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.750
 four major there is nothing else 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.270
 to say because as you have seen are 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.890
 these tips are very simple because 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.470
 in the end it's all a team effort 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.390
 you only need to train on the walls of 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.010
 simultaneously then maybe succeed 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.979
 to have a person that while if 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.250
 entering here there is another passing 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.560
 from there 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.410
 and maybe another one that does 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.180
 the round like this and immediately goes to block it 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.220
 spawn or spawn kill two who come 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.830
 killed setting then sees it 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.600
 always try to think about moving 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.880
 coordinated this map is not like 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.410
 raid that I can tell you where to do 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.270
 something in this case is much more 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.880
 difficult given that these maps 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.979
 require you see this one this 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.080
 quis close contributions that is one 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:19.390
 home that another green house another 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.540
 home then it's all up to you to try to 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.340
 to be coordinated I can only 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.930
 direct you to say the movement 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.940
 best to do but then it's up to you in the 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.820
 moment to do it with the partner 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.960
 however this is the second episode of 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.970
 how to break the posts I will also do a 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.860
 a video on how to defend it in this 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.569
 I will explain to you de Silk enough 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.190
 details why not many people 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:43.740
 they know how to make enemies play 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.300
 on the other side of the map then vi 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.310
 I will see through the video well 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.050
 dirty the note in this note 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.430
 you can only spawn kill 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.400
 killing two people then running in 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.289
 another area so wait for the 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.090
 next video and beautiful girl who me 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:59.330
 know with comments if you liked it 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.330
 beautiful
