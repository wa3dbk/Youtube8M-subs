at<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.209> got<00:03:26.389> tornadoes<00:03:27.019> yet<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.799> light<00:03:28.040> beams

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
at you got tornadoes yet the light beams

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.610 
at you got tornadoes yet the light beams
of<00:03:28.730> outland<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:29.299> got<00:03:29.420> all<00:03:29.569> these<00:03:29.690> lightning

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
of outland you got all these lightning

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.710 
of outland you got all these lightning
strikes<00:03:31.100> everywhere<00:03:31.670> is<00:03:31.850> just<00:03:32.060> purple<00:03:32.569> is

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
strikes everywhere is just purple is

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.080 
strikes everywhere is just purple is
just<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:33.079> think<00:03:33.319> another<00:03:33.920> storm<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:34.700> look<00:03:34.970> at

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
just I think another storm and look at

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.539 
just I think another storm and look at
that<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.510> sky<00:03:35.840> is<00:03:35.900> being<00:03:36.290> funneled<00:03:36.680> into<00:03:37.160> the

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
that the sky is being funneled into the

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.400 
that the sky is being funneled into the
zone<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:37.819> think<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:38.389> makes<00:03:38.600> it<00:03:38.750> even<00:03:38.870> better<00:03:39.019> I

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
zone I think that makes it even better I

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.740 
zone I think that makes it even better I
just<00:03:39.799> I<00:03:40.280> always<00:03:40.519> remember<00:03:40.880> another<00:03:41.120> storm<00:03:41.510> and

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
just I always remember another storm and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.670 
just I always remember another storm and
because<00:03:42.620> of<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:42.769> it's<00:03:43.400> number<00:03:43.820> 4<00:03:44.169> hmm<00:03:45.229> number

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
because of that it's number 4 hmm number

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.409 
because of that it's number 4 hmm number
3<00:03:45.919> goes<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.130> hellfire<00:03:46.639> peninsula<00:03:46.850> and<00:03:47.299> that's

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
3 goes to hellfire peninsula and that's

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:48.100 
3 goes to hellfire peninsula and that's
because<00:03:47.690> when<00:03:47.840> you

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
because when you

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.870 
because when you
first<00:03:48.260> walked<00:03:48.560> into<00:03:48.830> the<00:03:49.010> Dark<00:03:49.250> Portal<00:03:49.670> in

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
first walked into the Dark Portal in

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.640 
first walked into the Dark Portal in
Burning<00:03:50.360> Crusade<00:03:50.390> you<00:03:50.990> just<00:03:51.140> looked<00:03:51.380> up<00:03:51.500> and

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
Burning Crusade you just looked up and

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.640 
Burning Crusade you just looked up and
saw<00:03:51.920> that<00:03:52.210> crazy<00:03:53.210> sky<00:03:53.630> you<00:03:53.690> see<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:54.170> giant

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
saw that crazy sky you see the giant

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.040 
saw that crazy sky you see the giant
light<00:03:54.860> beam<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.670> see<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:55.970> red<00:03:56.270> planet<00:03:56.930> and

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
light beam you see the red planet and

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.350 
light beam you see the red planet and
the<00:03:57.140> blue<00:03:57.380> planet<00:03:57.710> and<00:03:58.130> I<00:03:58.460> think<00:03:58.730> everybody

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
the blue planet and I think everybody

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.000 
the blue planet and I think everybody
has<00:03:59.630> that<00:03:59.870> in<00:04:00.050> their<00:04:00.170> memory<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.710> have<00:04:00.860> all

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
has that in their memory you have all

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.890 
has that in their memory you have all
those<00:04:01.130> planets<00:04:01.640> in<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.790> sky<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.300> the<00:04:02.360> giant

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
those planets in the sky and the giant

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.470 
those planets in the sky and the giant
beams<00:04:03.140> and<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.620> red<00:04:03.860> smoke<00:04:04.460> floating<00:04:05.360> around

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
beams and the red smoke floating around

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.420 
beams and the red smoke floating around
is<00:04:05.870> just<00:04:06.110> or<00:04:06.320> the<00:04:06.350> clouds<00:04:06.680> smoke<00:04:07.190> cloud

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
is just or the clouds smoke cloud

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.820 
is just or the clouds smoke cloud
whatever<00:04:07.730> but<00:04:08.420> I<00:04:08.720> think<00:04:09.200> that's<00:04:09.440> just<00:04:09.530> a<00:04:09.650> very

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
whatever but I think that's just a very

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.860 
whatever but I think that's just a very
memorable<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:10.670> really<00:04:11.090> cool<00:04:11.300> looking<00:04:11.600> sky

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
memorable and really cool looking sky

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.140 
memorable and really cool looking sky
and<00:04:12.110> that's<00:04:12.230> why<00:04:12.350> it's<00:04:12.500> number<00:04:12.620> three<00:04:12.980> hmm

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
and that's why it's number three hmm

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.790 
and that's why it's number three hmm
number<00:04:14.450> two<00:04:14.630> is<00:04:14.780> Negron<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.320> it's<00:04:15.470> because

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
number two is Negron and it's because

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.710 
number two is Negron and it's because
it's<00:04:16.100> got<00:04:16.340> just<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:16.760> mixture<00:04:17.480> of<00:04:17.600> everything

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
it's got just the mixture of everything

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.229 
it's got just the mixture of everything
that<00:04:18.109> fits<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.470> zone<00:04:18.650> it's<00:04:18.890> got<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.670> planets

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
that fits the zone it's got the planets

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.480 
that fits the zone it's got the planets
about<00:04:20.450> hland<00:04:20.720> it's<00:04:20.870> got<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.260> beam<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:22.100> giant

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
about hland it's got the beam the giant

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.760 
about hland it's got the beam the giant
beam<00:04:22.700> which<00:04:23.450> is<00:04:23.630> like<00:04:23.810> another<00:04:24.140> storm<00:04:24.440> as<00:04:24.620> well

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
beam which is like another storm as well

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.490 
beam which is like another storm as well
it's<00:04:25.100> got<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:26.120> normal<00:04:26.540> clouds<00:04:26.900> floating

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
it's got the the normal clouds floating

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.800 
it's got the the normal clouds floating
in<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.650> sky<00:04:27.800> that<00:04:28.280> just<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:29.240> just<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.690> all

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
in the sky that just it just it all

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.840 
in the sky that just it just it all
clubs<00:04:30.290> together<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:30.710> fit<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.070> zone<00:04:31.280> so<00:04:31.610> well

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
clubs together to fit the zone so well

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.300 
clubs together to fit the zone so well
as<00:04:32.060> just<00:04:32.720> walk<00:04:33.020> right<00:04:33.169> Norse<00:04:33.470> integrand<00:04:34.010> that

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
as just walk right Norse integrand that

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.860 
as just walk right Norse integrand that

people thought I was gonna pick Negron

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.090 
people thought I was gonna pick Negron
his<00:04:41.690> number<00:04:41.960> one<00:04:42.110> but<00:04:42.260> I<00:04:42.290> didn't<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:42.770> I<00:04:42.830> pick
