of<00:01:24.970> a<00:01:25.090> challenge<00:01:25.330> I<00:01:25.600> get<00:01:25.750> hit<00:01:25.930> a<00:01:25.960> couple<00:01:26.170> times

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
of a challenge I get hit a couple times

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:38.320 
of a challenge I get hit a couple times
just<00:01:26.650> because<00:01:26.800> i<00:01:26.980> missed<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.400> counter

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.100 

so<00:01:39.290> they<00:01:39.380> start<00:01:39.590> you<00:01:39.650> off<00:01:39.680> with<00:01:39.890> one<00:01:40.130> guy

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
so they start you off with one guy

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.000 
so they start you off with one guy
that's<00:01:42.110> what<00:01:42.230> the<00:01:42.320> counter<00:01:42.590> looks<00:01:42.770> like<00:01:42.890> it

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
that's what the counter looks like it

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.830 
that's what the counter looks like it
takes<00:01:43.220> about<00:01:43.460> two<00:01:43.760> counters<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.390> kill<00:01:44.600> every

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
takes about two counters to kill every

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.790 
takes about two counters to kill every
enemy<00:01:45.910> enemies<00:01:46.910> you<00:01:47.180> kill<00:01:47.210> that<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:48.350> don't

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
enemy enemies you kill that you don't

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.960 
enemy enemies you kill that you don't
counter<00:01:49.190> but<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:49.400> hit<00:01:49.550> with<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.730> counter

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
counter but you hit with the counter

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.370 
counter but you hit with the counter
attack<00:01:50.240> like<00:01:50.480> if<00:01:50.600> two<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:50.810> them<00:01:51.020> are<00:01:51.080> standing

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
attack like if two of them are standing

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.040 
attack like if two of them are standing
in<00:01:51.440> front<00:01:51.590> of<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:51.770> they<00:01:52.580> will<00:01:52.790> count<00:01:53.120> so<00:01:53.930> if

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
in front of you they will count so if

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.300 
in front of you they will count so if
you<00:01:54.140> can<00:01:54.260> group<00:01:54.440> them<00:01:54.560> up<00:01:54.740> that<00:01:54.950> works<00:01:55.130> out

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
you can group them up that works out

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:14.809 
you can group them up that works out
great

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.089 

so<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.450> just<00:02:15.719> wave<00:02:16.109> them<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:16.409> you<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.829> gets<00:02:16.950> a

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
so I just wave them on you it gets a

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.069 
so I just wave them on you it gets a
little<00:02:17.249> tricky<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.670> keep<00:02:18.420> track<00:02:18.629> of<00:02:18.689> who's

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
little tricky to keep track of who's

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.530 
little tricky to keep track of who's
gonna<00:02:19.260> attack<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:20.060> when<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.180> played<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
gonna attack you when you played the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.440 
gonna attack you when you played the
game<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:22.049> lot<00:02:22.349> like<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.769> have<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.969> kind<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.239> know

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
game a lot like I have you kind of know

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.270 
game a lot like I have you kind of know
their<00:02:24.780> attack<00:02:25.079> patterns<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.799> that<00:02:25.920> once<00:02:26.099> they

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
their attack patterns and that once they

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.709 
their attack patterns and that once they
hit<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.579> they're<00:02:26.999> going<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.180> wait<00:02:27.389> a<00:02:27.450> minute

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
hit you they're going to wait a minute

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.289

to<00:02:28.260> attack<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.739> again<00:02:28.859> so<00:02:29.730> it'll<00:02:29.849> look<00:02:29.879> on<00:02:30.150> to

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
to attack you again so it'll look on to

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.179 
to attack you again so it'll look on to
someone<00:02:30.540> else<00:02:33.379> so<00:02:34.379> you<00:02:34.439> see<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:34.709> killed<00:02:35.099> an

someone else so you see I just killed an
enemy<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.719> that<00:02:36.719> didn't<00:02:36.900> even<00:02:37.049> attack<00:02:37.290> me

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
enemy that I that didn't even attack me

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.110 
enemy that I that didn't even attack me
that's<00:02:37.739> because<00:02:38.099> he<00:02:38.430> was<00:02:38.549> just<00:02:38.760> standing<00:02:38.939> in
