00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.190 
goes so that's right on f-sharp minor
pentatonic<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.390> he<00:00:37.020> does<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.440> bend<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:40.079> then

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
pentatonic and he does the bend and then

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.170 
pentatonic and he does the bend and then
brings<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> vibrato<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.370> once<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.790> note<00:00:42.000> has

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
brings the vibrato and once the note has

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.760 
brings the vibrato and once the note has
been<00:00:42.390> up<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.690> pitch<00:00:42.930> which<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.290> very<00:00:43.500> vocal

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:53.090

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000

group is very odd he slides up probably
a<00:01:00.149> mistake<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:01.109> sounds<00:01:02.239> exceptionally<00:01:03.239> cool

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
a mistake but sounds exceptionally cool

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.899 
a mistake but sounds exceptionally cool
because<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.110> Hendrix<00:01:04.500> he<00:01:05.159> slides<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
because it's Hendrix he slides up to the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.010 
because it's Hendrix he slides up to the
15th<00:01:06.390> fret<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:08.670> bends<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.299> half-step<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.930> he

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
15th fret and bends up a half-step so he

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.570 
15th fret and bends up a half-step so he
can<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.439> F<00:01:10.619> sharp<00:01:10.890> note<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.310> one<00:01:11.460> more

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
can get that F sharp note so one more

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:20.390 
can get that F sharp note so one more
time<00:01:11.610> he<00:01:11.880> got<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:13.820> then<00:01:16.369> many<00:01:17.369> plays<00:01:19.220> which<00:01:20.220> is

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
time he got it then many plays which is

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.570 
time he got it then many plays which is
really<00:01:20.759> weird<00:01:21.500> pulling<00:01:22.500> off<00:01:22.650> from<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.009> 14th

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
really weird pulling off from the 14th

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.570 
really weird pulling off from the 14th

which<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.790> really<00:01:27.060> added<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> scale<00:01:27.990> when<00:01:28.619> he

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
which is really added the scale when he

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.010 
which is really added the scale when he
played<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> song<00:01:29.250> live<00:01:29.670> he<00:01:30.360> would<00:01:30.509> play<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
played the song live he would play a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.530 
played the song live he would play a
lick<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.890> made<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.520> more<00:01:32.759> sense<00:01:32.820> he

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
lick that made a little more sense he

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.890 
lick that made a little more sense he
would<00:01:33.630> go<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:38.430> stay<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.270> scale<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:39.810> in

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
would go and stay in the scale but in

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.440 
would go and stay in the scale but in
this<00:01:40.020> case<00:01:42.649> just<00:01:43.649> one<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.890> those<00:01:43.979> weird

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450

this case just one of those weird
idiosyncratic<00:01:45.450> things<00:01:45.689> then<00:01:46.439> he<00:01:46.590> slides<00:01:46.890> up
