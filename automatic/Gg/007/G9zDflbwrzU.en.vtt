00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
of the putties together and I'm going to

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.119 
of the putties together and I'm going to
make<00:03:25.519> sure<00:03:25.549> that<00:03:26.269> there's<00:03:26.540> no<00:03:26.780> lines<00:03:27.109> that<00:03:27.859> it

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
make sure that there's no lines that it

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.550 
make sure that there's no lines that it
is<00:03:28.280> completely<00:03:28.939> one<00:03:29.389> color<00:03:29.750> one<00:03:30.049> solid<00:03:30.409> color

before<00:03:30.859> I<00:03:31.099> start<00:03:31.819> to<00:03:32.359> roll<00:03:32.629> it<00:03:32.810> out<00:03:33.019> so<00:03:33.409> that<00:03:33.560> I

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
before I start to roll it out so that I

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.429 
before I start to roll it out so that I
can<00:03:33.949> apply<00:03:34.189> it<00:03:34.280> onto<00:03:34.639> the<00:03:35.000> tray<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:36.169> putty

can apply it onto the tray the putty

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.830 
can apply it onto the tray the putty
does<00:03:36.739> start<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.099> harden<00:03:37.579> within<00:03:38.030> time<00:03:38.299> so<00:03:38.689> make

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
does start to harden within time so make

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.390 
does start to harden within time so make
sure<00:03:38.870> that<00:03:39.139> you<00:03:39.229> have<00:03:39.409> your<00:03:39.530> phone<00:03:39.739> by<00:03:39.949> you<00:03:40.009> or

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
a stopwatch that you can keep track of

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.469 
a stopwatch that you can keep track of
the<00:03:42.739> time<00:03:43.009> before<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.609> put<00:03:43.939> it<00:03:44.060> into<00:03:44.359> your

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:44.479 
the time before you put it into your

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.110 
the time before you put it into your
mouth<00:03:44.689> that<00:03:45.290> way<00:03:45.530> it's<00:03:45.829> going<00:03:46.069> to<00:03:46.400> harden<00:03:46.909> and

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
mouth that way it's going to harden and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.969 
mouth that way it's going to harden and
give<00:03:47.329> you<00:03:47.449> the<00:03:47.569> perfect<00:03:47.810> molding<00:03:48.379> and<00:03:48.500> it's

give you the perfect molding and it's

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:50.589 
give you the perfect molding and it's
not<00:03:49.189> uncomfortable<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:49.939> thought<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.269> would<00:03:50.449> be

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
not uncomfortable I thought it would be

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.629 
not uncomfortable I thought it would be
but<00:03:50.780> it's<00:03:50.959> actually<00:03:51.470> very<00:03:51.680> easy<00:03:51.919> to<00:03:52.220> do<00:03:52.370> and

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
but it's actually very easy to do and

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.640 
but it's actually very easy to do and
that<00:03:52.790> is<00:03:52.939> what<00:03:53.120> mine<00:03:53.359> looks<00:03:53.389> like<00:03:53.810> once<00:03:54.500> you

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
that is what mine looks like once you

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.619 
that is what mine looks like once you
are<00:03:54.739> done<00:03:54.919> you<00:03:54.979> just<00:03:55.159> seal<00:03:55.489> it<00:03:55.639> back<00:03:56.150> into<00:03:56.419> the

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
are done you just seal it back into the

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.929 
are done you just seal it back into the
bag<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.169> into<00:03:57.409> the<00:03:57.709> box<00:03:57.949> ready<00:03:58.400> to<00:03:58.639> ship<00:03:58.819> out

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909

anything but I really love about this

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.800 
anything but I really love about this
program<00:04:44.440> is<00:04:44.860> that<00:04:45.190> you<00:04:45.580> have<00:04:45.820> braces<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:46.690> are

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
program is that you have braces that are

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.990 
program is that you have braces that are
clear<00:04:47.140> so<00:04:47.440> that<00:04:47.470> you<00:04:47.800> don't<00:04:47.980> have<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.430> be<00:04:48.580> out

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
clear so that you don't have to be out

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.690 
clear so that you don't have to be out
and<00:04:49.450> about<00:04:49.660> with<00:04:50.050> metal<00:04:50.770> on<00:04:50.950> your<00:04:51.250> mouth<00:04:51.460> if

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700

you're<00:04:51.820> not<00:04:52.000> comfortable<00:04:52.240> with<00:04:52.630> that<00:04:52.720> that's

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
you're not comfortable with that that's

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.420 
you're not comfortable with that that's
actually<00:04:53.320> something<00:04:53.560> that<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:53.890> really<00:04:54.160> was

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
actually something that I really was

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.520 
actually something that I really was
looking<00:04:54.550> into<00:04:55.000> because<00:04:55.300> I<00:04:55.510> didn't<00:04:56.110> want<00:04:56.320> to

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
looking into because I didn't want to

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.110 
looking into because I didn't want to
commit<00:04:56.890> to<00:04:56.950> something<00:04:57.310> that<00:04:57.700> I<00:04:57.730> wasn't

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
commit to something that I wasn't

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.670 
commit to something that I wasn't
comfortable<00:04:58.330> with<00:04:58.720> if<00:04:58.900> I<00:04:58.960> didn't<00:04:59.230> like<00:04:59.380> metal

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
comfortable with if I didn't like metal

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.780 
comfortable with if I didn't like metal
braces<00:05:00.010> it's<00:05:00.130> not<00:05:00.310> like<00:05:00.460> they<00:05:00.610> could<00:05:00.760> just

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
braces it's not like they could just

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.580 
braces it's not like they could just
take<00:05:01.090> em<00:05:01.210> off<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.630> about<00:05:02.140> us<00:05:02.290> to<00:05:02.440> pay<00:05:02.560> for

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
take em off and about us to pay for

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.160 
take em off and about us to pay for
invisible<00:05:03.220> braces<00:05:03.370> at<00:05:03.940> an<00:05:04.270> orthodontist<00:05:05.020> it

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
invisible braces at an orthodontist it

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.690 
invisible braces at an orthodontist it
would<00:05:05.290> be<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:05.470> lot<00:05:05.800> of<00:05:05.950> money<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.400> it's<00:05:06.520> not

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
would be a lot of money and it's not

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.100 
would be a lot of money and it's not
like<00:05:06.820> they<00:05:06.940> would<00:05:07.090> refund<00:05:07.420> me<00:05:07.570> my<00:05:07.720> money<00:05:07.900> back

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
like they would refund me my money back

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.260 
like they would refund me my money back
so<00:05:08.560> what<00:05:09.010> I<00:05:09.040> really<00:05:09.370> like<00:05:09.520> about<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.880> is<00:05:10.090> that

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
so what I really like about it is that

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.460 
so what I really like about it is that
you<00:05:10.390> do<00:05:10.540> have<00:05:10.720> options

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
you do have options

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.760 
you do have options
now<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:11.830> impression<00:05:12.460> kit<00:05:12.580> is<00:05:12.730> $95<00:05:13.630> and<00:05:13.900> once

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
now the impression kit is $95 and once

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.680 
now the impression kit is $95 and once
you<00:05:15.070> have<00:05:15.280> received<00:05:15.430> your<00:05:15.820> first<00:05:15.910> alignment

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
you have received your first alignment

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.270 
you have received your first alignment
and<00:05:16.840> you<00:05:16.900> are<00:05:17.170> not<00:05:17.350> happy<00:05:17.680> with<00:05:17.710> it<00:05:17.950> whatsoever

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
and you are not happy with it whatsoever

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.650 
and you are not happy with it whatsoever
you<00:05:18.700> don't<00:05:18.880> want<00:05:19.030> to<00:05:19.090> continue<00:05:19.420> with<00:05:19.540> the

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
you don't want to continue with the

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.720 
you don't want to continue with the
program<00:05:19.840> they<00:05:20.470> will<00:05:20.590> refund<00:05:21.010> you<00:05:21.160> back<00:05:21.400> of<00:05:21.640> the

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
program they will refund you back of the

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.360 
program they will refund you back of the
$95<00:05:22.630> and<00:05:22.900> they<00:05:23.290> won't<00:05:23.500> charge<00:05:23.680> you<00:05:23.770> up<00:05:24.010> anymore

$95 and they won't charge you up anymore

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.280 
$95 and they won't charge you up anymore

so I think it's great for you to
experiment<00:05:26.800> if<00:05:27.070> it's<00:05:27.220> something<00:05:27.520> that<00:05:27.640> you're

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.150 
experiment if it's something that you're

you could see how your teeth are going
to<00:05:59.080> shift<00:05:59.560> so<00:05:59.770> that<00:05:59.890> you<00:05:59.980> can<00:06:00.190> get<00:06:00.310> straighter
