Shakeology<00:03:27.099> for<00:03:27.280> their<00:03:27.400> breakfast<00:03:27.760> so<00:03:27.970> you

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
Shakeology for their breakfast so you

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.750 
Shakeology for their breakfast so you
know<00:03:28.510> just<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:29.049> way<00:03:29.139> to<00:03:29.169> figure<00:03:29.440> it<00:03:29.560> out<00:03:29.760> I've

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
know just a way to figure it out I've

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.190 
know just a way to figure it out I've
had<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:30.970> lot<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.180> people<00:03:31.510> talk<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:31.959> me<00:03:32.019> about

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
had a lot of people talk to me about

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.619 
had a lot of people talk to me about
that<00:03:32.950> looks<00:03:33.160> really<00:03:33.370> confusing<00:03:33.940> but<00:03:34.209> I<00:03:34.419> hope

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
that looks really confusing but I hope

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.420 
that looks really confusing but I hope
that<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:34.989> can<00:03:35.200> tell<00:03:35.379> by<00:03:35.590> this<00:03:35.650> it's<00:03:36.129> not

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
that you can tell by this it's not

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.129 
that you can tell by this it's not
really<00:03:36.730> it's<00:03:36.910> just<00:03:37.030> plugging<00:03:37.450> things<00:03:37.629> in<00:03:37.840> and

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
really it's just plugging things in and

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.309 
really it's just plugging things in and
it's<00:03:38.260> it's<00:03:38.590> not<00:03:39.129> really<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.519> hard<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.199> so<00:03:41.199> my

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
it's it's not really that hard and so my

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.680 
it's it's not really that hard and so my
first<00:03:41.470> tip<00:03:41.620> is<00:03:41.799> start<00:03:42.040> with<00:03:42.160> dinner<00:03:42.310> my<00:03:43.150> second
