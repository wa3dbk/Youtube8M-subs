00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.230
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.630
 tariftipp.de we have in the context of 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.680
 cebit 2014 the possibilities are here 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.180
 to look at the huawei mediapad 17.0 like 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.640
 The name says it is a tablet 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.880
 with a 7 inch display 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.579
 we have a quad core installed here 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.919
 Processor with 1.6 gigahertz clocking 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.480
 beyond that as an operating system 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:38.160
 Android 4.2 and the familiar emotion 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.800
 user interface 2.0 by kuwait 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.390
 a special feature of the huawei mediapad 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.019
 x1 is the weight we have here 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.379
 namely 239 grams 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:52.719
 that is relatively little for a tablet with 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.589
 7 inch display anyway we have here 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:58.149
 a battery firmly installed with 5000 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.370
 milliampere capacity we have 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.379
 yes, a main camera on board the 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.239
 a really nice high resolution 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.790
 namely 13 megapixel is supported 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.229
 also from autofocus and a led lightning 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.080
 in addition , we have a second one 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.180
 camera on board with 5 megapixels, too 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.890
 is relatively much 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.250
 The resolution of the display is 1200 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.150
 1120 pixels so slightly more than hd 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.460
 resolution 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:31.700
 The internal memory measures 16 gigabytes 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.920
 but can via micro sd card on 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.270
 another 32 gigabytes will be expanded 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.680
 We also have one more 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.150
 RAM on board now too 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.470
 not the smallest he measures 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.470
 two gigabytes of ram 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.829
 another special feature in this 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.780
 device is that we also lte on board 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.659
 even have category 4 that is 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.610
 that huawei mediapad x1 can handle up to 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.000
 150 megabits per second on the internet 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.000
 surfing 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.500
 As you look here I can do this 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.180
 Even though I am still relative 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.680
 it can at least in the great 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.840
 hand holding a hand operation goes 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.760
 Of course not full but what else has 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.440
 important is we have here too 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.229
 a telephone function on board also that 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.130
 distinguishes the robotics 1 from the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.130
 most tablets
