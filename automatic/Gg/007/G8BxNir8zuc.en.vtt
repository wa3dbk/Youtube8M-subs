00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.620
 I want 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.710
 first he's 13 years old he's here with 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.440
 your neighbor to dance 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.440
 carmen gimÃ©nez is today in sabadazo 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.440
 dancing 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.460
 for sandoval and the samba samba of the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.460
 samba samba samba 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.730
 a blanket 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.060
 To be able to pass 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.620
 hills 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.549
 tonight if you have it hard 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.149
 because the level of choreography that 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.220
 we have presented is high I think if I do not 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.569
 wrong is not the first time that is the 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.569
 dancing scene with the big ones 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.520
 we see samba and that the level of samba yes 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.700
 I'm not wrong or in the way you are 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.200
 As you say one hour they have rhythm but 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.820
 before better than the samba is one of the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.290
 so of the rhythms that are most 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.750
 enjoy that more must be moved and more 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.180
 to feel and you have felt it 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.550
 I think that there is definitely the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.710
 elasticity and I lack a little in 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.210
 some steps that you stretch your 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.590
 knees that will coat so that the 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.330
 energy reach the tips of your 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.890
 feet but in general they have done it very 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.890
 good happiness thank you very much 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.420
 sergio the test hours were given 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.700
 see that they worked a technique was seen 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.370
 Personally very clean I do not know 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.740
 you guys, I saw them too, very safe and 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.660
 apart enjoying the dance thanks to 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.790
 Congratulations thank you very much thank you 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.790
 we are roberto but 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.450
 the wonderful dance the enthusiasm 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.120
 extraordinary there were two parts 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.819
 you know it well that they left 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.549
 rhythm because the samba they made 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.220
 you a samba that are never used 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:31.819
 the ones loaded or the books all the 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.129
 Pure leg work they used and 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.859
 they looked extraordinary is a fantasy 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.870
 of samba but those details that made 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:41.780
 you there this one was the music two 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.840
 times and are seeking excellence 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.510
 of this contest there is what you have 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.459
 figure they have was red they have him 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.849
 interesting to become champions 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.540
 but I two points take away for that 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.540
 exactly 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.270
 about nobody knows about dancing here 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.250
 besides the lady in the exceptional 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.250
 Roberto Mitzuko tells them for his good 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.110
 and because the truth he is an expert in 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.740
 the clear valley in fact high has the 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.740
 experience 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.470
 follow because for me 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.690
 and I think we have some here 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.250
 winners very soon 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.880
 thank you very much to hear you saw that anime 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.550
 do not take anything personal to the contrary 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.190
 everything to learn is the rigor of 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.020
 roberto mitzuko but good is a book 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.030
 open and you have to squeeze it all the 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.420
 wisdom many solidarities many 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.270
 Thank you 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.540
 with karim because well we know that 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.700
 friendship for you beautiful is something very 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.070
 but very important 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.910
 come with me, come to here because 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.980
 you are precious 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.650
 that friendship is very important there 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.670
 times that life puts us tests and 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.590
 we have to get away from friendships 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.260
 when you were four years old there is a 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.280
 very solid friendship but with a girl 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.770
 I think it's called litzy veronica is this 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.340
 that we have here is a photograph with 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.260
 she the best friend you love her very much 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.380
 too 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.530
 which means in this day of love and 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.810
 friendship think about leasing because I would 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.670
 I want to say first I want to thank you 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.620

 beautiful friendship for so many years 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:40.700
 how much time you have without seeing it 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.320
 a year or so a year without seeing it 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.510
 imagine she is carried through 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:49.320
 social networks are supported 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:52.110
 and the truth is that those friendships 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.289
 friendships you have to take care of yourself and 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.389

 friends what comes for them 

00:06:57.499 --> 00:07:02.360
 as they grow, if they follow 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:04.459
 encouraging they are starting their friendship is 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.079
 hatching girls and already the
