at<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.970> point<00:01:27.240> because<00:01:27.659> model<00:01:28.049> warfare<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.560> a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
at this point because model warfare is a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.170 
at this point because model warfare is a
way<00:01:28.920> too<00:01:28.979> much<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.460> modern<00:01:29.729> warfare<00:01:29.880> word

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
way too much of a modern warfare word

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.570 
way too much of a modern warfare word
and<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.380> had<00:01:31.470> my<00:01:31.500> warfare<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.430> say

and I just had my warfare just to say
again<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.299> had<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.600> sentence<00:01:33.990> enough<00:01:34.799> amount

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
again it had one sentence enough amount

right<00:02:06.900> to<00:02:06.930> work<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.680> sounds<00:02:07.950> like<00:02:08.069> one<00:02:08.220> of

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
right to work it sounds like one of

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.589 
right to work it sounds like one of
those<00:02:08.399> electric<00:02:08.729> razors<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.390> shave

those electric razors that you shave
your<00:02:09.750> face<00:02:09.899> with<00:02:10.170> it's

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.920 

I<00:02:13.010> mean<00:02:13.910> that's<00:02:14.120> back<00:02:14.270> in<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.480> days<00:02:14.600> of<00:02:14.630> model

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
I mean that's back in the days of model

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.540 
I mean that's back in the days of model
for<00:02:15.050> who<00:02:15.140> first<00:02:15.350> came<00:02:15.560> out<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:16.070> I<00:02:16.250> said<00:02:16.310> it

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
for who first came out and I said it

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.260 
for who first came out and I said it
again<00:02:16.910> oh<00:02:17.470> dear

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
again oh dear

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.850 
again oh dear
but<00:02:20.270> one<00:02:20.780> thing<00:02:20.960> cool<00:02:21.140> about<00:02:21.260> waistline<00:02:21.620> is

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
but one thing cool about waistline is

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.620 
but one thing cool about waistline is
actually<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.220> remake<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.640> an<00:02:22.850> old<00:02:23.030> map<00:02:23.210> I<00:02:23.510> think

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
actually a remake of an old map I think

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.580 
actually a remake of an old map I think
I<00:02:23.870> said<00:02:24.050> this<00:02:24.440> was<00:02:24.650> brie<00:02:24.860> court<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:27.140> looks

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
I said this was brie court and it looks

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.010 
I said this was brie court and it looks
like<00:02:27.770> a<00:02:27.800> wide-open<00:02:28.100> map<00:02:28.640> but<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.720> terrain<00:02:29.870> of

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
like a wide-open map but the terrain of

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.080 
like a wide-open map but the terrain of
the<00:02:30.260> map<00:02:30.410> itself<00:02:30.770> can<00:02:31.460> actually<00:02:31.670> give<00:02:32.000> you

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
the map itself can actually give you

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.970 
the map itself can actually give you
cover<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:33.020> like<00:02:33.200> there's<00:02:33.380> certain<00:02:33.650> ways<00:02:33.770> that

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
cover and like there's certain ways that

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.890 
cover and like there's certain ways that
you<00:02:34.070> can<00:02:34.190> take<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:35.210> I<00:02:35.450> guess<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.750> wouldn't

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
you can take it and I guess you wouldn't

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.000 
you can take it and I guess you wouldn't
notice<00:02:36.050> at<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.350> beginning<00:02:36.440> of<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:36.800> game<00:02:36.950> but

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
notice at the beginning of the game but

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.050 
notice at the beginning of the game but
like<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.880> map<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.360> huge<00:02:38.690> compared<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.470> a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
like this map is huge compared to a a

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.040 
like this map is huge compared to a a
certain<00:02:41.060> shooter<00:02:41.480> game<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:41.870> we're<00:02:42.020> playing

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
certain shooter game that we're playing

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.760 
certain shooter game that we're playing

boom<00:05:32.680> I<00:05:32.890> hit<00:05:33.040> I<00:05:33.370> just<00:05:33.729> I<00:05:33.940> pretty<00:05:34.330> much<00:05:34.390> tried<00:05:34.660> to

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
boom I hit I just I pretty much tried to

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.600

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.210 
quickscope him they were cold-blooded
and<00:05:36.870> that's<00:05:37.870> because<00:05:38.169> they<00:05:38.350> spawn<00:05:38.860> right<00:05:39.040> on

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
and that's because they spawn right on

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.840 
and that's because they spawn right on
top<00:05:39.400> of<00:05:39.430> me

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
well it didn't really for some reason

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.990 
well it didn't really for some reason
when<00:05:41.890> they<00:05:41.950> spawned<00:05:42.250> on<00:05:42.340> top<00:05:42.490> of<00:05:42.640> me<00:05:42.729> here<00:05:42.940> in

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000
