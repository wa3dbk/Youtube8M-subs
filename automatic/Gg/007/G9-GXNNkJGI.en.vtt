00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
little seeds grow down at the same time

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.290 
little seeds grow down at the same time
the<00:01:01.500> roots<00:01:01.770> are<00:01:01.980> growing<00:01:02.400> so<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.630> plant

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
the roots are growing so is the plant

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.140 
the roots are growing so is the plant
seeds<00:01:06.320> when<00:01:07.320> they<00:01:07.440> become<00:01:07.770> plants<00:01:08.340> they<00:01:08.820> reach

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
seeds when they become plants they reach

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.219 
seeds when they become plants they reach
up<00:01:09.480> towards<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.560> Sun<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.790> know<00:01:11.820> why

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
up towards the Sun you know why

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.370 
up towards the Sun you know why
because<00:01:13.799> did<00:01:14.009> you<00:01:14.039> know<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.939> plants<00:01:15.570> make

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
because did you know that plants make

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.789 
because did you know that plants make
their<00:01:16.409> own<00:01:16.740> food

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
their own food

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.959 
their own food
yep<00:01:18.399> they<00:01:18.670> sure<00:01:18.880> do<00:01:19.149> in<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:19.719> process<00:01:20.259> called

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
yep they sure do in a process called

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:24.030 
yep they sure do in a process called
photosynthesis<00:01:22.020> plants

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
photosynthesis plants

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.570

whose<00:01:24.670> water<00:01:25.140> nutrients<00:01:26.140> from<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.500> soil<00:01:26.740> and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
whose water nutrients from the soil and

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.380 
whose water nutrients from the soil and
take<00:01:27.880> in<00:01:28.150> carbon<00:01:28.540> dioxide<00:01:29.490> from<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.580> air<00:01:30.730> and

take in carbon dioxide from the air and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.860 
take in carbon dioxide from the air and
they<00:01:31.930> use<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.320> energy<00:01:32.530> from<00:01:32.980> the<00:01:33.550> Sun<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:34.660> make

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
they use the energy from the Sun to make

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.330 
they use the energy from the Sun to make
their<00:01:35.140> own<00:01:35.170> food<00:01:35.650> this<00:01:36.610> process<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.570> called

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
their own food this process is called

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.030 
their own food this process is called
photosynthesis<00:01:39.570> vent<00:01:40.570> plants<00:01:41.200> release

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
photosynthesis vent plants release

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.140 
photosynthesis vent plants release
oxygen<00:01:42.630> into<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.720> air<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.380> humans<00:01:45.370> breathe

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
oxygen into the air and humans breathe

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.180 
oxygen into the air and humans breathe
that<00:01:46.750> oxygen<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.940> Sun<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:50.170> moon<00:01:50.200> play

that oxygen the Sun and the moon play

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.340 
that oxygen the Sun and the moon play
important<00:01:51.820> roles<00:01:52.300> in<00:01:53.010> plants<00:01:54.010> growing<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.820> in

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
important roles in plants growing and in

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.990 
important roles in plants growing and in
photosynthesis<00:01:58.320> photosynthesis<00:01:59.320> is<00:01:59.850> just<00:02:00.850> as

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
photosynthesis photosynthesis is just as

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.380 
photosynthesis photosynthesis is just as
easy<00:02:01.240> in<00:02:01.450> Spanish<00:02:02.020> as<00:02:02.260> in<00:02:02.830> English<00:02:03.250> do<00:02:04.240> you

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
easy in Spanish as in English do you

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.660 
easy in Spanish as in English do you
know<00:02:04.600> that<00:02:04.840> all<00:02:05.080> these<00:02:05.350> processes<00:02:06.250> take<00:02:06.610> place

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
know that all these processes take place

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.290 
know that all these processes take place
in<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.390> leaf<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:08.649> little<00:02:09.070> leaves<00:02:09.310> do<00:02:09.760> all<00:02:10.030> the

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
in the leaf the little leaves do all the

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.220 
in the leaf the little leaves do all the
hard<00:02:10.510> work<00:02:10.660> in<00:02:11.650> little<00:02:12.100> tiny<00:02:12.280> cells<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.840> use

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
hard work in little tiny cells and use

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.699 
hard work in little tiny cells and use
things<00:02:14.560> called<00:02:15.330> chloroplasts<00:02:16.330> and

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
things called chloroplasts and

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.199 
things called chloroplasts and
chlorophyll<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.340> that's<00:02:18.520> what<00:02:18.760> makes<00:02:19.000> them

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
chlorophyll and that's what makes them

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.250 
chlorophyll and that's what makes them
green<00:02:20.250> humans<00:02:21.250> need<00:02:21.490> trees<00:02:21.880> just<00:02:22.660> as<00:02:22.870> much<00:02:23.080> as

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
green humans need trees just as much as

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.160 
green humans need trees just as much as
animals<00:02:23.770> because<00:02:24.730> we<00:02:24.910> breathe<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.480> oxygen

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
animals because we breathe the oxygen

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.800 
animals because we breathe the oxygen
that<00:02:26.320> they<00:02:26.560> make<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.220> we<00:02:27.760> eat<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.150> food<00:02:28.420> that

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
that they make and we eat the food that

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.900 
that they make and we eat the food that
plants<00:02:29.709> also<00:02:29.920> produce<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:33.310> has<00:02:33.550> been<00:02:33.760> our
