00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
a lot better than this one but pretty

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.450 
a lot better than this one but pretty
cool<00:03:50.820> right<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.390> mean<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:52.130> thought<00:03:53.130> that<00:03:53.340> was

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
cool right I mean I thought that was

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.450 
cool right I mean I thought that was
pretty<00:03:53.610> awesome<00:03:53.820> um<00:03:54.800> it's<00:03:55.800> a<00:03:56.220> little<00:03:56.940> much<00:03:57.420> for

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
pretty awesome um it's a little much for

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.590 
pretty awesome um it's a little much for
daytime<00:03:59.460> but<00:03:59.610> I<00:03:59.670> guess<00:03:59.850> if<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.120> never<00:04:00.330> knew<00:04:00.570> me

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
daytime but I guess if you never knew me

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.270 
daytime but I guess if you never knew me
and<00:04:01.020> then<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.170> had<00:04:01.380> all<00:04:01.410> my<00:04:01.530> makeup<00:04:01.890> done<00:04:02.100> you

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
and then I had all my makeup done you

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.860 
and then I had all my makeup done you
probably<00:04:02.670> wouldn't<00:04:03.060> really<00:04:03.150> be<00:04:03.360> able<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.660> tell

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
probably wouldn't really be able to tell

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.640 
probably wouldn't really be able to tell
so<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:06.120> then<00:04:06.510> you<00:04:06.630> can<00:04:06.810> kind<00:04:07.020> of<00:04:07.080> set<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.470> with

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
so and then you can kind of set it with

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:15.440 
so and then you can kind of set it with
the<00:04:08.510> gloss<00:04:09.560> here<00:04:13.400> no<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.430> think<00:04:14.640> it's<00:04:14.880> fun<00:04:15.150> I

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450

was really inexpensive and they ship
them<00:04:22.500> pretty<00:04:22.710> fast<00:04:23.010> so<00:04:23.250> again<00:04:23.640> it's<00:04:23.850> this

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090
