00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.510 
frag and this is a it's a huge it's a
huge<00:01:06.810> point<00:01:07.049> especially<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.100> fact<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.430> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
huge point especially the fact that I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.910 
huge point especially the fact that I
don't<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.880> an<00:01:09.090> SMG<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.810> want<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.680> that

don't have an SMG I want to have that

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.640 
don't have an SMG I want to have that
ability<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.700> test<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.510> usually<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.049> mean<00:01:13.500> I'll

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
ability to test it usually I mean I'll

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.080 
ability to test it usually I mean I'll
throw<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> concussion<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.640> sort<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.880> slow

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
throw the concussion that sort of slow

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.560 
throw the concussion that sort of slow
them<00:01:15.270> down<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:16.400> then<00:01:17.400> use<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> frag<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
them down and then use the frag to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.700 
them down and then use the frag to
actually<00:01:18.869> kill<00:01:19.080> them<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.350> they<00:01:19.380> don't<00:01:19.500> run

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
actually kill them so they don't run

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.859 
actually kill them so they don't run
away<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.970> also<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.330> hit<00:01:21.540> detection

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
away but I can also get hit detection

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.539 
away but I can also get hit detection
zon<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.619> know<00:01:22.770> if<00:01:23.040> they're<00:01:23.189> there<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.539 
zon that so I know if they're there and
I<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.820> sort<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.119> prepare<00:01:24.750> myself<00:01:25.460> through<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
I can sort of prepare myself through the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.460 
I can sort of prepare myself through the
onslaught<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.330> did<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.689> last<00:01:27.960> round<00:01:28.170> too

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
onslaught and I did this last round too

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.469 
onslaught and I did this last round too
as<00:01:28.680> well<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.189> know<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.549> didn't<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:29.970> actually<00:01:30.360> get

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
as well I know I didn't get actually get

as well I know I didn't get actually get
a<00:01:30.540> kill<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.920> what<00:01:32.070> I'm

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.149 
here I use it to clear out to see if
anyone<00:01:54.509> sort<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.840> perched<00:01:55.049> up<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.590> area

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
anyone sort of perched up in that area

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.700 
anyone sort of perched up in that area
they're<00:01:56.520> looking<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.210> sort<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.710> basically

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
they're looking and sort of basically

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.469 
they're looking and sort of basically
holding<00:01:59.130> down<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.520> choke<00:01:59.790> point<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.240> far

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
holding down that choke point on the far

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.030 
holding down that choke point on the far
end<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.020> if<00:02:01.290> I'm<00:02:01.409> coming<00:02:01.649> around<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
end so that if I'm coming around the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.679 
end so that if I'm coming around the
side<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:02.280> they're<00:02:03.060> just<00:02:03.240> gonna<00:02:03.329> take<00:02:03.570> me

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
side there they're just gonna take me

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.999 
side there they're just gonna take me
out<00:02:03.810> because<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:04.110> very<00:02:04.290> difficult<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.829> see

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
out because it's very difficult to see

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.399 
out because it's very difficult to see
those<00:02:05.189> people<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:06.060> when<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.630> use<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.049> that

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
those people so when you use that that

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.309 
those people so when you use that that
mid<00:02:07.860> point<00:02:08.190> there<00:02:08.399> where<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.390> spawned<00:02:10.140> or

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
mid point there where I spawned or

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.229 
mid point there where I spawned or
whatever<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.830> then<00:02:11.280> go<00:02:11.400> from<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.730> point<00:02:11.790> it

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
whatever and then go from that point it

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.030 
whatever and then go from that point it
makes<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.840> hell<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.230> lot<00:02:13.379> easier

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
makes it a hell of a lot easier

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.809 
makes it a hell of a lot easier
actually<00:02:14.579> make<00:02:15.329> your<00:02:15.480> way<00:02:15.629> around<00:02:16.579> this<00:02:17.579> area

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
actually make your way around this area

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.190 
actually make your way around this area
here<00:02:18.000> because<00:02:18.239> you've<00:02:18.480> at<00:02:18.599> least<00:02:18.659> cleared<00:02:19.049> it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
here because you've at least cleared it

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.110 
here because you've at least cleared it
out<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.950> deters<00:02:20.340> them<00:02:20.609> from<00:02:20.790> going<00:02:21.030> in

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
out and it deters them from going in

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.550 
out and it deters them from going in
there<00:02:21.269> so<00:02:21.390> if<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.540> get<00:02:21.689> a<00:02:21.719> kill<00:02:21.989> then<00:02:22.469> you

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
there so if you get a kill then you

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.319 
there so if you get a kill then you
won't<00:02:22.680> have<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.859> worry<00:02:23.040> again<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:23.849> is<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.060> very

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
won't have to worry again this is a very

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.539 
won't have to worry again this is a very
active<00:02:24.569> area<00:02:24.959> here<00:02:25.439> a<00:02:25.620> lot<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.040> people<00:02:26.280> want<00:02:26.459> to

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
active area here a lot of people want to

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:27.470 
active area here a lot of people want to
try<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.819> come<00:02:26.939> through<00:02:26.969> here

watching out on this if those guys were
smart<00:02:36.090> they<00:02:36.299> would<00:02:36.329> be<00:02:36.510> throwing<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.900> semtex

smart they would be throwing a semtex
there<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.709> must<00:02:38.099> pay<00:02:38.340> attention<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.939> your<00:02:39.120> map

enemy<00:02:49.799> is<00:02:49.859> in<00:02:49.950> front<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.609> those<00:02:51.209> guys<00:02:51.480> were

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
enemy is in front and those guys were

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.140 
enemy is in front and those guys were
just<00:02:51.840> rushing<00:02:52.439> forward<00:02:52.819> knowing<00:02:53.819> that

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
just rushing forward knowing that

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.849 
just rushing forward knowing that
basically<00:02:54.720> from<00:02:55.019> their<00:02:55.139> own<00:02:55.260> map<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.709> their

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
basically from their own map that their

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.300 
basically from their own map that their
entire<00:02:56.129> team<00:02:56.459> was<00:02:56.639> on<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.849> side<00:02:57.109> logically

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
entire team was on that side logically

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.619 
entire team was on that side logically
logically<00:02:59.310> they<00:02:59.760> have<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.120> assume<00:03:00.450> that

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
logically they have to assume that

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.360 
logically they have to assume that
there's<00:03:00.840> someone<00:03:01.169> like<00:03:01.620> myself<00:03:01.829> on<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.310> other

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
there's someone like myself on the other

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.429 
there's someone like myself on the other
side<00:03:02.669> of<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.879> bridge<00:03:03.090> holding<00:03:03.419> it<00:03:03.540> down<00:03:03.750> and

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
side of the bridge holding it down and

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.199 
side of the bridge holding it down and
it<00:03:04.680> was<00:03:04.769> very<00:03:05.010> very<00:03:05.189> foolish<00:03:05.519> of<00:03:05.760> them<00:03:05.879> to<00:03:06.060> just

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
it was very very foolish of them to just

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.869 
it was very very foolish of them to just
run<00:03:06.389> across<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:07.159> would<00:03:08.159> never<00:03:08.310> do<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:08.700> and

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
run across I would never do that and

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.580 
run across I would never do that and
that's<00:03:09.239> why<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.480> dolphin<00:03:09.959> dive<00:03:10.109> across<00:03:10.409> that

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
that's why I dolphin dive across that

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.860 
that's why I dolphin dive across that
bridge<00:03:10.739> as<00:03:10.919> well<00:03:11.099> it<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.849> dangerous<00:03:12.359> I<00:03:12.480> don't

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
bridge as well it is dangerous I don't

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.960 
bridge as well it is dangerous I don't
like<00:03:13.079> using<00:03:13.409> that<00:03:13.620> bridge<00:03:13.919> I<00:03:14.129> try<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.430> avoid<00:03:14.639> it

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
like using that bridge I try to avoid it

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.929 
like using that bridge I try to avoid it
I<00:03:15.120> cross<00:03:15.599> it<00:03:15.629> once<00:03:16.169> maybe<00:03:16.530> twice<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.669> little

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:17.939 
I cross it once maybe twice in a little

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.759 
I cross it once maybe twice in a little
span<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.389> time<00:03:18.569> like<00:03:18.810> don't<00:03:19.079> like<00:03:19.319> using<00:03:19.530> it

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
span of time like don't like using it

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.069 
span of time like don't like using it
too<00:03:19.889> often<00:03:20.280> though<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:21.359> see<00:03:21.569> my<00:03:21.720> teammate

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
too often though and I see my teammate

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.289 
too often though and I see my teammate
there<00:03:22.290> but<00:03:22.799> I'm<00:03:22.889> still<00:03:23.159> observing<00:03:23.639> I'm<00:03:23.790> trying

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
there but I'm still observing I'm trying

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.360 
there but I'm still observing I'm trying
to<00:03:24.389> watch<00:03:24.599> where<00:03:24.900> my<00:03:25.049> team<00:03:25.349> teammates<00:03:26.190> are

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
to watch where my team teammates are

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.699 
to watch where my team teammates are
because<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:26.760> spawn<00:03:27.000> system<00:03:27.419> in<00:03:27.569> this<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:27.989> as

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
because the spawn system in this is as

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.129 
because the spawn system in this is as
I've<00:03:28.889> said<00:03:29.099> before<00:03:29.159> it<00:03:29.579> very<00:03:29.879> dynamic<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.750> it

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
I've said before it very dynamic and it

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.020 
I've said before it very dynamic and it
changes<00:03:31.530> out<00:03:31.680> quite<00:03:31.949> a<00:03:31.979> bit<00:03:32.069> so<00:03:32.699> it's<00:03:32.849> not

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
changes out quite a bit so it's not

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.610 
changes out quite a bit so it's not
necessarily<00:03:33.479> that<00:03:33.629> the<00:03:33.750> entire<00:03:34.109> team's<00:03:34.440> gonna

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
necessarily that the entire team's gonna

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.309 
necessarily that the entire team's gonna
start<00:03:35.250> spawning<00:03:35.579> in<00:03:35.790> one<00:03:35.970> area<00:03:36.239> they<00:03:36.989> did<00:03:37.169> an

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
start spawning in one area they did an

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.289 
start spawning in one area they did an
actual<00:03:37.470> good<00:03:38.010> job<00:03:38.280> as<00:03:38.489> far<00:03:38.579> as<00:03:38.729> I'm<00:03:38.909> concerned

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
actual good job as far as I'm concerned

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.849 
actual good job as far as I'm concerned
they<00:03:39.419> did<00:03:39.569> a<00:03:39.599> good<00:03:39.840> job<00:03:39.900> in<00:03:40.169> deathmatch<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.799> know

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
they did a good job in deathmatch I know

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.920 
they did a good job in deathmatch I know
it<00:03:41.069> seems<00:03:41.280> a<00:03:41.400> little<00:03:41.489> randomized<00:03:42.150> but<00:03:42.840> it

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
it seems a little randomized but it

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.629 
it seems a little randomized but it
prevents<00:03:43.290> from<00:03:43.560> spawn<00:03:43.889> killing<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.459> think

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
prevents from spawn killing and I think

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.280 
prevents from spawn killing and I think
that's<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:45.000> very<00:03:45.269> very<00:03:45.419> good<00:03:45.659> element<00:03:46.139> of

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
that's a very very good element of

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.649 
that's a very very good element of
balancing<00:03:46.919> in<00:03:47.099> these<00:03:47.609> games<00:03:47.849> that<00:03:48.120> was

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
balancing in these games that was

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.550 
balancing in these games that was
lacking<00:03:48.930> from<00:03:49.319> modern<00:03:49.560> warfare<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:50.159> I<00:03:50.400> think

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
lacking from modern warfare to I think

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.979 
lacking from modern warfare to I think
let<00:03:52.560> me<00:03:52.590> just<00:03:52.859> take<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.040> look<00:03:53.220> here<00:03:53.459> oh<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:54.720> was

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
let me just take a look here oh I was

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.270 
let me just take a look here oh I was
thinking<00:03:55.139> of<00:03:55.379> the<00:03:55.500> last<00:03:55.680> game<00:03:55.889> there<00:03:56.010> was<00:03:56.159> a

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
thinking of the last game there was a

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.129 
thinking of the last game there was a
guy<00:03:56.549> was<00:03:56.760> camping<00:03:57.209> like<00:03:57.389> right<00:03:57.689> on<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.930> wall

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
guy was camping like right on the wall

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.250 
guy was camping like right on the wall
oh<00:03:58.349> yeah<00:03:58.769> that<00:03:58.949> was<00:03:59.099> the<00:03:59.220> last<00:03:59.370> game<00:04:00.019> it<00:04:01.019> was

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
oh yeah that was the last game it was

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.099 
oh yeah that was the last game it was
like<00:04:01.409> the<00:04:01.530> most<00:04:01.970> stupid<00:04:02.970> spot<00:04:03.359> to<00:04:03.599> camp<00:04:03.810> I've

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
like the most stupid spot to camp I've

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.240 
like the most stupid spot to camp I've
ever<00:04:04.379> seen<00:04:04.650> in<00:04:04.739> my<00:04:04.769> life

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
ever seen in my life

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.819 
ever seen in my life
there<00:04:05.549> you<00:04:05.669> notice<00:04:06.000> what<00:04:06.150> I'm<00:04:06.269> doing<00:04:06.510> here<00:04:07.500> I'm

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
there you notice what I'm doing here I'm

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.559 
there you notice what I'm doing here I'm
still<00:04:08.159> moving<00:04:08.579> around<00:04:08.669> the<00:04:08.939> map<00:04:09.150> but<00:04:09.449> I'm

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
still moving around the map but I'm

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.020 
still moving around the map but I'm
holding<00:04:10.079> what<00:04:10.409> I<00:04:10.439> call<00:04:10.769> tactical<00:04:11.129> positions

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
holding what I call tactical positions

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.789 
holding what I call tactical positions
you're<00:04:12.389> gonna<00:04:12.509> can't<00:04:12.870> kill<00:04:13.139> move<00:04:13.379> and<00:04:13.620> then

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
you're gonna can't kill move and then

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.069 
you're gonna can't kill move and then
you<00:04:13.919> move<00:04:14.099> on<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.609> mean<00:04:15.060> you're<00:04:15.449> constantly<00:04:15.840> you

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
you move on I mean you're constantly you

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.060 
you move on I mean you're constantly you
don't<00:04:16.229> want<00:04:16.349> to<00:04:16.440> stay<00:04:16.620> in<00:04:16.739> there<00:04:16.889> and<00:04:16.979> the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
don't want to stay in there and the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.349 
don't want to stay in there and the
reason<00:04:17.159> why<00:04:17.430> you<00:04:17.489> don't<00:04:17.669> want<00:04:17.759> to<00:04:17.940> stay<00:04:18.120> in<00:04:18.269> one

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
reason why you don't want to stay in one

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.930 
reason why you don't want to stay in one
spot<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:19.440> because<00:04:19.769> you<00:04:20.190> have<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.639> constantly

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
spot is because you have to constantly

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.839 
spot is because you have to constantly
be<00:04:21.269> watching<00:04:21.720> your<00:04:21.900> teammates<00:04:22.349> no<00:04:22.700> there<00:04:23.700> we

be watching your teammates no there we
go<00:04:23.969> once<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.419> dogs<00:04:24.690> once<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.229> have<00:04:25.380> dogs<00:04:25.620> or

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
go once the dogs once you have dogs or

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.560 
go once the dogs once you have dogs or
even<00:04:25.979> gunship<00:04:26.820> in<00:04:27.029> this

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
even gunship in this

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.860 
even gunship in this
it's<00:04:27.870> pretty<00:04:28.200> much<00:04:28.350> over<00:04:29.010> that's<00:04:29.610> kind<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.270> you

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
it's pretty much over that's kind of you

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.630 
it's pretty much over that's kind of you
know<00:04:30.960> tips<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.620> scales<00:04:31.950> and<00:04:32.280> things<00:04:32.460> get

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
know tips the scales and things get

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.550 
know tips the scales and things get
really<00:04:32.940> messed<00:04:33.240> up<00:04:33.420> and<00:04:33.660> as<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.110> said<00:04:34.170> before

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
really messed up and as I said before

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.800 
really messed up and as I said before
once<00:04:34.830> those<00:04:35.010> dogs<00:04:35.370> are<00:04:35.580> out<00:04:35.760> not<00:04:36.390> so<00:04:36.540> much<00:04:36.660> with

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
once those dogs are out not so much with

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.970 
once those dogs are out not so much with
the<00:04:36.870> gunship<00:04:37.260> because<00:04:37.470> you're<00:04:37.620> controlling

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
the gunship because you're controlling

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.220 
the gunship because you're controlling
it<00:04:38.130> but<00:04:38.490> once<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:38.880> dogs<00:04:39.120> are<00:04:39.300> Unleashed<00:04:39.570> just

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
it but once the dogs are Unleashed just

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.130 
it but once the dogs are Unleashed just
go<00:04:40.520> forgetting<00:04:41.520> just<00:04:41.550> run<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:42.390> and<00:04:42.690> just

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
go forgetting just run and and just

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.490 
go forgetting just run and and just
blast<00:04:43.500> around<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:44.010> map<00:04:44.190> because<00:04:45.170> those<00:04:46.170> dogs

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
blast around the map because those dogs

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.260 
blast around the map because those dogs
they<00:04:46.770> are<00:04:46.890> gonna<00:04:47.010> be<00:04:47.100> preoccupied<00:04:47.700> with<00:04:47.910> them

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
they are gonna be preoccupied with them

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.140 
they are gonna be preoccupied with them
they<00:04:48.690> are<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:48.870> one<00:04:49.290> bite<00:04:49.560> kill<00:04:49.920> and<00:04:50.220> therefore

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
they are a one bite kill and therefore

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.840 
they are a one bite kill and therefore

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
dogs just tear them up I'll destroy them

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.220 
dogs just tear them up I'll destroy them
keep<00:05:08.160> these<00:05:08.400> things<00:05:08.580> in<00:05:08.790> mind<00:05:09.030> in<00:05:09.420> death<00:05:09.960> match

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
keep these things in mind in death match

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.780 
keep these things in mind in death match
it's<00:05:10.500> not<00:05:10.680> like<00:05:10.890> modern<00:05:11.220> warfare<00:05:11.250> to<00:05:11.670> you

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
it's not like modern warfare to you

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.750 
it's not like modern warfare to you

type<00:05:15.030> at<00:05:15.330> all<00:05:15.510> I<00:05:15.870> think<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.140> get<00:05:16.290> some<00:05:16.470> a<00:05:16.680> double

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010

type at all I think I get some a double
here<00:05:17.190> now<00:05:18.120> see<00:05:18.390> though<00:05:18.510> this<00:05:18.720> is<00:05:18.900> one<00:05:19.080> of<00:05:19.200> the

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
here now see though this is one of the

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.930 
here now see though this is one of the
first<00:05:19.440> times<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:19.920> think<00:05:20.130> because<00:05:20.430> my<00:05:20.580> entire

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
first times I think because my entire

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.850 
first times I think because my entire
team<00:05:21.270> was<00:05:21.360> on<00:05:21.510> the<00:05:21.570> other<00:05:21.690> side<00:05:21.960> they<00:05:22.470> kind<00:05:22.740> of

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
team was on the other side they kind of

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.310 
team was on the other side they kind of
did<00:05:23.370> a<00:05:23.400> group<00:05:23.730> spawning<00:05:24.180> there<00:05:24.510> but<00:05:25.200> you'll

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
did a group spawning there but you'll

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.450 
did a group spawning there but you'll
notice<00:05:25.590> even<00:05:25.950> when<00:05:26.070> you're<00:05:26.190> playing

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
notice even when you're playing

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.180 
notice even when you're playing
deathmatch<00:05:26.970> that<00:05:27.240> you<00:05:27.330> typically<00:05:27.860> spawn<00:05:28.860> in

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
deathmatch that you typically spawn in

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.160 
deathmatch that you typically spawn in
sort<00:05:29.520> of<00:05:29.550> almost<00:05:29.880> random<00:05:30.360> areas<00:05:30.750> and<00:05:31.050> there's

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
sort of almost random areas and there's

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.480 
sort of almost random areas and there's
not<00:05:31.380> going<00:05:31.500> to<00:05:31.560> be<00:05:31.620> many<00:05:31.950> teammates

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
not going to be many teammates

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.310 
not going to be many teammates
they'll<00:05:32.700> be<00:05:32.850> teammates<00:05:33.150> some<00:05:33.600> wot<00:05:33.840> around<00:05:34.200> the

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
they'll be teammates some wot around the

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.200 
they'll be teammates some wot around the
area<00:05:34.620> but<00:05:34.830> sometimes<00:05:35.550> you'll<00:05:35.730> spawn<00:05:36.000> like

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
area but sometimes you'll spawn like

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.360 
area but sometimes you'll spawn like
right<00:05:36.510> near<00:05:36.780> the<00:05:36.990> enemy<00:05:37.290> and<00:05:37.500> that's<00:05:37.860> because

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
right near the enemy and that's because

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.070 
right near the enemy and that's because
the<00:05:38.670> spawn<00:05:38.940> system<00:05:39.360> that<00:05:39.510> they've<00:05:39.690> designed

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
the spawn system that they've designed

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.250 
the spawn system that they've designed
for<00:05:40.650> deathmatch<00:05:41.310> is<00:05:41.640> a<00:05:42.120> little<00:05:42.540> more<00:05:42.630> dynamic

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
for deathmatch is a little more dynamic

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.720 
for deathmatch is a little more dynamic
and<00:05:43.440> I<00:05:43.560> think<00:05:43.830> it's<00:05:43.980> good<00:05:44.190> sometimes<00:05:44.460> it's

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
and I think it's good sometimes it's

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.000 
and I think it's good sometimes it's
crews<00:05:45.030> you<00:05:45.180> over<00:05:45.420> but<00:05:45.900> for<00:05:45.960> the<00:05:46.260> most<00:05:46.470> part<00:05:46.620> it

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
crews you over but for the most part it

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.460 
crews you over but for the most part it
stops<00:05:47.400> that<00:05:47.670> spawn<00:05:48.150> killing<00:05:48.450> to<00:05:49.140> remember

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
stops that spawn killing to remember

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.860 
stops that spawn killing to remember
choke<00:05:49.710> points<00:05:50.070> up<00:05:50.250> here<00:05:50.730> is<00:05:50.850> a<00:05:50.880> big<00:05:51.210> one<00:05:51.420> but

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
choke points up here is a big one but

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.630 
choke points up here is a big one but
you<00:05:52.020> meet<00:05:52.290> it's<00:05:52.620> not<00:05:52.830> just<00:05:53.040> watching<00:05:53.250> choke

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
you meet it's not just watching choke

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.040 
you meet it's not just watching choke
points<00:05:53.970> or<00:05:54.060> knowing<00:05:54.300> where<00:05:54.420> they<00:05:54.510> are<00:05:54.630> you

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
points or knowing where they are you

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.770 
points or knowing where they are you
need<00:05:55.290> to<00:05:55.350> observe<00:05:55.650> where<00:05:56.100> your<00:05:56.250> team<00:05:56.550> is<00:05:56.880> where

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
need to observe where your team is where

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.660 
need to observe where your team is where
your<00:05:57.930> team<00:05:58.170> is<00:05:58.200> is<00:05:58.650> gonna<00:05:58.830> dictate<00:05:59.130> for<00:05:59.580> the

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
your team is is gonna dictate for the

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.520 
your team is is gonna dictate for the
most<00:05:59.910> part<00:06:00.210> where<00:06:00.630> the<00:06:00.780> enemy<00:06:01.080> is<00:06:01.140> gonna<00:06:01.230> pop

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
most part where the enemy is gonna pop

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.550 
most part where the enemy is gonna pop
up<00:06:02.000> so<00:06:03.000> that's<00:06:03.150> it<00:06:03.450> so<00:06:03.690> twenty<00:06:04.080> nine<00:06:04.230> and<00:06:04.440> one

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
up so that's it so twenty nine and one

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.560 
up so that's it so twenty nine and one
same<00:06:05.130> thing<00:06:05.160> and<00:06:05.550> and<00:06:05.700> believe<00:06:06.060> me<00:06:06.360> when<00:06:06.540> you

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
same thing and and believe me when you

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.150 
same thing and and believe me when you
do<00:06:06.930> these<00:06:07.080> strategies<00:06:07.500> when<00:06:07.770> you<00:06:07.860> keep<00:06:07.980> these

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
do these strategies when you keep these

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.920 
do these strategies when you keep these
things<00:06:08.220> in<00:06:08.490> mind<00:06:08.700> you<00:06:09.210> will<00:06:09.330> become<00:06:09.720> more

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
things in mind you will become more

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.300 
things in mind you will become more
consistent<00:06:10.320> these<00:06:10.680> aren't<00:06:10.890> just<00:06:11.100> random

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310
