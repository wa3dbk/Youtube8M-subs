00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
next to the Jama harness is a Capcom

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.810 
next to the Jama harness is a Capcom
system<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.270> kick<00:00:45.570> harness<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:47.460> it's<00:00:47.670> nice

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
system to kick harness and it's nice

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.299 
system to kick harness and it's nice
because<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.559> this<00:00:49.559> particular<00:00:49.770> harness

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
because that this particular harness

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.380 
because that this particular harness
coming<00:00:50.520> out<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.730> machine<00:00:50.789> here<00:00:51.149> already

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
coming out of the machine here already

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.180 
coming out of the machine here already
has<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.660> wired<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.440> there's<00:00:52.739> no<00:00:52.800> messing

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
has that wired in so there's no messing

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.709 
has that wired in so there's no messing

this<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.750> rockman<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> power<00:01:01.890> fighters

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
this is rockman to the power fighters

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.920 
this is rockman to the power fighters
and<00:01:05.270> another<00:01:06.270> thing<00:01:06.420> I'm<00:01:06.510> doing<00:01:06.720> with<00:01:06.840> this

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and another thing I'm doing with this

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.990 
and another thing I'm doing with this
setup<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.530> I'm<00:01:07.619> actually<00:01:07.670> I've<00:01:08.670> got<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
setup here is I'm actually I've got it

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000 
setup here is I'm actually I've got it
hooked<00:01:09.119> into<00:01:09.540> two<00:01:10.110> different<00:01:10.260> monitors<00:01:10.770> and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
hooked into two different monitors and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.370 
hooked into two different monitors and
I've<00:01:11.130> got<00:01:11.310> them<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.820> system<00:01:12.689> selector<00:01:13.170> so

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
I've got them on a system selector so

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.750 
I've got them on a system selector so
instead<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.950> changing<00:01:14.280> systems<00:01:14.610> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
instead of you know changing systems and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.190 
instead of you know changing systems and
stuff<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.030> actually<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.450> flip<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> switch

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
stuff I actually just flip the switch

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.020 
stuff I actually just flip the switch
and<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.680> goes<00:01:16.860> from<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.460> monitor<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
and it goes from one monitor to the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.899 
and it goes from one monitor to the
other<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.860> power<00:01:20.100> these<00:01:20.310> off<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.820> give

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
other so it's power these off and give

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:36.060 
other so it's power these off and give
you<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.150> look<00:01:21.330> at<00:01:21.479> that

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.380

for<00:02:08.179> it

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.430 

so<00:02:15.910> there's<00:02:16.210> that<00:02:16.420> planning<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.080> for<00:02:17.350> look

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
so there's that planning and for look

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.390 
so there's that planning and for look
over<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.830> other<00:02:17.860> screen<00:02:18.250> here<00:02:19.710> see<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:21.010> just

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
over the other screen here see I just

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.170 
over the other screen here see I just
flip<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.760> switch<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:23.640> there<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.820> is<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.150> the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
flip the switch and there it is on the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.030 
flip the switch and there it is on the
other<00:02:25.390> screen<00:02:25.630> so<00:02:26.080> for<00:02:26.290> games<00:02:26.410> on<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.620> vertical

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
other screen so for games on a vertical

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.490 
other screen so for games on a vertical
it<00:02:27.220> would<00:02:27.310> be<00:02:27.750> correct<00:02:28.750> right<00:02:29.110> now<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.350> course

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
it would be correct right now of course

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.110 
it would be correct right now of course
it's<00:02:29.740> sideways<00:02:30.100> because<00:02:30.340> it's<00:02:30.670> not<00:02:30.790> made<00:02:30.940> for

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
it's sideways because it's not made for

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.960 
it's sideways because it's not made for
a<00:02:31.180> vertical<00:02:31.300> screen<00:02:32.370> just<00:02:33.370> flip<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.760> back

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
a vertical screen just flip that back

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.540 
a vertical screen just flip that back
over<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:37.270> there<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.600> is<00:02:37.660> again<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:39.250> yeah<00:02:39.370> it

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
over and there it is again so yeah it

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.800 
over and there it is again so yeah it
works<00:02:39.700> out<00:02:39.850> real<00:02:40.000> nice<00:02:40.240> I've<00:02:40.360> got<00:02:40.480> quite<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.720> few
