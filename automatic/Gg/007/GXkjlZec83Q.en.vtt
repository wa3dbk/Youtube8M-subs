00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.420
 further technology builds your video 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.120
 we continue with the vox series and 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.269
 this time the a box is smart light car 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.030
 lamp turn this is again an LED 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.789
 lamp but this time we have none 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.880
 loudspeaker that just it 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.580
 a colorful led light the natural 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.490
 can shine quite normal but if 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.410
 one uses the appropriate app then 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.880
 I can change colors with it 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.800
 or make a disco 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.520
 You see , I'm right now 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.440
 warm yellow and darkest brightness 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.180
 so to speak , we can of course that 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.219
 also screw everything up, of course 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.440
 Now the camera darkens and then I am 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.920
 I at maximum brightness something 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.030
 at 60 watts 800 lumens for its 15 16 18 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.370
 square meters room enough so that 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.260
 straight ahead would be a second lamp of it 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.489
 probably better a reasonable one 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.660
 to make light for a smaller one 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.329
 room is probably the same 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.129
 but really blatant 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.439
 Luminous efficacy does not exist 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.930
 already like a normal lamp year though 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.369
 now what I want out of is the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.320
 price a part costs 50 euros I say 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.909
 a comparable lamp from the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.900
 Baumarkt or ikea costs 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.369
 probably 56 euros maximum for it 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.009
 but I can not do such cool things 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.220
 then via bluetooth or per 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.729
 smartphone app for ios and android 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.380
 dimming 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.150
 Unfortunately, Windows phone users look in 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.829
 the tube and of course we have too 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.630
 different sounds so we can do it 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.960
 make it colder or brighter here or 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.880
 bluish or completely cold that's it 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.320
 very unpleasant citizen light who 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.000
 maybe his office lighting too 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.920
 would like to have home for that would be 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.259
 maybe the cool thing is 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.880
 the second option the colors i have 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.649
 here once so big color palette for 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.420
 turn and then I can do that here 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.409
 various projects throughout 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.420
 So from green to light blue dark blue 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.460
 pink red or orange 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.409
 go in that is very cool and there too 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.540
 of course, the brightness again I can 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.829
 adjust or I'm upset 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.550
 disco then are down here already 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.860
 ready- made color change modes ready 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.320
 So a few colors there 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.120
 more colors changes quickly 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.710
 then there are only three colors red yellow 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.680
 green red green blue then something more 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.720
 again change colors slowly and 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.340
 change colors again slowly 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.960
 supple with thick everywhere 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.760
 long light transitions and me this 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.410
 abrupt but I can as I said 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.450
 always stop when I have the buck 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.970
 also disco mode or I have below 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.060
 still the row with the colors red yellow 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.940
 Well you see it yourself and that was 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.200
 I can turn the lamp on there 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.600
 I say now I can do it yes 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.790
 completely so i can complete it 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.560
 down to the there to make out there 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.870
 then in the app on the top right then and 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.190
 switch off then the lamp goes off 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.660
 but of course still in the 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.070
 standby is always so consumed 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.270
 a little stream with it again 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.950
 if I can start with the 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.239
 smartphone come that has two disadvantages 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.410
 I do not always have the smartphone in it 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.850
 the hand with it I do not really run 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.070
 around the apartment and get started 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.320
 light off light on light off when i am 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.750
 then let the lamp so dimmed 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.100
 if this light tone sounds like 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.700
 So I stand under it 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.440
 just listen to it so easy me 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.140
 would not say fiepen now but so 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.519
 a low noise is there like me 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.110
 Just turn the lamp on again 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.610
 because now one wonders what is 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.530
 now with my settings or in 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.840
 what color is it now if 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.560
 I switch the lamp normally by switch 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.970
 making up 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.410
 I'll show you right away I'll do that 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.560
 Now off once and then again 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.560
 on 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.329
 soja maybe the click of the 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.560
 light switch heard that lasts the 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.000
 somehow saves it like that 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.409
 little right current so far the 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.700
 lice use the switch pushes up the 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.099
 lamp then goes out that can already 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.810
 be five seconds until it's out 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.519
 and if you turn it back on 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.560
 then the lamp has your last 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.180
 noted adjustment and then she catches 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.099
 I think that's very good again 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.720
 Of course, maybe one side 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.189
 one has stopped in the evening with red light 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.989
 and now it was the next 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.430
 evening or early evening then the next 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.139
 day shifted there now red light 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.940
 comes out and then you look first 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.829
 desperate again in the smartphone app 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.570
 connects to the lamp the whole 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.510
 does not work over bluetooth 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.720
 weather and of course then stop over 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.760
 content via the corresponding a box from 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.620
 50 euros is a proud price goes 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.750
 I do not know if it goes well 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.030
 if you have something he wants for colorful 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.979
 There is a lot of light out there 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.449
 I do not know if I'm just for 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.860
 colorful light to bring such an expensive thing 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.570
 or if I'm not something that I want 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.889
 so afterwards what with built-in 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.990
 would take speakers 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.449
 so say the cheapest 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.280
 lamp is out of the box test series and because 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.419
 It also works fine when I am 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.620
 the lamp because always at the light switch 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.940
 on and off and not per 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.520
 smartphone app or with me no 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.080
 that's why I would have the 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.180
 lamp easily on the spot I say 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.830
 Now just choose place three 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.520
 those of the box lamps that I have so far 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.500
 would have 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.760
 and with that we are actually through 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.050
 I would personally like such a thing 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.389
 grab somewhere 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.520
 I do not believe if it would be cheaper 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.479
 maybe as a bauble but completely 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.400
 honestly then i prefer to take that 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.720
 complete package and get me one 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.060
 lamp was also still speaker 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.470
 but it is blocked to the lamp we come 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.330
 that's what it was supposed to be next 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.130
 Thank you very much for watching it 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.130
 good and bye video bye
