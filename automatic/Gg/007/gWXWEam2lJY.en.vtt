00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
separate bowls and I've got some melted

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.660

chocolate<00:03:23.720> in<00:03:23.870> One<00:03:24.140> Bowl<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:24.620> then<00:03:25.250> I've<00:03:25.430> got

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
chocolate in One Bowl and then I've got

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.460 
chocolate in One Bowl and then I've got
some<00:03:26.000> of<00:03:26.239> that<00:03:26.300> leftover<00:03:26.630> caramel<00:03:27.320> in<00:03:27.410> the

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
some of that leftover caramel in the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.080 
some of that leftover caramel in the
other<00:03:27.620> Bowl<00:03:27.800> so<00:03:28.280> I'm<00:03:28.340> going<00:03:28.519> to<00:03:28.580> take<00:03:28.760> just<00:03:28.790> a

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
other Bowl so I'm going to take just a

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.850 
other Bowl so I'm going to take just a
couple<00:03:29.269> of<00:03:29.540> teaspoons<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.500> caramel

couple of teaspoons of the caramel

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.140 
couple of teaspoons of the caramel
because<00:03:31.010> that's<00:03:31.160> going<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.400> thin<00:03:31.670> your<00:03:31.700> icing

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
because that's going to thin your icing

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.660 
because that's going to thin your icing
down<00:03:32.330> and<00:03:32.540> make<00:03:32.660> it<00:03:32.780> a<00:03:32.840> little<00:03:33.170> bit<00:03:33.560> moister<00:03:34.250> so

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
down and make it a little bit moister so

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.130 
down and make it a little bit moister so
don't<00:03:34.880> start<00:03:35.120> with<00:03:35.209> your<00:03:35.300> icing<00:03:35.630> too<00:03:35.810> thin

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
don't start with your icing too thin

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.810 
don't start with your icing too thin
here<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.590> then<00:03:36.980> I'm<00:03:37.070> going<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.250> take<00:03:37.370> a<00:03:37.430> couple

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
here and then I'm going to take a couple

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.310 
here and then I'm going to take a couple
of<00:03:37.910> spoonfuls<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.600> melted<00:03:38.900> chocolate

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
of spoonfuls of the melted chocolate

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.020 
of spoonfuls of the melted chocolate
and<00:03:39.440> put<00:03:39.590> it<00:03:39.650> into<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:39.890> other<00:03:40.010> half<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:40.850> want

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030
