00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.819 
old and I said how can I get money
because<00:03:33.599> my<00:03:33.810> parents<00:03:34.170> certainly<00:03:34.290> don't<00:03:34.620> have

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
because my parents certainly don't have

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.949 
because my parents certainly don't have
it<00:03:35.040> where<00:03:35.879> there<00:03:36.239> would<00:03:36.390> never<00:03:36.569> have<00:03:36.659> happened

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
it where there would never have happened

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.860 
it where there would never have happened
and<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.069> said<00:03:38.370> I'm<00:03:38.879> gonna<00:03:39.120> start<00:03:39.390> a<00:03:39.480> lemonade

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
and so I said I'm gonna start a lemonade

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.190 
and so I said I'm gonna start a lemonade
stand<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.819> I<00:03:41.819> remember<00:03:42.090> my<00:03:42.209> parents<00:03:42.420> saying<00:03:42.720> a

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
that 10-speed bike so bad so I decided

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.690 
that 10-speed bike so bad so I decided
that<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.620> was<00:03:52.829> going<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.040> start<00:03:53.220> my<00:03:53.340> lemonade

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
that I was going to start my lemonade

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.819 
that I was going to start my lemonade
stand<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.359> so<00:03:54.840> every<00:03:55.049> day<00:03:55.109> I<00:03:55.230> would<00:03:55.409> take<00:03:55.620> my

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
stand and so every day I would take my

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.160 
stand and so every day I would take my
table<00:03:56.340> down<00:03:56.909> to<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:57.540> edge<00:03:57.750> of<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:57.989> driveway

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
table down to the edge of the driveway

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.750 
table down to the edge of the driveway
and<00:03:58.560> I'm<00:03:58.620> like<00:03:58.769> I<00:03:58.859> said<00:03:59.069> it's<00:03:59.190> like<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.340> quarter

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
and I'm like I said it's like a quarter

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.089 
and I'm like I said it's like a quarter
of<00:03:59.849> a<00:03:59.909> mile<00:04:00.060> down<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.329> driveway<00:04:00.769> and<00:04:01.769> I<00:04:01.859> put

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
of a mile down that driveway and I put

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.890 
of a mile down that driveway and I put
my<00:04:02.220> table<00:04:02.400> on<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.849> edge<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.329> I'd<00:04:03.450> sit<00:04:03.720> there

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
my table on the edge and I'd sit there

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.990 
my table on the edge and I'd sit there
and<00:04:03.959> like<00:04:04.079> wait<00:04:04.290> for<00:04:04.319> cars<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:04.980> go<00:04:05.099> by<00:04:05.280> now<00:04:05.940> the

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
and like wait for cars to go by now the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.149 
and like wait for cars to go by now the
interesting<00:04:06.389> thing<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.930> when<00:04:07.290> cars<00:04:07.620> went<00:04:07.950> by

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
interesting thing is when cars went by

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.720 
interesting thing is when cars went by
they<00:04:08.730> actually<00:04:09.090> didn't<00:04:09.510> stop<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.730> they

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
they actually didn't stop and they

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.190 
they actually didn't stop and they
stopped<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.299> then<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:12.569> know<00:04:12.689> my<00:04:12.810> lemonade

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
stopped and then you know my lemonade

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.979

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
was 50 Cent's but they often gave me a

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.020 
was 50 Cent's but they often gave me a
dollar<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:17.070> funny<00:04:17.280> thing<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:17.579> we<00:04:17.880> were
