i'll show you the bottom of the zoom
itself<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:40.229> with<00:01:40.350> all<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> ports<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.430> not

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
itself here with all the ports it's not

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.980 
itself here with all the ports it's not
very<00:01:41.670> well<00:01:41.939> lit<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.540> see<00:01:42.720> if<00:01:42.810> there's

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
very well lit but you can see if there's

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.440 
very well lit but you can see if there's
a<00:01:43.200> charging<00:01:43.979> port<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.790> bottom<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
a charging port on the bottom of the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.660 
a charging port on the bottom of the
zoom<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.680> what<00:01:46.890> will<00:01:46.979> take<00:01:47.159> advantage<00:01:47.579> of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
zoom that is what will take advantage of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.880 
zoom that is what will take advantage of
this<00:01:47.820> little<00:01:48.090> brick<00:01:48.270> here<00:01:48.570> not<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.530> bad<00:01:49.860> but

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
this little brick here not that bad but

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.410 
this little brick here not that bad but
you<00:01:50.280> know<00:01:50.369> it'll<00:01:50.549> stick<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> long<00:01:51.119> will<00:01:51.329> be

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
you know it'll stick in the long will be

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.999 
you know it'll stick in the long will be
out<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.630> way<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.049> that's<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
out of the way and that's it for the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.319 
out of the way and that's it for the
unboxing<00:01:53.329> so<00:01:55.670> hopefully<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:57.000> won't<00:01:57.149> be

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
unboxing so hopefully that won't be

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.810 
unboxing so hopefully that won't be
falling<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.229> we'll<00:01:58.350> go<00:01:58.469> ahead<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.950> see<00:01:59.670> if<00:01:59.729> we

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
falling so we'll go ahead and see if we

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.819 
falling so we'll go ahead and see if we
can<00:01:59.969> turn<00:02:00.180> these<00:02:00.360> zoom<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.930> already<00:02:01.530> with<00:02:01.710> the
