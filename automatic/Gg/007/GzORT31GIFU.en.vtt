00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
these types of orbital buffers these are

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.889 
these types of orbital buffers these are

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the layered foam backing pad and it's

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.960 
the layered foam backing pad and it's
ten<00:01:04.170> inches<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.500> diameter<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.820> bit

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
ten inches in diameter so it's a bit

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.670 
ten inches in diameter so it's a bit
bigger<00:01:06.180> than<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> six<00:01:06.660> and<00:01:06.840> variety<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.470> cover

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
bigger than the six and variety to cover

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.279 
bigger than the six and variety to cover
more<00:01:07.950> area<00:01:08.310> with<00:01:08.520> each<00:01:08.640> pass<00:01:08.910> and<00:01:09.300> out<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
more area with each pass and out of the

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.020 
more area with each pass and out of the
box<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.680> includes<00:01:10.979> two<00:01:11.220> bonnets<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.880> go

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
box and includes two bonnets that go

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.630 
box and includes two bonnets that go
over<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> phone<00:01:12.539> pad<00:01:12.780> an<00:01:13.340> application<00:01:14.340> bonnet

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
over the phone pad an application bonnet

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.920 
over the phone pad an application bonnet
so<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.759> can<00:01:14.850> apply<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.119> wax<00:01:15.330> onto<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> bond

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
so you can apply the wax onto the bond

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.719 
so you can apply the wax onto the bond
in<00:01:16.080> itself<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:17.039> can<00:01:17.190> use<00:01:17.310> either<00:01:17.429> paste

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
in itself and you can use either paste

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.359 
in itself and you can use either paste
wax<00:01:18.060> or<00:01:18.360> liquid<00:01:18.840> wax<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.709> either<00:01:19.890> works<00:01:20.100> fine

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
wax or liquid wax so either works fine

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.120 
wax or liquid wax so either works fine
and<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.450> second<00:01:21.840> bonnet<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.289> the<00:01:22.709> buffing

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and the second bonnet is the buffing

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.359 
and the second bonnet is the buffing
bonnet<00:01:23.490> which<00:01:24.209> has<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> synthetic<00:01:25.080> wool

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
bonnet which has a synthetic wool

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.770 
bonnet which has a synthetic wool
they're<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> best<00:01:26.819> fonts<00:01:27.270> by<00:01:27.420> any<00:01:27.569> means

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
they're not the best fonts by any means

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.020 
they're not the best fonts by any means
but<00:01:28.140> they<00:01:28.259> get<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.530> job<00:01:28.740> done<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.849> nice

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
but they get the job done and it's nice

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.949 
but they get the job done and it's nice
that<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.270> don't<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.599> to<00:01:30.720> go<00:01:30.810> out<00:01:30.929> and

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:30.959 
that you don't have to go out and

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:32.779 
that you don't have to go out and
purchase<00:01:31.200> them<00:01:31.500> which<00:01:32.009> leads<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.520> added

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
purchase them which leads to the added

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.760 
purchase them which leads to the added
additional<00:01:33.179> cost<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.509> purchase<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.619> only

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
additional cost of purchase the only

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.320 
additional cost of purchase the only
thing<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.009> need<00:01:35.130> us<00:01:35.280> apply<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.580> your<00:01:35.729> own<00:01:35.849> is

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
thing you need us apply on your own is

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.809 
thing you need us apply on your own is
wax<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:37.050> the<00:01:37.500> way<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.740> buffer<00:01:38.130> works<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
wax and the way this buffer works is it

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.699 
wax and the way this buffer works is it
spins<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.209> a<00:01:39.270> circular<00:01:39.479> motion<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
spins in a circular motion just like a

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.830 
spins in a circular motion just like a
tire<00:01:41.009> does<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.580> it<00:01:42.179> also<00:01:42.330> orbits<00:01:42.690> on<00:01:42.810> a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
tire does and it also orbits on a

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.749 
tire does and it also orbits on a
separate<00:01:43.200> axis<00:01:43.560> while<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> phone<00:01:44.250> pad<00:01:44.459> spins

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.819 

the<00:01:48.119> advantage<00:01:48.539> of<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.110> when<00:01:49.500> applying

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
the advantage of this is when applying

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.100 
the advantage of this is when applying
wax<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.149> added<00:01:51.329> orbital<00:01:51.689> motion<00:01:51.990> while<00:01:52.079> a

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
wax as the added orbital motion while a

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.279 
wax as the added orbital motion while a
foam<00:01:52.350> pad<00:01:52.530> spins<00:01:52.890> reduces<00:01:53.820> swirl<00:01:54.090> marks<00:01:54.289> when

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
foam pad spins reduces swirl marks when

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.660 
foam pad spins reduces swirl marks when
it<00:01:55.409> comes<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.649> your<00:01:55.740> car's<00:01:55.950> paint<00:01:56.219> job<00:01:56.460> you

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
it comes to your car's paint job you

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.760 
it comes to your car's paint job you
really<00:01:56.969> don't<00:01:57.179> want<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> marks<00:01:57.899> let's<00:01:58.560> take<00:01:58.740> a

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
really don't want to marks let's take a

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.200 
really don't want to marks let's take a
look<00:01:58.950> at<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.310> little<00:01:59.520> buffer<00:01:59.789> in<00:01:59.880> action

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
look at the so little buffer in action

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.389 
look at the so little buffer in action
to<00:02:00.299> see<00:02:00.329> how<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.750> does<00:02:01.009> starting<00:02:02.009> off<00:02:02.130> with<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
to see how it does starting off with the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.809 
to see how it does starting off with the
application<00:02:03.060> bonnet<00:02:03.390> using<00:02:03.990> liquid<00:02:04.259> wax

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.219 
application bonnet using liquid wax
remember<00:02:05.819> you<00:02:06.119> can<00:02:06.299> use<00:02:06.450> either<00:02:06.600> liquid<00:02:06.929> wax

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
remember you can use either liquid wax

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.249 
remember you can use either liquid wax
or<00:02:07.530> paste<00:02:07.979> wax<00:02:08.310> either<00:02:09.149> one<00:02:09.479> works<00:02:09.660> fine<00:02:09.929> I

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
or paste wax either one works fine I

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.500 
or paste wax either one works fine I
decided<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.280> go<00:02:11.370> with<00:02:11.400> liquid<00:02:11.819> wax<00:02:11.970> because

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
decided to go with liquid wax because

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.970 
decided to go with liquid wax because
it's<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.840> bit<00:02:13.080> easier<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.470> apply<00:02:13.620> onto<00:02:13.830> the
