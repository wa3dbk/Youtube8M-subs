I've researched as much as I can look to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.970 
I've researched as much as I can look to
every<00:00:35.850> single<00:00:36.090> still<00:00:36.540> frame<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.170> these<00:00:37.770> are

things that I can summarize from what

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.520 
things that I can summarize from what
we've<00:00:41.880> seen<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.780> first<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.290> all<00:00:43.380> of

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
we've seen here so first of all of

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.800 
we've seen here so first of all of
course<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:44.370> exosuits<00:00:45.030> most<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.390> us<00:00:45.510> kind<00:00:45.690> of

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
course the exosuits most of us kind of

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.600 
course the exosuits most of us kind of
knew<00:00:45.990> they<00:00:46.470> were<00:00:46.590> gonna<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> multiplayer

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
knew they were gonna be a multiplayer

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.190 
knew they were gonna be a multiplayer
and<00:00:47.790> they<00:00:47.910> were<00:00:48.030> pretty<00:00:48.450> much<00:00:48.630> confirmed

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
and they were pretty much confirmed

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.840 
and they were pretty much confirmed
although<00:00:49.470> we<00:00:49.620> hadn't<00:00:49.890> actually<00:00:50.010> seen<00:00:50.430> them<00:00:50.640> in

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
although we hadn't actually seen them in

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.010 
although we hadn't actually seen them in
any<00:00:51.120> multiplayer<00:00:51.360> footage<00:00:51.660> because<00:00:51.870> we

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
any multiplayer footage because we

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.170 
any multiplayer footage because we
hadn't<00:00:52.290> seen<00:00:52.470> any<00:00:52.740> yeah<00:00:53.220> but<00:00:53.430> here<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:53.730> see<00:00:53.760> two

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
hadn't seen any yeah but here we see two

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.930 
hadn't seen any yeah but here we see two
very<00:00:54.210> obvious<00:00:55.140> examples<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.160> how<00:00:56.340> they<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.790> be

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
very obvious examples of how they can be

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.840 
very obvious examples of how they can be
used<00:00:57.210> one<00:00:57.630> soldier<00:00:58.140> jumps<00:00:58.680> up<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.160> backwards

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
used one soldier jumps up and backwards

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.819 
used one soldier jumps up and backwards
to<00:01:00.000> get<00:01:00.150> behind<00:01:00.390> his<00:01:00.720> enemy<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.200> another

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
to get behind his enemy and another

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.830 
to get behind his enemy and another
soldier<00:01:02.340> uses<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.790> real<00:01:03.060> nice<00:01:03.360> strife

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
soldier uses a real nice strife

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.899 
soldier uses a real nice strife
personally<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.739> think<00:01:04.829> those<00:01:05.220> two<00:01:05.460> abilities

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
personally I think those two abilities

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.179 
personally I think those two abilities
will<00:01:06.270> probably<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:06.810> perks<00:01:07.200> maybe<00:01:07.799> even<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
will probably be perks maybe even the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.100 
will probably be perks maybe even the
high<00:01:08.340> jumps<00:01:08.790> will<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.060> perks<00:01:09.360> who<00:01:09.630> knows<00:01:09.840> maybe

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
high jumps will be perks who knows maybe

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.290 
high jumps will be perks who knows maybe
you'll<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.710> custom<00:01:11.369> amount<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.820> abilities

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
you'll have a custom amount of abilities

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.149 
you'll have a custom amount of abilities
that<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.750> attach<00:01:13.050> to<00:01:13.200> your<00:01:13.260> exosuit<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
that you can attach to your exosuit and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.649 
that you can attach to your exosuit and
you<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.520> unlock<00:01:14.670> different<00:01:15.060> ones<00:01:15.450> with

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
you can unlock different ones with

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.060 
you can unlock different ones with
different<00:01:16.050> kind<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.260> things<00:01:16.500> i'm<00:01:16.650> not<00:01:16.800> sure<00:01:16.950> if

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
different kind of things i'm not sure if

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.040 
different kind of things i'm not sure if
every<00:01:17.490> ability<00:01:17.700> will<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.479> available<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
every ability will be available to

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.960 
every ability will be available to
everyone<00:01:19.409> i<00:01:19.530> think<00:01:19.800> possibly<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.430> jump<00:01:20.729> one

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
everyone i think possibly the jump one

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.000 
everyone i think possibly the jump one
would<00:01:21.210> be<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.600> would<00:01:21.690> make<00:01:21.870> sense<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
would be that would make sense and the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.700 
would be that would make sense and the
other<00:01:23.159> ones<00:01:23.370> will<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.640> added<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.180> perks<00:01:24.479> but

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
other ones will be added on perks but

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.130 
other ones will be added on perks but
that<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:25.890> guesswork<00:01:26.370> so<00:01:26.760> who<00:01:27.000> knows<00:01:27.240> so

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
that is just guesswork so who knows so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.260 
that is just guesswork so who knows so
also<00:01:28.409> when<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:29.010> look<00:01:29.159> at<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.460> footage<00:01:29.760> as<00:01:30.030> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
also when we look at this footage as you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.000 
also when we look at this footage as you
see<00:01:30.479> during<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> multiplayer<00:01:31.560> bit<00:01:31.830> when<00:01:31.950> you

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
see during the multiplayer bit when you

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.950 
see during the multiplayer bit when you
see<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> first<00:01:32.490> person<00:01:32.850> perspective<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.810> can

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
see the first person perspective you can

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.990 
see the first person perspective you can
see<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.260> radar<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:34.979> top<00:01:35.340> left<00:01:35.880> hand

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
see the radar in the top left hand

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.149 
see the radar in the top left hand
corner<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.780> black<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.440> white<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:37.950> not

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
corner is black and white it's not

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.680 
corner is black and white it's not
normally<00:01:38.549> black<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.030> white<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.390> call<00:01:39.570> of

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
normally black and white in a call of

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.330 
normally black and white in a call of
duty<00:01:39.990> game<00:01:40.200> no<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.409> think<00:01:40.740> they've<00:01:40.920> done<00:01:41.159> this

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
duty game no I think they've done this

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.520 
duty game no I think they've done this
to<00:01:41.790> make<00:01:41.940> it<00:01:41.970> subtle<00:01:42.510> I<00:01:42.810> know<00:01:42.869> they<00:01:43.170> were<00:01:43.229> going

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
to make it subtle I know they were going

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.230 
to make it subtle I know they were going
for<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.770> kind<00:01:44.010> of<00:01:44.159> feel<00:01:44.400> where<00:01:44.820> they<00:01:44.909> had<00:01:45.090> as

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
for a kind of feel where they had as

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.390 
for a kind of feel where they had as
little<00:01:45.420> HUD<00:01:45.810> as<00:01:45.990> possible<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:46.770> screen<00:01:47.159> and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
little HUD as possible on screen and

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.830 
little HUD as possible on screen and
only<00:01:47.820> looked<00:01:48.000> at<00:01:48.090> some<00:01:48.330> of<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> actual

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
only looked at some of the actual

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.149 
only looked at some of the actual
single-player<00:01:49.320> footage<00:01:49.619> we<00:01:49.740> were<00:01:49.860> thinking

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
single-player footage we were thinking

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.280 
single-player footage we were thinking
maybe<00:01:50.190> there'd<00:01:50.549> be<00:01:50.640> no<00:01:50.820> HUD<00:01:51.090> whatsoever<00:01:52.080> but

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
maybe there'd be no HUD whatsoever but

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.660 
maybe there'd be no HUD whatsoever but
you<00:01:52.409> can<00:01:52.560> see<00:01:52.740> there<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.010> definitely<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.430> hard

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
you can see there is definitely a hard

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.490 
you can see there is definitely a hard
here<00:01:53.909> heads-up<00:01:54.299> display<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:55.260> some

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
here heads-up display with some

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.590 
here heads-up display with some
information<00:01:55.650> on<00:01:56.220> and<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.430> radar<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:57.030> black

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
information on and the radar is black

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.240 
information on and the radar is black
and<00:01:57.780> white<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.380> don't<00:01:58.710> know<00:01:58.830> if<00:01:59.040> that's

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
and white so I don't know if that's

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.070 
and white so I don't know if that's
going<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.430> be<00:01:59.520> difficult<00:01:59.670> for<00:02:00.150> a<00:02:00.479> colorblind

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
going to be difficult for a colorblind

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.870 
going to be difficult for a colorblind
people<00:02:01.290> or<00:02:01.710> maybe<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:01.979> helps<00:02:02.400> with<00:02:02.520> color<00:02:02.729> by

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
people or maybe that helps with color by

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.160 
people or maybe that helps with color by
on<00:02:02.970> people<00:02:03.270> because<00:02:03.420> then<00:02:03.720> they<00:02:03.840> don't<00:02:03.990> get

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
on people because then they don't get

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.020 
on people because then they don't get
confused<00:02:04.470> you<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.159> see<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.700> friendly

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030

shooting but that's something you can
know<00:03:07.260> next<00:03:08.260> up<00:03:08.380> when<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.530> look<00:03:08.770> at<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:08.980> map<00:03:09.220> I

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
know next up when I look at the map I

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.790 
know next up when I look at the map I
can<00:03:09.790> kind<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.090> see<00:03:10.300> that<00:03:10.480> this<00:03:10.660> might<00:03:11.200> be<00:03:11.500> San

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
can kind of see that this might be San

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.800 
can kind of see that this might be San
Francisco<00:03:12.520> it's<00:03:12.700> definitely<00:03:13.120> got<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.480> Golden

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
Francisco it's definitely got the Golden

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.870 
Francisco it's definitely got the Golden
Gate<00:03:14.020> Bridge<00:03:14.050> look<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:15.040> who<00:03:15.460> knows<00:03:15.520> it

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
Gate Bridge look to it who knows it

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.580 
Gate Bridge look to it who knows it
could<00:03:15.910> be<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.210> fictional<00:03:16.720> version<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.350> their

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
could be a fictional version of their

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.530 
could be a fictional version of their
other<00:03:18.160> than<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.580> with<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.910> map<00:03:19.090> obviously

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
other than that with the map obviously

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.390 
other than that with the map obviously
the<00:03:19.690> main<00:03:19.960> thing<00:03:20.260> we<00:03:20.410> notice<00:03:20.710> is<00:03:20.740> the<00:03:20.980> tidal

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
the main thing we notice is the tidal

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.920 
the main thing we notice is the tidal
wave<00:03:21.550> coming<00:03:21.880> in<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.210> guessing<00:03:22.630> there's<00:03:22.780> gonna

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
wave coming in I guessing there's gonna

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.410 
wave coming in I guessing there's gonna
be<00:03:23.140> dynamic<00:03:23.650> events<00:03:23.770> on<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.220> much<00:03:24.880> larger<00:03:25.150> scale

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
be dynamic events on a much larger scale

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.120 
be dynamic events on a much larger scale
than<00:03:25.660> they're<00:03:25.990> wearing<00:03:26.260> goats<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.709> go<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:26.950> the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
than they're wearing goats and go to the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.949 
than they're wearing goats and go to the
dynamic<00:03:27.310> events<00:03:27.640> what<00:03:28.209> kind<00:03:28.450> of<00:03:28.570> laughable

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
dynamic events what kind of laughable

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.230 
dynamic events what kind of laughable
but<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:29.470> huge<00:03:29.890> tidal<00:03:30.250> wave<00:03:30.550> does<00:03:31.030> look

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
but that huge tidal wave does look

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.120 
but that huge tidal wave does look
really<00:03:31.600> cool<00:03:31.959> and<00:03:32.200> could<00:03:32.380> be<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.530> bit<00:03:32.770> of<00:03:32.800> a<00:03:32.950> game

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
really cool and could be a bit of a game

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.830 
really cool and could be a bit of a game
changer<00:03:33.580> more<00:03:33.790> on<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.030> scale<00:03:34.330> of<00:03:34.480> the

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
changer more on the scale of the

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.290 
changer more on the scale of the
battlefield<00:03:35.290> 4<00:03:35.430> events<00:03:36.430> that<00:03:36.730> we<00:03:36.820> see<00:03:36.970> happen

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
battlefield 4 events that we see happen

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.330 
battlefield 4 events that we see happen
in<00:03:37.480> that<00:03:37.750> game<00:03:38.020> next<00:03:38.560> thing<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:38.740> know<00:03:38.770> is<00:03:39.100> that

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
in that game next thing I know is that

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.400 
in that game next thing I know is that
the<00:03:39.640> map<00:03:39.850> seems<00:03:40.120> quite<00:03:40.450> large<00:03:40.720> just<00:03:41.020> for<00:03:41.170> first

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
the map seems quite large just for first

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.500 
the map seems quite large just for first
impressions<00:03:41.560> looking<00:03:42.250> at<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.490> quite<00:03:42.940> open

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
impressions looking at it quite open

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.870 
impressions looking at it quite open
looks<00:03:44.260> like<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.440> large<00:03:44.740> area<00:03:45.130> maybe<00:03:45.580> that<00:03:45.790> won't

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
looks like a large area maybe that won't

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.610 
looks like a large area maybe that won't
be<00:03:46.060> a<00:03:46.090> problem<00:03:46.150> because<00:03:46.810> obviously<00:03:47.230> you've

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
be a problem because obviously you've

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.380 
be a problem because obviously you've
got<00:03:47.740> the<00:03:47.830> exosuits<00:03:48.520> to<00:03:48.700> get<00:03:48.850> around<00:03:49.030> quickly

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
got the exosuits to get around quickly

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.540 
got the exosuits to get around quickly
and<00:03:49.750> jump<00:03:49.959> higher<00:03:50.200> but<00:03:50.920> it<00:03:51.010> does<00:03:51.130> look<00:03:51.160> quite

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
and jump higher but it does look quite

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.890 
and jump higher but it does look quite
larger<00:03:52.030> but<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.209> don't<00:03:52.420> really<00:03:52.510> see<00:03:52.600> that<00:03:52.840> as

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
larger but I don't really see that as

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.330 
larger but I don't really see that as
being<00:03:52.990> a<00:03:53.230> problem<00:03:53.380> because<00:03:53.860> it<00:03:53.980> looks<00:03:54.130> quite

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
being a problem because it looks quite

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.890 
being a problem because it looks quite
open<00:03:54.790> as<00:03:54.910> well<00:03:55.090> one<00:03:55.330> thing<00:03:55.510> that's<00:03:55.660> knowing

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
open as well one thing that's knowing

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.870 
open as well one thing that's knowing
about<00:03:55.990> large<00:03:56.830> maps<00:03:57.130> is<00:03:57.310> when<00:03:57.430> they<00:03:57.520> have<00:03:57.670> lots

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
about large maps is when they have lots

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.370 
about large maps is when they have lots
of<00:03:58.090> little<00:03:58.240> corridors<00:03:58.780> in<00:03:58.900> them<00:03:59.080> and<00:03:59.230> they're

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
of little corridors in them and they're

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.320 
of little corridors in them and they're
still<00:03:59.590> huge<00:03:59.920> a<00:04:00.160> large<00:04:00.459> open<00:04:00.610> map<00:04:01.060> could

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
still huge a large open map could

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.170 
still huge a large open map could
actually<00:04:01.480> be<00:04:01.810> quite<00:04:02.080> fun<00:04:02.700> next<00:04:03.700> up<00:04:03.790> let's<00:04:03.940> talk

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
actually be quite fun next up let's talk

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.390 
actually be quite fun next up let's talk
about<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:04.600> gun<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:05.290> gun<00:04:05.440> looks<00:04:05.740> like<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:05.980> slow

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
about the gun the gun looks like a slow

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.730 
about the gun the gun looks like a slow
fire<00:04:06.730> rate<00:04:06.880> automatic<00:04:07.870> assault<00:04:08.260> rifle

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
fire rate automatic assault rifle

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.190 
fire rate automatic assault rifle
similar<00:04:09.370> in<00:04:09.490> construction<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:10.240> an<00:04:10.360> SMR<00:04:10.959> if<00:04:11.110> you

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
similar in construction to an SMR if you

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.420 
similar in construction to an SMR if you
look<00:04:11.350> at<00:04:11.440> it<00:04:11.470> looks<00:04:11.680> kind<00:04:11.890> of<00:04:11.950> similar<00:04:12.070> to<00:04:12.280> the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
look at it looks kind of similar to the

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.730 
look at it looks kind of similar to the
SMR<00:04:12.970> in<00:04:13.120> black<00:04:13.660> ops<00:04:13.810> 2<00:04:13.930> especially<00:04:14.500> when<00:04:14.650> you

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
SMR in black ops 2 especially when you

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.250 
SMR in black ops 2 especially when you
look<00:04:14.890> at<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.820> reticle<00:04:16.600> shall<00:04:16.840> I<00:04:16.900> say<00:04:17.109> the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
look at the the reticle shall I say the

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.990 
look at the the reticle shall I say the
iron<00:04:17.590> sight<00:04:17.830> it's<00:04:18.010> got<00:04:18.220> there<00:04:18.430> not<00:04:18.609> wreck<00:04:18.820> or

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
iron sight it's got there not wreck or

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.270 
iron sight it's got there not wreck or
sorry<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:20.140> so<00:04:20.350> looks<00:04:20.560> like<00:04:20.620> it<00:04:20.859> could<00:04:21.100> be<00:04:21.130> a

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
sorry and so looks like it could be a

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.010 
sorry and so looks like it could be a
long-range<00:04:22.000> weapons<00:04:22.570> got<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:22.840> very

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
long-range weapons got a very

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.600 
long-range weapons got a very
interesting<00:04:23.410> look<00:04:23.620> to<00:04:23.830> it<00:04:23.950> I<00:04:24.100> didn't<00:04:24.520> actually

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
interesting look to it I didn't actually

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.880 
interesting look to it I didn't actually
see<00:04:25.000> any<00:04:25.210> ability<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:25.870> print<00:04:26.200> bullets<00:04:26.740> we

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
see any ability to print bullets we

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.830 
see any ability to print bullets we
talked<00:04:27.100> about<00:04:27.340> in<00:04:27.430> a<00:04:27.460> previous<00:04:27.490> video<00:04:27.970> of<00:04:28.390> mine

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
talked about in a previous video of mine

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.570 
talked about in a previous video of mine
where<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:29.140> could<00:04:29.350> actually<00:04:29.380> print<00:04:30.070> bullet<00:04:30.400> on

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
where you could actually print bullet on

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.629 
where you could actually print bullet on
the<00:04:31.030> flight<00:04:31.270> with<00:04:31.570> your<00:04:31.810> gun<00:04:32.050> but

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
the flight with your gun but

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.520 
the flight with your gun but
don't<00:04:32.849> see<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.150> on<00:04:33.270> here<00:04:33.599> but<00:04:33.930> that<00:04:34.110> might<00:04:34.379> be

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
don't see that on here but that might be

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.260 
don't see that on here but that might be
an<00:04:34.650> attachment<00:04:35.009> that<00:04:35.430> you<00:04:35.460> actually<00:04:35.669> add<00:04:35.999> to

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
an attachment that you actually add to

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.420 
an attachment that you actually add to
the<00:04:36.360> weapon<00:04:36.719> but<00:04:37.289> no<00:04:37.439> sign<00:04:37.650> of<00:04:37.710> that<00:04:37.979> as<00:04:38.129> per

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
the weapon but no sign of that as per

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.860 
the weapon but no sign of that as per
default<00:04:38.939> if<00:04:39.060> we<00:04:39.180> were<00:04:39.240> wondering<00:04:39.599> if<00:04:39.689> that

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
default if we were wondering if that

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.719 
default if we were wondering if that
would<00:04:39.990> be<00:04:40.020> on<00:04:40.199> every<00:04:40.560> weapon<00:04:40.710> it<00:04:41.069> doesn't<00:04:41.669> look

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
would be on every weapon it doesn't look

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.790 
would be on every weapon it doesn't look
like<00:04:41.969> it<00:04:42.210> will<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:43.169> gun<00:04:43.319> actually<00:04:43.620> looks

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
like it will the gun actually looks

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.529 
like it will the gun actually looks
pretty<00:04:43.919> cool<00:04:44.219> as<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:44.490> is<00:04:44.610> no<00:04:44.849> camera<00:04:45.240> on<00:04:45.389> it

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
pretty cool as it is no camera on it

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.480 
pretty cool as it is no camera on it

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
made by Atlas which is interesting if

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.529 
made by Atlas which is interesting if
you<00:04:47.520> have<00:04:47.669> a<00:04:47.699> look<00:04:47.849> at<00:04:47.969> it<00:04:48.060> that<00:04:48.210> she<00:04:48.360> says

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
you have a look at it that she says

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.749 
you have a look at it that she says
Atlas<00:04:49.020> on<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.439> weapon<00:04:49.590> does<00:04:50.219> this<00:04:50.400> mean<00:04:50.699> that

atlas I don't know what happy to see
another<00:05:04.020> obvious<00:05:04.229> things<00:05:04.620> this<00:05:04.919> guy<00:05:05.099> gets<00:05:05.400> a

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
another obvious things this guy gets a

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.580 
another obvious things this guy gets a
skeet<00:05:05.909> shooter<00:05:06.330> medal<00:05:06.719> for<00:05:06.960> killing<00:05:06.990> this<00:05:07.349> guy

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
skeet shooter medal for killing this guy

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.320 
skeet shooter medal for killing this guy
I<00:05:07.889> would<00:05:07.949> guess<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:08.699> it<00:05:08.789> would<00:05:09.029> be<00:05:09.060> pretty

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
I would guess and it would be pretty

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.300 
I would guess and it would be pretty
obvious<00:05:09.539> but<00:05:10.199> skeet<00:05:10.560> sure<00:05:10.740> would<00:05:10.949> be<00:05:11.099> first

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
obvious but skeet sure would be first

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.980 
obvious but skeet sure would be first
shooting<00:05:11.550> someone<00:05:11.969> who's<00:05:12.150> jumping<00:05:12.449> in<00:05:12.840> the

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
shooting someone who's jumping in the

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.170 
shooting someone who's jumping in the
air<00:05:13.020> like<00:05:13.409> skeet<00:05:13.770> shooting<00:05:14.129> in<00:05:14.490> real<00:05:14.819> life<00:05:15.060> I'm

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
air like skeet shooting in real life I'm

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.939 
air like skeet shooting in real life I'm
sure<00:05:15.330> something<00:05:15.599> you<00:05:15.719> know<00:05:15.870> what<00:05:16.319> that<00:05:16.529> is<00:05:16.710> all

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
sure something you know what that is all

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.610 
sure something you know what that is all
about<00:05:17.180> now<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.240> next<00:05:18.659> big<00:05:18.960> thing<00:05:18.990> that<00:05:19.319> I've

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
about now the next big thing that I've

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.709 
about now the next big thing that I've
noticed<00:05:19.650> here<00:05:20.340> that<00:05:20.370> isn't<00:05:20.729> very<00:05:20.939> obvious<00:05:21.599> at

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
noticed here that isn't very obvious at

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.600 
noticed here that isn't very obvious at
all<00:05:21.900> when<00:05:22.080> you<00:05:22.139> first<00:05:22.439> look<00:05:22.680> is<00:05:22.830> the

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
all when you first look is the

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.399 
all when you first look is the
killstreaks<00:05:24.270> or<00:05:24.539> should<00:05:24.719> I<00:05:24.750> say<00:05:24.839> point

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
killstreaks or should I say point

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.679 
killstreaks or should I say point
streaks<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:25.949> looks<00:05:26.189> to<00:05:26.370> me<00:05:26.550> like<00:05:26.759> they<00:05:27.539> are

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:27.689 
streaks it looks to me like they are

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:29.149 
streaks it looks to me like they are
point<00:05:27.990> streaks<00:05:28.289> now<00:05:28.439> the<00:05:28.500> video<00:05:28.860> isn't

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
point streaks now the video isn't

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.249 
point streaks now the video isn't
exactly<00:05:29.610> super<00:05:30.120> high<00:05:30.270> quality<00:05:30.300> so<00:05:30.900> it's<00:05:31.050> quite

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
exactly super high quality so it's quite

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:32.959 
exactly super high quality so it's quite
difficult<00:05:31.529> to<00:05:31.800> make<00:05:31.949> out<00:05:32.159> but<00:05:32.370> if<00:05:32.639> you<00:05:32.699> look<00:05:32.819> at

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
difficult to make out but if you look at

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:34.309 
difficult to make out but if you look at
the<00:05:33.060> right<00:05:33.270> hand<00:05:33.300> side<00:05:33.599> looks<00:05:34.020> like<00:05:34.080> we've<00:05:34.289> got

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 
the right hand side looks like we've got

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.409 
the right hand side looks like we've got
to<00:05:34.680> score<00:05:34.889> streaks<00:05:35.339> they're<00:05:35.610> kind<00:05:36.120> of<00:05:36.210> like<00:05:36.360> a

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
to score streaks they're kind of like a

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.290 
to score streaks they're kind of like a
jewel<00:05:36.870> rotor<00:05:37.169> flying<00:05:37.650> thing<00:05:38.490> like<00:05:38.909> similar<00:05:39.210> to

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
jewel rotor flying thing like similar to

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.959 
jewel rotor flying thing like similar to
the<00:05:39.479> quadrotor<00:05:39.930> from<00:05:40.289> is<00:05:40.919> it<00:05:41.069> ghosts<00:05:41.699> or<00:05:41.789> black

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:41.969 
the quadrotor from is it ghosts or black

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.209 
the quadrotor from is it ghosts or black
ops<00:05:42.150> 2<00:05:42.330> I<00:05:42.750> remember<00:05:43.319> which<00:05:43.439> one<00:05:43.650> that<00:05:43.680> was<00:05:43.919> in<00:05:44.069> I

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:44.219 
ops 2 I remember which one that was in I

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.740 
ops 2 I remember which one that was in I
think<00:05:44.639> that<00:05:44.669> was<00:05:44.819> in<00:05:44.909> back<00:05:45.029> of<00:05:45.089> us<00:05:45.300> directly

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
think that was in back of us directly

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.950 
think that was in back of us directly
and<00:05:45.990> also<00:05:46.589> like<00:05:46.949> a<00:05:46.979> little<00:05:47.430> possible<00:05:48.029> UAV<00:05:48.719> or

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
and also like a little possible UAV or

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.570 
and also like a little possible UAV or
something<00:05:49.349> similar<00:05:49.770> either<00:05:50.399> way<00:05:50.550> the

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
something similar either way the

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.550 
something similar either way the
important<00:05:51.270> thing<00:05:51.449> is<00:05:51.629> is<00:05:51.779> that<00:05:52.110> you<00:05:52.229> can<00:05:52.379> see

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
important thing is is that you can see

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.260 
important thing is is that you can see
there<00:05:52.710> are<00:05:52.740> two<00:05:52.860> numbers<00:05:53.460> written<00:05:53.669> in<00:05:53.969> the<00:05:54.060> top

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
there are two numbers written in the top

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.850 
there are two numbers written in the top
left-hand<00:05:54.539> corner<00:05:54.719> of<00:05:55.050> both<00:05:55.259> of<00:05:55.289> those<00:05:55.589> I'm

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
left-hand corner of both of those I'm

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.379 
left-hand corner of both of those I'm
guessing<00:05:56.550> that<00:05:56.580> is<00:05:56.759> the<00:05:56.849> amount<00:05:57.000> of<00:05:57.149> points

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
guessing that is the amount of points

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.629 
guessing that is the amount of points
you<00:05:57.509> need<00:05:57.569> to<00:05:57.719> get<00:05:58.020> now<00:05:58.830> before<00:05:59.219> the<00:05:59.339> guy<00:05:59.490> has

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
you need to get now before the guy has

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.700 
you need to get now before the guy has
got<00:05:59.669> the<00:06:00.029> cure<00:06:00.300> they're<00:06:00.779> the<00:06:01.110> box<00:06:01.500> is

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
got the cure they're the box is

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.589 
got the cure they're the box is
completely<00:06:02.250> empty<00:06:02.370> and<00:06:02.610> once<00:06:02.969> the<00:06:03.120> guy<00:06:03.240> gets

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
completely empty and once the guy gets

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:05.450 
completely empty and once the guy gets
the<00:06:03.750> kill<00:06:03.990> you<00:06:04.319> can<00:06:04.500> see<00:06:04.710> it<00:06:04.830> slightly<00:06:05.129> feels

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
the kill you can see it slightly feels

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.459 
the kill you can see it slightly feels
up<00:06:05.699> from<00:06:05.969> the<00:06:06.089> left<00:06:06.330> to<00:06:06.479> the<00:06:06.629> right<00:06:06.719> we<00:06:07.349> have<00:06:07.379> a

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:07.469 
up from the left to the right we have a

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.920 
up from the left to the right we have a
little<00:06:07.680> bit<00:06:07.889> of<00:06:07.919> a<00:06:08.219> I<00:06:08.490> suppose<00:06:08.819> why<00:06:09.330> opaque

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
little bit of a I suppose why opaque

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.050 
little bit of a I suppose why opaque
kind<00:06:10.259> of<00:06:10.379> area<00:06:10.740> fills<00:06:11.039> up<00:06:11.310> so<00:06:11.699> it<00:06:11.759> looks<00:06:11.939> like

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
kind of area fills up so it looks like

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.300 
kind of area fills up so it looks like
that<00:06:12.419> is<00:06:12.539> filling<00:06:12.960> up<00:06:13.080> so<00:06:13.319> as<00:06:13.469> you<00:06:13.800> get<00:06:14.099> the

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
that is filling up so as you get the

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.550 
that is filling up so as you get the
points<00:06:14.729> you'll<00:06:15.389> get<00:06:15.569> closer<00:06:15.870> to<00:06:16.139> pushing<00:06:16.379> that

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
points you'll get closer to pushing that

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.559 
points you'll get closer to pushing that
to<00:06:16.740> the<00:06:16.830> end<00:06:17.039> and<00:06:17.250> then<00:06:17.399> when<00:06:17.610> the<00:06:17.789> actual<00:06:18.389> box

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:18.569 
to the end and then when the actual box

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:20.300 
to the end and then when the actual box
is<00:06:18.750> completely<00:06:19.259> fill<00:06:19.439> up<00:06:19.560> you'll<00:06:19.919> get<00:06:20.159> the

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
is completely fill up you'll get the

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.889 
is completely fill up you'll get the
streak<00:06:20.610> that<00:06:20.789> is<00:06:20.939> definitely<00:06:21.419> how<00:06:21.569> it<00:06:21.719> looks

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:21.899 
streak that is definitely how it looks

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:23.990 
streak that is definitely how it looks
to<00:06:22.050> me<00:06:22.080> a<00:06:22.229> slightly<00:06:22.649> different<00:06:22.949> system<00:06:23.550> that's

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
to me a slightly different system that's

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.969 
to me a slightly different system that's
similar<00:06:24.449> to<00:06:24.479> black<00:06:24.779> ops<00:06:24.960> 2<00:06:25.229> so<00:06:25.560> for<00:06:25.830> me<00:06:25.949> that

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
similar to black ops 2 so for me that

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.219 
similar to black ops 2 so for me that
looks<00:06:26.430> like<00:06:26.610> how<00:06:26.819> it<00:06:27.000> works<00:06:27.240> obviously<00:06:28.050> that

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
looks like how it works obviously that

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:29.839 
looks like how it works obviously that
is<00:06:28.349> just<00:06:28.589> are<00:06:28.710> still<00:06:28.979> a<00:06:29.009> bit<00:06:29.250> of<00:06:29.279> a<00:06:29.399> guess<00:06:29.610> but

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
is just are still a bit of a guess but

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:31.159 
is just are still a bit of a guess but
it<00:06:30.000> would<00:06:30.089> be<00:06:30.120> very<00:06:30.330> strange<00:06:30.479> if<00:06:30.750> it<00:06:30.870> didn't

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
it would be very strange if it didn't

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:32.899 
it would be very strange if it didn't
that<00:06:31.589> seems<00:06:31.889> to<00:06:32.009> be<00:06:32.039> how<00:06:32.219> it<00:06:32.339> works<00:06:32.580> from<00:06:32.729> what

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 
that seems to be how it works from what

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:34.290 
that seems to be how it works from what
we<00:06:33.060> see<00:06:33.240> happening<00:06:33.449> on

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
we see happening on

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.600 
we see happening on
ring<00:06:34.419> next<00:06:35.379> up<00:06:35.530> and<00:06:35.740> the<00:06:35.830> final<00:06:36.220> thing<00:06:36.250> that<00:06:36.550> I

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
ring next up and the final thing that I

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.189 
ring next up and the final thing that I
really<00:06:36.940> noticed<00:06:37.120> here<00:06:37.569> in<00:06:37.780> this<00:06:37.960> little

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
really noticed here in this little

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.379 
really noticed here in this little
snippet<00:06:38.500> of<00:06:38.830> gameplay<00:06:39.250> is<00:06:39.550> the<00:06:39.729> two<00:06:39.909> grenades

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:40.389 
snippet of gameplay is the two grenades

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:42.149 
snippet of gameplay is the two grenades
or<00:06:40.690> tactical<00:06:41.259> grenades<00:06:41.319> well<00:06:41.889> they<00:06:42.009> could

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:42.159 
or tactical grenades well they could

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:44.279 
or tactical grenades well they could
even<00:06:42.310> be<00:06:42.699> I'm<00:06:43.060> not<00:06:43.449> sure<00:06:43.720> that<00:06:43.750> could<00:06:44.020> be<00:06:44.080> like

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:44.289 
even be I'm not sure that could be like

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:45.899 
even be I'm not sure that could be like
special<00:06:44.860> weapons<00:06:45.220> because<00:06:45.340> they<00:06:45.460> kind<00:06:45.789> of

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:45.909 
special weapons because they kind of

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:48.059 
special weapons because they kind of
look<00:06:46.090> like<00:06:46.120> shields<00:06:46.930> however<00:06:47.680> the<00:06:47.830> bottom

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:48.069 
look like shields however the bottom

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:50.219 
look like shields however the bottom
right-hand<00:06:48.220> corner<00:06:48.430> as<00:06:48.849> you<00:06:49.000> can<00:06:49.180> see<00:06:49.419> there

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:50.229 
right-hand corner as you can see there

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:52.230 
right-hand corner as you can see there
is<00:06:50.259> two<00:06:50.590> possible<00:06:51.190> grenades<00:06:51.639> and<00:06:51.849> you<00:06:51.940> can<00:06:52.090> see

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
is two possible grenades and you can see

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.939 
is two possible grenades and you can see
they<00:06:52.389> seem<00:06:52.599> to<00:06:52.629> have<00:06:52.750> like<00:06:52.990> a<00:06:53.020> battery<00:06:53.500> style

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:53.949 
they seem to have like a battery style

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:57.119 
they seem to have like a battery style
like<00:06:54.940> kind<00:06:55.240> of<00:06:55.330> display<00:06:56.050> underneath<00:06:56.830> so<00:06:57.039> I'm

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:57.129 
like kind of display underneath so I'm

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:58.890 
like kind of display underneath so I'm
guessing<00:06:57.430> that<00:06:57.759> is<00:06:57.849> a<00:06:57.879> battery<00:06:58.210> style<00:06:58.659> thing

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900 
guessing that is a battery style thing

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.149 
guessing that is a battery style thing
they<00:06:59.050> have<00:06:59.229> like<00:06:59.409> a<00:06:59.440> certain<00:06:59.889> amount<00:07:00.039> of

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:00.159 
they have like a certain amount of

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:02.189 
they have like a certain amount of
charge<00:07:00.550> or<00:07:00.909> something<00:07:01.599> like<00:07:01.780> that<00:07:01.840> obviously

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 
charge or something like that obviously

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:03.960 
charge or something like that obviously
I'm<00:07:02.470> not<00:07:02.530> sure<00:07:02.800> of<00:07:02.979> the<00:07:03.009> details<00:07:03.280> but<00:07:03.669> just

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
I'm not sure of the details but just

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.610 
I'm not sure of the details but just
guessing<00:07:04.389> I<00:07:04.539> would<00:07:04.960> say<00:07:05.139> they<00:07:05.289> are<00:07:05.379> probably

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
guessing I would say they are probably

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.379 
guessing I would say they are probably
grenades<00:07:06.159> that<00:07:06.370> have<00:07:06.520> some<00:07:06.759> sort<00:07:06.940> of<00:07:07.030> charge

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:07.389 
grenades that have some sort of charge

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:09.180 
grenades that have some sort of charge
to<00:07:07.479> them<00:07:07.870> or<00:07:08.020> they<00:07:08.110> need<00:07:08.349> to<00:07:08.469> be<00:07:08.620> charged<00:07:09.039> I

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190 
to them or they need to be charged I

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.490 
to them or they need to be charged I
don't<00:07:09.580> know<00:07:09.729> possibly<00:07:10.030> the<00:07:10.479> more<00:07:10.690> you<00:07:10.870> hold

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:11.500 
don't know possibly the more you hold

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.439 
don't know possibly the more you hold
down<00:07:11.680> a<00:07:11.740> button<00:07:12.159> the<00:07:12.340> more<00:07:12.520> charge<00:07:12.819> users<00:07:13.330> and

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:13.449 
down a button the more charge users and

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:15.420 
down a button the more charge users and
the<00:07:13.509> more<00:07:13.629> powerful<00:07:13.930> is<00:07:14.259> all<00:07:14.680> just<00:07:15.069> guesswork

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.430 
the more powerful is all just guesswork

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.860 
the more powerful is all just guesswork
but<00:07:15.550> maybe<00:07:15.969> that's<00:07:16.180> something<00:07:16.389> you<00:07:16.539> didn't

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:16.870 
but maybe that's something you didn't

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.080 
but maybe that's something you didn't
notice<00:07:17.110> that<00:07:17.289> I<00:07:17.560> picked<00:07:17.889> out<00:07:18.069> there<00:07:18.370> of<00:07:18.550> course
