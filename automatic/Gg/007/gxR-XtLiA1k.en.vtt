00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.410 
think this still interacting with each
other<00:05:31.030> see<00:05:33.040> but<00:05:34.040> I'm<00:05:34.430> really<00:05:34.790> good<00:05:35.120> about

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
other see but I'm really good about

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.300 
other see but I'm really good about
Darth<00:05:35.690> Maul<00:05:35.930> because<00:05:36.380> I<00:05:36.530> would<00:05:36.710> have<00:05:37.100> borrowed

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
Darth Maul because I would have borrowed

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.190 
Darth Maul because I would have borrowed
it<00:05:37.490> from<00:05:37.580> our<00:05:37.730> kazaaam<00:05:38.120> as<00:05:38.240> well<00:05:38.420> but<00:05:38.690> I<00:05:38.720> was

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
it from our kazaaam as well but I was

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.770 
it from our kazaaam as well but I was
sure<00:05:39.380> I<00:05:39.410> had<00:05:39.620> one<00:05:39.830> I<00:05:39.860> do<00:05:40.190> but<00:05:40.630> don't<00:05:41.630> know<00:05:41.690> why

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
sure I had one I do but don't know why

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.380 
sure I had one I do but don't know why
it's<00:05:41.900> not<00:05:41.960> working<00:05:42.760> well<00:05:43.760> these<00:05:43.880> are<00:05:44.060> great<00:05:44.150> I

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
it's not working well these are great I

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.110 
it's not working well these are great I
really<00:05:44.420> like<00:05:44.840> these<00:05:45.020> I<00:05:45.760> think<00:05:46.760> it<00:05:46.970> has

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
really like these I think it has

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.250 
really like these I think it has
something<00:05:47.330> similar<00:05:47.840> I<00:05:47.870> think<00:05:47.900> I<00:05:48.080> had<00:05:48.200> two

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
something similar I think I had two

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.170 
something similar I think I had two
Darth<00:05:48.500> Vader<00:05:48.770> one<00:05:49.040> but<00:05:50.030> yeah<00:05:51.940> still<00:05:52.940> not<00:05:53.060> sure

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
Darth Vader one but yeah still not sure

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.510 
Darth Vader one but yeah still not sure
why<00:05:53.330> qui-gon<00:05:53.600> doesn't<00:05:53.720> move<00:05:54.080> so<00:05:54.350> it<00:05:55.310> could<00:05:55.460> be

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
why qui-gon doesn't move so it could be

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.100 
why qui-gon doesn't move so it could be
a<00:05:55.580> mechanic<00:05:56.000> thing<00:05:56.240> could<00:05:56.480> be<00:05:56.600> the<00:05:56.690> battery

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
a mechanic thing could be the battery

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.080 
a mechanic thing could be the battery
for<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:57.920> mechanical<00:05:58.520> part<00:05:58.730> because<00:05:58.940> it's<00:05:59.060> a

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
for the mechanical part because it's a

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.610 
for the mechanical part because it's a
battery<00:05:59.270> for<00:05:59.510> the<00:05:59.600> mechanics<00:06:00.050> is<00:06:00.200> a<00:06:00.230> battery

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
battery for the mechanics is a battery

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.740 
battery for the mechanics is a battery
for<00:06:00.650> the<00:06:00.890> actual<00:06:01.160> things<00:06:01.850> Apache<00:06:02.210> for<00:06:02.450> a<00:06:02.510> bit

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
for the actual things Apache for a bit

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.990
