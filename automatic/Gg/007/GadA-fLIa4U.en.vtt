00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
much deeper than that can you talk about

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.370 
much deeper than that can you talk about
the<00:05:05.180> depth<00:05:05.390> of<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:05.720> film<00:05:06.310> yes<00:05:07.900> to<00:05:08.900> me<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:09.200> film
