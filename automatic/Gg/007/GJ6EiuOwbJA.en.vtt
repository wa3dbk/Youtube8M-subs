00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello everyone remembering in the previous chapter we had talked about 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.540
 the first two games of the saga the commotion for that game due to the touch 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.490
 gore of blood and fatalities are now about to see the story of mortal 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.490
 kombat part 2 enjoy it 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.490
 tels 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.320
 ses 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.660
 mortal kombat 3 turned out to be a faster game between mexico than its predecessor 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.330
 but that instead of an advantage for many was such an inconvenience 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.760
 speed will not accommodate the game strategy thing from which 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.270
 mortal kombat two could boast 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.460
 certainly the inclusion of the button of running was not a great fondness to 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.580
 this game as expected these little animals did not enchant everything 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.500
 substituting some of the most beloved fighters like hokage scorpion for 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.500
 characters the likes of steven tyler did not like anything else 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.400
 it was also rumored that this version of the game was not the definitive one 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.420
 and within a few months they were confirmed 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.700
 in the first version of the game you will find 14 fighters other bosses 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.829
 endings and hid them 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.439
 about succulents 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:15.589
 we say that it is a playable hidden character while the other and power 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:18.769
 available only to face it but not control it 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.469
 unfortunately this time I can not put the story of this game 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:27.400
 because it has too many alternative endings and that would cost me to do 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.400
 more than two videos to clarify the story 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.290
 it was the year 1995 when it was rumored that mortal kombat 3 the iaj in its version 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.349
 with exclusive solange for sony playstation actually such exclusivity 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.409
 lasted a few months until the rest of the domestic versions appeared 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.189
 higuain intelligently created ultimate mortal kombat 3 that was deadly kombat 3 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.419
 with more characters and scenarios that sold their domestic exclusivity were 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:57.579
 for sacyr 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.379
 after a few months it appeared on the other super nintendo machines of genesis 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:07.099
 Ultimate mortal Kombat 3 was finally officially launched for Genesis and 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.779
 Super nintendo 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:12.839
 which contained 24 playable fighters these final bosses and one 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:16.979
 and again I'm going to touch the subject of the hidden characters 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:21.809
 if you suffer human moke is transformed due to a movement trick and 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:24.809
 gestures you have to do before 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.559
 if you are watching a fight of it 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:35.489
 in response to the exclusivity of ultimate mortal kombat 3 by part of 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.619
 sega sony and nintendo will present a list 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:42.389
 in a new version of mortal kombat 3 better than ultimate mortal kombat 3 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.969
 ccoo and thus was born mortal kombat the audi 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:50.199
 includes all the scenarios of the saga except some of mortal kombat one and 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:54.139
 and all the characters appeared but not each version of them of each 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:54.899
 game 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:59.239
 in the versions of pc playstation saturn ipc was included some 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.649
 more characters I have 64 because the capacity of the n64 cartridges was 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:08.009
 insufficient to house all the characters 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:11.899
 something that was curious in this game is that johnny cage is the only character 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:15.759
 of mortal kombat trilogy made exclusively for the game since the 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:19.970
 dismiss the previous actor inah patients could not use his sprinter 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:21.509
 from mortal kombat 2 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:25.499
 the role of Johnny Cage got him Chris Alexander for this game 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.490
 and at the end of the game announced in the wind credits four for 1997 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.879
 then in the next few years they took out deadly kombat 3 for peace 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.189
 laptops pulled deadly kombat advance in 2001 for game boy advance 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.419
 and then in 2008 they took out ultimate mortal kombat 3 for ds and in the game you can 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.419
 play combat kutcher in mechanization 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.759
 currently it can be emulated in pc with the genesis emulator or also 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.139
 download it from your xbox this was the story of mortal kombat part I hope 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.930
 that you liked it and wait for the next chapter before anything else 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.650
 I want to send a greeting to corporation 0 8 already with what then I will upload the tan 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.539
 Expected tribute to face states also saluted will bring chaos to the oquendo 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:18.229
 tuto that helped me reflect well this was all I am with taiwan and up 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:19.189
 the next video
