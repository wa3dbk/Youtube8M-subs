00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
rally investors around them at the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.860 
rally investors around them at the
moment<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.000> problem<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.359> them<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
moment the problem for them is that the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.349 
moment the problem for them is that the
Glazer<00:01:01.079> say<00:01:01.410> we're<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.129> selling<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.760> they've

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
Glazer say we're not selling so they've

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.030 
Glazer say we're not selling so they've
got<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.539> problem<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.350> know<00:01:04.470> as<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.920> any

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
got a problem but you know as with any

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.460 
got a problem but you know as with any
negotiation<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.000> think<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.630> anyone<00:01:07.110> would<00:01:07.260> sell

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
negotiation I think in anyone would sell

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.960 
negotiation I think in anyone would sell
at<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> right<00:01:07.979> price<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.549> i<00:01:08.580> think<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
at the right price so i think it's the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.940 
at the right price so i think it's the
start<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.750> very<00:01:09.780> long<00:01:10.110> process<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.890> which

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
start of a very long process in which

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.190 
start of a very long process in which
they'll<00:01:11.700> look<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.970> galvanize<00:01:12.570> support<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:13.049> say

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
they'll look to galvanize support to say

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.289 
they'll look to galvanize support to say
among<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> wider<00:01:13.740> fanbase<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.490> hope<00:01:15.060> that

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
among the wider fanbase and hope that

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.120 
among the wider fanbase and hope that
that<00:01:15.479> helps<00:01:15.750> persuade<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> glazers<00:01:16.950> that's

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
that helps persuade the glazers that's

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.770 
that helps persuade the glazers that's
just<00:01:17.310> really<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:17.549> worth<00:01:17.850> their<00:01:18.090> while<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
just really not worth their while and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.480 
just really not worth their while and
they're<00:01:18.869> better<00:01:19.049> off<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:20.009> know<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.250> getting

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
out on buying the club or perhaps

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.580 
out on buying the club or perhaps
selling<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:31.960> at<00:04:32.260> a<00:04:32.350> modest<00:04:32.650> profit<00:04:32.889> now<00:04:33.490> I

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
selling it at a modest profit now I

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.080 
selling it at a modest profit now I
think<00:04:35.590> it<00:04:35.710> could<00:04:35.889> obviously<00:04:36.280> go<00:04:36.669> either<00:04:36.910> way

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
think it could obviously go either way

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.060 
think it could obviously go either way
and<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:37.360> will<00:04:37.660> just<00:04:37.870> depend<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.620> to<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:38.800> large

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
and it will just depend to it to a large

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.480 
and it will just depend to it to a large
extent<00:04:39.460> on<00:04:39.669> on<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.330> fans<00:04:40.570> role<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:42.310> how

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
extent on on the fans role and and how

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.520 
extent on on the fans role and and how
long<00:04:42.729> they<00:04:42.970> can<00:04:43.000> keep<00:04:43.360> this<00:04:43.540> protest<00:04:44.410> that
