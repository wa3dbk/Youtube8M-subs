00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.380 

wow<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.620> think<00:03:25.920> I<00:03:26.070> just<00:03:26.130> struck<00:03:26.490> out

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.360 

okay<00:03:30.390> so<00:03:30.450> after<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.379> battle<00:03:31.709> is<00:03:31.799> over<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.250> get

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
okay so after the battle is over you get

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.339 
okay so after the battle is over you get
a<00:03:32.430> ton<00:03:32.610> of<00:03:32.640> X<00:03:32.939> so<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.510> guess<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:33.989> made<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.230> whole

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
a ton of X so I guess it made the whole

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.770 
a ton of X so I guess it made the whole
thing<00:03:34.379> worth<00:03:34.799> it<00:03:35.040> he<00:03:35.730> also<00:03:35.879> leaves<00:03:36.209> behind<00:03:36.360> the
