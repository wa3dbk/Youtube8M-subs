00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:08.350
 the fire and 2 lubricity commonly 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.350
 called earthworms are a 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.890
 family of olive annelids that cough of the 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:18.130
 order up what taxi gives at present there is 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:22.230
 described some 4,000 species and 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.430
 calculate that there are about 6000 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.099
 of aquatic origin maintains still 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.800
 characteristics of the environment 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.530
 cutaneous respiration dependence of the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.390
 moisture resistance systems 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.760
 Drying pods massive capsules 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.180
 quiescence have an important role 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.320
 in ecosystems where they are 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.320
 considered key species 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.990
 they constitute the 1 biomass zoo mass of 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:01.010
 soil that contribute to the formation of 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:04.699
 soil that actively participate in the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:08.950
 carbon and nitrogen cycles in 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.900
 the one that promote microbial activity 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.950
 improves the physical properties and 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:19.040
 soil chemicals that are important 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.000
 in trophic networks being the basis of 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:28.479
 feeding for birds and mammals 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.479
 fox badgers boars etc 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.720
 in the Iberian Peninsula I had a presence 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.380
 in genius was life commonly called 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.009
 California red worm and it has 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.869
 seated could be considered a 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.509
 invasive species lumbre ictus terrestris 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:54.690
 Canadian earthworm and they get to measure 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.340
 up to 30 centimeters long and although 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.200
 are originally from europe have been 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.159
 introduced in many areas of the world 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.549
 nothing common 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.550
 the best-known earthworms dig 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:15.400
 galleries on the ground and come out at night to 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.400
 explore your surroundings 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.510
 they are very beneficial animals while 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.879
 they are excavated to make their tunnels 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.760
 they ingest soil particles and digest 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.540
 any organic rest in times 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:36.430
 humid creeping leaves inside 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.430
 the earth to feed 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.940
 with it they remove air and enrich the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.790
 soil helping to keep 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.930
 fertile when ascending phosphorus and 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.950
 potassium from the subsoil and by expelling 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.560
 own nitrogenous waste the time 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.070
 more conducive to earthworms is 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.160
 When the weather is humid and warm a 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.640
 moment when they come to the surface 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.640
 to procreate 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.909
 the worms are hermaphrodites since 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.110
 have male reproductive organs 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:25.879
 and female but they need to mate 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:29.930
 but linked ochaeta is very voracious arriving 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:34.280
 to eat up to 90% of its own weight 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.879
 per day of this excreta intake between 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.260
 50 and 60 percent become a 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:44.840
 high quality natural nutrient 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.319
 known as vermicompost or humus 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.319
 worm 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.590
 Earthworm has no teeth their 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.530
 effectiveness resides in your device 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.150
 digestive for which it has a device 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:07.260
 vocal sucker pharynx crop gizzard 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.860
 and the rest is intestine in adult state 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.370
 gets to measure between 9 and 30 centimeters 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.370
 long 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:22.350
 their mating occurs generally 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:25.770
 when they peek to eat to the surface the 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:31.530
 Egg laying is done at the rate of one 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:36.479
 Coconut per animal every 45 to 60 days live 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:39.229
 4 to 5 years do not have lungs breathe 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.229
 through the skin
