 only touch and it does not vibrate then some 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.140
 wrong thing is happening 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.130

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.170
 guys 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:58.190
 one of the options here on my cell phone that 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:05.149
 strip makes it stop vibrating 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:08.930
 is the other economy I once had and he 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:13.310
 not vibrated, nothing is already activated with 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.340
 where some application such as 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:23.390
 antivirus also that when they 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:26.930
 want to save battery he does this 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:31.880
 kind of economy and makes your 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.760
 phone does not vibrate and vibrate to take much 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.189
 charge on the battery and then probably 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.010
 it should be this or some application you 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:44.180
 put the other economy 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.850
 if this is not a problem I have 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.750
 with 11 with vibration system of the 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.740
 cell phone 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.520
 just changing the assistance 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:00.970
 there will not be a way, because it's a 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.970
 piece that may have failed 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.590
 and then going to technical assistance in the 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.680
 this is a system of economic 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.840
 So you have whats going on? 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.080
 application you have placed and everything 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.560
 question is just to put a 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.850
 comment there on youtube and that's it 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.850
