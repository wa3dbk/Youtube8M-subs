as you sit there or stand or whatever
you<00:03:11.250> doing<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:13.200> suddenly<00:03:13.620> feel<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.930> scan<00:03:15.930> on

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
you doing you suddenly feel the scan on

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.129 
you doing you suddenly feel the scan on
your<00:03:16.380> fingertips<00:03:17.450> become<00:03:18.450> cold<00:03:18.930> and

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
your fingertips become cold and

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:24.410 
your fingertips become cold and
resilient<00:03:19.829> and<00:03:21.200> as<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.350> look<00:03:22.590> at<00:03:22.709> them<00:03:23.420> you

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
resilient and as you look at them you

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.830 
resilient and as you look at them you
just<00:03:24.630> see<00:03:24.870> them<00:03:25.049> as<00:03:25.290> if<00:03:26.130> they're<00:03:26.310> metal<00:03:26.810> like<00:03:27.810> a

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
just see them as if they're metal like a

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.470 
just see them as if they're metal like a
robot<00:03:28.349> or<00:03:28.920> cyborg<00:03:29.880> or<00:03:30.000> Android<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.139> slowly

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
robot or cyborg or Android and it slowly

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.449 
robot or cyborg or Android and it slowly
creeps<00:03:36.480> down<00:03:36.840> on<00:03:37.049> your<00:03:37.230> fingertips<00:03:37.799> onto<00:03:38.130> your

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
creeps down on your fingertips onto your

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.890 
creeps down on your fingertips onto your
hands<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.380> up<00:03:40.380> your<00:03:40.560> arms<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:42.480> as<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.440> does<00:03:43.620> so

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
hands and up your arms and as it does so

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.930 
hands and up your arms and as it does so
you<00:03:45.900> become<00:03:46.260> more<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.680> more<00:03:46.889> focused<00:03:47.370> on<00:03:47.609> the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
you become more and more focused on the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.490 
you become more and more focused on the
logical<00:03:48.450> reasoning<00:03:48.630> of<00:03:49.049> things<00:03:50.630> and<00:03:51.630> you

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
logical reasoning of things and you

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.699 
logical reasoning of things and you
become<00:03:52.769> more<00:03:52.980> more<00:03:53.190> prepared<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.150> do<00:03:54.709> things

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
become more more prepared to do things

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.409 
become more more prepared to do things
faster<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.579> suddenly<00:03:57.000> have<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.180> better

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
faster you suddenly have a better

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.080 
faster you suddenly have a better
understanding<00:03:58.139> of<00:03:58.519> math<00:03:59.519> without<00:04:00.060> a

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
understanding of math without a

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.199 
understanding of math without a
calculator<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:01.440> you<00:04:02.310> can<00:04:02.459> suddenly<00:04:02.700> recall

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
calculator and you can suddenly recall

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.289 
calculator and you can suddenly recall
all<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:04.169> theorems<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.950> theories<00:04:05.430> and

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
all the theorems and theories and

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.629 
all the theorems and theories and
everything<00:04:06.690> else<00:04:06.870> you<00:04:07.079> learned<00:04:07.459> because<00:04:08.459> your

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
everything else you learned because your

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.500 
everything else you learned because your
mind<00:04:08.880> just<00:04:09.090> wants<00:04:09.359> to<00:04:09.480> focus<00:04:09.660> on<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.319> logic

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
mind just wants to focus on the logic

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.969 
mind just wants to focus on the logic
and<00:04:12.510> by<00:04:12.660> now<00:04:13.310> you<00:04:14.310> realize<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:15.590> your<00:04:16.590> torso
