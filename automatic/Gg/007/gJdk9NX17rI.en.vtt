00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910 

I<00:00:02.990> thought<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.110> pace<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.440> practice<00:00:04.770> was

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
I thought the pace of practice was

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.570 
I thought the pace of practice was
really<00:00:05.190> good<00:00:05.779> a<00:00:06.779> lot<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.649> things<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.069> improve

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
really good a lot of things to improve

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.940 
really good a lot of things to improve
on<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:08.910> get<00:00:09.030> better<00:00:09.240> at<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.690> put<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:10.080> but<00:00:10.889> for

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
on and get better at and put in but for

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.499 
on and get better at and put in but for
the<00:00:11.190> first<00:00:11.340> day<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.580> was<00:00:11.880> really<00:00:12.509> happy<00:00:12.690> with

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
the first day I was really happy with

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.750 
the first day I was really happy with
this<00:00:15.509> with<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.809> pace<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.260> out<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.340> here<00:00:17.490> okay

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
this with the pace and out of here okay

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.890 
this with the pace and out of here okay
I<00:00:20.990> think<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.230> know<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.380> have<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> lot<00:00:22.980> of

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
I think you know you have a lot of

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.000 
I think you know you have a lot of
collisions<00:00:24.900> during<00:00:25.050> practice<00:00:25.560> sky<00:00:25.769> went

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
collisions during practice sky went

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.620 
collisions during practice sky went
after<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> loose<00:00:26.490> ball<00:00:26.730> today<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.240> kind<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> got

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
after a loose ball today and kind of got

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.099 
after a loose ball today and kind of got
crushed<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.109> was<00:00:28.199> right<00:00:28.349> back<00:00:28.560> up<00:00:28.800> but<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:30.109> what

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
crushed and was right back up but I what

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.760 
crushed and was right back up but I what
I<00:00:31.140> really<00:00:31.439> liked<00:00:31.650> about<00:00:31.850> those<00:00:32.850> kind<00:00:33.090> of

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
I really liked about those kind of

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.139 
I really liked about those kind of
altercations<00:00:34.770> or<00:00:34.920> collisions<00:00:35.340> with<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:36.000> guys

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
altercations or collisions with the guys

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.869 
altercations or collisions with the guys
are<00:00:36.360> right<00:00:36.480> back<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:36.870> playing<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:38.309> think

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
are right back up playing and I think

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.240 
are right back up playing and I think
that's<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.210> good<00:00:39.960> sign<00:00:40.200> for<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.530> personality

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
chase i think is is a really it's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.120 
chase i think is is a really it's
everybody<00:01:12.689> has<00:01:12.840> her<00:01:12.990> own<00:01:13.080> leadership<00:01:13.380> style

everybody has her own leadership style
but<00:01:14.369> what<00:01:14.520> i<00:01:14.549> really<00:01:14.610> like<00:01:14.970> about<00:01:15.030> chase<00:01:15.509> is

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
but what i really like about chase is

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.940 
but what i really like about chase is
that<00:01:16.700> he<00:01:17.700> fits<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.930> everyone<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.650> he's<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
that he fits in with everyone and he's a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.280 
that he fits in with everyone and he's a
guy<00:01:20.220> who<00:01:20.280> has<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> relationship<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:21.750> every

guy who has a relationship with every

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.730 
guy who has a relationship with every
player<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.860> team<00:01:22.890> no<00:01:23.340> matter<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:23.759> he<00:01:23.880> was

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
player on the team no matter if he was

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.560 
player on the team no matter if he was
you<00:01:25.740> know<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.890> redshirt<00:01:26.549> scout<00:01:26.850> team<00:01:27.030> guy<00:01:27.270> last

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
you know a redshirt scout team guy last

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.200 
you know a redshirt scout team guy last
year<00:01:27.750> or<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:29.100> know<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.549> captain<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
year or you know the captain and the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.300 
year or you know the captain and the
team<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.720> think<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.200> that's<00:01:31.380> where<00:01:31.710> chase<00:01:32.100> can

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
team I think that that's where chase can

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.160 
team I think that that's where chase can
really<00:01:32.520> bring<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:34.280> lot<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.840> positive<00:01:36.840> things<00:01:36.869> to

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
really bring a lot of positive things to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.109 
really bring a lot of positive things to
this<00:01:37.409> team<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:38.070> his<00:01:38.280> ability<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.850> relate<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
this team just his ability to relate to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.580 
this team just his ability to relate to
each<00:01:39.479> guy<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:41.630> I<00:01:42.630> think<00:01:42.899> we'll<00:01:43.020> practice<00:01:43.200> with

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
each guy but I think we'll practice with

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.440 
each guy but I think we'll practice with
a<00:01:43.619> lot<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.860> different<00:01:44.220> lineups<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:45.360> know

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
a lot of different lineups you know

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
a lot of different lineups you know
probably<00:01:45.750> within<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> next<00:01:46.649> week<00:01:47.310> or<00:01:47.460> two

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
probably within the next week or two

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.090 
probably within the next week or two
we'll<00:01:47.850> get<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.180> thing<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.710> know

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
we'll get this thing to you know

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.070 
we'll get this thing to you know
what<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.640> would<00:01:50.820> consider<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.360> 1012<00:01:51.869> guys

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
what I would consider to be 1012 guys

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.140 
what I would consider to be 1012 guys
that<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.680> chance<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.070> start<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.939> then

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
that have a chance to start and then

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.350 
that have a chance to start and then
we'll<00:01:54.390> go<00:01:55.140> from<00:01:55.170> there
