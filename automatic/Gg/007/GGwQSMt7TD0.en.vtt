00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.769
 hi to all ten of spacesgames I am 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.320
 Dr. White we are here today with a new one 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.360
 episode of the best pica strikers 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.160
 last team after seeing dinner 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.289
 traorÃ© is the attacker who plays in the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.869
 league rou 6 transferred recently to 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.470
 france is a player's turn 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.880
 premier league 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.650
 I didn't want to make heights that it was 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.029
 quite obvious I chose a 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.220
 player very similar to him for 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.040
 features andy carroll too 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.680
 very high one meter and 91 strong head 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.760
 strong physically you will remember though 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.110
 forget why it was 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.360
 purchased from liverpool for one amount 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.579
 really high did not respect the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.500
 waited now he went to play west 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.719
 end if i'm not mistaken let's see how 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.430
 behaves in the field starting as you do 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.960
 enter speed speed that has me 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.750
 has left a bit puzzled 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.430
 a very poor acceleration only 69 of 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.160
 accelerations therefore very low for a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.500
 striker but a good maximum speed 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.180
 so you struggle a little when you are 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.129
 it's about starting off guard 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.409
 if it reaches the maximum speed it is not 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.700
 not bad because because of strength 91 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.260
 physical therefore a great physical strength 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.600
 which allows you to win fights 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.710
 against the opposing fensors then from the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.840
 point of view of physical strength 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.979
 really nothing to say one of the best 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.630
 in the game 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.549
 talking about the athletic qualities of 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.409
 I didn't like this player 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.900
 agility the tour is really low 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.250
 so he is not an agile player we could 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.040
 wait for us because he is a great player 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.590
 high so it's not much of a trip 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.689
 pay here for drilling because dripping 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.579
 really poor only two star ski 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.170
 therefore it is not suitable for dribbling 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.880
 in the high to do her skills and also to the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.439
 really very low agility 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.200
 what surprised me about this 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.390
 player is the shot is left-handed three-star 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.439
 pil is weak so just pull on 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.630
 left if you can 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.210
 but surprised because because it is a big one 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.420
 Realizer scores really many goals is 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.100
 an excellent 90 finalizer and pass by 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.200
 finalization so it's not bad at all 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.360
 it has an amazing shooting power 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.670
 look at these shots even from outside the area 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.640
 who manage to go quietly in 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.500
 net a player who is almost always at 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.329
 right place at the right time because a 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.489
 good positioning in attack on 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.060
 wordpress probably looks like average 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.190
 average here 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.020
 be careful if you like 20 or not 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.970
 you may not like this player because 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.950
 It is very similar so from the point of view 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.660
 of the shot and of the positions in attack 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.760
 really really nothing to say 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.410
 the passage is a little scarce but it is not a 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.050
 player who must create game then 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.110
 we don't care much about the other passage 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.090
 quality is very high which we 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.709
 we could expect it is the coup of 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.900
 head shot that for a 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.230
 one meter high 91 player is one of the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.140
 most important qualities is certainly more 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.040
 poor senator because he is tall 10 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.019
 centimeters less 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.580
 however he manages to engage the defenses 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.080
 opponents this thanks also the strength 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.000
 physics manages to move the defenders 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.410
 so he manages to jump easily 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.299
 above that very high defenders 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.910
 try to jump over company a 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.769
 chiellini really very used people on 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.140
 line that make us suffer often with 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.790
 carroll did not have these problems 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.069
 so I managed to quietly 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.170
 score very often so it is suitable for 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.849
 who loves going to cross this 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.750
 player who khamis restyle of 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.940
 council 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.040
 the first is soccer player o 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.810
 increase speed and throw a 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.760
 I recommend this less you decrease more 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.530
 expensive should cost around 56 thousand 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.209
 credit the card so I recommend it 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.890
 maybe to read it player with 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.060
 this paper that had style applied 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.239
 and I was lucky enough to pay for it 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.299
 1,100 with the player already applied the 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.400
 second alternative is sniper pd sniper 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.560
 in this case to document the shot and 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.030
 water in those of different centers 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.560
 in the first I prefer to increase the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.299
 speed in the second favorite 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.920
 increase the driven two qualities that not 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.799
 I'm really at the top of this player 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.889
 where to use andy carroll io vi 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.870
 advice or a 4 3 3 of the premier 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.880
 league with which were the only tip that can 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.650
 go to score sick roses of the two 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.630
 very offensive exteriors like ben arfa e 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.220
 willy even more we have fellaini era 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.079
 in the garage that goes from disagreement a lot 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.090
 so a very offensive team but 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.819
 then gave solidity in defense by putting 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.799
 enrique biotech obscene in kabul that I am 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.010
 of players who are very much into 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.609
 alternative defense or the 3 5 2 always of 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.930
 premier league 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.940
 in this case they complete 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.530
 the attack with samuel eto'o 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.880
 we are readers and technique is not complete 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.280
 a perfection because eto'o is a lot 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.840
 fast but not much physically 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.190
 terror the contrary 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.930
 we have a coutinho that he can serve 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.269
 the tools 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.190
 attackers with ease is very good 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.600
 coutinho I advise you outside aims 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.910
 the schurrle venue which are tireless 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.460
 they run a lot and go to cross then 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.560
 a really complete team with few 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.120
 carroll conclusion weak points is 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.650
 surely a great striker has a 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.419
 great shot excellent physical strength e 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.949
 really exceptional fault head 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.800
 acceleration leaves somewhat 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.300
 wishing for warcraft can give parties 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.340
 to some since the average is not 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.900
 just great for a tip 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.460
 anyway I suggest you try it 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.320
 maybe to have an alternative fir 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.699
 that not to always use the usual ones 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.860
 players maybe try there does not have 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.660
 premier league and inexpensive to do 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.889
 catch the first team but also 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.180
 we concluded if the video was liked 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.979
 was a secular comment entered on 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.750
 channel we will see each other soon with others 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.370

 Hi everyone
