hello this is music tech help guy and
welcome<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.149> this<00:00:03.270> video<00:00:03.449> tutorial<00:00:03.720> on

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:04.279 
welcome to this video tutorial on

welcome to this video tutorial on
automating<00:00:05.279> synth<00:00:05.640> parameters<00:00:06.240> in<00:00:06.480> Logic<00:00:06.899> Pro

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
automating synth parameters in Logic Pro

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.320 
automating synth parameters in Logic Pro
9<00:00:07.140> what<00:00:07.980> this<00:00:08.130> allows<00:00:08.370> us<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.760> do<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.150> allows

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
9 what this allows us to do is it allows

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.089 
9 what this allows us to do is it allows
us<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.660> take<00:00:09.840> any<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.139> our<00:00:10.260> automatable<00:00:10.740> knobs

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
us to take any of our automatable knobs

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.890 
us to take any of our automatable knobs
or<00:00:11.460> faders<00:00:11.820> or<00:00:12.000> any<00:00:12.120> controls<00:00:12.570> within<00:00:12.809> a

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
or faders or any controls within a

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.749 
or faders or any controls within a
synthesizer<00:00:13.440> or<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.799> plug-in<00:00:14.280> for<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.490> matter

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
synthesizer or a plug-in for that matter

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.420 
synthesizer or a plug-in for that matter
like<00:00:15.330> an<00:00:15.420> FX<00:00:15.690> plug-in<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.289> automate<00:00:17.250> them

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
like an FX plug-in and automate them

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.189 
like an FX plug-in and automate them
across<00:00:17.730> our<00:00:17.910> timeline<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.840> can<00:00:18.990> create

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
across our timeline so it can create

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.679 
across our timeline so it can create
some<00:00:19.439> more<00:00:19.560> interesting<00:00:20.010> effects<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.480> for

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
some more interesting effects so for

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.849 
some more interesting effects so for
instance<00:00:22.020> maybe<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.320> wanted<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.619> create<00:00:22.830> a

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
instance maybe I wanted to create a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.189 
instance maybe I wanted to create a
filter<00:00:23.220> sweep<00:00:23.369> by<00:00:23.670> moving<00:00:23.970> my<00:00:24.199> cutoff

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
filter sweep by moving my cutoff

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.380 
filter sweep by moving my cutoff
frequency<00:00:25.769> knob<00:00:25.980> or<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> resonant<00:00:26.849> sweep<00:00:27.150> or<00:00:27.330> an

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
frequency knob or a resonant sweep or an

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.509 
frequency knob or a resonant sweep or an
FM<00:00:27.720> sweep<00:00:28.109> or<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.590> pitch<00:00:28.830> sweep<00:00:29.130> or<00:00:29.310> really

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
FM sweep or a pitch sweep or really

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.160 
FM sweep or a pitch sweep or really
anything<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.939> can<00:00:30.029> think<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.779> this

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
anything you can think of and this

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.110 
anything you can think of and this
doesn't<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:31.800> go<00:00:32.009> for<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.250> es<00:00:32.489> 2-cent<00:00:33.059> that

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
doesn't just go for the es 2-cent that

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.760 
doesn't just go for the es 2-cent that
I'm<00:00:33.300> using<00:00:33.480> here<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.809> goes<00:00:33.930> for<00:00:34.079> any<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.350> logic

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
I'm using here it goes for any of logic

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.520 
I'm using here it goes for any of logic
synths<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.450> also<00:00:36.450> any<00:00:36.600> third-party<00:00:36.870> plugins

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
synths and also any third-party plugins

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.740 
synths and also any third-party plugins
that<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.770> installed<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> logic<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.570> what<00:00:39.719> I

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that you installed the logic so what I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.160 
that you installed the logic so what I
have<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.260> just<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.250> logics<00:00:41.700> stock

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
have is I just have one of logics stock

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.360 
have is I just have one of logics stock
patches<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.320> I've<00:00:43.410> slightly<00:00:43.770> tweaked<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
patches that I've slightly tweaked and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.569 
patches that I've slightly tweaked and
I'm<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.440> record<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.620> first<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
I'm going to record in first just a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.020 
I'm going to record in first just a
stock<00:00:48.090> bassline<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.050> standard<00:00:49.379> bassline

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
stock bassline just a standard bassline

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.549 
stock bassline just a standard bassline
with<00:00:51.030> no<00:00:51.270> effect<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.199> then<00:00:52.320> I'm<00:00:52.410> going

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
with no effect on it and then I'm going

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.410 
with no effect on it and then I'm going
to<00:00:52.590> go<00:00:52.739> back<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.129> automate<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.000> effect

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
to go back and automate the the effect

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.720 
to go back and automate the the effect
on<00:00:54.600> top<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.500> pre<00:00:55.710> recorded<00:00:56.129> recording<00:00:56.579> now

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
on top of the pre recorded recording now

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.299 
on top of the pre recorded recording now
you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:58.100> simultaneously<00:00:59.100> if<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
you can do this simultaneously if you

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.860 
you can do this simultaneously if you
want<00:00:59.550> but<00:00:59.760> I'm<00:00:59.850> gonna<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.180> separately<00:01:00.629> for

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
want but I'm gonna do it separately for

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.910 
want but I'm gonna do it separately for
this<00:01:00.960> video<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.320> makes<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.649> little<00:01:01.800> bit

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
this video it makes it a little bit

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.889 
this video it makes it a little bit
easier<00:01:02.219> since<00:01:02.489> I'm<00:01:02.699> holding<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.359> microphone<00:01:03.750> in

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
easier since I'm holding a microphone in

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.050 
easier since I'm holding a microphone in
one<00:01:04.049> hand<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.559> don't<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.220> two<00:01:05.430> hands<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
one hand I don't have two hands to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.000 
one hand I don't have two hands to
automate<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> parameter<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.560> play<00:01:07.799> at<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
automate the parameter and play at the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.310 
automate the parameter and play at the
same<00:01:08.189> time<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.090> I'm<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.240> gonna<00:01:09.450> play<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.930> just

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
same time so I'm just gonna play in just

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:28.010 
same time so I'm just gonna play in just
a<00:01:10.470> simple<00:01:10.830> bassline<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:26.780> there<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.869> go<00:01:27.900> just

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
a simple bassline here there we go just

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.270 
a simple bassline here there we go just
a<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:28.710> simple<00:01:29.240> synth<00:01:30.240> bass<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.189> what<00:01:32.189> I'm

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
a very simple synth bass and what I'm

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.490 
a very simple synth bass and what I'm
gonna<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.729> I'm<00:01:32.909> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.270> open<00:01:33.689> up<00:01:34.140> my<00:01:34.259> es

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
gonna do is I'm going to open up my es

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.380 
gonna do is I'm going to open up my es
to<00:01:34.710> again<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.820> want<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.150> create<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
to again and I want to create a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.870 
to again and I want to create a
customized<00:01:37.320> filter<00:01:37.950> sweep<00:01:38.130> now<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
customized filter sweep now you can do a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.840 
customized filter sweep now you can do a
filter<00:01:39.180> sweep<00:01:39.420> with<00:01:39.990> an<00:01:40.110> LFO<00:01:40.530> or<00:01:40.799> with<00:01:41.369> one<00:01:41.759> of

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
filter sweep with an LFO or with one of

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.100 
filter sweep with an LFO or with one of
the<00:01:41.939> envelopes<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:42.540> I'm<00:01:42.720> gonna<00:01:42.869> do<00:01:43.079> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the envelopes but I'm gonna do a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.160 
the envelopes but I'm gonna do a
customized<00:01:43.829> shape<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:45.149> my<00:01:45.270> filter<00:01:45.540> sweep<00:01:45.810> via

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
customized shape to my filter sweep via

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.620 
customized shape to my filter sweep via
automation<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.189> what<00:01:47.640> we're<00:01:47.759> gonna<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:48.090> is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
automation and what we're gonna do is

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.819 
automation and what we're gonna do is
we're<00:01:48.869> going<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:50.060> set<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.450> cutoff<00:01:52.200> frequency

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
we're going to set this cutoff frequency

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.310 
we're going to set this cutoff frequency
to<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.090> our<00:01:54.210> controller<00:01:54.630> assignments<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
to one of our controller assignments and
