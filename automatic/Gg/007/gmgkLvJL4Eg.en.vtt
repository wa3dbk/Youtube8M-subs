00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
work in ways that I had not really

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.569 
work in ways that I had not really
experienced<00:02:03.930> as<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> screenwriter<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.950> had<00:02:05.430> this

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
experienced as a screenwriter I had this

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.419 
experienced as a screenwriter I had this
uncanny<00:02:06.110> experience<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.229> seeing<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
uncanny experience of seeing on the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.790 
uncanny experience of seeing on the
screen<00:02:08.819> what<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.300> wrote<00:02:09.599> which<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.560> not<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
screen what I wrote which is not the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.220 
screen what I wrote which is not the
same<00:02:11.009> thing<00:02:11.340> as<00:02:11.489> hearing

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
same thing as hearing

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.380 
same thing as hearing
words<00:02:12.409> on<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.830> screen<00:02:13.129> it<00:02:13.640> looked<00:02:14.000> like<00:02:14.209> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
words on the screen it looked like the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.140 
words on the screen it looked like the
movie<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.959> wrote<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:16.610> can<00:02:16.909> attribute

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
movie that I wrote and I can attribute

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.140 
movie that I wrote and I can attribute
that<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.569> our<00:02:18.530> affinity<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.580> think<00:02:19.879> is

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
that to our affinity that I think is

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.250 
that to our affinity that I think is
historical<00:02:20.900> now<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.970> think<00:02:23.239> it<00:02:23.629> also<00:02:23.959> came

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
historical now and I think it also came

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.559 
historical now and I think it also came
out<00:02:24.409> of<00:02:24.470> an<00:02:24.769> inherent<00:02:25.310> trust<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:25.879> you<00:02:26.000> had<00:02:26.209> in

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
out of an inherent trust that you had in

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.360 
out of an inherent trust that you had in
the<00:02:26.599> material<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.470> feel<00:02:27.860> like<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.099> were<00:02:28.190> just<00:02:28.220> a

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
the material I feel like you were just a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.009 
the material I feel like you were just a
very<00:02:28.549> generous<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.150> wonderful<00:02:29.239> collaborator

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
very generous and wonderful collaborator

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:30.970 
very generous and wonderful collaborator
through<00:02:30.319> it<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.440> don't<00:02:30.560> know<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.739> felt<00:02:30.830> like

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
through it I don't know it felt like

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.640 
through it I don't know it felt like
something<00:02:31.160> came<00:02:31.629> full-circle<00:02:32.629> away<00:02:33.230> when<00:02:33.620> I

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650
