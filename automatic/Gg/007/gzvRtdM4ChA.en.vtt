00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.800 

for<00:00:28.710> me<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.130> fundamentals<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.240> good<00:00:30.420> offset

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
for me the fundamentals of a good offset

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.470 
for me the fundamentals of a good offset
sequence<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.619> coddling<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.579> stager<00:00:33.000> well<00:00:33.210> is

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
sequence and coddling a stager well is

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.940 
sequence and coddling a stager well is
having<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.960> good<00:00:34.140> understanding<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.829> your

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
having a good understanding of your

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.889 
having a good understanding of your
transition<00:00:35.460> points<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.780> keep

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
transition points so that you can keep

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.479 
transition points so that you can keep
the<00:00:37.050> boat<00:00:37.230> moving<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.040> direction<00:00:38.160> that

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
the boat moving in the direction that

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.670 
the boat moving in the direction that
you<00:00:38.670> want<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.149> at<00:00:39.420> all<00:00:39.510> times<00:00:39.870> that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
you want to be going at all times that

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.900 
you want to be going at all times that
means<00:00:40.860> when<00:00:40.980> you're<00:00:41.070> looking<00:00:41.309> at<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> offset

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
means when you're looking at the offset

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.459 
means when you're looking at the offset
sequence<00:00:42.329> you're<00:00:42.540> not<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:42.899> paddling<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
sequence you're not just paddling the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.750 
sequence you're not just paddling the
gates<00:00:43.710> because<00:00:43.920> if<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.160> paddle<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> gates

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
gates because if you paddle the gates

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.069 
gates because if you paddle the gates
you<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.120> get<00:00:45.239> later<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.690> later<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.960> later

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
you just get later and later and later

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.049 
you just get later and later and later
through<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> sequence<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.820> need<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
through the sequence so what you need to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.160 
through the sequence so what you need to
do<00:00:48.180> when<00:00:48.360> you're<00:00:48.420> looking<00:00:48.629> at<00:00:48.719> your<00:00:48.870> offset

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
do when you're looking at your offset

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.350 
do when you're looking at your offset
sequence<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:50.129> try<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.460> find<00:00:50.789> those<00:00:50.969> points

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
sequence is try and find those points

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.330 
sequence is try and find those points
where<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:51.899> Powell<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.500> window<00:00:52.890> from<00:00:53.100> one

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
where you can Powell the window from one

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.090 
where you can Powell the window from one
gate<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.390> point<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.350> need<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.590> turn<00:00:55.770> for

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
gate to the point you need to turn for

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.010 
gate to the point you need to turn for
the<00:00:56.190> next<00:00:56.460> gate<00:00:56.640> which<00:00:57.120> means<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:57.690> always

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the next gate which means not always

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.330 
the next gate which means not always
coddling<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.500> gates<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.859> looking<00:00:59.160> at<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
coddling the gates is looking at the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.860 
coddling the gates is looking at the
current<00:00:59.520> seeing<00:01:00.000> where<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> cross<00:01:00.420> currents

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
current seeing where the cross currents

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.900 
current seeing where the cross currents
are<00:01:01.020> where<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.379> waves<00:01:01.590> are<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.699> if

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
are where the waves are so that if

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.880 
are where the waves are so that if
you're<00:01:03.030> going<00:01:03.180> from<00:01:03.539> day<00:01:03.750> one<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.229> two<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you're going from day one to two and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.250 
you're going from day one to two and
then<00:01:05.040> you've<00:01:05.129> got<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.250> go<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> three<00:01:06.330> maybe<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
then you've got to go to three maybe the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.469 
then you've got to go to three maybe the
best<00:01:07.409> way<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.650> go<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.369> set<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.790> day<00:01:08.939> one<00:01:09.210> so

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
best way to go is to set up day one so

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.990 
best way to go is to set up day one so
you're<00:01:09.600> turning<00:01:09.960> halfway<00:01:10.170> between<00:01:10.590> gate<00:01:11.130> one

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
you're turning halfway between gate one

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.940 
you're turning halfway between gate one
and<00:01:12.180> two<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> good<00:01:13.200> cross<00:01:13.590> good

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and two so you get a good cross good

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.429 
and two so you get a good cross good
powerful<00:01:14.580> driving<00:01:15.330> strokes<00:01:15.689> across<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.259> gate

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
powerful driving strokes across the gate

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.010 
powerful driving strokes across the gate
three<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.909> think<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.659> need<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
three and I think you need to have a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.210 
three and I think you need to have a
really<00:01:19.229> open<00:01:19.380> mind<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:19.920> you're<00:01:20.040> doing

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
really open mind when you're doing

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.770 
really open mind when you're doing
offsets<00:01:20.640> cuz<00:01:20.759> there's<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.060> many<00:01:21.180> ways<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> do

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
offsets cuz there's so many ways to do

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.270 
offsets cuz there's so many ways to do
it<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.140> do<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> sweep<00:01:22.710> stroke<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
it you can do it on a sweep stroke on a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
it you can do it on a sweep stroke on a
draw<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> stroke<00:01:23.909> forward<00:01:24.330> strokes<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.780> whole

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
draw a stroke forward strokes the whole

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.810 
draw a stroke forward strokes the whole
way<00:01:25.049> true<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.860> if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.430> your<00:01:26.549> line<00:01:26.790> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
way true but if you have if your line is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.210 
way true but if you have if your line is
set<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.360> perfectly<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:28.500> means<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> boat<00:01:29.070> is

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
set up perfectly that means the boat is

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.969 
set up perfectly that means the boat is
always<00:01:29.549> moving<00:01:29.900> with<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.930> stern<00:01:31.320> following

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
always moving with the stern following

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.570 
always moving with the stern following
the<00:01:32.130> bow<00:01:32.310> which<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> fast

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
the bow which is the fast

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.660 
the bow which is the fast
move<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.180> boat<00:01:34.360> I<00:01:34.630> therefore<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.950> is<00:01:36.250> it<00:01:36.490> the

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
move the boat I therefore the is it the

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.760 
move the boat I therefore the is it the
same<00:01:36.880> risky<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.630> know<00:01:37.990> not<00:01:38.710> but<00:01:39.700> all<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.330> time

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
same risky you know not but all the time

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.080 
same risky you know not but all the time
the<00:01:41.770> same<00:01:41.980> it<00:01:42.100> is<00:01:42.250> nature<00:01:42.460> you<00:01:42.820> know<00:01:42.850> yeah<00:01:43.180> and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the same it is nature you know yeah and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.290 
the same it is nature you know yeah and
it<00:01:46.090> with<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.630> short<00:01:46.900> both<00:01:47.260> many<00:01:48.010> guises<00:01:48.340> the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
it with the short both many guises the

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.530 
it with the short both many guises the
boat<00:01:49.510> not<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.890> same<00:01:51.130> snake<00:01:51.520> but<00:01:51.910> you<00:01:52.180> don't

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
boat not the same snake but you don't

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.960 
boat not the same snake but you don't
look<00:01:52.690> too<00:01:52.750> much<00:01:53.080> I<00:01:53.440> have<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.220> similarity<00:01:54.760> there

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
look too much I have a similarity there

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.220 
look too much I have a similarity there
with<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:56.220> downhill<00:01:57.220> skiing<00:01:57.610> so<00:01:58.480> the<00:01:58.870> fact<00:01:59.080> is

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
with the downhill skiing so the fact is

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.540 
with the downhill skiing so the fact is
even<00:01:59.470> there<00:01:59.800> that<00:01:59.830> you<00:02:00.100> have<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.340> have<00:02:00.430> to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
even there that you have to have to

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.790 
even there that you have to have to
speed<00:02:00.880> on<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.270> last<00:02:01.480> gate<00:02:01.810> so<00:02:02.410> you<00:02:02.470> have<00:02:02.650> to

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
speed on the last gate so you have to

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.800 
speed on the last gate so you have to
ensure<00:02:03.160> that<00:02:03.190> would<00:02:03.970> be<00:02:04.090> good<00:02:04.300> on<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:04.630> first

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
ensure that would be good on the first

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.260 
ensure that would be good on the first
and<00:02:05.230> on<00:02:06.070> a<00:02:06.100> second<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.640> third<00:02:06.670> gate<00:02:07.090> and

and on a second and a third gate and
fourth<00:02:07.600> gate<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:07.930> have<00:02:08.080> crap<00:02:08.290> to<00:02:08.350> speed<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.890> go

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
fourth gate you have crap to speed to go

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.400 
fourth gate you have crap to speed to go
away<00:02:09.340> because<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:10.210> problem<00:02:10.660> always<00:02:10.869> occurs

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
away because the problem always occurs

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.070 
away because the problem always occurs
on<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.740> last<00:02:12.270> downstream<00:02:13.270> gates<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.780> with

on the last downstream gates I with
diver<00:02:14.350> I'm<00:02:14.800> thinking<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:16.000> have<00:02:16.209> a<00:02:16.240> devoted

very<00:03:11.220> vertical<00:03:12.220> yeah<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:14.050> not<00:03:14.260> like<00:03:14.590> this<00:03:14.800> all

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
very vertical yeah and not like this all

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.780 
very vertical yeah and not like this all
this<00:03:15.580> I<00:03:15.910> try<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.720> do<00:03:16.959> this<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.380> think<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.160> you

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
this I try to do this I think you you

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.330 
this I try to do this I think you you
have<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.739> have<00:03:20.739> a<00:03:21.420> lot<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.450> space<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:23.709> really

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
have to have a lot of space to really

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.220 
have to have a lot of space to really
push<00:03:25.330> our<00:03:25.540> boat<00:03:25.690> forward<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:27.660> your<00:03:28.660> front

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
push our boat forward and your front

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.780 
push our boat forward and your front
your<00:03:29.739> front<00:03:30.010> should<00:03:30.280> be<00:03:30.489> always<00:03:30.910> down<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:32.790> I

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
your front should be always down and I

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.759 
your front should be always down and I
think<00:03:34.299> it's<00:03:34.510> good<00:03:34.810> if<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.080> go<00:03:35.260> in<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.530> middle

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
think it's good if you go in the middle

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.180 
think it's good if you go in the middle
of<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:35.890> gates<00:03:36.190> don't<00:03:37.180> cut<00:03:37.420> any<00:03:37.600> lines<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.620> if

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
of the gates don't cut any lines and if

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.350 
of the gates don't cut any lines and if
you<00:03:39.310> have<00:03:39.489> room<00:03:39.700> for<00:03:40.060> paddling

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
you have room for paddling

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.860 
you have room for paddling
not<00:03:41.990> the<00:03:42.140> Boing<00:03:42.350> I<00:03:43.070> think<00:03:43.430> this<00:03:43.640> is<00:03:43.820> quite<00:03:44.810> a

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
not the Boing I think this is quite a

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.920 
not the Boing I think this is quite a
good<00:03:45.110> sound<00:03:45.350> uh<00:03:46.280> in<00:03:47.120> offsets<00:03:47.540> are<00:03:47.690> really

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
good sound uh in offsets are really

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.240 
good sound uh in offsets are really
trying<00:03:48.110> to<00:03:48.580> focus<00:03:49.580> on<00:03:49.970> staying<00:03:50.980> early<00:03:51.980> and

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
trying to focus on staying early and

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
trying to focus on staying early and
never<00:03:53.030> feeling<00:03:53.420> rushed<00:03:53.720> like<00:03:54.080> I<00:03:54.620> was<00:03:54.860> gonna<00:03:55.270> if

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
never feeling rushed like I was gonna if

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.970 
never feeling rushed like I was gonna if
I'm<00:03:56.390> early<00:03:56.750> i<00:03:56.780> feel<00:03:57.050> like<00:03:57.200> i'm<00:03:57.350> in<00:03:57.380> control<00:03:57.650> in

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
I'm early i feel like i'm in control in

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.580 
I'm early i feel like i'm in control in
the<00:03:58.070> rivers<00:03:58.370> not<00:03:58.400> not<00:03:59.060> pushing<00:03:59.330> me<00:03:59.570> anywhere<00:04:00.530> i

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
the rivers not not pushing me anywhere i

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.790 
the rivers not not pushing me anywhere i
can<00:04:00.770> push<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.520> boat<00:04:01.670> where<00:04:01.880> i<00:04:01.910> need<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.620> to<00:04:03.620> be

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
can push the boat where i need to to be

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.760 
can push the boat where i need to to be
so<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:05.720> really<00:04:05.900> always<00:04:06.140> starts<00:04:06.530> with<00:04:06.590> the

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
so it really always starts with the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.760 
so it really always starts with the
first<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.459> first<00:04:07.610> offset<00:04:08.090> if<00:04:08.270> I<00:04:08.390> see<00:04:08.600> a<00:04:08.770> it

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
first the first offset if I see a it

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.380 
first the first offset if I see a it
offsets<00:04:10.190> in<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.430> in<00:04:10.670> a<00:04:10.760> full-length<00:04:11.030> course

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
offsets in a in a full-length course

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.449 
offsets in a in a full-length course
i'll<00:04:11.660> spend<00:04:12.410> most<00:04:12.560> of<00:04:12.709> my<00:04:12.770> time<00:04:12.860> looking<00:04:13.190> at

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
i'll spend most of my time looking at

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.550 
i'll spend most of my time looking at
the<00:04:13.550> first<00:04:13.790> one<00:04:14.140> important<00:04:15.140> thing<00:04:15.170> from

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
the first one important thing from

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.900 
the first one important thing from
upstate<00:04:16.209> is<00:04:20.440> that<00:04:21.440> means

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
upstate is that means

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.480 
upstate is that means
not<00:04:23.540> being<00:04:23.840> too<00:04:23.990> late<00:04:24.200> in<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.650> in<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.010> offset

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
not being too late in the in the offset

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.360 
not being too late in the in the offset
like<00:04:25.850> preparing<00:04:26.630> it<00:04:26.870> turning<00:04:27.650> to<00:04:27.830> start<00:04:28.100> again

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
like preparing it turning to start again

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.260 
like preparing it turning to start again
and<00:04:29.120> making<00:04:29.540> a<00:04:30.140> lot<00:04:30.710> of<00:04:30.740> sweet<00:04:31.220> through<00:04:32.210> the

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
and making a lot of sweet through the

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.650 
and making a lot of sweet through the
game<00:04:32.540> be<00:04:33.230> prepared<00:04:34.100> early<00:04:34.730> that's<00:04:35.120> one<00:04:35.390> of<00:04:35.510> my

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
game be prepared early that's one of my

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.960 
five golden rules um yeah it's just like
if<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.110> start<00:04:39.320> off<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.650> first<00:04:39.860> guide<00:04:40.160> you<00:04:40.640> you

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
if you start off the first guide you you

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.730 
if you start off the first guide you you
screwed<00:04:41.300> and<00:04:41.510> so<00:04:42.200> to<00:04:42.650> set<00:04:43.130> up<00:04:43.280> a<00:04:43.370> stagger

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
screwed and so to set up a stagger

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.800 
screwed and so to set up a stagger
officer<00:04:45.740> combination<00:04:46.310> I<00:04:46.460> felt<00:04:47.360> really

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
officer combination I felt really

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
officer combination I felt really
confident<00:04:48.410> in<00:04:48.620> just<00:04:49.040> preparing<00:04:49.670> everything

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
confident in just preparing everything

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.680 
confident in just preparing everything
the<00:04:51.830> earlier<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.250> better<00:04:52.340> just<00:04:53.120> make<00:04:53.420> some

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
the earlier the better just make some

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.630 
the earlier the better just make some
room<00:04:53.930> with<00:04:54.140> the<00:04:54.230> first<00:04:54.440> guide<00:04:54.710> and<00:04:54.980> then<00:04:55.100> you

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
room with the first guide and then you

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.570 
room with the first guide and then you
better<00:04:55.910> off<00:04:56.090> with<00:04:56.870> the<00:04:56.960> last<00:04:57.170> ones<00:04:57.470> it<00:04:58.250> becomes

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
better off with the last ones it becomes

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.340 
better off with the last ones it becomes
important<00:04:59.060> to<00:04:59.150> look<00:04:59.330> at<00:04:59.510> an<00:04:59.600> offset<00:04:59.960> sequence

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
important to look at an offset sequence

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.860 
important to look at an offset sequence
and<00:05:00.530> decide<00:05:00.830> where<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.670> biggest<00:05:01.970> turn<00:05:02.420> has

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
and decide where the biggest turn has

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.540 
and decide where the biggest turn has
the<00:05:03.080> most<00:05:03.290> value<00:05:03.740> to<00:05:03.830> you<00:05:04.130> which<00:05:04.310> means

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
the most value to you which means

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.540 
the most value to you which means
sometimes<00:05:05.210> in<00:05:05.570> a<00:05:05.660> stagger<00:05:06.200> sequence<00:05:06.560> maybe

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
sometimes in a stagger sequence maybe

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.450 
sometimes in a stagger sequence maybe
one<00:05:07.910> gate<00:05:08.380> requires<00:05:09.380> a<00:05:09.470> really<00:05:09.800> big<00:05:09.980> turn<00:05:10.250> and

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
one gate requires a really big turn and

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.980 
one gate requires a really big turn and
you<00:05:10.580> need<00:05:10.730> to<00:05:10.820> make<00:05:10.850> a<00:05:10.970> choice<00:05:11.240> based<00:05:11.720> on<00:05:11.900> the

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
you need to make a choice based on the

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.420 
you need to make a choice based on the
water<00:05:12.230> that<00:05:12.440> you<00:05:12.530> have<00:05:12.710> available<00:05:12.860> whether

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
water that you have available whether

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.830 
water that you have available whether
you're<00:05:13.550> going<00:05:13.640> to<00:05:13.730> do<00:05:13.850> a<00:05:13.880> big<00:05:14.120> pivot<00:05:14.330> turn<00:05:14.630> and

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
you're going to do a big pivot turn and

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.970 
you're going to do a big pivot turn and
stay<00:05:15.020> direct<00:05:15.410> or<00:05:15.940> spin<00:05:16.940> and<00:05:17.240> and<00:05:18.110> it's<00:05:18.710> really

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
stay direct or spin and and it's really

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.070 
stay direct or spin and and it's really
important<00:05:19.370> in<00:05:19.430> those<00:05:19.580> situations<00:05:20.390> as<00:05:20.750> often

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
important in those situations as often

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.200 
important in those situations as often
times<00:05:21.350> the<00:05:22.010> choice<00:05:22.280> can<00:05:22.550> be<00:05:22.580> in<00:05:22.820> a<00:05:22.910> set<00:05:23.120> of

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
times the choice can be in a set of

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.600 
times the choice can be in a set of
three<00:05:23.360> or<00:05:23.480> four<00:05:23.720> staggers<00:05:24.200> which<00:05:25.040> gate<00:05:25.340> do<00:05:25.520> I

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
three or four staggers which gate do I

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.190 
three or four staggers which gate do I
actually<00:05:25.790> do<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.240> big<00:05:26.390> turn<00:05:26.630> are<00:05:26.870> there<00:05:27.050> nuts

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
actually do the big turn are there nuts

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.570 
actually do the big turn are there nuts
that's<00:05:27.770> where<00:05:27.950> you<00:05:28.040> got<00:05:28.160> to<00:05:28.250> look<00:05:28.340> at<00:05:28.490> the

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
that's where you got to look at the

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.280 
that's where you got to look at the
water<00:05:28.760> and<00:05:29.060> really<00:05:29.270> make<00:05:29.420> a<00:05:29.450> decision<00:05:29.930> so<00:05:30.170> that

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
water and really make a decision so that

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.960 
water and really make a decision so that
you<00:05:30.380> can<00:05:30.530> do<00:05:30.680> the<00:05:30.800> maximum<00:05:31.340> turn<00:05:31.610> where<00:05:31.880> it

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
you can do the maximum turn where it

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.030 
you can do the maximum turn where it
costs<00:05:32.300> you<00:05:32.420> to<00:05:32.510> lease<00:05:32.660> them

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
costs you to lease them

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.550 
costs you to lease them
of<00:05:33.070> time<00:05:33.340> and<00:05:33.670> then<00:05:34.360> get<00:05:34.540> back<00:05:34.750> on<00:05:35.020> track<00:05:35.230> and

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
of time and then get back on track and

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.710 
of time and then get back on track and
do<00:05:35.680> that<00:05:35.830> fundamental<00:05:36.550> good<00:05:36.820> offset<00:05:37.270> stagger

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
do that fundamental good offset stagger

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.970 
do that fundamental good offset stagger
sequence<00:05:38.110> paddling<00:05:38.560> where<00:05:38.710> you're<00:05:38.830> driving
