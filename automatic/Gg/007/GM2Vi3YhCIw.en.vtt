00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
uncomfortable thing we will tolerate is

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.280 
uncomfortable thing we will tolerate is
a<00:03:14.500> time<00:03:14.910> when<00:03:15.910> women<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.750> don't<00:03:16.930> care<00:03:17.170> about

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
a time when women you don't care about

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.430 
a time when women you don't care about
discomfort<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:19.540> actually<00:03:19.810> go<00:03:20.140> beyond

discomfort you actually go beyond

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.839 
discomfort you actually go beyond
uncomfortable<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:21.280> into<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.549> realm<00:03:21.700> of

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
uncomfortable and into the realm of

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.110 
uncomfortable and into the realm of
sheer<00:03:22.150> pain<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:24.190> some<00:03:24.519> of<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:24.730> painful

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
sheer pain and some of this painful

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.180 
sheer pain and some of this painful
stuff<00:03:25.330> doesn't<00:03:25.810> even<00:03:25.989> turn<00:03:26.260> us<00:03:26.410> men<00:03:26.650> on<00:03:26.799> if

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
stuff doesn't even turn us men on if

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.940 
stuff doesn't even turn us men on if
that<00:03:27.489> is<00:03:27.670> your<00:03:27.819> objective<00:03:28.440> now<00:03:29.440> it's<00:03:29.620> hard<00:03:29.890> to

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
that is your objective now it's hard to

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.160 
that is your objective now it's hard to
tell<00:03:30.250> you<00:03:30.370> ladies<00:03:30.730> that<00:03:30.970> on<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.810> one-on-one

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
tell you ladies that on a one-on-one

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.229 
tell you ladies that on a one-on-one
basis<00:03:32.830> because<00:03:33.069> you<00:03:33.280> get<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.459> little<00:03:33.760> defensive

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
basis because you get a little defensive

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.400 
basis because you get a little defensive
so<00:03:37.239> hopefully<00:03:37.450> this<00:03:37.840> will<00:03:38.019> be<00:03:38.079> a<00:03:38.200> little

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
so hopefully this will be a little

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.240 
so hopefully this will be a little
easier<00:03:38.650> in<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.579> group<00:03:39.849> scenario<00:03:43.799> ladies<00:03:44.799> most
