microphones<00:00:07.950> here's<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.880> microphone<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.510> I

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
microphones here's a microphone that I

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.290 
microphones here's a microphone that I
had<00:00:10.019> but<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.710> audio<00:00:10.950> cause<00:00:11.490> he<00:00:11.700> reproduced

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
had but the audio cause he reproduced

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.020 
had but the audio cause he reproduced
was<00:00:12.780> very<00:00:13.049> poor<00:00:13.349> now<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> used<00:00:14.490> an<00:00:14.639> electorate

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
was very poor now I used an electorate

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.359 
was very poor now I used an electorate
insert<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.780> they<00:00:16.470> should<00:00:16.740> be<00:00:16.770> quite<00:00:17.100> good

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
insert and they should be quite good

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.450 
insert and they should be quite good
however<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.510> one<00:00:18.810> wasn't<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.500> opened<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.310> up

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
however this one wasn't I opened it up

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.250 
however this one wasn't I opened it up
destroying<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.390> plastic<00:00:21.810> grill<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
destroying the plastic grill in the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.939 
destroying the plastic grill in the
process<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.730> found<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.180> few<00:00:24.359> things<00:00:24.570> wrong

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
process and I found a few things wrong

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.250 
process and I found a few things wrong
first<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.130> all<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.670> microphone<00:00:27.359> element<00:00:27.869> was

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
first of all the microphone element was

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.769 
first of all the microphone element was
not<00:00:28.470> even<00:00:28.769> glued<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.160> position<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:30.359> wasn't

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
not even glued in position it wasn't

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.870 
not even glued in position it wasn't
facing<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> front<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:32.640> would<00:00:32.850> have

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
facing the front and that would have

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.510 
facing the front and that would have
muffled<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:33.480> sound<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.710> other<00:00:34.860> thing<00:00:35.160> was

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
muffled for sound the other thing was

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.160 
muffled for sound the other thing was
when<00:00:35.700> i<00:00:35.760> touch<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.239> neck<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.600> microphone

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
when i touch the neck of the microphone

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.860 
when i touch the neck of the microphone
and<00:00:37.350> along<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> cable<00:00:38.370> there<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.300> 50<00:00:39.660> hertz

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
and along the cable there is 50 hertz

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.130 
and along the cable there is 50 hertz
hum<00:00:40.230> i<00:00:40.670> opened<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.760> up<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.149> found<00:00:42.600> there<00:00:43.020> are

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
hum i opened that up and found there are

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.590 
hum i opened that up and found there are
just<00:00:43.320> two<00:00:43.559> boys<00:00:43.829> they<00:00:44.610> weren't<00:00:44.879> even<00:00:45.030> shield

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
just two boys they weren't even shield

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.290 
just two boys they weren't even shield
it<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:47.160> audio<00:00:47.520> level<00:00:47.700> wasn't<00:00:48.149> good

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
it and the audio level wasn't good

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.979 
it and the audio level wasn't good
enough<00:00:48.329> I'll<00:00:48.989> talk<00:00:49.410> about<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.710> later<00:00:50.070> on

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
enough I'll talk about that later on

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.150 
enough I'll talk about that later on
here's<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.020> why<00:00:52.350> from<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> original

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
here's the why from the original

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.000 
here's the why from the original
microphone<00:00:53.699> lead<00:00:53.940> just<00:00:54.809> two<00:00:55.079> leads<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.649> no

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
microphone lead just two leads and no

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.099 
microphone lead just two leads and no
shielding<00:00:56.520> no<00:00:57.149> wonder<00:00:57.510> there<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:57.960> much

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
shielding no wonder there is so much

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.250 
shielding no wonder there is so much
harm<00:00:59.329> replacing<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> twin<00:01:00.660> lead<00:01:00.870> with

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
harm replacing the twin lead with

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.110 
harm replacing the twin lead with
shielded<00:01:01.710> audio<00:01:01.980> cable<00:01:02.460> made<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> huge

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
shielded audio cable made a huge

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.359 
shielded audio cable made a huge
difference<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.809> meant<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.920> could<00:01:05.129> touch<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
difference and meant you could touch it

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.440 
difference and meant you could touch it
without<00:01:05.909> harm<00:01:08.030> having<00:01:09.030> broken<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
without harm having broken the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.300 
without harm having broken the
microphone<00:01:10.020> grill<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.470> needed<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.130> make<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
microphone grill I needed to make a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.600 
microphone grill I needed to make a
substitute<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.960> case<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.770> nib<00:01:14.010> part<00:01:14.369> of
