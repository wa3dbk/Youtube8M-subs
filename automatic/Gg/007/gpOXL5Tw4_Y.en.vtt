00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
sort of anyway let's go I think this is

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.920 
sort of anyway let's go I think this is
the<00:00:33.059> first<00:00:33.090> time<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.660> encountered<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.140> new<00:00:34.350> zeal

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
the first time we encountered a new zeal

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:46.280 
the first time we encountered a new zeal
as<00:00:36.930> an<00:00:37.230> enemy<00:00:37.410> anyway<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.309> unlocked

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:58.710 

no<00:00:47.290> better<00:00:47.500> d<00:00:47.650> battle<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.520> this<00:00:57.940> is<00:00:58.090> another<00:00:58.390> l

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
no better d battle and this is another l

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.650 
no better d battle and this is another l
dime<00:00:59.110> unit<00:00:59.560> and<00:01:00.190> then<00:01:00.550> use<00:01:01.270> one<00:01:01.480> of<00:01:01.510> these

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
dime unit and then use one of these

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.850 
dime unit and then use one of these
since<00:01:01.960> like<00:01:02.170> part<00:01:03.160> two<00:01:03.370> I<00:01:03.400> think<00:01:04.800> these<00:01:05.800> are

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
since like part two I think these are

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:16.730

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
here just good when you're fighting a

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.940 
here just good when you're fighting a
lot<00:04:14.480> of<00:04:14.660> enemies<00:04:14.990> i<00:04:15.140> got<00:04:15.320> the<00:04:15.410> beginning<00:04:15.740> with

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
stage but against him I guess not so

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.170 
stage but against him I guess not so
much<00:04:18.860> because<00:04:18.950> I'm<00:04:19.160> not<00:04:19.489> hurried<00:04:19.880> in<00:04:20.000> that

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.830 
than one video in a row for this game
just<00:05:50.969> because<00:05:52.879> sometimes<00:05:53.879> the<00:05:54.030> missions<00:05:54.449> are

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
just because sometimes the missions are

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.020 
just because sometimes the missions are
longer<00:05:55.169> than<00:05:55.379> I<00:05:55.590> anticipate<00:05:56.490> it<00:05:56.639> plus<00:05:56.789> I<00:05:56.939> have
