you shouldn't just play the opposite of

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.390 
you shouldn't just play the opposite of
what<00:01:38.020> your<00:01:38.170> right<00:01:38.320> foot<00:01:38.590> is<00:01:38.680> doing<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.160> and

what your right foot is doing and and

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.330 
what your right foot is doing and and
you<00:01:39.610> know<00:01:39.640> counter<00:01:40.330> that<00:01:40.479> because<00:01:41.170> then<00:01:41.470> what

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
you know counter that because then what

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.210 
you know counter that because then what
happens<00:01:42.760> is<00:01:42.910> you're<00:01:43.270> playing<00:01:43.510> it<00:01:43.720> up<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:45.040> set

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
happens is you're playing it up and set

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.030 
happens is you're playing it up and set
up<00:01:45.340> down<00:01:45.610> so<00:01:46.300> in<00:01:46.690> other<00:01:46.990> words<00:01:47.229> when<00:01:47.800> you<00:01:47.890> do<00:01:48.009> a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
up down so in other words when you do a

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.100 
up down so in other words when you do a
squelch<00:01:48.399> you're<00:01:48.820> pulling<00:01:49.300> your<00:01:49.420> foot<00:01:49.660> off<00:01:49.810> and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
squelch you're pulling your foot off and

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.609 
squelch you're pulling your foot off and
then<00:01:50.229> putting<00:01:50.470> it<00:01:50.590> back<00:01:50.649> down<00:01:51.030> instead<00:01:52.030> of

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
then putting it back down instead of

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.530 
then putting it back down instead of
preparing<00:01:53.619> to<00:01:53.860> put<00:01:54.190> it<00:01:54.280> down<00:01:54.520> on<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:55.300> beat

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
preparing to put it down on the beat

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.900 
preparing to put it down on the beat
after<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:56.290> play<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.680> bass<00:01:56.860> drum<00:01:57.070> so<00:01:57.610> I<00:01:57.640> like

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
after you play the bass drum so I like

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.200 
after you play the bass drum so I like
to<00:01:57.940> think<00:01:58.180> of<00:01:58.330> it<00:01:58.420> as<00:01:58.649> if<00:01:59.649> if<00:02:00.009> I<00:02:00.640> want<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:00.940> play<00:02:01.180> a

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
to think of it as if if I want to play a

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.020 
to think of it as if if I want to play a
bass<00:02:01.540> drum<00:02:01.570> beat<00:02:02.530> I<00:02:02.710> have<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.130> pull<00:02:03.399> my<00:02:03.729> foot

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
bass drum beat I have to pull my foot

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.620 
bass drum beat I have to pull my foot
away<00:02:04.210> from<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.780> header<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.530> head<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:07.420> play

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
away from the header the head to to play

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.560 
away from the header the head to to play
so<00:02:08.080> it's<00:02:08.259> up<00:02:08.440> down<00:02:08.500> up<00:02:09.160> down<00:02:09.220> up<00:02:09.790> down<00:02:09.880> up<00:02:10.479> down

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
so it's up down up down up down up down

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.340 
so it's up down up down up down up down
up<00:02:11.140> down<00:02:11.580> same<00:02:12.580> with<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> hi-hat<00:02:13.180> up<00:02:13.360> down<00:02:13.750> down

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:57.680 

or<00:02:45.520> sick<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.600> know

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.570 

then<00:02:58.690> you've<00:02:58.930> actually<00:02:59.170> got<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.650> play<00:02:59.920> on<00:03:00.130> the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
then you've actually got to play on the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.220 
then you've actually got to play on the
beach<00:03:00.700> on<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.030> beach<00:03:01.240> on<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.570> beach<00:03:01.810> on<00:03:02.170> the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
beach on the beach on the beach on the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.830 
beach on the beach on the beach on the
beach<00:03:02.410> on<00:03:02.710> the<00:03:02.800> beat<00:03:03.070> not<00:03:03.280> off<00:03:03.460> off<00:03:04.000> off<00:03:04.480> off

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
beach on the beat not off off off off

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.400 
beach on the beat not off off off off
off<00:03:05.320> off<00:03:05.620> so<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:07.600> becomes<00:03:08.080> more<00:03:09.930> relevant<00:03:10.930> if

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
off off so it becomes more relevant if

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.290 
off off so it becomes more relevant if
you<00:03:11.650> always<00:03:12.130> think<00:03:12.550> like<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:12.970> so<00:03:15.030> prone<00:03:16.030> to

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.480 
play quarter notes with while still
tapping<00:03:47.560> eight<00:03:47.890> so<00:03:48.190> it's<00:03:48.310> like<00:03:48.460> this<00:03:53.160> ok<00:03:54.160> so<00:03:54.220> my

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
tapping eight so it's like this ok so my

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.730 
tapping eight so it's like this ok so my
foots<00:03:55.060> bouncing<00:03:55.600> twice<00:03:55.840> as<00:03:56.140> many<00:03:56.260> times<00:03:56.590> as

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
foots bouncing twice as many times as

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.020 
foots bouncing twice as many times as
I'm<00:03:56.920> playing<00:03:59.310> so<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.340> transition<00:04:01.000> between

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
I'm playing so the transition between

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.610 
I'm playing so the transition between
the<00:04:01.330> quarters<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.930> eights<00:04:02.050> is<00:04:02.260> nothing

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
the quarters and the eights is nothing

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:14.120 
the quarters and the eights is nothing
all<00:04:02.830> I<00:04:02.980> have<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.250> do<00:04:03.370> is<00:04:03.490> lift<00:04:03.640> my<00:04:03.790> toe<00:04:03.850> up<00:04:12.840> as

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
all I have to do is lift my toe up as

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.280 
all I have to do is lift my toe up as
you<00:04:15.130> can<00:04:15.220> see<00:04:15.430> nothing<00:04:15.730> is<00:04:16.150> changing<00:04:16.780> my<00:04:17.020> foot

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
you can see nothing is changing my foot

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:25.000 
you can see nothing is changing my foot
it's<00:04:17.500> just<00:04:17.980> what<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.280> hear

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.590 

so<00:04:26.010> it's<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.250> very<00:04:26.280> subtle<00:04:26.760> movement<00:04:27.300> but<00:04:27.420> it's

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
so it's a very subtle movement but it's

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
so it's a very subtle movement but it's
still<00:04:27.900> on<00:04:28.550> a<00:04:29.550> positive<00:04:30.510> movement<00:04:30.870> down

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
still on a positive movement down

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.190 
still on a positive movement down
instead<00:04:32.340> of<00:04:32.370> thinking<00:04:33.120> of<00:04:33.390> it<00:04:33.480> negatively<00:04:33.870> up

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
instead of thinking of it negatively up

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.410 
instead of thinking of it negatively up
and<00:04:34.560> I'm<00:04:34.740> not<00:04:34.890> talking<00:04:35.100> about<00:04:35.340> you<00:04:36.060> know<00:04:36.180> bad

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
and I'm not talking about you know bad

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.920 
and I'm not talking about you know bad
or<00:04:36.600> good<00:04:36.780> just<00:04:37.140> the<00:04:38.070> inverse<00:04:38.550> of<00:04:38.850> what<00:04:39.300> a<00:04:39.510> lot

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
or good just the inverse of what a lot

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.420 
or good just the inverse of what a lot
of<00:04:39.960> people<00:04:40.080> think<00:04:40.530> when<00:04:40.950> they're<00:04:41.070> playing<00:04:41.220> the

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
of people think when they're playing the

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.220 
of people think when they're playing the
high<00:04:41.580> hat<00:04:41.760> so<00:04:42.920> and<00:04:43.920> another<00:04:44.820> thing<00:04:44.940> is<00:04:45.270> it's

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
high hat so and another thing is it's

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:53.140 
high hat so and another thing is it's
not<00:04:46.530> just<00:04:47.210> closed<00:04:48.210> or<00:04:48.920> just<00:04:49.920> open<00:04:51.140> there's<00:04:52.140> a

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
not just closed or just open there's a

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:13.470 
not just closed or just open there's a
dozen<00:04:54.150> different<00:04:54.180> ways<00:04:54.570> you<00:04:55.050> know

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.960 

and<00:05:14.380> if<00:05:14.980> you<00:05:15.070> look<00:05:15.250> at<00:05:15.400> my<00:05:15.520> foot<00:05:15.730> what<00:05:15.880> I'm

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
and if you look at my foot what I'm

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.510 
and if you look at my foot what I'm
doing<00:05:16.180> that<00:05:19.560> we're<00:05:20.560> talking<00:05:20.710> millimeters<00:05:21.490> of

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
doing that we're talking millimeters of

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.260 
doing that we're talking millimeters of
movement<00:05:22.090> so<00:05:23.080> you<00:05:23.140> really<00:05:23.380> have<00:05:23.500> to<00:05:23.650> have<00:05:23.830> a

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.120 

you<00:05:28.270> really<00:05:28.540> have<00:05:28.660> to<00:05:28.750> have<00:05:28.780> a<00:05:28.900> fine<00:05:29.290> idea<00:05:29.650> of

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
you really have to have a fine idea of

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.310 
you really have to have a fine idea of
where<00:05:30.550> your<00:05:30.760> hi-hats<00:05:31.150> being<00:05:31.480> you<00:05:32.050> know<00:05:32.140> the

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
where your hi-hats being you know the

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:45.260 
where your hi-hats being you know the
difference<00:05:32.650> between<00:05:32.710> a<00:05:33.250> nice<00:05:33.490> steady<00:05:41.370> and

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:06:01.650 

almost<00:05:46.270> sloshy<00:05:59.640> as<00:06:00.640> you<00:06:00.970> can<00:06:01.060> see<00:06:01.270> my<00:06:01.450> left

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
almost sloshy as you can see my left

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.630 
almost sloshy as you can see my left
foot<00:06:01.870> is<00:06:02.020> hardly<00:06:02.320> moving<00:06:02.560> but<00:06:03.250> just<00:06:03.490> that

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
foot is hardly moving but just that

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.390 
foot is hardly moving but just that
pressure<00:06:04.060> that<00:06:04.870> is<00:06:05.080> it's<00:06:05.980> screwing

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
pressure that is it's screwing

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.430 
pressure that is it's screwing
everything<00:06:06.760> up<00:06:07.000> so<00:06:07.240> it<00:06:07.360> sounds<00:06:07.690> inconsistent

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
everything up so it sounds inconsistent

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.340 
everything up so it sounds inconsistent
and<00:06:08.560> if<00:06:09.190> again<00:06:10.000> similarly<00:06:10.630> if<00:06:10.930> you<00:06:11.080> want<00:06:11.290> a

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
and if again similarly if you want a

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.260 
and if again similarly if you want a
sloshy<00:06:11.680> hi-hat<00:06:12.190> feel<00:06:12.460> if<00:06:12.670> you<00:06:12.790> really<00:06:13.060> do

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
sloshy hi-hat feel if you really do

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.870 
sloshy hi-hat feel if you really do
you've<00:06:13.840> got<00:06:14.140> to<00:06:14.290> keep<00:06:14.440> that<00:06:14.500> foot<00:06:14.980> exactly<00:06:15.760> in

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
you've got to keep that foot exactly in

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:24.530 
you've got to keep that foot exactly in
the<00:06:15.970> same<00:06:16.120> place

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:39.090 

if<00:06:25.540> you<00:06:25.660> really<00:06:25.930> want<00:06:26.260> sloshy<00:06:35.340> and<00:06:37.980> you<00:06:38.980> know

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.100 
if you really want sloshy and you know

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.010 
if you really want sloshy and you know
there's<00:06:39.610> always<00:06:40.060> of<00:06:40.300> course<00:06:40.330> there's<00:06:40.750> all<00:06:40.870> the

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
there's always of course there's all the

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.150 
there's always of course there's all the
different<00:06:41.290> techniques<00:06:41.650> for<00:06:41.830> hitting<00:06:42.130> the

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
different techniques for hitting the

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.220 
different techniques for hitting the
high<00:06:42.370> hat<00:06:42.550> but<00:06:42.850> I'm<00:06:43.300> talking<00:06:43.780> about<00:06:43.840> foot

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230 
high hat but I'm talking about foot

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.960 
high hat but I'm talking about foot
technique<00:06:44.590> so<00:06:44.890> you<00:06:45.880> know<00:06:45.970> be<00:06:46.810> aware<00:06:47.970> that

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
technique so you know be aware that

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:54.500 
technique so you know be aware that
there's<00:06:49.180> a<00:06:49.240> difference<00:06:49.630> between<00:06:49.720> this<00:06:50.230> and

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.510 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:05.340 

this<00:06:55.510> and<00:07:03.060> it's<00:07:04.060> all<00:07:04.270> because<00:07:04.300> of<00:07:04.750> foot<00:07:05.200> and

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:05.350 
this and it's all because of foot and

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.410 
this and it's all because of foot and
where<00:07:05.980> you're<00:07:06.190> hitting<00:07:06.310> the<00:07:06.550> high<00:07:06.670> hat<00:07:06.850> so

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:07.420 
where you're hitting the high hat so

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.240 
where you're hitting the high hat so
it's<00:07:07.630> a<00:07:07.720> very<00:07:07.750> it's<00:07:08.620> an<00:07:08.890> instant

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.250 
it's a very it's an instant

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.740 
it's a very it's an instant
oft-forgotten<00:07:10.000> an<00:07:10.390> ignored<00:07:12.150> thing<00:07:13.150> but<00:07:13.540> if

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
oft-forgotten an ignored thing but if

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.500 
oft-forgotten an ignored thing but if
you<00:07:13.960> learn<00:07:14.200> to<00:07:15.130> play<00:07:15.520> the<00:07:15.550> high<00:07:15.850> hat<00:07:16.090> instead

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:16.510 
you learn to play the high hat instead
