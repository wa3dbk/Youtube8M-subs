00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
challenge to keep the right music that's

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.830 
challenge to keep the right music that's
fresh<00:02:05.530> but<00:02:06.100> yet<00:02:06.310> keep<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.850> with

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
fresh but yet keep it with

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.290 
fresh but yet keep it with
and<00:02:07.929> the<00:02:08.319> idea<00:02:08.619> of<00:02:08.830> fans<00:02:09.160> expectations<00:02:09.550> of

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
and the idea of fans expectations of

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.570 
and the idea of fans expectations of
what<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.230> Star<00:02:11.440> Wars<00:02:11.560> universe<00:02:11.650> sounds<00:02:12.430> like

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
what the Star Wars universe sounds like

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.270 
what the Star Wars universe sounds like
my<00:02:13.330> approach<00:02:13.599> was<00:02:13.629> really<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.230> just<00:02:14.530> immerse

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
my approach was really to just immerse

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.100 
my approach was really to just immerse
myself<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:15.910> listening<00:02:16.269> to<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.480> music<00:02:16.510> for

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
myself and listening to that music for

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.250 
myself and listening to that music for
as<00:02:17.860> much<00:02:18.069> time<00:02:18.310> as<00:02:18.489> I<00:02:18.580> could<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.120> make<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.200> a

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
as much time as I could and make it a

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.880 
as much time as I could and make it a
part<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.560> my<00:02:20.739> being<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.730> just<00:02:22.360> hopefully

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
part of my being and just hopefully

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.280 
part of my being and just hopefully
rather<00:02:23.890> than<00:02:24.129> try<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.489> rewrite<00:02:25.030> John<00:02:25.930> Williams

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
rather than try to rewrite John Williams

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.339 
rather than try to rewrite John Williams
music<00:02:26.680> just<00:02:27.670> write<00:02:28.330> what<00:02:28.569> comes<00:02:28.870> naturally

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
music just write what comes naturally

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.140 
music just write what comes naturally
because<00:02:29.680> I've<00:02:29.830> been<00:02:29.860> exposed<00:02:30.549> to<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.819> so<00:02:30.970> much

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
because I've been exposed to it so much

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.990 
because I've been exposed to it so much
the<00:02:31.690> object<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.140> not<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.379> photocopy<00:02:33.250> anything

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
the object is not to photocopy anything

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.009 
the object is not to photocopy anything
that<00:02:34.090> John<00:02:34.239> Williams<00:02:34.569> did<00:02:34.860> it's<00:02:35.860> more<00:02:37.019> it's

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
that John Williams did it's more it's

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.940 
that John Williams did it's more it's
more<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.560> starting<00:02:38.950> off<00:02:39.040> point<00:02:39.099> and<00:02:39.690> also

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
more of a starting off point and also

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.339 
more of a starting off point and also
the<00:02:41.950> game<00:02:42.220> dictates<00:02:42.760> in<00:02:43.569> any<00:02:43.780> whether<00:02:44.170> it's

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
the game dictates in any whether it's

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.630 
the game dictates in any whether it's
whether<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.829> Star<00:02:45.010> Wars<00:02:45.099> been<00:02:45.310> burning

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
whether it's the Star Wars been burning

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.640 
whether it's the Star Wars been burning
again<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:46.120> game<00:02:46.269> dictates<00:02:46.690> what<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.440> write

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
again the game dictates what you write

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.789 
again the game dictates what you write
for<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:48.040> musically<00:02:48.549> so<00:02:48.910> in<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:50.110> game<00:02:50.410> it's

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
for it musically so in this game it's

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.009 
for it musically so in this game it's
set<00:02:51.130> way<00:02:51.400> before<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:52.000> Star<00:02:52.209> Wars<00:02:52.329> films<00:02:52.450> as

set way before the Star Wars films as
far<00:02:53.170> as<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.349> timeline<00:02:53.799> on<00:02:54.129> the<00:02:54.340> story<00:02:54.670> so<00:02:56.010> that

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
far as the timeline on the story so that

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.839 
far as the timeline on the story so that
gives<00:02:57.129> you<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.280> little<00:02:57.489> bit<00:02:57.579> of<00:02:57.670> freedom

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
gives you a little bit of freedom

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.210 
gives you a little bit of freedom
inherently<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:59.470> key<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.860> honor<00:03:00.010> the

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.170 
that we tried to schedule out each
planet<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.799> be<00:03:56.919> generally<00:03:57.639> composed<00:03:57.940> by<00:03:58.180> one

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
planet to be generally composed by one

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.089 
planet to be generally composed by one
to<00:03:59.510> be<00:03:59.599> handled<00:03:59.900> entirely<00:04:00.230> by<00:04:00.530> one<00:04:00.709> composer

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
to be handled entirely by one composer

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.009 
to be handled entirely by one composer
so<00:04:01.730> that<00:04:01.879> they<00:04:02.000> can<00:04:02.180> develop<00:04:02.420> their<00:04:02.750> themes

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
so that they can develop their themes

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.899 
so that they can develop their themes
over<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.469> course<00:04:03.680> of<00:04:03.829> the<00:04:04.099> planet<00:04:04.609> they<00:04:04.760> can

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
over the course of the planet they can

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.709 
over the course of the planet they can
have<00:04:05.060> one<00:04:05.390> team<00:04:06.730> one<00:04:07.730> melodic<00:04:08.180> idea<00:04:08.510> that

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:08.719 
have one team one melodic idea that

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.530 
have one team one melodic idea that
recurs<00:04:09.109> in<00:04:09.140> several<00:04:09.680> different<00:04:09.799> cues<00:04:10.540> it's

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
recurs in several different cues it's

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.229 
recurs in several different cues it's
just<00:04:11.719> so<00:04:11.840> that<00:04:12.109> each<00:04:12.290> planet<00:04:12.739> has<00:04:12.769> its<00:04:13.129> own<00:04:13.250> its

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
just so that each planet has its own its

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.240 
just so that each planet has its own its
own<00:04:14.329> identity<00:04:14.900> you<00:04:15.530> know<00:04:15.650> you<00:04:15.709> do<00:04:15.920> want<00:04:16.160> to

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
own identity you know you do want to

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.379 
own identity you know you do want to

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
establish themes you do want to

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:18.580 
establish themes you do want to
reference<00:04:17.600> those<00:04:17.900> seams<00:04:18.109> and<00:04:18.259> you<00:04:18.350> want<00:04:18.500> to

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
reference those seams and you want to

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.170 
reference those seams and you want to
develop<00:04:18.829> them<00:04:19.160> throughout<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.850> larger

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
develop them throughout the larger

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.210 
develop them throughout the larger
experience<00:04:21.639> so<00:04:22.639> you<00:04:23.150> know<00:04:23.650> film<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:24.860> a<00:04:24.889> little

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
experience so you know film is a little

there's<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.699> lot<00:04:31.880> more<00:04:31.910> interactivity<00:04:33.190> it's

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
there's a lot more interactivity it's

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.680 
there's a lot more interactivity it's
more<00:04:34.400> of<00:04:34.460> an<00:04:34.550> open<00:04:34.669> experience<00:04:35.330> but<00:04:35.449> I<00:04:35.479> think

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
more of an open experience but I think

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.990 
more of an open experience but I think
from<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:35.930> compositional<00:04:36.770> standpoint<00:04:37.370> you

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
from a compositional standpoint you

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.879 
from a compositional standpoint you
still<00:04:38.270> need<00:04:38.389> to<00:04:38.449> develop<00:04:38.900> very<00:04:39.289> strong<00:04:39.560> themes

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
still need to develop very strong themes

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.480 
still need to develop very strong themes
and<00:04:40.280> then<00:04:40.400> want<00:04:41.560> be<00:04:42.560> able<00:04:42.740> to<00:04:42.830> develop<00:04:43.280> them

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
and then want be able to develop them

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.749 
and then want be able to develop them
make<00:04:44.419> them<00:04:44.599> interesting<00:04:44.810> expand<00:04:45.680> them<00:04:45.949> in<00:04:46.250> no

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 
make them interesting expand them in no

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.060 
make them interesting expand them in no
wind<00:04:47.060> to<00:04:47.270> reference<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:48.169> various<00:04:48.470> themes<00:04:48.740> so

wind to reference the various themes so

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.980 
wind to reference the various themes so

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
that it ties together it makes sense and

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.080 
that it ties together it makes sense and

that the story will never be done and

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.320 
that the story will never be done and
what<00:04:59.539> I<00:04:59.570> mean<00:04:59.750> by<00:04:59.810> that<00:04:59.930> is<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:01.270> each<00:05:02.270> person

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
what I mean by that is that each person

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
great things visually about the screen

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.890 
great things visually about the screen
is<00:06:18.160> that<00:06:18.340> every<00:06:18.670> planet<00:06:19.240> every<00:06:19.450> area<00:06:19.720> has<00:06:19.870> a

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790 
different color scheme and you can hear

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.550 
different color scheme and you can hear
that<00:06:21.820> in<00:06:21.970> the<00:06:22.120> music<00:06:22.450> you<00:06:22.540> can<00:06:22.690> just<00:06:22.870> hear<00:06:23.140> this

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
that in the music you can just hear this

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.560 
that in the music you can just hear this
is<00:06:23.770> this<00:06:24.070> emotion<00:06:24.730> that<00:06:24.850> I<00:06:24.910> really<00:06:25.330> want<00:06:25.510> this

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
is this emotion that I really want this

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.200 
is this emotion that I really want this
planet<00:06:25.930> to<00:06:26.200> go<00:06:26.320> by<00:06:26.550> so<00:06:27.550> i<00:06:27.580> guess<00:06:27.790> the<00:06:27.910> answer<00:06:28.060> is

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
planet to go by so i guess the answer is

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.410 
planet to go by so i guess the answer is
I<00:06:28.570> really<00:06:29.200> didn't<00:06:29.650> think<00:06:29.890> too<00:06:30.640> much<00:06:30.670> about<00:06:31.120> the

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
I really didn't think too much about the

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.300 
I really didn't think too much about the
Star<00:06:31.690> Wars<00:06:31.840> thing<00:06:32.110> but<00:06:32.350> more<00:06:32.590> about<00:06:32.860> the

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
Star Wars thing but more about the

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.820 
Star Wars thing but more about the
players<00:06:33.580> experience<00:06:34.060> and<00:06:34.600> within<00:06:35.530> the

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
players experience and within the

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.130 
players experience and within the
general<00:06:36.340> idioms<00:06:36.910> of<00:06:37.180> orchestral<00:06:37.630> John
