00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
yeah the r plus window is great because

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.230 
yeah the r plus window is great because
what<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.929> r<00:00:04.080> plus<00:00:04.290> does<00:00:04.529> is<00:00:04.799> it<00:00:05.490> doesn't<00:00:06.089> have

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
what the r plus does is it doesn't have

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.730 
what the r plus does is it doesn't have
I<00:00:06.359> don't<00:00:06.509> have<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.690> pull<00:00:06.870> out<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.290> existing

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
I don't have to pull out the existing

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.100 
I don't have to pull out the existing
window<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.519> r<00:00:08.639> plus<00:00:08.940> i<00:00:09.179> can<00:00:09.389> put<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.690> right<00:00:09.840> on

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
window the r plus i can put it right on

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.450 
window the r plus i can put it right on
top<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.800> window<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.340> basically

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
top of the window and it basically

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.209 
top of the window and it basically
creates<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.480> second<00:00:12.900> window<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.590> way<00:00:13.740> i'm

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
creates a second window so in a way i'm

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.400 
creates a second window so in a way i'm
taking<00:00:14.280> my<00:00:14.820> single<00:00:15.210> pane<00:00:15.389> windows<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.020> with

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
taking my single pane windows and with

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.170 
taking my single pane windows and with
the<00:00:16.500> r<00:00:16.619> plus<00:00:16.920> i'm<00:00:17.100> putting<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.490> two<00:00:18.029> other

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the r plus i'm putting in two other

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.910 
the r plus i'm putting in two other
windows<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.750> i'm<00:00:18.840> now<00:00:18.960> made<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.199> almost<00:00:19.380> like<00:00:19.859> a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
windows so i'm now made it almost like a

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.980

we've done in the feedback is people
can't<00:01:13.580> believe<00:01:13.939> the<00:01:14.119> results<00:01:14.470> about<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:15.530> year

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
can't believe the results about a year

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.389 
can't believe the results about a year
ago<00:01:16.299> we<00:01:17.299> we<00:01:17.899> put<00:01:18.140> attic<00:01:18.439> insulation<00:01:18.649> in<00:01:19.280> to

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
ago we we put attic insulation in to

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.730 
ago we we put attic insulation in to
bring<00:01:19.610> it<00:01:19.759> up<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.210> maximum<00:01:20.630> that<00:01:20.960> that's

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
bring it up to the maximum that that's

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.670 
bring it up to the maximum that that's
practical<00:01:22.430> to<00:01:22.580> do<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:23.960> I<00:01:24.049> didn't<00:01:24.320> notice<00:01:24.560> a

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
practical to do and I didn't notice a

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.740 
practical to do and I didn't notice a
real<00:01:24.890> huge<00:01:25.310> difference<00:01:25.789> in<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.180> heating<00:01:26.509> bill

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
real huge difference in the heating bill

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.499 
real huge difference in the heating bill
after<00:01:27.110> we<00:01:27.500> did<00:01:27.710> that<00:01:28.000> until<00:01:29.000> we<00:01:29.060> put<00:01:29.330> these

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
after we did that until we put these

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.649 
after we did that until we put these
windows<00:01:29.899> in<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.740> first<00:01:30.979> of<00:01:31.159> every<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.970> at

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
windows in the first of every and at

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.749 
windows in the first of every and at
that<00:01:32.810> point<00:01:33.110> I<00:01:33.320> could<00:01:33.500> see<00:01:33.740> Oh<00:01:34.009> a<00:01:34.100> twenty<00:01:34.640> or

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
that point I could see Oh a twenty or

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.570 
that point I could see Oh a twenty or
thirty<00:01:35.000> percent<00:01:35.450> drop<00:01:35.720> in<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.259> heating<00:01:36.619> this

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
thirty percent drop in the heating this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.820 
thirty percent drop in the heating this
window<00:01:38.000> had<00:01:38.390> a<00:01:38.420> lot<00:01:38.659> of<00:01:38.689> cold<00:01:39.020> coming<00:01:39.319> into<00:01:39.679> it

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
window had a lot of cold coming into it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.430 
window had a lot of cold coming into it
so<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:40.819> was<00:01:40.970> really<00:01:41.240> cold<00:01:41.569> all<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:41.929> time<00:01:42.080> on

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
so it was really cold all the time on

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.200 
so it was really cold all the time on
this<00:01:42.560> side<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.920> bed<00:01:43.069> is<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.550> side<00:01:43.940> that<00:01:43.970> I

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
this side of the bed is the side that I

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.010 
this side of the bed is the side that I
sleep<00:01:44.479> one<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:46.640> when<00:01:46.909> we<00:01:47.030> put<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.360> insert<00:01:47.750> in

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
sleep one and when we put the insert in

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.800 
sleep one and when we put the insert in
it<00:01:48.350> really<00:01:48.979> warmed<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.729> place<00:01:49.940> up<00:01:50.179> in<00:01:50.330> fact<00:01:50.630> so

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
it really warmed the place up in fact so

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.109 
it really warmed the place up in fact so
much<00:01:50.960> when<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:52.009> heater<00:01:52.220> comes<00:01:52.549> on<00:01:52.759> we

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
much when you the heater comes on we

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.430 
much when you the heater comes on we
don't<00:01:53.270> even<00:01:53.509> keep<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.690> heater<00:01:53.959> on<00:01:54.049> anymore

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440

the<00:01:54.799> insert<00:01:55.159> piece<00:01:55.670> here<00:01:55.970> was<00:01:56.090> about<00:01:56.209> fifth

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
the insert piece here was about fifth

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.350 
the insert piece here was about fifth
the<00:01:56.959> cost<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.409> replacing<00:01:57.770> this<00:01:58.069> window<00:01:58.429> so<00:01:59.330> it

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
the cost of replacing this window so it
