watching<00:00:30.869> her<00:00:30.960> do<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.439> was<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:32.040> feel

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
watching her do this I was like I feel

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.340 
watching her do this I was like I feel
like<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.969> would<00:00:33.090> be<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.510> another<00:00:33.840> channel

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
like that would be just another channel

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.260 
like that would be just another channel
and<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.219> would<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.460> liked<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:36.090> really
