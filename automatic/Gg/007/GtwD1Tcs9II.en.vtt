00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.529
 Hi, I'm here with me for the past 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.529
 The best and worst books that is this is 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.040
 For those who do not know that, no. 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.049
 working reviews consider my 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.109
 Dear editor who goes on holiday then 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.420
 will my children stay so my stress 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.460
 the scenario is different than it was very 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.070
 money available to me then me 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.320
 sorry and the image is very good 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.119
 so let's start one of the worst books 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.210
 I read this year I read a lot that 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.180
 I did not like it but I just came back to 2 to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.110
 serve as an example of a function or 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.390
 divergent 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.399
 so I do not think it's awful you do not 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.219
 It makes you happy seeing I think it's more 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.770
 less this intention and today mechanical 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.140
 The question is of course that it is really me or 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:55.050
 I got to finish reading it because 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:58.320
 I found it very weak wind the last days 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.020
 of krypton but are personal issues 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.630
 I do not like them and I go 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.760
 try to work this over again try to see 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.350
 with long trot of the event through 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.479
 continuations 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.880
 so but these ones I really doubt 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.650
 that I will go ahead with the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.990
 super sexy astrology 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.049
 now we started I liked I 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.790
 I will leave out so that he 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.920
 year that are continuations 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.869
 I had never read before second Teixeira 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.020
 the volume series that had begun in the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.329
 last year as part of the gossip 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.850
 first law to double sword the king of 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.890
 thrones of precatório arisen track 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.650
 best so you've ever liked 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.470
 first but it was not news they 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.390
 they can get out but the new scheme of 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.619
 first then I'm talking about energy 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.250
 that even talking you're going to talk about 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.960
 they 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.049
 so let's go there the first one that actually 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.399
 three is the trilogy of the black magician who 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.110
 I had to get all of them that are 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.930
 stuck here in the case of plastic wizards 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.689
 worst worst apprentice I 've ever been 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.549
 I said in the reviews that it is difficult. 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.320
 indicate to them because they are not very slow 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.550
 uncompetitive have things 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.030
 unnecessary 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.740
 He has a lot of money there. 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.680
 It's very big but it turned out not 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.840
 corresponding some expectations of the 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.959
 story right of pta to see 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.370
 but I liked him is liz was one 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.870
 critical reading very happy I feel 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.420
 characters so slow but 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.620
 I had three more names I was going to read more 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.180
 three goals 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.280
 so it's a technology that I like 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.950
 I was quite happy to start 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.770
 ball has bought her in the past I 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.280
 I knew luciano the next was johnny is 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.470
 to fail to obtain that thus I was in his 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.750
 cast and know it's complicated it is to be 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.030
 slow because of her sister's book 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.760
 which is the howling windy hill that is 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.519
 I could not finish reading mg-111 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.590
 never because I found it very very slow 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.530
 It was a little heavenly here but I 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.780
 I really liked the Mexican soap opera when 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.300
 what can happen happens i liked 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.180
 and I was very happy with him and me. 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.760
 I would recommend recommending classics with 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.040
 sure to though you have to remember 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.280
 that it was written in another time in 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.530
 150 years is another rhythm and so the 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.200
 clichés as he said in his video was not 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.390
 investigated at the time now sanchez 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.549
 were very repeated but at that time 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.420
 have to have that moment when he does 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:33.049
 a fight that I thought I might not have 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.840
 read it but I do not speak much of it 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:40.100
 now that 's what's confusing me the most 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.950
 and and I forgot something and then talking about thomas 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.220
 but it is a very good money that who 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.880
 read can read if you do not much like 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.310
 book but is interested in learning about 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.250
 story of the film is the case but it is 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.070
 very very good I want it again block 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.769
 the next one is excessive I do not have to unite 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.769
 preferably or anything, this is my 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:08.030
 preferred cooperative help wars 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:10.850
 although I liked the movies in a way 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.130
 and measuring with the book I really liked it 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.220
 but I was not started because I did not 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.669
 I had liked the dae way, so it's 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.039
 Kind of reads like this but I was very happy. 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.530
 even because he is so much like 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.590
 the movie what's funny 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:31.280
 can almost watch was accompanying to 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.880
 people hit even the scenes cuts 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:40.340
 Here is equal know I guess I do not 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:43.820
 I picked up a pole but it was pretty cool. 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.820
 I read you and the last otto someone guesses that 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.540
 I say that it will be one not 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.540
 I can imagine 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:56.180
 jame athlete who was super eat lei 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.390
 because I thought it would series number 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.480
 My little girl, my god, I do not even know 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.580
 teenager going past but not him 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.410
 is much more adult than imagined 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.360
 all new and more mature than 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.250
 I imagined and I did not fall in love with 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.620
 story, you know I'm addicted 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:20.750
 in this series on TV series in the series of 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:22.820
 books is so much that I'm so close 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.169
 I also really liked the two of them. 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.590
 as good as the first 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:30.140
 Ah, I love this story a long time ago. 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.660
 I did not get so pulled it's a thing. 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:37.610
 how are you from here but who have the problems 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.930
 of them the defects and so the fed here was 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.310
 done on purpose to it 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.800
 conquer the audience 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.289
 but I love it I was very happy to 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.330
 I bought it, I ordered it on a 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.630
 I did not know anything about history. 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:54.440
 but I saw that it had tv series was 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.150
 beginning and that's how I ordered 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.090
 before watching the series 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.640
 Actually, then, how did I comment on him? 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.289
 was to watch the first second episode 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.510
 I think I already had an aunt in the 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.970
 first set the first 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.780
 and then when he arrived he was already 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.930
 addicted 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.880
 so it was great that came the second 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.550
 episode and unfortunately has been released 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.050
 according to whether you do not know dragonfly nobel 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.050

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:24.050

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.039

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:30.950
