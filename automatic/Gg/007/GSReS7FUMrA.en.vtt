of the large ones will um previously as
a<00:01:55.290> sport<00:01:55.680> you'd<00:01:55.890> want<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.219> stack<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> medium

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
a sport you'd want to stack the medium

a sport you'd want to stack the medium
camp<00:01:57.119> when<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.390> pull<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.020> here<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.350> you

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
camp when you pull it in here and you

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.050 
camp when you pull it in here and you
get<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> pretty<00:01:59.070> good<00:01:59.189> chunk<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.549> experience

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
get a pretty good chunk of experience

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.179 
get a pretty good chunk of experience
you<00:02:00.210> maybe<00:02:00.360> get<00:02:00.509> some<00:02:00.689> gold<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.829> now<00:02:02.009> with

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
you maybe get some gold but now with

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.459 
you maybe get some gold but now with
this<00:02:02.310> change<00:02:02.759> you're<00:02:03.390> not<00:02:03.570> as<00:02:03.750> efficient

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
this change you're not as efficient

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.260 
this change you're not as efficient
within<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.219> jungle<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.759> stacking<00:02:06.180> of

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.020 
within the jungle and the stacking of
pulling<00:02:06.450> mechanic<00:02:06.930> within<00:02:07.170> dota<00:02:07.290> 2<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.550> that's

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
pulling mechanic within dota 2 so that's

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.190 
pulling mechanic within dota 2 so that's
why<00:02:09.179> we're<00:02:09.390> seeing<00:02:09.509> more<00:02:09.750> things<00:02:09.989> such<00:02:10.170> as

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
why we're seeing more things such as

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.110 
why we're seeing more things such as
aggression<00:02:10.590> it's<00:02:11.039> almost<00:02:11.310> better<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.700> pick<00:02:11.970> up

the stacking remains the same it is

that heal each other if you click on the

tells you which ones heal you can see
down<00:02:51.480> here<00:02:51.750> but<00:02:52.290> when<00:02:52.409> you<00:02:52.440> do<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.859> when<00:02:53.129> you

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
down here but when you do that when you

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.160 
down here but when you do that when you
go<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.340> pull<00:02:53.549> them<00:02:53.790> what<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.690> have<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.900> do<00:02:55.049> is

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
go to pull them what you have to do is

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.800 
go to pull them what you have to do is
you<00:02:55.260> need<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.409> walk<00:02:55.769> into<00:02:56.190> them<00:02:56.569> have<00:02:57.569> them<00:02:57.720> to

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
you need to walk into them have them to

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.119 
you need to walk into them have them to
grow<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.170> grade<00:02:58.409> you<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.769> then<00:02:58.950> you're<00:02:59.040> going

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
grow a grade you and then you're going

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.309 
grow a grade you and then you're going
to<00:02:59.190> walk<00:02:59.400> away<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.569> do<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.079> stack<00:03:01.290> it

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
to walk away and you do that to stack it

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.410 
to walk away and you do that to stack it
the<00:03:01.530> reason<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.340> because<00:03:02.400> if<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.060> attack

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
the reason is is because if you attack

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.059 
the reason is is because if you attack
it<00:03:03.450> if<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.750> just<00:03:03.840> right-click<00:03:04.260> them<00:03:04.409> they're

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
it if you just right-click them they're

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.170 
it if you just right-click them they're
going<00:03:05.159> to<00:03:05.250> start<00:03:05.340> healing<00:03:05.579> each<00:03:05.760> other<00:03:05.940> and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
going to start healing each other and

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.039 
going to start healing each other and
then<00:03:06.420> they're<00:03:06.510> going<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.720> stay<00:03:06.840> right<00:03:06.989> there

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
then they're going to stay right there

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.270 
then they're going to stay right there
and<00:03:07.260> you're<00:03:07.349> not<00:03:07.409> going<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.620> stack<00:03:07.829> I<00:03:08.010> see<00:03:08.129> a

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
and you're not going to stack I see a

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.059 
and you're not going to stack I see a
lot<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.459> new<00:03:08.700> players<00:03:09.440> going<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.680> stack<00:03:10.889> and

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
lot of new players going to stack and

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.430 
lot of new players going to stack and
pull<00:03:11.280> they<00:03:11.519> pull<00:03:12.030> at<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.209> right<00:03:12.510> time<00:03:12.780> but

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
pull they pull at the right time but

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.990 
pull they pull at the right time but
then<00:03:13.650> those<00:03:13.829> guys<00:03:14.129> just<00:03:14.159> stand<00:03:14.639> there<00:03:14.700> and

he'll one another and then the camp
isn't<00:03:16.680> spawn<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.129> that's<00:03:17.280> one<00:03:17.489> note<00:03:17.879> to<00:03:18.030> make

you're<00:03:26.579> still<00:03:26.669> going<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:26.970> be<00:03:27.030> pulling<00:03:27.269> them<00:03:27.449> in

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
you're still going to be pulling them in

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.930 
you're still going to be pulling them in
this<00:03:27.959> area<00:03:28.349> here<00:03:28.769> but<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.310> change<00:03:29.609> that<00:03:29.849> was

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
this area here but the change that was

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.539 
this area here but the change that was
made<00:03:30.000> is<00:03:30.449> that<00:03:30.480> when<00:03:30.750> creeps<00:03:31.049> spawn<00:03:31.560> they<00:03:32.430> get

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
made is that when creeps spawn they get

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.000 
made is that when creeps spawn they get
an<00:03:32.639> increased<00:03:33.120> run<00:03:33.480> speed<00:03:33.780> until<00:03:34.680> they<00:03:34.859> get

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
an increased run speed until they get

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.770 
an increased run speed until they get
about<00:03:35.250> here<00:03:35.699> on<00:03:35.879> the<00:03:36.000> map<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.540> if<00:03:36.629> you<00:03:36.690> look

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
about here on the map so if you look

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.750 
about here on the map so if you look
down<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.079> mini-map<00:03:37.440> from<00:03:38.129> about<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.489> point

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
down the mini-map from about this point

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.400 
down the mini-map from about this point
to<00:03:39.150> about<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:39.449> point<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.049> see<00:03:40.260> here

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
to about this point and you see here

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.009 
to about this point and you see here
these<00:03:40.530> creeps<00:03:40.829> upon<00:03:40.919> their<00:03:41.879> moving<00:03:42.090> at<00:03:42.239> 406

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
these creeps upon their moving at 406

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.629 
these creeps upon their moving at 406
movement<00:03:43.379> speed<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.799> you'll<00:03:44.220> notice<00:03:44.549> when

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
movement speed and you'll notice when

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.309 
movement speed and you'll notice when
they<00:03:44.760> get<00:03:44.879> about<00:03:45.060> right<00:03:45.299> here<00:03:45.690> they're<00:03:46.199> going

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
they get about right here they're going

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.189 
they get about right here they're going
to<00:03:46.410> slow<00:03:46.650> back<00:03:46.829> down<00:03:46.859> to<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.400> normal<00:03:47.849> speed

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199 
to slow back down to the normal speed

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.619 
to slow back down to the normal speed
and<00:03:49.280> so<00:03:50.280> that's<00:03:50.430> going<00:03:50.549> to<00:03:50.609> adjust<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.269> poll

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
and so that's going to adjust the poll

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.479 
and so that's going to adjust the poll
time<00:03:51.900> so<00:03:52.169> before<00:03:52.260> you<00:03:52.560> recall<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.280> pull-tab

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
time so before you recall the pull-tab

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.229 
time so before you recall the pull-tab
of<00:03:53.699> about<00:03:53.849> 45<00:03:54.299> 46<00:03:54.750> see<00:03:55.680> here<00:03:55.829> now<00:03:55.949> it's<00:03:56.069> 325<00:03:56.459> now

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
of about 45 46 see here now it's 325 now

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.759 
of about 45 46 see here now it's 325 now
with<00:03:57.419> the<00:03:57.510> new<00:03:57.540> poll<00:03:57.959> time<00:03:58.169> you're<00:03:58.590> going<00:03:58.680> to

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
with the new poll time you're going to

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.879 
with the new poll time you're going to
want<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:58.919> pull<00:03:59.129> this<00:03:59.340> camp<00:03:59.639> around<00:04:00.500> 43<00:04:01.500> or

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
want to pull this camp around 43 or

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.990 
want to pull this camp around 43 or
around<00:04:03.650> 13<00:04:04.650> so<00:04:04.949> the<00:04:05.069> number<00:04:05.579> is<00:04:05.609> kind<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.849> ended

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
around 13 so the number is kind of ended

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.689 
around 13 so the number is kind of ended
three<00:04:06.269> that<00:04:07.019> is<00:04:07.139> kind<00:04:07.349> of<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.739> gist<00:04:08.099> now<00:04:08.340> so

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
three that is kind of the gist now so

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.640 
three that is kind of the gist now so
don't<00:04:09.120> rely<00:04:09.269> on<00:04:09.449> just<00:04:10.049> staring<00:04:10.379> at<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.530> clock

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
don't rely on just staring at the clock

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.649 
don't rely on just staring at the clock
try<00:04:10.979> to<00:04:11.040> eyeball<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.729> notice<00:04:12.449> where<00:04:12.629> the

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
try to eyeball it and notice where the

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.860 
try to eyeball it and notice where the
creeps<00:04:12.989> are<00:04:13.109> at<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:14.099> you<00:04:14.159> notice<00:04:14.400> here<00:04:14.579> um

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
we'll do a poll and one thing to note

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.430 
we'll do a poll and one thing to note
too<00:04:17.970> that<00:04:18.209> with<00:04:18.599> these<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:19.320> know<00:04:19.409> these

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.649 
too that with these you know these
jungle<00:04:19.889> changes<00:04:20.340> things<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:21.060> were<00:04:21.150> adjusted

jungle changes things that were adjusted
a<00:04:22.849> double<00:04:23.849> polling<00:04:24.240> which<00:04:24.389> I<00:04:24.510> show<00:04:24.659> at<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.870> end

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
a double polling which I show at the end

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.500 
a double polling which I show at the end
of<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.440> previous<00:04:25.590> video<00:04:26.010> you

of the previous video you
is<00:04:26.570> a<00:04:26.810> lot<00:04:27.170> more<00:04:27.230> important<00:04:27.830> now<00:04:27.920> because<00:04:28.160> you

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
is a lot more important now because you

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.260 
is a lot more important now because you
still<00:04:28.820> want<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.090> get<00:04:29.150> access<00:04:29.540> to<00:04:29.750> those<00:04:31.270> those

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.480 
still want to get access to those those
other<00:04:32.480> creeps<00:04:32.840> so<00:04:33.290> tearing<00:04:33.920> down<00:04:34.040> this<00:04:34.190> tree

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
other creeps so tearing down this tree

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.520 
other creeps so tearing down this tree
and<00:04:34.670> pulling<00:04:35.060> that<00:04:35.180> one<00:04:35.390> there<00:04:35.630> is<00:04:35.870> definitely

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
and pulling that one there is definitely

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.100 
and pulling that one there is definitely
something<00:04:36.830> you<00:04:36.950> really<00:04:37.280> want<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:37.520> be<00:04:37.580> doing

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
up into this area it's definitely

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.230 
up into this area it's definitely
something<00:04:42.530> you<00:04:42.650> still<00:04:42.890> be<00:04:43.070> doing<00:04:43.220> if<00:04:43.940> you're

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
concerned about what those poles are

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.680 
concerned about what those poles are
