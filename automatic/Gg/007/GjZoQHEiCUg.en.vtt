our point about coffee filters and oil
filters<00:00:56.460> let's<00:00:57.239> start<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> coarse<00:00:57.960> green

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260

filters let's start with a coarse green
filter<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.920> see<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.550> particulates<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.239> can

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
filter and see what particulates we can

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.889 
filter and see what particulates we can
