00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.550 

we've<00:00:04.240> already<00:00:04.420> seen<00:00:04.779> how<00:00:04.960> we<00:00:05.020> can<00:00:05.140> sketch

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:05.560 
we've already seen how we can sketch

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.409 
we've already seen how we can sketch
more<00:00:05.920> Z<00:00:06.130> spheres<00:00:06.460> on<00:00:06.640> top<00:00:06.819> of<00:00:07.000> a<00:00:07.090> singles

00:00:07.409 --> 00:00:07.419 
more Z spheres on top of a singles

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:09.390 
more Z spheres on top of a singles
easier<00:00:07.839> now<00:00:08.440> let's<00:00:08.650> take<00:00:08.860> a<00:00:08.889> look<00:00:09.070> at<00:00:09.219> how<00:00:09.340> we

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
easier now let's take a look at how we

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.250 
easier now let's take a look at how we
can<00:00:09.639> build<00:00:09.879> a<00:00:10.120> Z's<00:00:10.420> for<00:00:10.570> your<00:00:10.660> armature<00:00:10.959> and

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 
can build a Z's for your armature and

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.470 
can build a Z's for your armature and
then<00:00:11.830> add<00:00:12.040> Z<00:00:12.370> sphere<00:00:12.639> sketching<00:00:13.059> on<00:00:13.179> top<00:00:13.360> of

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
then add Z sphere sketching on top of

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.509 
then add Z sphere sketching on top of
that<00:00:13.660> the<00:00:14.469> reason<00:00:14.769> I'm<00:00:14.860> going<00:00:14.950> to<00:00:15.009> call<00:00:15.250> it<00:00:15.370> as

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 
that the reason I'm going to call it as

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.580 
that the reason I'm going to call it as
easier<00:00:16.000> armature<00:00:16.540> is<00:00:16.720> much<00:00:17.050> like<00:00:17.230> a<00:00:17.259> clay

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
easier armature is much like a clay

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.470 
easier armature is much like a clay
sculptor<00:00:18.130> would<00:00:18.310> build<00:00:18.550> a<00:00:18.759> wire<00:00:19.060> armature

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
sculptor would build a wire armature

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.810 
sculptor would build a wire armature
before<00:00:19.989> they<00:00:20.110> start<00:00:20.380> adding<00:00:20.680> the<00:00:20.770> clay<00:00:21.040> to

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
before they start adding the clay to

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.120 
before they start adding the clay to
have<00:00:22.000> a<00:00:22.239> base<00:00:22.509> for<00:00:22.779> their<00:00:22.930> form<00:00:23.230> we<00:00:23.800> can<00:00:23.919> do<00:00:24.040> the

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
have a base for their form we can do the

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.100 
have a base for their form we can do the
same<00:00:24.340> thing<00:00:24.579> with<00:00:24.700> these<00:00:24.849> these<00:00:25.029> spheres<00:00:28.110> so

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
same thing with these these spheres so

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.249 
same thing with these these spheres so
we'll<00:00:29.259> quickly<00:00:29.410> just<00:00:30.630> pull<00:00:31.630> out<00:00:31.660> a<00:00:31.809> basic

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
we'll quickly just pull out a basic

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.279 
we'll quickly just pull out a basic
shape<00:00:32.290> that<00:00:36.269> we<00:00:37.269> want<00:00:37.300> to<00:00:37.480> do<00:00:37.600> some<00:00:37.870> sketching

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:38.289 
shape that we want to do some sketching

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:45.569 
shape that we want to do some sketching
on<00:00:38.379> top<00:00:38.589> of<00:00:43.829> now<00:00:44.829> once<00:00:45.039> you<00:00:45.160> have<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.370> base

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
on top of now once you have the base

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:46.739 
on top of now once you have the base
that<00:00:45.850> you<00:00:45.910> want<00:00:46.089> to<00:00:46.149> work<00:00:46.300> with

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:46.749 
that you want to work with

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:48.630 
that you want to work with
just<00:00:47.079> like<00:00:47.199> before<00:00:47.350> we'll<00:00:47.800> simply<00:00:48.129> hit<00:00:48.309> shift

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
just like before we'll simply hit shift

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.779 
just like before we'll simply hit shift
a<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:50.350> can<00:00:50.499> now<00:00:50.589> start<00:00:50.649> sketching<00:00:51.219> on<00:00:51.460> top<00:00:51.640> of

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
a we can now start sketching on top of

00:00:51.789 --> 00:01:06.780 
a we can now start sketching on top of
the<00:00:51.850> model<00:00:54.059> hold<00:00:55.059> shift<00:00:55.390> to<00:00:55.480> smooth

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.970 

what's<00:01:07.540> great<00:01:07.720> about<00:01:07.780> this<00:01:08.110> process<00:01:08.410> is<00:01:08.830> that

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
what's great about this process is that

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.010 
what's great about this process is that
any<00:01:09.220> point<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:09.670> can<00:01:09.820> hit<00:01:09.970> shift<00:01:10.330> a<00:01:10.510> and<00:01:10.870> go

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
any point you can hit shift a and go

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.900 
any point you can hit shift a and go
back<00:01:11.200> to<00:01:11.320> your<00:01:11.380> armature<00:01:11.710> z<00:01:12.010> spheres<00:01:12.280> and<00:01:12.490> you

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
back to your armature z spheres and you

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.940 
back to your armature z spheres and you
can<00:01:13.060> continue<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.630> creation<00:01:14.230> process<00:01:14.260> by

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
can continue the creation process by

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.860 
can continue the creation process by
simply<00:01:15.310> extruding<00:01:15.760> out<00:01:15.850> newsy<00:01:16.360> spheres<00:01:16.660> to

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
simply extruding out newsy spheres to

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:25.470 
simply extruding out newsy spheres to
work<00:01:17.020> with<00:01:23.340> again<00:01:24.340> once<00:01:24.610> you<00:01:24.760> have<00:01:24.940> these<00:01:25.150> new

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
work with again once you have these new

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.300 
work with again once you have these new
armatures<00:01:25.960> these<00:01:26.170> spheres<00:01:26.440> set<00:01:26.680> up<00:01:26.830> you

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
armatures these spheres set up you

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.130 
armatures these spheres set up you
simply<00:01:27.520> hit<00:01:27.790> shift<00:01:28.150> a<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.390> go<00:01:28.690> back<00:01:28.870> to<00:01:28.990> that

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
simply hit shift a to go back to that

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:39.690 
simply hit shift a to go back to that
sketch<00:01:29.410> mode

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.399 

now<00:01:40.240> you've<00:01:40.420> already<00:01:40.570> learnt<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:40.990> keyboard

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
now you've already learnt the keyboard

between this standard Z sphere mode
where<00:01:46.180> I<00:01:46.210> set<00:01:46.450> up<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.659> armature<00:01:47.049> and<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
where I set up the armature and the

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.670 
where I set up the armature and the
sketching<00:01:48.970> mode<00:01:49.119> but<00:01:49.930> take<00:01:50.140> note<00:01:50.350> that<00:01:50.380> in

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
sketching mode but take note that in

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.170 
sketching mode but take note that in
your<00:01:50.830> tool<00:01:51.040> palette<00:01:51.430> you<00:01:51.549> have<00:01:51.580> a<00:01:51.700> drop<00:01:51.970> down

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
your tool palette you have a drop down

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.240 
your tool palette you have a drop down
here<00:01:52.210> called<00:01:52.630> Z<00:01:52.869> sketch<00:01:53.200> you'll<00:01:53.920> notice<00:01:54.159> a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
here called Z sketch you'll notice a

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.219 
here called Z sketch you'll notice a
button<00:01:54.520> here<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:54.880> that<00:01:55.000> says<00:01:55.270> edit<00:01:55.509> sketch

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229

this<00:01:57.159> is<00:01:57.340> what<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.729> shift<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.330> shortcut<00:01:59.020> is

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
this is what the shift a shortcut is

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.840 
this is what the shift a shortcut is
activating<00:01:59.649> so<00:01:59.920> we<00:02:00.039> can<00:02:00.159> simply<00:02:00.460> click<00:02:00.700> this

sketch<00:02:07.990> z<00:02:08.530> spheres

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
sketch z spheres

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.979 
sketch z spheres
now<00:02:09.729> you<00:02:09.789> notice<00:02:10.090> when<00:02:10.269> we're<00:02:10.420> in<00:02:10.539> this<00:02:10.690> mode

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
now you notice when we're in this mode

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.850 
now you notice when we're in this mode
we<00:02:11.140> can<00:02:11.470> actually<00:02:11.620> move<00:02:12.010> our<00:02:12.250> armature<00:02:12.550> around

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
we can actually move our armature around

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.530 
we can actually move our armature around
so<00:02:14.860> if<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.130> rotate<00:02:15.940> this<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:17.040> then<00:02:18.040> hit<00:02:18.360> shift<00:02:19.360> a

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
so if I rotate this and then hit shift a

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.720 
so if I rotate this and then hit shift a
you'll<00:02:20.530> see<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.890> we<00:02:21.040> moved<00:02:21.280> our<00:02:21.430> armature

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
you'll see that we moved our armature

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.940 
you'll see that we moved our armature
but<00:02:22.390> our<00:02:22.510> sketch<00:02:22.720> z<00:02:22.959> spheres<00:02:23.290> stayed<00:02:23.560> in<00:02:23.680> place

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
but our sketch z spheres stayed in place

says show sketch this will give us our

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.190 
says show sketch this will give us our
sketches<00:02:36.700> each<00:02:37.030> spheres<00:02:37.330> in<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.780> ghosted

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200

so<00:02:40.900> we<00:02:40.989> can<00:02:41.110> see<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.350> model<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.709> we're

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
so we can see the model that we're

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.380 
so we can see the model that we're
working<00:02:41.950> with<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.489> way<00:02:42.880> if<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.090> do<00:02:43.150> any

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
working with that way if I do any

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.720 
working with that way if I do any
movement<00:02:44.109> of<00:02:44.230> my<00:02:44.500> armature<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.130> can<00:02:45.370> see<00:02:45.549> where

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
movement of my armature I can see where

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.099 
movement of my armature I can see where
I'm<00:02:45.850> moving<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:48.030> now<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.090> would<00:02:49.299> expect<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.930> Z

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
I'm moving it now you would expect the Z

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.199 
I'm moving it now you would expect the Z
spheres<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.620> move<00:02:50.769> with<00:02:50.950> armature<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.609> course

spheres to move with armature of course

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.569 
spheres to move with armature of course
we<00:02:52.359> can<00:02:52.510> do<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.750> too<00:02:53.019> you'll<00:02:53.680> also<00:02:53.890> notice<00:02:54.280> in

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
we can do that too you'll also notice in

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.430 
we can do that too you'll also notice in

rigid<00:04:32.350> you'll<00:04:32.710> keep<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.010> slider<00:04:33.310> all<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.610> way

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
rigid you'll keep the slider all the way

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.360 
rigid you'll keep the slider all the way
to<00:04:34.120> zero<00:04:34.419> if<00:04:35.410> we<00:04:35.470> want<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:35.889> have<00:04:35.979> a<00:04:36.010> little<00:04:36.190> bit

spheres<00:04:50.470> so<00:04:51.099> when<00:04:51.250> we're<00:04:51.460> working<00:04:51.490> with

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
spheres so when we're working with

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.640 
spheres so when we're working with
something<00:04:52.389> like<00:04:52.539> this<00:04:52.690> that<00:04:52.900> has<00:04:52.960> muscles<00:04:53.470> we

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
something like this that has muscles we

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.719 
something like this that has muscles we
might<00:04:53.830> want<00:04:54.010> to<00:04:54.039> add<00:04:54.160> a<00:04:54.190> little<00:04:54.370> bit<00:04:54.550> of<00:04:54.580> the

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
might want to add a little bit of the

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.750 
might want to add a little bit of the
soft<00:04:55.000> bind<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.599> model<00:04:56.070> again<00:04:57.070> I'll<00:04:57.280> press

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
soft bind to the model again I'll press

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.920 
soft bind to the model again I'll press
edit<00:04:58.060> sketch<00:04:58.570> to<00:04:59.229> continue<00:04:59.650> adding<00:04:59.800> Z<00:05:00.070> spheres

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
edit sketch to continue adding Z spheres

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.150 
edit sketch to continue adding Z spheres
so<00:05:01.930> what's<00:05:02.110> very<00:05:02.229> powerful<00:05:02.800> about<00:05:02.949> this

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
so what's very powerful about this

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.010 
so what's very powerful about this
process<00:05:03.430> as<00:05:03.880> you<00:05:04.090> continue<00:05:04.510> to<00:05:04.599> work<00:05:04.720> on<00:05:04.930> the

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
process as you continue to work on the
