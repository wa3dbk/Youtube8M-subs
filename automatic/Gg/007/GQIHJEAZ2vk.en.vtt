00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.060
 seldom was petroleum as cheap as straight 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.040
 now 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.629
 nevertheless the cartell renounced 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.360
 most recently 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.650
 to reduce the offer 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.780
 especially since the beginning 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.570
 the ukraine crisis said the price in 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.859
 bottomless is behind the flood 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.850
 markets may be political 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.340
 Intention 90 million barrels 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.859
 oil consumption the world currently per 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.230
 a commodity that has not been a commodity for years 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.199
 It was more cheap than it was today 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.329
 In June 2014, the price of oil fell by half 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.860
 the variety at 45 50 dollars per barrel 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.520
 the reason for this is the present one 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.879
 oversupply on the markets in previous ones 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.079
 price collapse reduced the opec the 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.809
 delivery last november 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:55.199
 However, Saudi Arabia prevented one 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:57.300
 the relevant decision we have 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.340
 of course it took three took 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.090
 or four hours the situation 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.250
 to advise 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.260
 at the end the conference has decided 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.630
 that we can handle at 40 million 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.290
 our production in the coming six 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.290
 stay for months 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.020
 a problem is that before price decline 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.229
 especially for states whose budget is strong 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.689
 depends on the export of raw materials while 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.549
 the rich us allied saudi arabia 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.380
 can certainly afford these failures 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.130
 They mean for russia and venezuela 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.899
 This is a tough stress test 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.509
 development may even be wanted 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.280
 no, the market observer roland thinks 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.020
 hirschmüller from the munich-based baader 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.759
 Bank 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.549
 the americans have their oil production 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.280
 the last three years of about 55 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.140
 million barrels a day at 95 to almost 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.729
 ten million barrels per day increased 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.470
 This oil will of course be mainly 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.299
 consumed in the country say the 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.459
 americans are not like that anymore 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.679
 depending on the oil imports that out here 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:58.600
 the united arab emirates or 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.450
 generally from the cartel 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.369
 finally comes for several years 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.569
 especially in north america this is booming 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.119
 controversial fracking 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.369
 this is difficult to transport oil with 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.950
 chemicals blown up from the underground 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.170
 the resulting increased oil production in 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.810
 the usa is considered by many observers 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.670
 reason for the falling price of 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.690
 historian and energy researcher daniele 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.820
 Ganser sees these numbers are skeptical 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.769
 in the usa at the moment three million almost 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.400
 won in about Fracking with oil 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.940
 become 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.950
 but the conventional earth that is that 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.590
 Easily eligible ertl has in the us 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.720
 also reached level in 1970 and the 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.910
 production goes back that is to say 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.650
 on a crooked level and try 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.310
 here with fracking the level too 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.410
 It seems questionable that the usa 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.290
 currently allegedly independent of 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.420
 oil imports if so why 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.819
 The OPEC does not reduce the delivery rate 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.250
 the stock exchange expert dirk müller sees 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.180
 a connection between oil price and 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.639
 US American interests 80 percent 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.200
 Russia exports are commodities and 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.670
 finance about 50 percent of 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.480
 state budget so the low 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.990
 oil price is doing its remaining this 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.000
 tensions continue to make fire 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.850
 also other fischer editor of the 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.290
 Investors magazine of the shareholder believes in 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.079
 a political background 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.329
 the usa and saudi arabia shake hands in 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.500
 lead hand work 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.090
 you can sort of covert war in 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.930
 russia coat here russia and 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.090
 Venezuela massively weaken clear evidence 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.280
 for a control of the price of oil 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.349
 Washington does not exist yet 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.720
 at least an interest 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.890
 Washingtons Revenues of Russia and 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.599
 Venezuela possible to press 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.549
 us president barack obama dismissed the end 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.430
 2014 in an interview of the 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.650
 tv channels npr open one that the 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.120
 usa moscow dependency on the price of oil 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.739
 at least allow for 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.189
 Are you just happy that the price of oil 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.049
 sinks and their currency almost collapses 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.879
 how they will remember theirs 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.489
 economy already before the collapse of the 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.549
 Oil price problems and the capital flowed 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.739
 and part of our logic in this process 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.630
 that was the only thing the economy 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.370
 Still over water keeps the oil price is 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.380
 the sanctions are upheld 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.820
 so obama could continue russia 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.130
 economy sooner or later 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.729
 Fluctuations in the price of oil barely 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.729
 compensate 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:34.900
 Nevertheless, Russia is still up 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.400
 Exports of raw materials as the most important 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.439
 instructed revenue source 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.569
 this image film of the state

 north sea already in 2004 moscow started with 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:50.460
 the construction of a stabilization fund 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.460
 to protect against falling oil prices 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:56.919
 what russia could face is in 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.990
 already to watch venezuela 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.270
 the late president hugo chavez 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.400
 built since the turn of the millennium the 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:08.819
 social benefits in the country massively 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.020
 sharp socialism of the 21st century 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:14.310
 financed by the revenue of 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.930
 state oil company pdv usa 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.300
 Meanwhile , the government succeeds in 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.360
 Caracas barely has her policy too 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.360
 finance 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.770
 Russia, however, has another 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:32.720
 customer found for his petroleum 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:35.180
 the emerging big power china 2014 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.280
 both states agreed extensively 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.520
 oil and gas supplies for the next 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.169
 three decades at least part of the 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.570
 Deliveries should be in the local currencies 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:48.240
 Ruble and Julian are charged 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:51.610
 a frontal attack against the dollar 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.890
 the political scientist jeff bridges is the

 global strategy in an interview with 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.330
 polanski made polish tv 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.550
 clearly also the new raw material axis 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:07.200
 moscow beijing could be due to low 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.200
 Oil prices are torpedoed 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:15.040
 this is a conversation an agreement 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.700
 if I'm not mistaken about 25 or 30 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.130
 years 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:21.100
 what stands as an obstacle in let's say 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.200
 ten years in the rating of china what 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.240
 the energy carriers are imported 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.370
 These from Saudi Arabia or Iran 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.560
 Much cheaper than the prices 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.080
 on which you have agreed with Russia 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.550
 has and if the Chinese so much 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.860
 Sensitive are the contract 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.260
 feeling connected because they are one in it 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.000
 take a certain position and which 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.980
 possibilities has in this area 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.600
 russia it makes tremendous 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.180
 Investment in the construction of pipelines 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.440
 for his entire export from china 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.510
 align 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.460
 and suddenly it learns that the previous one 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.200
 negotiated price at the time of 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.780
 Agreement already at a low 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:07:00.150
 level was another 30 percent fall 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.150
 maybe even 50 percent 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.350
 Washington generally as a weapon 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.850
 also believes that all 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.400
 Swiss is safe for the 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:15.450
 Power claims of the USA are Russian 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.460
 and Venezuela exports a threat 

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.710
 have also said if we in 21 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:25.590
 century the supermacht continues 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.590
 then we have to stay 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.270
 Secretary General Abdullah Al Badri said 

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.340
 By the end of January, by the way, he was counting on it 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.710
 no further price reductions 

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:48.330
 at the same time he warned again before one 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.330
 reduction of production volumes 

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.590
 liked him this contribution 

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.990
