UK after sales service here and we have

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.630 
UK after sales service here and we have
our<00:00:48.030> European<00:00:48.890> manufacturing<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.070> under<00:00:50.460> one

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
our European manufacturing in under one

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.220 
our European manufacturing in under one
roof<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:52.110> gives<00:00:52.649> us<00:00:52.829> certain<00:00:54.230> benefits

roof and that gives us certain benefits

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.680 
roof and that gives us certain benefits
I<00:00:55.530> believe<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.129> reduces<00:00:57.120> costs

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
I believe and reduces costs

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.779 
I believe and reduces costs
he<00:00:58.230> made<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.800> make<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> investment<00:00:59.640> in

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
he made that to make the investment in

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.569 
he made that to make the investment in
the<00:00:59.910> factory<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.840> cost<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.800> producing<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the factory but the cost of producing a

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.479 
the factory but the cost of producing a
TV<00:01:02.760> will<00:01:03.600> actually<00:01:03.930> fall<00:01:04.229> by<00:01:04.830> about<00:01:04.860> 20

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
TV will actually fall by about 20

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:05.929 
TV will actually fall by about 20
percent

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
percent

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.730 
percent
for<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> investment<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.560> we've<00:01:07.710> made

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
for for the investment that we've made

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
cello is actually a lot better than some

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.469 
cello is actually a lot better than some

allows us to to really get a grip of
total<00:01:46.530> quality<00:01:46.619> most<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.909> our<00:01:48.090> competitors

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
total quality most of our competitors

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.950 
total quality most of our competitors
are<00:01:48.750> making<00:01:49.140> either<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.340> them<00:01:50.610> Turkey<00:01:51.119> or<00:01:51.299> in

China

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.160 
China
and<00:01:53.619> I<00:01:53.799> believe<00:01:54.159> that<00:01:54.400> our<00:01:54.520> products<00:01:55.090> be<00:01:55.930> made

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
and I believe that our products be made

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.929 
and I believe that our products be made
in<00:01:56.320> new<00:01:56.500> care<00:01:56.770> significantly<00:01:57.549> better<00:01:57.759> than

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
in new care significantly better than

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:09.210 
in new care significantly better than
those<00:01:58.210> products<00:02:07.470> we<00:02:08.470> actually<00:02:08.800> doing<00:02:09.039> at<00:02:09.130> this

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
those products we actually doing at this

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.220 
those products we actually doing at this
point<00:02:09.429> is<00:02:09.580> we're<00:02:09.759> tidying<00:02:10.000> up<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.509> unit<00:02:10.929> so<00:02:11.140> it

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
point is we're tidying up the unit so it

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.020 
point is we're tidying up the unit so it
looks<00:02:11.410> exactly<00:02:11.590> as<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.100> gold<00:02:12.310> sample<00:02:12.640> so<00:02:13.000> the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
looks exactly as the gold sample so the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.360 
looks exactly as the gold sample so the
unit<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.540> went<00:02:13.720> into<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.560> laboratories<00:02:15.220> and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
unit that went into the laboratories and

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.729 
unit that went into the laboratories and
the<00:02:15.430> third-party<00:02:16.090> testing<00:02:16.450> areas<00:02:16.840> this<00:02:17.590> is

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
the third-party testing areas this is

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.640 
the third-party testing areas this is
what<00:02:17.890> we're<00:02:18.040> now<00:02:18.160> replicants<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:20.440> at<00:02:20.530> this

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
what we're now replicants so at this

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.140 
what we're now replicants so at this
point<00:02:20.890> when<00:02:21.130> I'll<00:02:21.250> check<00:02:21.489> them<00:02:21.610> for<00:02:21.640> VGA

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
point when I'll check them for VGA

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.509 
point when I'll check them for VGA
features<00:02:22.750> we<00:02:23.110> check<00:02:23.319> in<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.530> HDMI<00:02:23.800> feature

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
features we check in the HDMI feature

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.759 
features we check in the HDMI feature
and<00:02:25.360> we<00:02:25.510> also<00:02:25.660> ensure<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.470> unit

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
and we also ensure that the unit

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.559 
and we also ensure that the unit
actually<00:02:26.920> has<00:02:27.160> no<00:02:27.400> quality<00:02:27.819> issues<00:02:28.180> as<00:02:28.360> far<00:02:28.420> as

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
actually has no quality issues as far as

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:43.229 
actually has no quality issues as far as
pictures<00:02:29.019> concern<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:29.680> sound

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.880 

so<00:02:44.239> what<00:02:44.450> we<00:02:44.569> do<00:02:44.720> here<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:45.170> we<00:02:45.290> take<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.620> first

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
so what we do here is we take the first

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.039 
so what we do here is we take the first
10<00:02:46.189> units<00:02:46.549> from<00:02:46.610> any<00:02:46.819> production<00:02:47.209> build<00:02:47.659> and

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
10 units from any production build and

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.630 
10 units from any production build and
we<00:02:48.110> place<00:02:48.379> them<00:02:48.590> on<00:02:48.739> here<00:02:48.920> for<00:02:49.129> our<00:02:49.220> lifecycle

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
we place them on here for our lifecycle

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.059 
we place them on here for our lifecycle
check<00:02:50.060> so<00:02:50.540> these<00:02:50.659> units<00:02:50.930> are<00:02:51.230> actually<00:02:51.439> ruined

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
check so these units are actually ruined

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.500 
check so these units are actually ruined
for<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.310> full<00:02:52.519> length<00:02:52.760> of<00:02:52.939> the<00:02:53.060> production
