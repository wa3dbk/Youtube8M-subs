00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.530 
can cut one of the most maligned
vegetables<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.590> America<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.540> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.040 
Brussels sprout and I think a lot of
people<00:00:17.940> really<00:00:18.090> hate<00:00:18.390> Brussels<00:00:18.779> sprouts

people really hate Brussels sprouts

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.540 
people really hate Brussels sprouts
because<00:00:19.410> they've<00:00:19.590> only<00:00:19.740> ever<00:00:20.039> eaten<00:00:20.400> them

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
because they've only ever eaten them

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.150 
because they've only ever eaten them
when<00:00:21.119> they're<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.359> their<00:00:21.510> whole<00:00:21.750> form<00:00:22.109> or<00:00:22.500> if

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
when they're in their whole form or if

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.130 
when they're in their whole form or if
they've<00:00:23.369> been<00:00:23.519> boiled<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.240> death

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
they've been boiled to death

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.529

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
piece is that you have to cook it for a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.330 
piece is that you have to cook it for a
really<00:00:30.960> really<00:00:31.080> long<00:00:31.349> time<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.859> get<00:00:32.189> the

really really long time to get the
center<00:00:32.610> cooked<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.030> then<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.450> tastes

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
center cooked and then it just tastes

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.959 
center cooked and then it just tastes
disgusting<00:00:33.980> has<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> really<00:00:35.489> really<00:00:35.760> gross

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.350 
texture so I want to show you two
different<00:00:37.649> ways<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.059> cook<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
different ways that you can cook the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.170 
different ways that you can cook the
Brussels<00:00:39.690> sprout<00:00:39.960> today<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.879> I'm<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
Brussels sprout today and I'm going to

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180 
Brussels sprout today and I'm going to
show<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.360> actually<00:00:42.870> primarily<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:44.040> way<00:00:44.129> to

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
show you actually primarily the way to

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.799 
show you actually primarily the way to
cut<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:44.730> once<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.120> cut<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.660> two

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
cut it because once you cut it in two

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.860 
cut it because once you cut it in two
different<00:00:45.899> ways<00:00:46.430> it<00:00:47.430> comes<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.239> lot<00:00:48.360> easier<00:00:48.750> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870

sure<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.360> take<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> look<00:00:57.870> at<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.140> top<00:00:58.350> leaves

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
sure you take a look at the top leaves

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.110 
sure you take a look at the top leaves
and<00:00:58.980> some<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.160> those<00:00:59.280> leaves<00:00:59.520> sometimes<00:00:59.760> can

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
and some of those leaves sometimes can

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.580 
and some of those leaves sometimes can
look<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.300> little<00:01:00.329> rough<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.260> I'm<00:01:01.350> just<00:01:01.469> gonna

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
pull off the leaves that I think don't

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.380 
pull off the leaves that I think don't
look<00:01:04.799> good<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:05.670> look<00:01:05.790> okay<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.180> can

would<00:01:49.229> really<00:01:49.409> encourage<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> cut<00:01:50.220> them

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
would really encourage you to cut them

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.760 
would really encourage you to cut them
into<00:01:50.549> quarters<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.630> we're<00:01:52.229> simply<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.530> going

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
into quarters so we're simply just going

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.980 
into quarters so we're simply just going
to<00:01:52.860> cut<00:01:53.040> them<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.310> half<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.909> then<00:01:54.450> cut<00:01:54.750> them<00:01:54.869> in

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
to cut them in half and then cut them in

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.289 
to cut them in half and then cut them in
half<00:01:55.170> again<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.369> benefit<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.939> doing<00:01:57.000> this

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
half again and the benefit of doing this

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.240 
half again and the benefit of doing this
is<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.780> you're<00:01:58.290> actually<00:01:58.500> going<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.920> end<00:01:59.040> up

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
is that you're actually going to end up

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.280 
is that you're actually going to end up
with<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.490> lot<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.759> different<00:02:00.090> pieces<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.930> are

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
with a lot of different pieces that are

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.370 
with a lot of different pieces that are
even<00:02:01.710> size<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.820> having<00:02:03.060> evenly<00:02:03.689> sized<00:02:03.990> pieces

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
even size and having evenly sized pieces

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.560 
even size and having evenly sized pieces
of<00:02:04.680> Brussels<00:02:05.009> sprouts<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.460> really<00:02:05.729> key<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
of Brussels sprouts is really key to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.630 
of Brussels sprouts is really key to
getting<00:02:06.750> them<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.079> cook<00:02:07.259> properly<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.399> also

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
getting them to cook properly but also

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.309 
getting them to cook properly but also
when<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.060> open<00:02:09.119> them<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.899> create

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
when you open them like this you create

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.420 
when you open them like this you create
a<00:02:10.349> flat<00:02:10.649> surface

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
a flat surface

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.130 
a flat surface
and<00:02:11.549> you<00:02:11.670> can<00:02:11.819> see<00:02:12.060> when<00:02:12.299> I<00:02:12.330> layer<00:02:12.599> them<00:02:12.840> into

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
and you can see when I layer them into

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.110 
and you can see when I layer them into
my<00:02:13.260> roasting<00:02:13.739> pan<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.730> they<00:02:14.879> actually

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
my roasting pan that they actually

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.180 
my roasting pan that they actually
they're<00:02:15.930> going<00:02:16.049> to<00:02:16.110> get<00:02:16.200> exposed<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> heat

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
they're going to get exposed to the heat

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.410 
they're going to get exposed to the heat
directly<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.849> they're<00:02:17.970> gonna<00:02:18.060> caramelize

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
directly and they're gonna caramelize

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.170 
directly and they're gonna caramelize
really<00:02:18.989> nicely<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:20.040> if<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.310> were<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.459> hold<00:02:20.940> pan

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
really nicely so if I were to hold pan

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.149 
really nicely so if I were to hold pan
like<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.750> would<00:02:21.900> just<00:02:21.930> simply<00:02:22.470> cut<00:02:23.040> them

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
like this I would just simply cut them

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.920 
like this I would just simply cut them
all<00:02:23.340> into<00:02:23.489> quarters<00:02:23.909> throw<00:02:24.360> them<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.720> pan

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
all into quarters throw them in the pan

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.750 
all into quarters throw them in the pan
a<00:02:24.959> little<00:02:25.470> bit<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.650> olive<00:02:25.860> oil<00:02:26.129> maybe<00:02:26.489> some

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
a little bit of olive oil maybe some

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.110 
a little bit of olive oil maybe some
bacon<00:02:27.090> pieces<00:02:27.299> chopped<00:02:27.810> up<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.700> then<00:02:29.879> season

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
bacon pieces chopped up and then season

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.430 
bacon pieces chopped up and then season
them<00:02:30.360> with<00:02:30.390> salt<00:02:30.629> and<00:02:30.810> pepper<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.079> let<00:02:31.230> them

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
them with salt and pepper and let them

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.130 
them with salt and pepper and let them
roast<00:02:31.620> for<00:02:31.829> about<00:02:32.010> 20<00:02:32.540> 2025<00:02:33.540> minutes<00:02:33.840> at<00:02:33.959> 375

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
roast for about 20 2025 minutes at 375

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.380 
roast for about 20 2025 minutes at 375
now<00:02:34.920> if<00:02:35.549> you<00:02:35.670> don't<00:02:35.819> want<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.060> turn<00:02:36.150> on<00:02:36.269> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
now if you don't want to turn on the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.360 
now if you don't want to turn on the
oven<00:02:36.510> alternatively<00:02:37.409> you<00:02:37.680> can<00:02:37.829> cut<00:02:38.040> them<00:02:38.190> into

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
oven alternatively you can cut them into

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.160 
oven alternatively you can cut them into
the<00:02:38.549> same<00:02:38.819> shape<00:02:38.849> and<00:02:39.480> actually<00:02:39.840> do<00:02:39.989> what's

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
the same shape and actually do what's

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.380 
the same shape and actually do what's
called<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.470> pan<00:02:40.709> roast<00:02:41.099> so<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:41.879> would<00:02:42.060> just<00:02:42.209> get

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
called a pan roast so you would just get

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.210 
called a pan roast so you would just get
a<00:02:42.450> skillet<00:02:42.900> pan<00:02:43.079> nice<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.379> hot<00:02:43.590> put<00:02:44.040> some

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220

olive<00:02:44.549> oil<00:02:44.640> in<00:02:44.849> there<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.930> then<00:02:46.049> just<00:02:46.230> put

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
olive oil in there and then just put

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.839 
olive oil in there and then just put
these<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.530> here<00:02:46.680> same<00:02:47.010> way<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.459> toss<00:02:47.640> them

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
these in here same way and toss them

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.369 
these in here same way and toss them
around<00:02:47.940> for<00:02:48.329> 15<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.750> 20<00:02:48.810> minutes<00:02:49.049> until

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
around for 15 to 20 minutes until

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.559 
around for 15 to 20 minutes until
they're<00:02:49.680> nice<00:02:49.859> and<00:02:49.890> caramelized<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:51.390> it's

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
they're nice and caramelized and it's

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.539 
they're nice and caramelized and it's
often<00:02:51.840> nice<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.200> finish<00:02:52.500> off<00:02:52.709> Brussels

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
often nice to finish off Brussels

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.009 
often nice to finish off Brussels
sprouts<00:02:53.790> with<00:02:53.940> some<00:02:54.120> vinegar<00:02:54.299> maybe<00:02:54.810> some

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
sprouts with some vinegar maybe some

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.690 
sprouts with some vinegar maybe some
apple<00:02:55.349> cider<00:02:55.530> vinegar<00:02:55.680> some<00:02:56.340> lemon<00:02:56.400> juice

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
apple cider vinegar some lemon juice

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.729 
apple cider vinegar some lemon juice
something<00:02:57.150> like<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.629> so<00:02:58.109> that's<00:02:58.170> one<00:02:58.530> way

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
something like that so that's one way

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.920 
something like that so that's one way
you<00:02:59.069> can<00:02:59.220> cook<00:02:59.430> your<00:02:59.549> Brussels<00:02:59.940> sprout<00:03:00.180> now

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
you can cook your Brussels sprout now

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.110 
you can cook your Brussels sprout now
the<00:03:00.989> other<00:03:01.290> way<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.099> sneaky<00:03:02.670> way<00:03:02.790> and

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
the other way this is sneaky way and

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.149 
the other way this is sneaky way and
once<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.629> learned<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:03.989> method<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:04.950> was

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
once I learned this method this was

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.190 
once I learned this method this was
great<00:03:05.459> because<00:03:05.670> anytime<00:03:06.120> anybody<00:03:06.629> told<00:03:07.019> me

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
great because anytime anybody told me

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.869 
great because anytime anybody told me
they<00:03:07.319> didn't<00:03:07.560> like<00:03:07.650> Brussels<00:03:08.010> sprouts<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.489> knew

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
they didn't like Brussels sprouts I knew

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.089 
they didn't like Brussels sprouts I knew
I<00:03:08.909> could<00:03:09.239> convince<00:03:09.510> them<00:03:09.750> otherwise<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.890> what

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
I could convince them otherwise so what

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.979 
I could convince them otherwise so what
we're<00:03:11.250> gonna<00:03:11.340> do<00:03:11.640> is<00:03:11.849> actually<00:03:12.060> cut<00:03:12.540> them<00:03:12.750> into

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
we're gonna do is actually cut them into

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.830 
we're gonna do is actually cut them into
what's<00:03:13.319> called<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.829> Shifa<00:03:14.340> nod<00:03:14.519> so<00:03:15.329> that's<00:03:15.720> a

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
what's called a Shifa nod so that's a

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.839 
what's called a Shifa nod so that's a
French<00:03:16.169> term<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.739> actually<00:03:16.950> means<00:03:17.370> to

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
French term and it actually means to

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.270 
French term and it actually means to
make<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.239> into<00:03:18.540> ribbons<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:19.530> once<00:03:19.769> again<00:03:19.919> I

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
make it into ribbons so once again I

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.979 
make it into ribbons so once again I
just<00:03:20.609> cut<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.910> bottom<00:03:21.180> off<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:21.690> I've<00:03:21.810> taken

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
just cut the bottom off and I've taken

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.839 
just cut the bottom off and I've taken
the<00:03:22.169> outside<00:03:22.680> leaves<00:03:23.010> off<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.609> we're<00:03:23.819> just

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
the outside leaves off and we're just

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.940 
the outside leaves off and we're just
simply<00:03:24.269> going<00:03:24.419> to<00:03:24.510> cut<00:03:24.720> them<00:03:24.930> into<00:03:25.230> really

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
simply going to cut them into really

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.629 
simply going to cut them into really
thin<00:03:26.760> slices<00:03:27.590> so<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.769> if<00:03:29.010> we<00:03:29.160> were<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.459> pull

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
thin slices so that if we were to pull

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.270 
thin slices so that if we were to pull
them<00:03:29.790> apart<00:03:30.500> just<00:03:31.500> gonna<00:03:31.680> flip<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.099> that<00:03:32.250> way

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
them apart just gonna flip it that way

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.339 
them apart just gonna flip it that way
see<00:03:35.280> how<00:03:35.549> they<00:03:36.090> become<00:03:36.389> this<00:03:36.599> nice<00:03:36.930> little

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
see how they become this nice little

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.289 
see how they become this nice little
ship<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:38.010> odd<00:03:38.160> right<00:03:38.579> so<00:03:38.910> they<00:03:39.000> come<00:03:39.180> into

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
ship and odd right so they come into

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.059 
ship and odd right so they come into
little<00:03:39.569> pieces<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:40.500> it's<00:03:40.620> kind<00:03:40.859> of<00:03:40.919> like

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
little pieces so it's kind of like

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.610 
little pieces so it's kind of like
creating<00:03:41.579> a<00:03:41.730> Brussels<00:03:42.150> sprout<00:03:42.180> coleslaw<00:03:43.109> and

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
creating a Brussels sprout coleslaw and

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.259 
creating a Brussels sprout coleslaw and
as<00:03:43.889> I'm<00:03:44.069> cutting<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.549> realizing<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.030> probably

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
as I'm cutting and realizing it probably

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.670 
as I'm cutting and realizing it probably
makes<00:03:45.389> more<00:03:45.599> sense<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:46.019> cut<00:03:46.169> them<00:03:46.319> in<00:03:46.470> half

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
makes more sense to cut them in half

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.830 
makes more sense to cut them in half
first<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.370> then<00:03:47.910> do<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.120> shift<00:03:48.419> the<00:03:48.510> knot<00:03:48.660> so

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
first and then do the shift the knot so

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.849 
first and then do the shift the knot so
that<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.019> don't<00:03:49.169> have<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.410> root<00:03:49.590> piece

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
that you don't have the root piece

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.930 
that you don't have the root piece
keeping<00:03:50.250> them<00:03:50.400> attached<00:03:50.959> then<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.109> can<00:03:52.290> just

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
keeping them attached then you can just

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.309 
keeping them attached then you can just
cut<00:03:53.940> them<00:03:54.120> loose<00:03:54.269> like<00:03:54.510> this<00:03:54.540> they're<00:03:55.139> nice

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
cut them loose like this they're nice

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.920 
cut them loose like this they're nice
and<00:03:55.579> thin<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:57.090> beauty<00:03:57.329> of<00:03:57.359> this<00:03:57.569> is<00:03:57.780> they

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
and thin and the beauty of this is they

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.390 
and thin and the beauty of this is they
really<00:03:58.169> don't<00:03:58.290> take<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.590> lot<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.829> time<00:03:59.069> to<00:03:59.220> cook

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
really don't take a lot of time to cook

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.220 
really don't take a lot of time to cook
so<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.060> way<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.329> I<00:04:00.419> would<00:04:00.480> cook<00:04:00.720> these<00:04:00.930> is

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
so the way that I would cook these is

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.409 
so the way that I would cook these is
again<00:04:01.470> some<00:04:01.889> butter<00:04:02.129> some<00:04:02.519> olive<00:04:02.910> oil<00:04:03.060> some

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
again some butter some olive oil some

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.390 
again some butter some olive oil some
ghee<00:04:03.660> maybe<00:04:04.319> a<00:04:04.440> couple<00:04:04.680> of<00:04:04.799> pieces<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.220> bacon

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
ghee maybe a couple of pieces of bacon

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.159 
ghee maybe a couple of pieces of bacon
chopped<00:04:05.849> up<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.209> get<00:04:06.329> some<00:04:06.510> fat<00:04:06.720> in<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.930> pan

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
chopped up to get some fat in the pan

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.020 
chopped up to get some fat in the pan
get<00:04:07.799> that<00:04:07.980> nice<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.190> hot<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.699> then<00:04:08.879> I'm<00:04:08.970> just

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
get that nice and hot and then I'm just

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.150 
get that nice and hot and then I'm just
gonna<00:04:09.180> drop<00:04:09.540> these<00:04:09.810> right<00:04:10.139> in<00:04:10.319> there<00:04:10.530> maybe

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
gonna drop these right in there maybe

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.430 
gonna drop these right in there maybe
put<00:04:11.400> in<00:04:11.519> a<00:04:11.609> teaspoon<00:04:11.970> or<00:04:12.180> two<00:04:12.389> of<00:04:12.569> water<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:13.290> get

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
put in a teaspoon or two of water to get

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.470 
put in a teaspoon or two of water to get
some<00:04:13.650> steam<00:04:13.949> going<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.609> then<00:04:15.000> you<00:04:15.090> can<00:04:15.269> just

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
some steam going and then you can just

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.750 
some steam going and then you can just
toss<00:04:15.750> this<00:04:16.019> for<00:04:16.260> maybe<00:04:16.470> five<00:04:16.829> minutes<00:04:16.859> you'll

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
toss this for maybe five minutes you'll

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.580 
toss this for maybe five minutes you'll
notice<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.359> sprouts<00:04:18.690> will<00:04:19.049> really

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
notice that the sprouts will really

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.220 
notice that the sprouts will really
quickly

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
quickly

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.410 
quickly
it's<00:04:20.860> a<00:04:20.950> really<00:04:21.250> fast<00:04:21.460> way<00:04:21.670> to<00:04:21.700> cook<00:04:21.940> them<00:04:22.150> and

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
it's a really fast way to cook them and

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.730 
it's a really fast way to cook them and
it's<00:04:22.540> a<00:04:22.600> really<00:04:22.630> different<00:04:23.140> way<00:04:23.230> so<00:04:23.290> a<00:04:23.500> lot<00:04:23.650> of

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
it's a really different way so a lot of

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.990 
it's a really different way so a lot of
times<00:04:23.920> people<00:04:24.100> really<00:04:24.490> like<00:04:24.640> them<00:04:24.820> that<00:04:24.970> way

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
times people really like them that way

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.660 
times people really like them that way
so<00:04:25.810> that's<00:04:26.260> two<00:04:26.560> ideas<00:04:26.980> for<00:04:27.190> you<00:04:27.280> on<00:04:27.490> how<00:04:27.640> you

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
so that's two ideas for you on how you

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.310 
so that's two ideas for you on how you
can<00:04:27.910> cut<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.330> cook<00:04:28.480> some<00:04:28.690> Brussels<00:04:29.020> sprouts

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
can cut and cook some Brussels sprouts

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.220 
can cut and cook some Brussels sprouts
and<00:04:29.590> I<00:04:29.980> hope<00:04:30.190> you<00:04:30.520> take<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.360> chance<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:31.960> let<00:04:32.020> me
