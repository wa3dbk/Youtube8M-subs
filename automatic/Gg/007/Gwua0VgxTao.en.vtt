00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.160
 you can already say that is 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.560
 really a little sensation that 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.910
 worldwide vox is so far ahead and me 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.599
 I'll keep more youtube here 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.580
 to make jokes 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.450
 otherwise I already have shitstorm on the neck 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.200
 and they do not even have the first one 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.370
 curve reached 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.650
 I'm going to ride the car for a short time 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.720
 colleague dena you really have now 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.020
 the possibility here wok world champion too 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.850
 become 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.439
 you tomorrow until around 7:00 today had 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.730
 tells about your latest clip 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.890
 the camera has already cut 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.779
 back on hired on sharp 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.680
 actually you had to be tired 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.449
 but you probably have it now 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.619
 adrenaline kick or I have it the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.239
 slept all the time 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.980
 that's why it fits again now 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.960
 a push a minute after criminals 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.640
 Is it really just that you are so lucky 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.870
 far ahead since I ask again here 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.129
 would the kelly or have you 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.540
 really what you have decided 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.430
 you really have gathered together 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.960
 psychologically somehow the whole already 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.640
 times worked up you are the route 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.440
 have gone through mental what 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.879
 of course we have us 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.770
 got some tips and I believe it 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.270
 also counts a lot that we all know each other 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.500
 and all know well and all good 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.180
 harmonize with each other 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.100
 that actually already makes a lot of house 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.770
 In any case, so this way 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.719
 absolute team the residue only 0.84 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.799
 seconds and maybe we will see here 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.140
 the new wok world champion and then 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.430
 we can really make a small one 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.439
 sensations actually talk when 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.930
 the one medal will get those too 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.460
 had a good trend earlier 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.530
 only with the third best start since 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.850
 drove off and in the end it was the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.020
 second fastest time 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.970
 that is also likely to be 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.049
 with the weight a bit cheap 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.330
 after loading 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.400
 but that will have with the ddr 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.180
 of course a pretty tough nut too 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.250
 crack 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.880
 two tenth lead ghost so already 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.829
 tenth off the then three tenths 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.630
 since now we have almost the 13th again 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.479
 so even now the trends seem 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.649
 At this work of studios won here 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.380
 agree 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.939
 they are fast but what happens 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.250
 what happens in the key passages 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.570
 turn 9 because of the reactions rather 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.100
 Maybe they will not be so good 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.600
 be like a few experts like that 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.770
 already when that was done yes and now 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.270
 4000 send 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.579
 now a very short story 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.280
 it's probably about the silver gray 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.549
 and proudly proud and that's it 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.600
 they'll probably do that 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.880
 passed jan really big happiness that 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.470
 I sit back four leather titles 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.790
 so what's inside the medal 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.640
 maybe still in there anyway 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.700
 it will not be itself and the titles 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.250
 second place four behind the ddr 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.660
 work through this fabric reaches the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.510
 were really good at the moment 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.480
 on the way in the millenium area only 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.930
 behind these people here after all 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.000
 olympic champions in the ddr where can you have 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.280
 really say respect and that 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.890
 Processing in the video then certainly 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.660
 soon on youtube pity that we 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.920
 Do not see her at the after show party 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.470
 be because the need of her already 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.299
 cut back and send them see 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.069
 hands on a band press 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.019
 There were also completely gone 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.630
 Besides 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:54.690
 Of course that was just friction there 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.880
 but then being so smart again 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.280
 to come on the bowl that has 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.019
 saved a medal because only 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.269
 a team is the one above 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.450
 Austrians because they have the same 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.989
 chance here on the home track world champion 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.209
 to become 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.120
 he is short he wobbled forward because 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.900
 almost everything went okay I had 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.900
 the hand and on board 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.300
 it could stay with silver or it 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:30.910
 bronze will be a dress for every occasion 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:32.950
 sure he too takes his feet again 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.810
 up there a bit later 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.650
 trigger and he finds relatively early 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.450
 the template 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.390
 This is a decisive advantage to the 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.990
 first house you have always seen it 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.120
 still down this time difference this 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.220
 time difference colored green that is 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.320
 always guiding we observe the 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.780
 difference if he slows down or 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.000
 27 seconds faster has even 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.250
 got another title and 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.250
 georg hackl has watched closely
