of that server in that host name for
that<00:03:58.720> service<00:03:59.020> definition<00:04:00.900> okay<00:04:01.900> so<00:04:01.989> we're

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
that service definition okay so we're

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.270 
that service definition okay so we're
gonna<00:04:02.200> run<00:04:02.350> through<00:04:02.500> these<00:04:02.620> real<00:04:02.830> quick<00:04:03.040> some

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
gonna run through these real quick some

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.890 
gonna run through these real quick some
of<00:04:03.310> these<00:04:03.430> are<00:04:03.550> just<00:04:03.670> CPU<00:04:04.060> load<00:04:04.300> up<00:04:04.630> time

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
of these are just CPU load up time

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.370 
of these are just CPU load up time
memory<00:04:05.470> usage<00:04:06.209> disk<00:04:07.209> space<00:04:07.570> these<00:04:08.080> are<00:04:08.230> just

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
memory usage disk space these are just

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.110 
memory usage disk space these are just
some<00:04:08.470> of<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.650> good<00:04:08.860> general<00:04:09.220> baseline<00:04:09.850> ones

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
some of the good general baseline ones

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.540 
some of the good general baseline ones
to<00:04:10.269> have<00:04:10.560> once<00:04:11.560> we've<00:04:11.739> got<00:04:11.860> these<00:04:11.980> configured

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
to have once we've got these configured

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.130 
to have once we've got these configured
we'll<00:04:12.820> create<00:04:13.120> a<00:04:13.209> couple<00:04:13.630> of<00:04:13.780> custom

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
we'll create a couple of custom

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.570 
we'll create a couple of custom
definitions<00:04:14.680> that<00:04:14.950> will<00:04:15.100> monitor<00:04:15.459> the

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
definitions that will monitor the

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.009 
definitions that will monitor the
specific<00:04:16.030> services<00:04:16.480> that<00:04:16.630> we're<00:04:16.750> interested

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
specific services that we're interested

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.040 
specific services that we're interested
in<00:04:19.080> so<00:04:20.080> the<00:04:20.620> w3<00:04:21.190> SVC<00:04:21.760> is<00:04:21.910> an<00:04:22.000> i<00:04:22.150> is<00:04:22.450> service<00:04:22.870> we

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
in so the w3 SVC is an i is service we

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.290 
in so the w3 SVC is an i is service we
don't<00:04:23.260> have<00:04:23.470> an<00:04:23.590> IAS<00:04:23.950> server<00:04:24.220> in<00:04:24.520> this<00:04:24.640> mix<00:04:24.910> so

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
don't have an IAS server in this mix so

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.300 
don't have an IAS server in this mix so
we're<00:04:25.419> actually<00:04:25.539> going<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:25.900> change

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
we're actually going to change

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.760 
we're actually going to change
this<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:27.330> be<00:04:27.510> one<00:04:28.020> of<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.200> services<00:04:28.560> for<00:04:28.710> the

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
this to be one of the services for the

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.120 
this to be one of the services for the
DC<00:04:29.070> 2012<00:04:29.639> so<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.810> service<00:04:31.320> description<00:04:31.950> is

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
DC 2012 so the service description is

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.520 
DC 2012 so the service description is
where<00:04:32.310> we<00:04:32.400> put<00:04:32.580> that<00:04:32.730> display<00:04:33.450> name<00:04:33.690> which<00:04:34.410> in

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
where we put that display name which in

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.900 
where we put that display name which in
this<00:04:34.650> case<00:04:34.800> is<00:04:35.010> Active<00:04:35.310> Directory<00:04:35.400> domain

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
this case is Active Directory domain

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.120 
this case is Active Directory domain
services<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:36.720> then<00:04:37.380> in<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.530> check<00:04:37.770> command

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
services and then in the check command

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.530 
services and then in the check command
we're<00:04:38.370> actually<00:04:38.490> going<00:04:38.730> to<00:04:38.820> put<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.300> name<00:04:39.480> of

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
we're actually going to put the name of

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.790 
we're actually going to put the name of
the<00:04:39.690> actual<00:04:40.080> service<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:40.620> in<00:04:40.770> this<00:04:40.889> case<00:04:41.100> NTDs

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
the actual service so in this case NTDs

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.110 
the actual service so in this case NTDs
and<00:04:43.800> we're<00:04:44.160> gonna<00:04:44.250> skip<00:04:44.490> on<00:04:44.610> down<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:44.940> last

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
and we're gonna skip on down the last

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.480 
and we're gonna skip on down the last
one<00:04:45.330> here<00:04:45.540> which<00:04:45.720> is<00:04:45.750> Windows<00:04:46.260> Explorer<00:04:46.740> we're

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
one here which is Windows Explorer we're

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.530 
one here which is Windows Explorer we're
going<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:47.669> go<00:04:47.730> ahead<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:47.970> enable<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.360> for

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
going to go ahead and enable that for

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.860 
going to go ahead and enable that for
both<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:49.610> often<00:04:50.610> disable<00:04:51.000> this<00:04:51.150> in<00:04:51.360> production

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
both I often disable this in production

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.890 
both I often disable this in production
because<00:04:52.050> Explorer<00:04:52.680> will<00:04:52.950> provide<00:04:53.310> false

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
because Explorer will provide false

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.510 
because Explorer will provide false
warnings<00:04:54.900> if<00:04:55.350> a<00:04:55.500> server<00:04:55.800> is<00:04:55.919> restarted<00:04:56.430> and

warnings if a server is restarted and

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.030 
warnings if a server is restarted and
you<00:04:56.580> have<00:04:56.700> it<00:04:56.790> log<00:04:56.910> back<00:04:57.120> into<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.889> now<00:04:58.889> that

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
you have it log back into it now that

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.260 
you have it log back into it now that
we've<00:04:59.130> done<00:04:59.250> that<00:04:59.310> we're<00:04:59.669> gonna<00:04:59.729> copy<00:05:00.060> the

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
we've done that we're gonna copy the

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.909 
we've done that we're gonna copy the

service of definition that we created

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.350 
service of definition that we created
for<00:05:02.190> NTDs<00:05:02.639> twice<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:05.370> in<00:05:05.880> this<00:05:06.000> bottom<00:05:06.330> one

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
for NTDs twice and in this bottom one

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.110 
for NTDs twice and in this bottom one
we're<00:05:06.810> going<00:05:07.050> to<00:05:07.139> modify<00:05:07.470> this<00:05:07.620> for<00:05:08.040> PR<00:05:08.430> 2008

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
we're going to modify this for PR 2008

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.350 
we're going to modify this for PR 2008
for<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.110> print<00:05:10.770> spooler<00:05:10.919> service<00:05:14.180> so<00:05:15.180> again

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
for the print spooler service so again

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.879 
for the print spooler service so again
in<00:05:15.450> this<00:05:15.570> case<00:05:15.780> since<00:05:16.020> it's<00:05:16.200> only<00:05:16.440> going<00:05:16.740> to<00:05:16.800> be

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
in this case since it's only going to be

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.270 
in this case since it's only going to be
for<00:05:17.520> PR<00:05:18.360> 2008<00:05:18.960> we're<00:05:19.500> only<00:05:19.680> going<00:05:19.919> to<00:05:20.010> put<00:05:20.190> the

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
for PR 2008 we're only going to put the

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.180 
for PR 2008 we're only going to put the
host<00:05:20.460> name<00:05:20.639> for<00:05:20.669> PR<00:05:21.000> 2008<00:05:21.600> in<00:05:21.720> there<00:05:25.190> and

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
host name for PR 2008 in there and

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.700 
host name for PR 2008 in there and
finally<00:05:26.669> we<00:05:26.910> have<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.360> DNS<00:05:27.780> server<00:05:27.990> service

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
finally we have the DNS server service

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.279 
finally we have the DNS server service
so<00:05:29.580> we're<00:05:30.330> going<00:05:30.479> to<00:05:30.570> go<00:05:30.690> ahead<00:05:30.780> and<00:05:31.050> change

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
so we're going to go ahead and change

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.860 
so we're going to go ahead and change
that<00:05:31.740> check<00:05:32.370> command<00:05:32.700> to<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.150> service<00:05:33.720> named

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
that check command to the service named

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.770 
that check command to the service named
DNS<00:05:34.229> and<00:05:35.190> then<00:05:35.370> in<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.760> service<00:05:36.510> description

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
DNS and then in the service description

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.050 
DNS and then in the service description
will<00:05:37.620> place<00:05:37.890> DNS<00:05:38.460> server<00:05:40.160> go<00:05:41.160> ahead<00:05:41.400> and<00:05:41.640> save

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
will place DNS server go ahead and save

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.630 
will place DNS server go ahead and save
and<00:05:42.330> quit<00:05:42.830> now<00:05:43.830> we<00:05:43.890> need<00:05:44.070> to<00:05:44.190> go<00:05:44.310> ahead<00:05:44.430> and

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
and quit now we need to go ahead and

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.150 
and quit now we need to go ahead and
modify<00:05:44.940> that<00:05:45.360> Nagios<00:05:45.840> CFG<00:05:46.560> file<00:05:46.830> and

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
modify that Nagios CFG file and

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:54.050 
modify that Nagios CFG file and
uncomment<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.600> path<00:05:48.810> to<00:05:49.169> the<00:05:49.260> windows<00:05:49.530> CFG<00:05:53.060> ok

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
uncomment the path to the windows CFG ok

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.159 
uncomment the path to the windows CFG ok
delete<00:05:54.300> the<00:05:54.390> comment<00:05:54.780> save<00:05:55.740> and<00:05:56.539> finally<00:05:57.539> we

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
delete the comment save and finally we

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.350 
delete the comment save and finally we
need<00:05:58.320> to<00:05:58.380> restart<00:05:58.770> the<00:05:59.190> Nagios<00:05:59.430> service<00:06:00.090> so

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
need to restart the Nagios service so
