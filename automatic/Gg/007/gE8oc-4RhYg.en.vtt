hi guys today I will be comparing the
drag<00:00:03.959> or<00:00:04.200> longswords<00:00:04.950> with<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.370> noxious

they<00:00:10.320> are<00:00:10.500> both<00:00:10.679> tr90<00:00:11.550> slash<00:00:12.269> weapons<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:12.900> it

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
they are both tr90 slash weapons so it

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.650 
they are both tr90 slash weapons so it
should<00:00:13.170> be<00:00:13.320> an<00:00:13.410> interesting<00:00:13.679> comparison

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
should be an interesting comparison

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.960 
should be an interesting comparison
ok<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:15.719> speed<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.560> clips<00:00:16.800> up<00:00:17.010> here<00:00:17.279> but<00:00:17.730> as<00:00:17.940> you

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
ok so speed the clips up here but as you

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.849 
ok so speed the clips up here but as you
can<00:00:18.210> see<00:00:18.449> I'm<00:00:18.630> using<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.050> dry<00:00:19.289> Gore's<00:00:19.560> first

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859

to<00:00:31.769> fast<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.790> that's<00:00:32.969> why<00:00:33.180> banners<00:00:33.809> are

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
to fast so that's why banners are

to fast so that's why banners are
spawning<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.620> about<00:00:34.950> 10<00:00:35.130> seconds<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:36.270> does

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
spawning in about 10 seconds this does

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.860 
spawning in about 10 seconds this does
cost<00:00:36.809> 25<00:00:37.260> 250<00:00:38.190> K<00:00:38.370> an<00:00:38.610> hour<00:00:38.790> rather<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.750> is

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
cost 25 250 K an hour rather but it is

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.450 
cost 25 250 K an hour rather but it is
definitely<00:00:40.230> worth<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.770> you're<00:00:40.950> looking<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
definitely worth it if you're looking to

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.720 
definitely worth it if you're looking to
maximize<00:00:41.879> your<00:00:42.390> profit<00:00:42.870> per<00:00:43.050> hour<00:00:43.520> now<00:00:44.520> use

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the scythe secondly as you can see

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.310 
the scythe secondly as you can see
keeping<00:00:47.610> everything<00:00:48.000> else<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.450> same<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:49.110> make

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
keeping everything else the same to make

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.760 
keeping everything else the same to make
sure<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> fair<00:00:50.640> comparison<00:00:51.230> as<00:00:52.230> for<00:00:52.620> my

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
sure it is a fair comparison as for my

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.920 
sure it is a fair comparison as for my
loot<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.340> got<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:54.140> Banda's<00:00:55.140> hilt<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:56.930> effigy

loot I got a Banda's hilt and a effigy

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.200 
loot I got a Banda's hilt and a effigy
but<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.559> wouldn't<00:00:58.920> expect<00:00:59.100> together<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.879> 20

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
but I wouldn't expect together and 20

but I wouldn't expect together and 20
kills<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.719> was<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.140> pure<00:01:01.469> luck<00:01:02.960> anyway<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
kills that was just pure luck anyway the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.380 
kills that was just pure luck anyway the

results are on screen now and what do
you<00:01:06.450> know<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.780> average<00:01:07.140> number<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.590> hits<00:01:07.830> was

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
you know the average number of hits was

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.580 
you know the average number of hits was
actually<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> same<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.270> each<00:01:09.299> beer<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.439> mine

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
actually the same for each beer and mine

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.080 
actually the same for each beer and mine
here<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.070> was<00:01:11.250> counting<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.700> number<00:01:11.970> of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
here that I was counting the number of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.410 
here that I was counting the number of
hits<00:01:12.299> from<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> main<00:01:12.990> hand<00:01:13.350> only<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.420> multiply

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
hits from the main hand only so multiply

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.539 
hits from the main hand only so multiply
by<00:01:15.600> 2<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.990> get<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.140> actual<00:01:16.530> number<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.979> hits<00:01:17.189> by

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
by 2 to get the actual number of hits by

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.300 
by 2 to get the actual number of hits by
the<00:01:17.610> dry<00:01:17.880> gauze<00:01:18.439> however<00:01:19.439> one<00:01:19.710> must<00:01:19.920> remember

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the dry gauze however one must remember

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.520 
the dry gauze however one must remember
the<00:01:20.640> long<00:01:20.850> swords<00:01:21.299> are<00:01:21.450> faster<00:01:21.840> by<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.170> Tec

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
the long swords are faster by one Tec

the long swords are faster by one Tec
each<00:01:23.369> hand<00:01:23.759> hits<00:01:24.000> once<00:01:24.240> every<00:01:24.509> 3<00:01:24.720> seconds<00:01:25.140> for

the long swords and the scythe hits only
once<00:01:27.570> every<00:01:27.750> 3.6<00:01:28.500> seconds<00:01:28.829> taking<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:30.000> into

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
once every 3.6 seconds taking this into

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.999 
once every 3.6 seconds taking this into
account<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.079> Dragons<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.619> clearly

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
account we see the Dragons a clearly

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
account we see the Dragons a clearly
faster<00:01:32.220> at<00:01:32.549> killing<00:01:32.729> ban<00:01:32.939> dose<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:34.200> I'm<00:01:34.290> not

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
faster at killing ban dose and I'm not

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.200 
faster at killing ban dose and I'm not
sure<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:35.009> fully<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.460> current<00:01:35.850> test<00:01:36.030> but

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
sure this is a fully a current test but

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.090 
sure this is a fully a current test but
it<00:01:36.299> gives<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> basic<00:01:36.900> idea<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.470> anyone<00:01:37.860> gets

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
it gives the basic idea if anyone gets

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.740 
it gives the basic idea if anyone gets
different<00:01:38.369> results<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.060> their<00:01:39.240> own<00:01:39.360> testing

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
different results in their own testing

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.260 
different results in their own testing
let<00:01:39.900> me<00:01:40.020> know<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.619> stands<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.130> reason

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
let me know but it stands to reason

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.700 
let me know but it stands to reason
because<00:01:42.270> faster<00:01:42.689> weapons<00:01:42.990> would<00:01:43.140> be<00:01:43.200> bitter

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
because faster weapons would be bitter

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.969 
because faster weapons would be bitter
as<00:01:44.130> list<00:01:44.430> damage<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.299> wasted<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.409> your

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
as list damage is wasted and your

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.550 
as list damage is wasted and your
winning<00:01:47.310> means<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> low<00:01:48.180> hit<00:01:48.450> or<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> miss

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
winning means that a low hit or a miss

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.319 
winning means that a low hit or a miss
counts<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.070> less<00:01:50.280> due<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> faster<00:01:51.090> speed

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
counts for less due to the faster speed

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.270
