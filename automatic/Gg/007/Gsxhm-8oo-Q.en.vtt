a<00:02:20.420> pinch<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.560> turmeric<00:02:22.250> turmeric<00:02:22.820> so<00:02:23.180> quite<00:02:23.510> a

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
a pinch of turmeric turmeric so quite a

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.930 
a pinch of turmeric turmeric so quite a
yellow<00:02:24.160> spice<00:02:25.160> and

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
yellow spice and

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.300 
yellow spice and
it's<00:02:26.690> almost<00:02:26.930> like<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.260> cheats<00:02:27.650> way<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:27.980> making

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
it's almost like a cheats way of making

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.370 
it's almost like a cheats way of making
some<00:02:28.490> nice<00:02:28.670> golden<00:02:30.550> potatoes<00:02:31.550> so<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:33.080> little

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
some nice golden potatoes so that little

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.170 
some nice golden potatoes so that little
bit<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.620> color<00:02:33.860> really<00:02:34.190> helps<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.880> ender

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
bit of color really helps in the ender

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.630 
bit of color really helps in the ender
and<00:02:35.500> we're<00:02:36.500> going<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.710> give<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.430> whole<00:02:37.610> thing

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
and we're going to give the whole thing

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.030 
and we're going to give the whole thing
a<00:02:37.970> nice<00:02:38.150> toss<00:02:38.450> certainly<00:02:39.410> it's<00:02:39.560> nice<00:02:39.740> even

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
a nice toss certainly it's nice even

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.100 
a nice toss certainly it's nice even
coating<00:02:40.250> I'm<00:02:40.820> gonna<00:02:41.000> stick<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.360> in<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:42.080> oven

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
coating I'm gonna stick it in the oven

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.910 
coating I'm gonna stick it in the oven
with<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.250> lamb<00:02:44.290> on<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.380> different<00:02:45.770> wreck

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
with the lamb on a different wreck

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.460 
with the lamb on a different wreck
obviously<00:02:46.490> but<00:02:47.450> this<00:02:47.780> should<00:02:48.050> be<00:02:48.170> in<00:02:48.290> there

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
obviously but this should be in there

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.690 
obviously but this should be in there
for<00:02:48.770> about<00:02:48.860> an<00:02:49.220> hour<00:02:49.490> to<00:02:49.790> get<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.570> nice<00:02:50.750> crispy

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
for about an hour to get the nice crispy

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.500 
for about an hour to get the nice crispy
potatoes<00:02:53.860> once<00:02:54.860> again<00:02:55.040> I<00:02:55.370> roast<00:02:55.730> doesn't

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
potatoes once again I roast doesn't

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.050 
potatoes once again I roast doesn't
complete<00:02:56.870> if<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:57.320> don't<00:02:57.500> have<00:02:57.770> some<00:02:58.730> roast

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
complete if you don't have some roast

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.180 
complete if you don't have some roast
pumpkin<00:02:59.450> so<00:03:00.350> this<00:03:00.470> goes<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:00.830> a<00:03:00.920> little<00:03:01.100> bit

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
pumpkin so this goes in a little bit

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.030 
pumpkin so this goes in a little bit
later<00:03:01.550> and<00:03:01.910> then<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.050> potatoes<00:03:03.500> because<00:03:03.770> it

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
later and then the potatoes because it

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.100 
later and then the potatoes because it
takes<00:03:04.250> less<00:03:04.520> time<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.760> cook<00:03:04.880> so<00:03:05.630> about<00:03:05.780> time<00:03:05.960> at

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
takes less time to cook so about time at

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.430 
takes less time to cook so about time at
some<00:03:06.520> tournaments<00:03:07.520> later<00:03:07.730> than<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.440> potatoes

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
some tournaments later than the potatoes

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.460 
some tournaments later than the potatoes
you<00:03:09.530> can<00:03:09.560> pull<00:03:09.800> them<00:03:09.860> out<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.100> then<00:03:10.700> put<00:03:10.730> on

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
you can pull them out and then put on

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.170 
you can pull them out and then put on
our<00:03:12.470> pumpkin<00:03:13.070> that<00:03:13.190> we've<00:03:13.340> cut<00:03:13.580> into<00:03:13.850> quite

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
our pumpkin that we've cut into quite

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.850 
our pumpkin that we've cut into quite
large<00:03:14.390> chunks<00:03:14.810> don't<00:03:15.230> want<00:03:15.350> to<00:03:15.410> make<00:03:15.500> them<00:03:15.680> too

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
large chunks don't want to make them too

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.700 
large chunks don't want to make them too
small<00:03:16.190> because<00:03:16.340> your<00:03:17.240> pumpkin<00:03:17.720> will<00:03:17.960> likely

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
small because your pumpkin will likely

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.250 
small because your pumpkin will likely
disintegrate<00:03:19.580> their<00:03:19.850> firm<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.390> few<00:03:20.870> pieces<00:03:21.080> are

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
disintegrate their firm a few pieces are

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.100 
disintegrate their firm a few pieces are
too<00:03:21.380> small<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:21.920> still<00:03:22.160> want<00:03:22.340> her<00:03:23.270> some

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
too small so you still want her some

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.380 
too small so you still want her some
pumpkin<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.950> hold<00:03:25.130> its<00:03:25.280> shape<00:03:25.310> so<00:03:26.060> I'll<00:03:26.180> try

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
pumpkin to hold its shape so I'll try

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.510 
pumpkin to hold its shape so I'll try
and<00:03:26.480> get<00:03:26.600> out<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:27.560> these<00:03:27.830> go<00:03:28.010> on<00:03:28.190> for<00:03:28.430> the

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
and get out so these go on for the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.660 
and get out so these go on for the
remaining<00:03:29.170> 40<00:03:30.170> minutes<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.620> should<00:03:31.370> be<00:03:31.489> nice

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
remaining 40 minutes and should be nice

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.560 
remaining 40 minutes and should be nice
nice<00:03:32.480> in<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.989> tasty<00:03:33.709> when<00:03:33.980> they<00:03:34.070> come<00:03:34.250> out<00:03:34.570> if

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.920 
you feel like it you can also add a
pinch<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.959> nutmeg<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.970> pumpkin<00:03:41.390> nutmeg

sort<00:04:53.180> this<00:04:54.180> is<00:04:54.330> it's<00:04:54.570> fairly<00:04:54.810> basic<00:04:55.020> it's<00:04:55.560> got

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160

a quite a bit of ingredients but it's

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.140 
a quite a bit of ingredients but it's

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
getting nice and turns brown we're going

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.170 
getting nice and turns brown we're going
to<00:05:08.430> add<00:05:08.490> stick<00:05:08.790> and<00:05:09.170> about<00:05:10.170> 50<00:05:11.160> grams<00:05:11.970> of

stock off and the roast I've been
talking<00:05:43.560> about<00:05:43.650> now<00:05:44.610> it's<00:05:44.940> important<00:05:45.390> to<00:05:45.450> skim

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
talking about now it's important to skim

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.950 
talking about now it's important to skim
most<00:05:46.230> of<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.980> fat<00:05:47.420> you'll<00:05:48.420> find<00:05:48.750> at<00:05:48.870> the

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
most of the fat you'll find at the

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.500 
most of the fat you'll find at the
juices<00:05:49.410> from<00:05:50.160> the<00:05:50.220> roast<00:05:50.520> there<00:05:50.910> will<00:05:51.030> be<00:05:51.180> two

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
juices from the roast there will be two

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.980 
juices from the roast there will be two
distinct<00:05:52.080> layers<00:05:52.290> and<00:05:52.980> the<00:05:53.040> top<00:05:53.310> layers<00:05:53.580> the

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
distinct layers and the top layers the

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.390 
distinct layers and the top layers the
oils<00:05:54.990> and<00:05:55.410> the<00:05:55.590> fats<00:05:55.800> that<00:05:55.890> we<00:05:56.040> don't<00:05:56.250> really

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
oils and the fats that we don't really

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.240 
oils and the fats that we don't really
want<00:05:56.700> so<00:05:56.880> we<00:05:56.970> can<00:05:57.090> skim<00:05:57.360> some<00:05:57.600> of<00:05:57.720> that<00:05:57.840> off

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
want so we can skim some of that off

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.520 
want so we can skim some of that off
with<00:05:59.250> a<00:05:59.280> spoon<00:05:59.610> but<00:06:00.300> leave<00:06:00.660> about<00:06:01.470> one

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
with a spoon but leave about one

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.190 
with a spoon but leave about one
teaspoon<00:06:01.980> in<00:06:02.400> there<00:06:02.480> so<00:06:03.480> we<00:06:03.570> can<00:06:03.660> tip<00:06:03.930> the

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
teaspoon in there so we can tip the

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.840 
teaspoon in there so we can tip the
remaining<00:06:04.950> juices<00:06:05.400> and<00:06:05.970> and<00:06:07.340> you'll<00:06:08.340> see<00:06:08.640> that

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
remaining juices and and you'll see that

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.730 
remaining juices and and you'll see that
will<00:06:09.030> start<00:06:09.830> submarine<00:06:10.830> away<00:06:11.190> and<00:06:11.550> reducing

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
will start submarine away and reducing

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.920 
will start submarine away and reducing
for<00:06:13.740> a<00:06:13.770> bit<00:06:14.370> of<00:06:14.490> added<00:06:14.730> sweetness<00:06:15.300> we<00:06:15.720> can

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
for a bit of added sweetness we can

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.580 
for a bit of added sweetness we can
stick<00:06:16.260> and<00:06:16.530> fuel<00:06:17.490> eggs<00:06:17.760> of<00:06:18.030> balsamic<00:06:19.020> vinegar

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
stick and fuel eggs of balsamic vinegar

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.290 
stick and fuel eggs of balsamic vinegar
if<00:06:20.430> you<00:06:20.550> don't<00:06:20.700> have<00:06:20.850> it<00:06:20.880> don't<00:06:21.060> worry<00:06:21.270> about

it<00:06:21.570> you<00:06:22.110> can<00:06:22.260> also<00:06:22.410> stick<00:06:22.770> in<00:06:22.920> some<00:06:23.190> sugar<00:06:23.750> but

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
it you can also stick in some sugar but

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.260 
it you can also stick in some sugar but
this<00:06:25.110> has<00:06:25.830> got<00:06:26.100> a<00:06:26.130> very<00:06:26.520> distinct<00:06:26.970> flavor

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
this has got a very distinct flavor

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.300 
this has got a very distinct flavor
that's<00:06:27.450> quite<00:06:27.840> nice<00:06:28.050> so<00:06:28.440> if<00:06:28.710> you<00:06:28.890> can<00:06:29.070> get<00:06:29.220> your

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
that's quite nice so if you can get your

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.240 
that's quite nice so if you can get your
