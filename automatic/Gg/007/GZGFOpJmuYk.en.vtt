00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.809
 I explain today how pattern 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.910
 is knitted 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.200
 I started here ever have 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.510
 already some holes worked holes in 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.310
 working the knitting is something 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.810
 very simple that is easy with 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.060
 made a wish for I show 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.210
 go back and knit right away 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.940
 Beginners often even happen 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.610
 but you can only provide the problem 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.370
 would work purely holes would be the one 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.460
 then would have done more to conclude 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.030
 number therefore you have to evenly with 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.739
 Stretch the holes together 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.800
 There are two different types of 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.640
 if i want that line at 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.579
 The holes look like that then frighten 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.440
 I stitch two together 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.700
 that means I would be so normal 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.630
 stretch but instead I knit 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.750
 at the same time have two stitches from that 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.979
 I less than a row in the row 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.410
 and now I can make a hole 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.830
 Of course, just the rides on 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:20.420
 the needle and that's all and then 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.420
 I continue 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.110
 until the next place with a hole 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.750
 I made that comes first land 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.119
 and then the series with the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:39.079
 glued together meshes again 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.819
 envelope then I have a stitch off 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.119
 I would rather not meet 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:48.009
 but I have only knit the 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:51.170
 Next mesh and pry this mesh 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.890
 over the stretched so I have neither 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.890
 from two times already made one and have 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:03.020
 then exactly the same mesh is on 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:07.099
 At the beginning, I simply resign each one 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:11.780
 weapon and also scare that is the 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:19.400
 first envelope stretch on this 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:22.510
 envelope his his mesh are here 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.510
 is my next envelope 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.260
 and so little on my new holes
