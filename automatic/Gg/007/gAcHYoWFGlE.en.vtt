00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
will stop doing that I think what

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.300 
will stop doing that I think what
happened<00:02:03.899> was<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.560> 18

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
happened was that 18

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.249 
happened was that 18
t<00:02:05.490> realize<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.060> was<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.420> happen<00:02:06.840> they

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
t realize this was going to happen they

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.199 
t realize this was going to happen they
started<00:02:07.649> going<00:02:08.069> after<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.610> unlimited<00:02:08.880> data

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
started going after the unlimited data

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.210 
started going after the unlimited data
users<00:02:09.720> trying<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.349> get<00:02:10.500> them<00:02:10.709> off<00:02:10.950> their

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
users trying to get them off their

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.910 
users trying to get them off their
unlimited<00:02:11.520> data<00:02:11.760> plans<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:13.470> think<00:02:13.709> that's

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
unlimited data plans and I think that's

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.770 
unlimited data plans and I think that's
where<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.400> whole<00:02:14.459> thing<00:02:14.849> comes<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.630> knew

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
where this whole thing comes in I knew

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.150 
where this whole thing comes in I knew
this<00:02:15.870> was<00:02:16.050> going<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.230> be<00:02:16.319> happening<00:02:16.560> i<00:02:16.890> use<00:02:17.130> a

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
this was going to be happening i use a

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.040 
this was going to be happening i use a
lot<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.459> data<00:02:17.730> whenever<00:02:18.060> I'm<00:02:18.450> not<00:02:18.690> working<00:02:18.959> on

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
lot of data whenever I'm not working on

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.650 
lot of data whenever I'm not working on
the<00:02:19.170> railroad<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.739> my<00:02:20.670> account<00:02:21.030> was<00:02:21.180> targeted

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
the railroad and my account was targeted

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.050 
the railroad and my account was targeted
and<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:22.500> think<00:02:22.709> that's<00:02:22.920> why<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.250> happened<00:02:23.880> and

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
and I think that's why this happened and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.800 
and I think that's why this happened and
I'm<00:02:24.989> going<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.230> do<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.890> best<00:02:26.069> I<00:02:26.310> can<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:27.209> to

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
I'm going to do the best I can to to

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.479 
I'm going to do the best I can to to
write<00:02:28.050> this<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.590> then<00:02:29.130> I'm<00:02:29.220> going<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.400> be

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
write this and then I'm going to be

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.120 
write this and then I'm going to be
