00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.990
 We speak gudes beauty that the Lord is 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.699
 welcome to another video was 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.260
 I know from bringing you a video one 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.269
 bit different here on the middle channel 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.490
 that an analysis is worth it or not 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.949
 play crossfire pirate like example I 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.380
 I'm playing crossfire blaze here 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.960
 show you if it really pays off 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.079
 you spend your valuable time playing 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.500
 these pirate beauty crossfire is on 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.020
 Old ping pong ping the hand of the sky 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.520
 without even talking what you get you know already 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.899
 opine is around 288 to 300 faces 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.230
 This is because I'm using a program 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.390
 who promises in quotes to reduce the fucking 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.500
 the speed of light and not the fucking 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.329
 ping and type does not work too much i guess 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.730
 that relatively speaking thus not 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.880
 works both in pirate crossfire 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.220
 That's when you could see the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.000
 gave a pass on the ping was very 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.220
 tall guy and old do not know if a part in 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.259
 time that the group was not here but in ps 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.939
 I do not know why in the video 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.520
 He was falling fps 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.340
 Finally each item is our Hackmann 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.750
 very hacked sometimes people do not 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.799
 Are you aware of what I'm talking about, man. 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.299
 very fast 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.659
 all entering room has type 90% of is 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.549
 of players are hacker guys a type to 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.740
 Most are old hackers 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.560
 I think it went black spent its time 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.950
 in a crossfire that only has face hack is 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.409
 The better you play there the crossfire l 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.299
 I'll tell you, I 'm not criticizing the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.220
 game I 'm not saying it's not for you 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.090
 play and neither do you stop playing I game 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.740
 sometimes changes a room there if hackers 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.259
 and the galley plays 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.479
 but still the ping messes up a lot 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.610
 in gameplay, it disturbs 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.159
 very much was very much even if you 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.160
 You want to download the cross fireblade will fall 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.179
 in the description link face but think well 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.150
 before playing 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.860
 ok the time you'll be missing out on 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.670
 linux to English and can bring 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.860
 crossfire it to any other 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.900
 original aspect because it is very fast 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.630
 you will get very nervous ping no 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.280
 It's going to go down from 200 they stayed, and the guys 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.640
 who plays there has a pib 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.400
 relatively low compared to its 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.260
 I think the guy who cited you because of you. 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.600
 have everything for free enter me to play 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.190
 I like it or I want to have some fun 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.390
 I want to use a life of it because I do not have 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.580
 purchase conditions 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.990
 it's okay you're not spending a lot 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.660
 your time will only be kidding 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.640
 amusing without commitment I think 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.709
 worth you have some fun 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.900
 there but to the point that you want to spend 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.390
 all the time of your day playing a group 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.440
 of pirates I do not think it pays much 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:02.760
 one that if it will not play well you will not 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.730
 will have a good fred your hair stays 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.650
 Too bad so I guess it does not make sense 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.050
 Unless you want to use here is a 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.209
 thing that I find very pink rubbish I do not 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.430
 I recommend you use spoil your game and 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.190
 the game leaves everybody the guy I think 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.299
 It does not pay, you understand. 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.340
 point of view 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.769
 in this new channel frame is worth or 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.769
 It's not worth playing pirate games, I'm going 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.790
 bring the majority of the pirate game to 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.580
 really tell you whether it's worth it 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.310
 play before you guys before you 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.760
 get down and fuck you do not like 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.040
 understood I was told that I had face virus 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.410
 I do not know if it has viruses to facilitate crossfire 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.269
 because I did not see one that they use 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.850
 virus detectors so I do not know if it has 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.410
 virus and it seems to me that it does not have 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.180
 two thousand people playing if they had 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.769
 something that would harm the pc I 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.600
 I think she had already claimed here 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.570
 beauty, I'll show you guys a little bit 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.640
 here my chest and I think it was in that 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.630
 bar or even if I'm not mistaken face 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:07.440
 It was here that I was earning what I 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:12.000
 I got someone the fucking gun that 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.730
 was collecting and I won the ak-47 and 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.850
 royal and unintentionally I won not 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.390
 I wanted to win but I finally got the zp 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.910
 there in the case bpp are infinite face 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.900
 but the title is that the expense updates of 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.090
 return 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.580
 I think I took him some three boxes 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.260
 while the leterrier dogs won 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.510
 so this is it if you liked the video 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.980
 It leaves a liquidity a favorite that was the 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.270
 my opinion I am not criticizing the 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.110
 I 'm not talking to you and I'm not talking to you. 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.180
 should play 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.919
 play who wants to pass anger who 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.840
 If you want, if you want, this is mine. 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.699
 saying if you liked the video but one 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.530
 I 'll tell you what I told you. 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.240
 It is not written on the channel that 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.030
 This will help a lot of guys coming 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.260
 In English, I apologize a thousand pardons in 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.639
 enrolled ones that I am 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.490
 taking too long to post videos but I 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.510
 I know she thinks she relaxes. 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:03.150

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.020
