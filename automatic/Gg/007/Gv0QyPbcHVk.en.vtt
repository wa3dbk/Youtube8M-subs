black<00:00:18.390> ops<00:00:18.900> 2<00:00:19.260> releases<00:00:19.980> its<00:00:20.130> very<00:00:20.400> first<00:00:20.640> map

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
black ops 2 releases its very first map

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.150 
black ops 2 releases its very first map
pack<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.020> map<00:00:22.199> pack<00:00:22.439> what<00:00:22.680> comes<00:00:22.949> with

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
pack and in the map pack what comes with

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.980 
pack and in the map pack what comes with
it<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:24.269> evidence<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.689> basically

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
it and the evidence that basically

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.080 
it and the evidence that basically
supports<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.769> whole<00:00:26.099> opinion<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.760> video

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
supports the whole opinion in this video

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.480 
supports the whole opinion in this video
so<00:00:27.630> first<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.050> all<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:28.859> want<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.220> bring<00:00:29.369> up

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
so first of all I just want to bring up

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.730 
so first of all I just want to bring up
the<00:00:29.699> fact<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.060> none<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.109> concrete

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
the fact that none of this is concrete

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.799 
the fact that none of this is concrete
evidence<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.669> could<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:33.030> wrong<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.510> could

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
evidence and I could be wrong I could

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.229 
evidence and I could be wrong I could
easily<00:00:33.899> be<00:00:34.170> wrong<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.550> proof<00:00:35.910> or

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
easily be wrong but have I have proof or

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.060 
easily be wrong but have I have proof or
what<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.480> think<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.809> proof<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.079> could<00:00:37.920> be

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
what I think is proof that could be

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.100 
what I think is proof that could be
construed<00:00:38.370> as<00:00:38.700> evidence<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.450> hopefully<00:00:39.690> I'm

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
construed as evidence so hopefully I'm

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.479 
construed as evidence so hopefully I'm
right<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.500> hopefully<00:00:40.860> dishonest

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
right and hopefully dishonest

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.400 
right and hopefully dishonest
information<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:41.969> accurate<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.260> start

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
information is accurate so to start

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.830 
information is accurate so to start
things<00:00:43.680> off<00:00:43.860> there<00:00:44.399> will<00:00:44.550> be<00:00:44.579> four<00:00:45.000> maps<00:00:45.239> just

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
things off there will be four maps just

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.869 
things off there will be four maps just
as<00:00:45.989> every<00:00:46.260> other<00:00:46.289> typical<00:00:46.710> treyarch<00:00:47.399> fashion

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
as every other typical treyarch fashion

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.729 
as every other typical treyarch fashion
there<00:00:48.300> was<00:00:48.450> released<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.930> maps<00:00:49.170> 3

the<00:00:52.680> video<00:00:52.920> about<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> minute<00:00:53.610> later<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
the video about a minute later in the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.939 
the video about a minute later in the
video<00:00:54.390> I'll<00:00:54.690> show<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.899> proof<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.530> there

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
video I'll show you proof that there

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.520 
video I'll show you proof that there
will<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.219> zombies<00:00:56.610> map<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.059> prove<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
will be a zombies map and prove that the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.770 
will be a zombies map and prove that the
map<00:00:58.739> they<00:00:59.730> it<00:01:00.000> will<00:01:00.149> come<00:01:00.300> out<00:01:00.449> which<00:01:00.660> is

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
map they it will come out which is

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
februari 12 I'm pretty certain it could

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.399 
februari 12 I'm pretty certain it could
be<00:01:02.789> marched<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.660> because<00:01:03.930> I'm<00:01:04.049> black<00:01:04.170> ops

keep things fresh because the number one

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.630 
keep things fresh because the number one
concern<00:01:25.020> people<00:01:25.259> had<00:01:25.439> about<00:01:25.560> black<00:01:25.740> ops<00:01:25.920> 1<00:01:26.100> was

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
concern people had about black ops 1 was

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.370 
concern people had about black ops 1 was
it<00:01:26.790> was<00:01:26.880> still<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.450> was<00:01:27.540> boring<00:01:28.049> there's<00:01:28.259> not

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
it was still it was boring there's not

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.020 
it was still it was boring there's not
enough<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.650> things<00:01:28.860> keep<00:01:29.040> interactive<00:01:29.610> well

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
enough to things keep interactive well

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.550 
enough to things keep interactive well
I'm<00:01:30.360> guessing<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:30.960> when<00:01:31.200> they<00:01:31.290> went<00:01:31.470> into

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
I'm guessing that when they went into

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.020 
I'm guessing that when they went into
black<00:01:31.770> ops<00:01:32.009> 2<00:01:32.159> even<00:01:32.460> before<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.700> said<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> make

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.569 
the DLCs you guys start dropping things
out<00:01:39.960> quicker<00:01:40.290> cuz<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:40.740> can't<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.100> rely<00:01:41.549> on

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
out quicker cuz we can't just rely on

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.249 
out quicker cuz we can't just rely on
maybe<00:01:42.060> making<00:01:42.390> them<00:01:42.600> wait<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.960> month<00:01:43.140> or

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
maybe making them wait for a month or

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.350 
maybe making them wait for a month or
two<00:01:43.290> before<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.369> what<00:01:44.549> they<00:01:44.670> did<00:01:44.729> was<00:01:45.119> they

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
two before so what they did was they

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.060 
two before so what they did was they
introduced<00:01:45.600> new<00:01:45.869> stuff<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.140> diamond<00:01:46.680> camos

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
introduced new stuff like diamond camos

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.440 
introduced new stuff like diamond camos
that's<00:01:47.520> pretty<00:01:47.700> cool<00:01:47.880> right<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.299> they

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
that's pretty cool right that they

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.940 
that's pretty cool right that they
should<00:01:48.479> step<00:01:48.840> fairly<00:01:49.259> quickly<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> game

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
should step fairly quickly in the game

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.219 
should step fairly quickly in the game
and<00:01:50.159> that's<00:01:50.670> why<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.909> start<00:01:51.240> strongly<00:01:51.899> believe

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
and that's why I start strongly believe

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.170 
and that's why I start strongly believe
that<00:01:52.259> they<00:01:52.649> will<00:01:52.680> introduce<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.610> februari

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
that they will introduce it on februari

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.510 
that they will introduce it on februari
12-1<00:01:54.899> there's<00:01:55.140> proof<00:01:55.560> who<00:01:56.070> they<00:01:56.219> want<00:01:56.399> to

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
12-1 there's proof who they want to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.039 
12-1 there's proof who they want to
change<00:01:56.939> up<00:01:57.149> their<00:01:57.240> mindset<00:01:57.689> they<00:01:57.810> want<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
change up their mindset they want to

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.090 
change up their mindset they want to
make<00:01:58.200> things<00:01:58.409> quicker<00:01:58.590> they<00:01:58.890> wouldn't

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
make things quicker they wouldn't

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.709 
make things quicker they wouldn't
release<00:01:59.310> they'll<00:01:59.640> see<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.880> was<00:02:00.030> faster<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
release they'll see it was faster and

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.510 
release they'll see it was faster and
three<00:02:01.200> they<00:02:01.439> don't<00:02:01.560> want<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> game<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:02.070> boring

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
three they don't want the game be boring

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.520 
three they don't want the game be boring
I'm<00:02:02.670> pretty<00:02:03.390> certain<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.689> they<00:02:03.899> will<00:02:04.049> now

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
I'm pretty certain that they will now

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.319 
I'm pretty certain that they will now
