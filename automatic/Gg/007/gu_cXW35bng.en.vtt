and I really like it it's really really

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.440 
and I really like it it's really really
waiting<00:02:26.890> there's<00:02:27.890> weight<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.610> but<00:02:29.330> it's

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
waiting there's weight to it but it's

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.170 
waiting there's weight to it but it's
not<00:02:29.750> really<00:02:30.440> heavy<00:02:30.890> there<00:02:31.460> is<00:02:31.610> weight<00:02:31.850> there

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
but it's not too heavy it's really
nicely<00:02:36.980> painted<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.640> think<00:02:37.910> my<00:02:38.030> monsters<00:02:38.780> and

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
nicely painted I think my monsters and

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.010 
nicely painted I think my monsters and
aliens<00:02:40.730> are<00:02:41.150> going<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.330> be<00:02:41.390> better<00:02:41.540> painted

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
aliens are going to be better painted

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.590

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
than the human figures but I guess

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.090 
than the human figures but I guess
everybody<00:02:45.050> knows<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.230> there's<00:02:45.800> some<00:02:45.950> really

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
everybody knows that there's some really

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.000 
everybody knows that there's some really
good<00:02:46.280> detail<00:02:46.790> on<00:02:47.060> this<00:02:47.810> one<00:02:48.050> his<00:02:48.380> teeth<00:02:48.770> are

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010

annoyance I guess they could have put a

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.030 
annoyance I guess they could have put a
black<00:02:54.380> wash<00:02:54.760> over<00:02:55.760> them<00:02:56.200> but<00:02:57.200> overall<00:02:57.770> I'm
