00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.509 
by look so it really it's going to be
interesting<00:03:52.630> as<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.560> see<00:03:53.739> how<00:03:53.920> it<00:03:53.980> plays<00:03:54.190> out

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
interesting as to see how it plays out

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.729 
interesting as to see how it plays out
when<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.790> game<00:03:54.970> goes<00:03:55.180> live<00:03:55.450> or<00:03:55.690> 6.1<00:03:56.290> goes<00:03:56.500> life

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
when the game goes live or 6.1 goes life

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.710 
when the game goes live or 6.1 goes life
I'm<00:03:57.190> not<00:03:57.370> going<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.579> touch<00:03:57.700> on<00:03:57.880> that<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.569> give

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
I'm not going to touch on that and give

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.140 
I'm not going to touch on that and give
them<00:03:58.840> my<00:03:58.930> thought<00:03:59.139> seeing<00:03:59.500> as<00:03:59.760> there's<00:04:00.760> so

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
them my thought seeing as there's so

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.770 
them my thought seeing as there's so
many<00:04:01.329> changes<00:04:01.989> like<00:04:02.920> reading<00:04:03.280> in<00:04:03.370> DK<00:04:03.849> DK<00:04:04.420> has<00:04:04.720> a

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
other classes above to so straight away

other classes above to so straight away
think<00:04:26.410> like<00:04:26.650> oh<00:04:26.920> that's<00:04:27.430> going<00:04:27.550> to<00:04:27.610> be

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
think like oh that's going to be

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.030 
think like oh that's going to be
ridiculous<00:04:28.210> why<00:04:28.390> they<00:04:28.600> buff<00:04:28.810> DK<00:04:29.200> then<00:04:29.740> looking

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
ridiculous why they buff DK then looking

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.010 
ridiculous why they buff DK then looking
at<00:04:30.130> all<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.370> other<00:04:30.460> classes<00:04:30.640> not<00:04:31.570> sure<00:04:31.780> how<00:04:31.960> to

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
at all the other classes not sure how to

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.230 
at all the other classes not sure how to
see<00:04:32.320> like<00:04:33.130> how<00:04:33.160> it's<00:04:33.460> going<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.640> pan<00:04:33.850> out<00:04:33.910> right

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
see like how it's going to pan out right

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.810 
see like how it's going to pan out right
now<00:04:34.390> so<00:04:34.660> just<00:04:34.960> wait<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:36.040> see<00:04:36.250> what<00:04:36.400> happens<00:04:36.730> I

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
now so just wait and see what happens I

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.180 
now so just wait and see what happens I

longest patch notes but when considering
like<00:05:34.570> they're<00:05:35.200> adding<00:05:35.620> in<00:05:35.800> new<00:05:36.460> blood<00:05:36.730> elf

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000

character models and stuff it's going to

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.790 
character models and stuff it's going to
seem<00:05:39.790> like<00:05:39.820> a<00:05:40.000> pretty<00:05:40.240> big<00:05:40.510> patch<00:05:40.800> although

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
seem like a pretty big patch although

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.980 
seem like a pretty big patch although
people<00:05:42.040> might<00:05:42.340> argue<00:05:42.370> that<00:05:42.790> the<00:05:43.420> blood<00:05:43.780> elf

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
people might argue that the blood elf

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.020 
people might argue that the blood elf
should<00:05:44.470> have<00:05:44.680> been<00:05:44.890> in<00:05:45.070> with<00:05:45.790> the<00:05:45.910> other

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.670 
should have been in with the other
characters<00:05:46.300> and<00:05:46.900> they'll<00:05:46.990> just<00:05:47.140> been<00:05:47.440> a<00:05:47.470> bit

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680
