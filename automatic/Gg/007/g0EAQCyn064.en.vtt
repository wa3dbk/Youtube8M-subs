00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.400
 total 3 collection editions were published 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.410

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.550
 collector you sit no exclusively for

 North America on him there now and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.320
 let's see the knights to arms 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.160
 so before us is a cardboard box 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.720
 medium size in fact it is not 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.029
 stands out for nothing special except 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.820
 the name of the game responding with gold color 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.430
 front on the sides and behind the various arts 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.800
 Game description of the contents of the well will begin 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.149
 to unpacking opening the box we 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.340
 discover steelbook 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.710
 and under it a figure in a plastic wrapper 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.899
 I, as a healer of steel packs from the game 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.300
 rated this copy though steelbook 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.340
 just looks like the name of the game 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.500
 symbolism on both sides of me he 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.340
 liked the symbol of the knightly order 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.980
 copy of the Order of 1886 convex 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.379
 and they are framed like he 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.390
 performed by marriage colors and this is a clear 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.400
 there is an element of stylization for the game inside 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.000
 blue ray game disc as well 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.939
 pieces of paper 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.350
 1 extra content is the same way 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.659
 as in the Russian edition 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.880
 further advertising bloodborne and anti- ice 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.700
 then reklamka hand to on game and also 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.830
 four stickers they are not at all like 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.229
 in our edition there were coats of arms on them 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.990
 halahad percival igreina and also 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.619
 the symbolism of the order removing all this we can 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.200
 see 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.060
 art on the inside of steel book 4 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.299
 game character and in-game 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.369
 London of the late 19th century on the background of the second and 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.220
 last element of the edition figurine 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.079
 halahad height figurine small all 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.540
 because the main character does not stand like 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.729
 it is usually figurines and shoots from 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.159
 shelter as a refuge brave knights 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.550
 chose a dilapidated concrete wall 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.990
 cut 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.910
 vodka upstairs which by the way 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.160
 compiled separately in order for all this 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.320
 could not fit the box also not 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.100
 pay attention to the details of the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.230
 character 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.930
 he is dressed in a knightly uniform on which 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.940
 depicts the coat of arms of Galahad for 10 set 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.430
 belt and transmitter through which 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.470
 knights can chat also have 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.540
 some semblance of chain mail on shoulders 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.400
 various patterns on armored parts 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.200
 forms if you really go into 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.570
 details cut gloves 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.040
 resemble the skin of his clothes in some 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.530
 places has folds somewhere 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.070
 plausibly crumpled and part of the cloak lies 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.590
 on the ground 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.200
 as for the face, but still far away 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.720
 reminds halahad already reaching and 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.700
 A sample of many figures seems to be 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.670
 knight has already entered a shootout 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.530
 the ground are 5 sleeves and cartridges nothing 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.050
 leaves no doubt in his hands 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.480
 certainly nothing more than one of the first 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.530
 samples of the Mosin A rifle in knightly 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.470
 circles this thing is called 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.120
 combined wheel with a shop for 20 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.040
 ammo and stunning shot options 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.230
 decide to skip a pint shock wave 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.930
 forming an enemy for a couple of meters 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.300
 If to speak as a whole the figure has left 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.209
 great here you and non-standard goats 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.000
 hero and detailing and just not 3 live 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.070
 kind of figurine such a take honorable 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.170
 what do you want to say at the completion 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.630
 that the building pleased me 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.360
 it would seem that only 2 steel book elements 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.960
 figurine but both are made with high quality and 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.990
 soundly 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.420
 Of course the publication can not be called perfect but 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.980
 I think every collector will appreciate it and 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.470
 especially fan of the game 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.360
 going into details acquiring this 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.940
 was one of the few experience orders 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.890
 publications overseas and first experience orders 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.510
 From American amazon I can safely 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.640
 say that with the exception of small 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.030
 questions declaring everything went on 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.160

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.940

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.440

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.220

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.730
