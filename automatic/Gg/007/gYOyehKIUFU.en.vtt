okay<00:01:48.830> it's<00:01:48.950> going<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.160> be<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.580> big<00:01:49.760> disk<00:01:50.030> okay

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
okay it's going to be the big disk okay

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.040 
okay it's going to be the big disk okay
so<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.200> go<00:01:51.470> ahead<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:52.490> you<00:01:52.640> put<00:01:52.880> your<00:01:53.090> disc<00:01:53.390> on

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
so you go ahead and you put your disc on

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
so you go ahead and you put your disc on
the<00:01:54.080> stand<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:55.310> you<00:01:55.460> tighten<00:01:55.880> it<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:06.710> as<00:02:06.950> you

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
the stand and you tighten it so as you

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.650 
the stand and you tighten it so as you
can<00:02:07.220> see<00:02:07.400> this<00:02:07.550> is<00:02:07.730> secure<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:08.360> while<00:02:08.510> you're

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
can see this is secure so while you're

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.880 
can see this is secure so while you're
polishing<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.650> disc<00:02:09.860> is<00:02:10.040> not<00:02:10.250> moving<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.890> I

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
polishing the disc is not moving and I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.650 
polishing the disc is not moving and I
guess<00:02:13.100> this<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.460> why<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.700> makes<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.240> easier<00:02:14.600> for

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
guess this is why it makes it easier for

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.220 
guess this is why it makes it easier for
you<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.080> paint<00:02:15.560> your<00:02:15.830> nail<00:02:16.480> now<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.720> poses<00:02:17.960> a

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
you to paint your nail now it poses a

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.170 
you to paint your nail now it poses a
