00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:03.470
 Laux is a very big fish 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.680
 but many animals 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.170
 is not that difficult 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.440
 experience coarser pull with the fish as it is done 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.259
 as we first see her cut in the head 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:18.599
 dannach 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.630
 lead the knife 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.630
 along the back 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.419
 and cut at the devices 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.419
 the entire page 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.630
 then maybe they'll raise that and have a better look at it 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.820
 section 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.370
 As you can see we always see the blade clinging to the backbone 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.370
 guided 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.900
 so they can solve the meat relatively easily 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 Yachts they do not necessarily have to go fast 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.170
 rather, no flash should remain on the devices that must 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.560
 be done thoroughly 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.850
 turn the fish over 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 the AHV of the fin move away 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.300
 and cut them back along the back 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.720
 once remove the upper row of Greten on the back 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.720
 they can pull off here now 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.060
 another cut on the head 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.770
 solve the fillet in front 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.740
 Now they can turn the fish over again 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.230
 and have one with it 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.230
 very good view of the cut surfaces 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.370
 the knife inserted under the counters along the backbone 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.930
 replaces the fillet in the rent 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.550
 and with a final cut this on the second Philips of the bones 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.740
 exempt 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.020
 Thinking openly and honestly not throwing away is perfect 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.820
 Percent to prepare Zuken or even for other fish dishes 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.689
 now threatens to see 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.139
 the fillets too 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.709
 and on request you can too 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.449
 fact sheet strain remove belly flaps 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:19.359
 In no case do not put the entire construction under mat 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.399
 Gently work your way with the knife 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.399
 and just remove the daily for their pity about the meat 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.529
 same procedure with the second Philipp 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.509
 with a very flat cut 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:40.339
 They can be the fact and even the cartilage on the bottom side is simple 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:43.339
 remove 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.949
 walking to the terminals 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:06.309
 the Phillies have 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:10.859
 at the middle of where the spine is still crying a lot of bones 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.949
 These must be with pliers 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:15.019
 they will be removed 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.759
 that works relatively quickly 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:19.979
 because the bones are very big 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.979
 you can easily grasp them 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:28.039
 swipe with your finger 

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:31.039
 over the meat then they can play the bones very well 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.889
 this gene is the bones in a row 

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:52.509
 and can be easily removed 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.799
 You do not necessarily have to buy a Greten tongs 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.640
 normal tool pliers or a GP-centered also just pay attention 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:08.599
 that she 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.599
 cleaned well Â» 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:19.239
 after terminals 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.239
 her two salmon fillets are ready 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.430
 Fish coarser 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.370
 wishes you good appetite 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.550
 and enjoy cooking 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.250
