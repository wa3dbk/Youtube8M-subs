00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.910 

in<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:00.750> step<00:00:01.020> we'll<00:00:01.199> be<00:00:01.380> putting<00:00:01.680> the

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
in this step we'll be putting the

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.670 
in this step we'll be putting the
binding<00:00:02.129> on<00:00:02.490> however<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.419> first<00:00:03.600> step<00:00:03.959> in<00:00:04.230> the

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
binding on however the first step in the

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.769 
binding on however the first step in the
binding<00:00:04.980> process<00:00:05.250> would<00:00:05.730> be<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:05.970> even<00:00:06.509> up<00:00:06.629> the

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
binding process would be to even up the

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.350 
binding process would be to even up the
edges<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.319> your<00:00:07.350> quilt<00:00:07.820> so<00:00:08.820> with<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.090> rotary

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
edges of your quilt so with a rotary

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.310 
edges of your quilt so with a rotary
cutter<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:10.200> your<00:00:10.530> cutting<00:00:11.099> mat<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:12.320> your

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
cutter and your cutting mat and your

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.530 
cutter and your cutting mat and your
ruler<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.860> would<00:00:14.040> even<00:00:14.309> all<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.030> edges<00:00:15.389> of

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
ruler you would even all the edges of

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:30.439 
ruler you would even all the edges of
the<00:00:15.660> quilt<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:29.400> next<00:00:29.699> step<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> process

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
the quilt the next step in the process

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.479 
the quilt the next step in the process
would<00:00:30.929> be<00:00:30.990> actually<00:00:31.529> measuring<00:00:31.800> your<00:00:32.160> quilt

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
would be actually measuring your quilt

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.220 
would be actually measuring your quilt
so<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.790> get<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.149> correct<00:00:33.570> length<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
so you get the correct length of the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.590 
so you get the correct length of the
binding<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.890> depending<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.640> how<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.910> sew<00:00:36.300> may

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
binding and depending on how you sew may

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.590 
binding and depending on how you sew may
depend<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.590> size<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> quilt<00:00:38.820> in

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
depend on the the size of the quilt in

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.020 
depend on the the size of the quilt in
the<00:00:39.809> case<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.170> our<00:00:40.290> little<00:00:40.620> four<00:00:41.399> patch<00:00:41.670> that

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the case of our little four patch that

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.660 
the case of our little four patch that
we<00:00:42.270> did<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.559> 13<00:00:44.520> by<00:00:44.850> 25<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:47.280> next<00:00:47.309> step

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
we did here it's 13 by 25 the next step

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.340 
we did here it's 13 by 25 the next step
would<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.149> figure<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.719> length<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.230> your

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
would be to figure the length of your

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.639 
would be to figure the length of your
binding<00:00:49.860> now<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> width<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.989> quilt<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
binding now the width of the quilt and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.290 
binding now the width of the quilt and
the<00:00:52.800> length<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> quilt<00:00:53.699> if<00:00:53.969> they're<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the length of the quilt if they're the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.810 
the length of the quilt if they're the
same<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:55.079> doesn't<00:00:55.829> matter<00:00:55.980> which<00:00:56.309> side<00:00:56.340> that

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
same it doesn't matter which side that

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000 
same it doesn't matter which side that
you<00:00:57.000> pick<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.020> case<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.440> my<00:00:58.620> small

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
you pick but in the case of my small

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.790 
you pick but in the case of my small
piece<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.609> have<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.320> side<00:01:01.559> that's

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
piece I have here I have one side that's

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.390 
piece I have here I have one side that's
13<00:01:02.340> inches<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.750> side<00:01:04.080> that's<00:01:04.320> 25<00:01:04.920> inches

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
13 inches and one side that's 25 inches

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.030 
13 inches and one side that's 25 inches
so<00:01:06.360> we'll<00:01:06.540> cut<00:01:06.720> two<00:01:06.960> pieces<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.439> binding<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
so we'll cut two pieces of binding that

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.679 
so we'll cut two pieces of binding that
are<00:01:08.159> 25<00:01:08.850> inches<00:01:08.880> long<00:01:09.540> by<00:01:10.020> 5<00:01:10.320> inches<00:01:10.740> wide<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
are 25 inches long by 5 inches wide and

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.499 
are 25 inches long by 5 inches wide and
then<00:01:12.689> two<00:01:12.960> pieces<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.590> binding<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.610> are<00:01:14.850> 15

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
then two pieces of binding that are 15

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.010 
then two pieces of binding that are 15
inches<00:01:15.930> long<00:01:16.170> by<00:01:16.619> 5<00:01:16.950> inches<00:01:17.369> wide<00:01:17.689> the<00:01:18.689> reason

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
inches long by 5 inches wide the reason

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.320 
inches long by 5 inches wide the reason
that<00:01:19.200> they<00:01:19.350> would<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.680> 15<00:01:20.159> inches<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.759> because

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
that they would be 15 inches is because

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.710 
that they would be 15 inches is because
we<00:01:22.229> need<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.590> extend<00:01:23.130> an<00:01:23.520> extra<00:01:23.970> two<00:01:24.180> inches<00:01:24.540> on

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
we need to extend an extra two inches on

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.070 
we need to extend an extra two inches on
either<00:01:24.960> side<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.619> connect<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
either side to connect with the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.020 
either side to connect with the
crosswise<00:01:28.080> binding<00:01:28.710> once<00:01:29.549> you've<00:01:29.700> cut<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
crosswise binding once you've cut the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.719 
crosswise binding once you've cut the
binding<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.500> filler<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.100> actually<00:01:32.549> need

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
binding and the filler you actually need

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.230 
binding and the filler you actually need
the<00:01:32.880> same<00:01:33.180> size<00:01:33.840> piece<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.470> filler<00:01:34.880> as<00:01:35.880> your

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the same size piece of filler as your

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.020 
the same size piece of filler as your
binding<00:01:37.009> just<00:01:38.009> place<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> inside

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
binding just place that on the inside

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.660

and<00:01:39.840> press<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:42.649> now<00:01:43.649> you're<00:01:44.399> going<00:01:44.549> to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
and press it and now you're going to
