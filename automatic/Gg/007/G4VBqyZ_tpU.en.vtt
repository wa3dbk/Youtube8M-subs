00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:11.720
 boat motor parsun t 2 and 6 bms this 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:14.890
 modification is approximately 2014 2013 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:19.279
 rather there is a modelka which 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:23.060
 our tiller usually goes without gas and 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.159
 if you see two screws on each side 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.699
 that is, all four screws are two halves 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:33.200
 engine case disassembled 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:38.720
 the gas of this motor and control us 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:43.430
 located right on the body of the motor this 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.960
 us trigger manual lace with 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.140
 lace which we are in this tag im 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.810
 we start a motor is a valve 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.160
 air dresser so-called 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:57.140
 the choke here is the gas control lever 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.300
 engine throttle valve 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.110
 that is, where the deliverer means turnovers 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.549
 you are 6 this is the average optimal momentum 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.310
 the bug is drawn means it 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:11.330
 minimum speed minimum gas is 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.320
 a button for killing the engine for say 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.380
 as if we see insurance that the button 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.390
 provided with the ability to install there here 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.780
 now show the button installed 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.909
 check such a safety cord 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.190
 the second half has it 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.130
 carabiner hangs clinging somewhere 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.950
 either on spadji years or on the arm of a man 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.200
 control motor when occurs 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.770
 some frame goal 1 person falls 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.610
 overboard that's what happens 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.159
 chicco pulls 2 weeks off 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.990
 in addition to the motor goes 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.760
 spare cord and handle this to run 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.880
 and that suddenly broke off the main 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.670
 here kulÑ‘chki see immediately this spare 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.540
 gaskets for changing 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.850
 butter go who riven so candle key and 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.750
 screwdriver is what goes with us 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.580
 sachets additional equipment 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:15.220
 motor so show now screw flint u 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.069
 motor metal that's even audible 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.380
 sound solid enough again 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.010
 We remind that at least once a month 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:33.910
 forget it rush plinth oh you vat 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:40.989
 turn the wines now show that here 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:44.890
 there is such a pin of his novelty 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.840
 need to remove straighten removed later 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.459
 screw and on the drive shaft 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.049
 if in some other and pollution in 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.670
 the stuffing box area they are all removed 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.400
 magnesium electrochemical protector 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.360
 corrosion protection is particularly important when 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.370
 March movement smoking motor on the transom 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.310
 done with the help of these two 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.380
 there is a screw pair clamp 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.790
 clamped motor directly on the transom 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.329
 motor fuel tank 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.079
 I know how to practice the cover here we show how 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:20.200
 it unscrews and closes on top of 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.690
 the lid has an additional valve 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.720
 air which need to be closed when 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.070
 transporting the motor when it lies and 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.630
 when you start the engine it 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.200
 be sure to open to baht 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.730
 inside 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.260
 built-in tanks in the motor not 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.090
 formed on the fuel system 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.959
 opens closes fuel motor 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.299
 again, remember not to forget 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.970
 fuel everything before 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.250
 packing and transporting motors for 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.930
 so that from the float chamber she 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.840
 then did not pour out either outside 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.889
 somewhere in the car and your not 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.579
 smelled of gas 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:04:00.900
 either did not get extra fuel surplus 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.900
 inside the colin zone
