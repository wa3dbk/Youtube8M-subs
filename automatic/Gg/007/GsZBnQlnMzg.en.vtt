00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
to find a red filter for this thing

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.220 
to find a red filter for this thing
because<00:00:17.279> it's<00:00:17.430> something<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.270> need<00:00:18.510> at<00:00:18.900> work

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
because it's something I need at work

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.349 
because it's something I need at work
and<00:00:19.880> I<00:00:22.010> couldn't<00:00:23.010> find<00:00:23.160> one<00:00:23.369> anywhere<00:00:23.519> they

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
didn't make them for this model so I

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.910 
didn't make them for this model so I
came<00:00:27.090> up<00:00:27.269> with<00:00:27.480> an<00:00:27.570> idea<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:28.080> how<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.650> make<00:00:28.890> a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
came up with an idea of how to make a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.919 
came up with an idea of how to make a
custom<00:00:29.400> one<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.820> i'll<00:00:30.449> show<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.689> how<00:00:30.720> i<00:00:30.810> did

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
custom one and i'll show you how i did

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.110 
custom one and i'll show you how i did
it<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.170> case<00:00:31.410> anybody<00:00:31.890> else<00:00:32.009> needs<00:00:32.820> one<00:00:33.000> as

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
it in case anybody else needs one as

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.459 
it in case anybody else needs one as
well<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:34.940> here<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:38.180> it's<00:00:39.180> not<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
well so here it is it's not the

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.410 
well so here it is it's not the
prettiest<00:00:40.469> thing<00:00:40.680> ever<00:00:40.969> but<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.030> does<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
prettiest thing ever but it does the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:50.029 
prettiest thing ever but it does the
trick<00:00:44.750> slip<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.780> right<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:49.039> there

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
trick slip it right on like that there

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.950 
trick slip it right on like that there
it<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.390> actually<00:00:51.469> it<00:00:52.469> puts<00:00:52.710> out<00:00:52.920> more<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
it is actually it puts out more of a

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.110 
it is actually it puts out more of a
violet<00:00:54.960> color<00:00:54.989> i<00:00:55.350> would<00:00:55.590> say<00:00:55.800> then<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> red<00:00:56.370> but

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
violet color i would say then a red but

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.720 
violet color i would say then a red but
still<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.629> serves<00:00:57.930> its<00:00:58.140> purpose<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.920> saves

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730

stuff i basically cut it out to fit this
circle<00:02:10.739> here

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
circle here

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.180 
circle here
side<00:02:12.420> here<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:13.069> mash<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.400> there<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:16.190> that

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
side here and mash it in there and that

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.280

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
worked and the one-inch diameter of this

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.140 
worked and the one-inch diameter of this
thing<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.980> actually<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.400> little<00:02:20.520> bit<00:02:20.730> loose<00:02:20.940> on

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.470 
it in there to get it eventually it
sticks<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.459> good<00:02:41.730> it's<00:02:42.030> not<00:02:42.150> going<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.390> come

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
sticks on good it's not going to come

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.420 
sticks on good it's not going to come
off<00:02:42.630> at<00:02:42.840> all<00:02:44.570> there<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.660> go<00:02:45.980> get<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.010> red<00:02:47.220> light

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
off at all there you go get a red light

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.190 
off at all there you go get a red light
cover<00:02:51.080> again<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.590> can<00:02:52.739> flip<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.160> open<00:02:53.489> and

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
cover again you can flip that open and

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.120 
cover again you can flip that open and
silly<00:02:55.200> got<00:02:55.380> your<00:02:55.500> white<00:02:55.650> light<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.810> does<00:02:57.989> a

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
silly got your white light and it does a

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.320 
silly got your white light and it does a
dissolute<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.640> have<00:02:59.820> this<00:02:59.910> filter<00:03:00.239> on

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
dissolute you have this filter on

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.449 
dissolute you have this filter on
obviously<00:03:00.570> degrades<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.290> lumen<00:03:01.920> output<00:03:01.980> and

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
obviously degrades the lumen output and

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.360 
obviously degrades the lumen output and
the<00:03:03.239> light<00:03:03.420> quality<00:03:03.690> overall<00:03:04.110> but<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.160> don't

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
the light quality overall but I don't

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.710 
the light quality overall but I don't
mind<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:05.670> at<00:03:05.760> all<00:03:05.910> in<00:03:06.060> extras<00:03:06.360> I'm<00:03:06.450> glad

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
mind that at all in extras I'm glad

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.040 
mind that at all in extras I'm glad
because<00:03:07.970> i'm<00:03:08.970> typically<00:03:09.420> going<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.720> use<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:09.959> on

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
because i'm typically going to use it on

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.070 
because i'm typically going to use it on
low<00:03:10.230> mode<00:03:10.470> when<00:03:10.830> i'm<00:03:10.950> walking<00:03:11.070> around<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:12.080> it

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
low mode when i'm walking around and it

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.699 
low mode when i'm walking around and it
doesn't<00:03:13.410> give<00:03:13.500> me<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.709> whole<00:03:14.010> lot<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.519> light

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
doesn't give me a whole lot of light

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.860 
doesn't give me a whole lot of light
which<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:16.860> good<00:03:17.040> though<00:03:17.220> because<00:03:17.370> i<00:03:17.850> want<00:03:18.299> just

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
which is good though because i want just

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.910 
which is good though because i want just
enough<00:03:18.989> light<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.380> see<00:03:19.530> what<00:03:19.769> i'm<00:03:19.860> doing

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
enough light to see what i'm doing

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.520 
enough light to see what i'm doing
without<00:03:20.250> killing<00:03:20.940> my<00:03:21.060> night<00:03:21.239> vision<00:03:21.269> and<00:03:21.780> then
