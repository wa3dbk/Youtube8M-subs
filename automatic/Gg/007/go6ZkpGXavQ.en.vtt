to make it nice and cute for work I try

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.260 
to make it nice and cute for work I try
to<00:00:34.430> leave<00:00:34.700> it<00:00:34.820> along<00:00:35.090> for<00:00:35.510> work<00:00:35.739> so<00:00:36.739> anyway<00:00:37.270> so

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
I tried out the volcanic ash exfoliator

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.819 
I tried out the volcanic ash exfoliator
and<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:44.600> this<00:00:44.840> is<00:00:45.050> what<00:00:45.199> I<00:00:45.230> have<00:00:45.469> to<00:00:45.649> say<00:00:45.800> about

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
and so this is what I have to say about

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.779 
and so this is what I have to say about
this<00:00:46.039> product<00:00:47.379> it<00:00:48.379> is<00:00:48.649> not<00:00:49.010> something<00:00:49.430> that<00:00:49.760> I

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
this product it is not something that I

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.310 
this product it is not something that I
would<00:00:49.910> call<00:00:50.210> a<00:00:50.239> Holy<00:00:50.750> Grail<00:00:50.949> exfoliator<00:00:51.949> I

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
would call a Holy Grail exfoliator I

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.080 
would call a Holy Grail exfoliator I
tried<00:00:54.320> on<00:00:54.350> my<00:00:54.649> face<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:55.160> my<00:00:55.280> body<00:00:55.489> just<00:00:55.699> so<00:00:56.030> i

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
tried on my face and my body just so i

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.319 
tried on my face and my body just so i
could<00:00:56.210> give<00:00:56.359> it<00:00:56.539> a<00:00:56.719> one-time<00:00:57.350> good<00:00:57.649> review

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
could give it a one-time good review

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.630 
could give it a one-time good review
usually<00:00:59.329> you<00:00:59.539> guys<00:00:59.719> already<00:01:00.140> know<00:01:00.410> my<00:01:00.949> choice

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
usually you guys already know my choice

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.780 
usually you guys already know my choice
for<00:01:02.090> face<00:01:02.300> scrub<00:01:02.690> is<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.109> origins<00:01:03.829> modern

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
for face scrub is the origins modern

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.039 
for face scrub is the origins modern
friction<00:01:05.890> so<00:01:06.890> when<00:01:07.369> I<00:01:07.400> use<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:08.000> volcanic<00:01:08.720> ash

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
friction so when I use the volcanic ash

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.399 
friction so when I use the volcanic ash
on<00:01:09.290> my<00:01:09.439> face<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:12.770> particles<00:01:14.229> they<00:01:15.229> are

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
on my face the the particles they are

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.039 
on my face the the particles they are
not<00:01:15.710> like<00:01:16.070> big<00:01:16.400> a<00:01:16.729> rough<00:01:17.150> or<00:01:17.479> anything<00:01:18.020> like

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
not like big a rough or anything like

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.999 
not like big a rough or anything like
that<00:01:18.200> but<00:01:18.560> they<00:01:18.740> are<00:01:19.630> more<00:01:20.630> coarse<00:01:21.110> than<00:01:21.650> the

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
that but they are more coarse than the

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.429 
that but they are more coarse than the
modern<00:01:22.220> friction<00:01:22.939> it<00:01:23.509> did<00:01:24.049> what<00:01:24.259> it<00:01:24.350> was

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
modern friction it did what it was

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.819 
modern friction it did what it was
supposed<00:01:24.500> to<00:01:25.130> do<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:26.420> didn't<00:01:27.079> my<00:01:27.320> skin<00:01:27.680> is

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
supposed to do and it didn't my skin is

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.340 
supposed to do and it didn't my skin is
look<00:01:28.040> irritated<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:29.030> actually<00:01:29.930> when<00:01:30.079> I<00:01:30.110> woke

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
look irritated and actually when I woke

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.420 
look irritated and actually when I woke
up<00:01:30.500> this<00:01:30.650> morning<00:01:31.100> I<00:01:31.369> didn't<00:01:32.000> have<00:01:32.119> a<00:01:32.149> lot<00:01:32.360> of

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
up this morning I didn't have a lot of

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.789 
up this morning I didn't have a lot of
oil<00:01:34.430> on<00:01:34.549> my<00:01:34.700> forehead<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.270> really<00:01:36.200> now<00:01:36.380> still

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
oil on my forehead and really now still

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.410 
oil on my forehead and really now still
down<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:37.220> shiny<00:01:37.460> but<00:01:37.729> it's<00:01:37.880> not<00:01:38.060> really<00:01:38.299> as

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
down and shiny but it's not really as

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.620 
down and shiny but it's not really as
poorly<00:01:38.720> as<00:01:38.899> it<00:01:39.170> usually<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:39.759> so<00:01:40.759> in<00:01:41.149> that<00:01:41.329> sense

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
poorly as it usually is so in that sense

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.270 
poorly as it usually is so in that sense
it<00:01:41.899> probably<00:01:42.290> did<00:01:42.500> help<00:01:42.740> with<00:01:42.920> some<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.130> the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
it probably did help with some of the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.899 
it probably did help with some of the
oiliness<00:01:43.700> but<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:44.570> didn't<00:01:45.020> um<00:01:45.880> do<00:01:46.880> anything

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
oiliness but it didn't um do anything

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.850 
oiliness but it didn't um do anything
that<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.600> modern<00:01:47.960> friction<00:01:48.350> couldn't<00:01:48.710> do

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
that the modern friction couldn't do

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.289 
that the modern friction couldn't do
without<00:01:50.740> scrubbing<00:01:51.740> my<00:01:52.520> face<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:52.939> just<00:01:53.119> thought

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
without scrubbing my face I just thought

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.429 
without scrubbing my face I just thought
it<00:01:53.540> was<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.689> little<00:01:53.960> too<00:01:54.140> rough<00:01:55.240> so<00:01:56.240> for<00:01:56.990> my<00:01:57.140> body

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
it was a little too rough so for my body

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.249 
it was a little too rough so for my body
I<00:01:57.619> tried<00:01:58.070> it<00:01:58.280> on<00:01:58.369> my<00:01:58.549> arms<00:01:59.060> my<00:01:59.149> legs<00:01:59.390> they<00:01:59.899> still

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
I tried it on my arms my legs they still

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.109 
I tried it on my arms my legs they still
feel<00:02:00.530> nice<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:00.799> smooth<00:02:01.399> I<00:02:03.340> like<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:04.610> nice<00:02:04.880> and

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
feel nice and smooth I like so nice and

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.490 
feel nice and smooth I like so nice and
smooth<00:02:05.390> so<00:02:05.810> that's<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.170> plus<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:07.780> thought<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:09.140> Holy

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
smooth so that's a plus I thought a Holy

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.530 
smooth so that's a plus I thought a Holy
Grail<00:02:09.619> scrub<00:02:10.130> for<00:02:10.340> me<00:02:10.460> was<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:11.030> bath<00:02:11.300> and

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
Grail scrub for me was the bath and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.150
