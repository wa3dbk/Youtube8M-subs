00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 in this video series the most 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.680
 used spelling rules of the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.320
 Dutch language explained in this video 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.440
 will use the numbers centrally 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.020
 for example, it is 13 clowns 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.359
 where 13 extends or where you 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.760
 numbers and it is the 100 euros 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.289
 where you allegedly move 100 or 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.900
 may use numbers 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.170
 I will explain when you use 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.779
 numbers or letters with numbers 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.579
 first the letters 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.100
 you use light figure you use 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.770
 letters for numbers from 0 to 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.930
 20 so one two three four five six seven 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.690
 you can go all the way from 19 to 2010 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.230
 write for the tens to a hundred 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.530
 so 20 30 40 50 60 70 to 100 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.030
 unsubscribe from the hundreds 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.390
 1000 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.480
 also writes from 500 600 700 800 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.359
 and so on for the thousands to 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.930
 10,000 4000 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.489
 7000 8000 you prescribe them to each other 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.470
 the numbers one hundred thousand million 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.049
 billion and trillion 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.610
 then you have to pay attention 100,000 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.260
 write to each other so if it is over 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.930
 1000 is still allowed to each other 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.880
 they write the window you million billion 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.259
 used over trillion then you put one 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.439
 space between 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.520
 so three space million 5 space billion 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.590
 and 10 space trillion finally for the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.400
 ordinal numbers of the aforementioned 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.470
 numbers so 30th hundredth 4000 they three 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.470
 billionth you all write out 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.180
 when do you use numbers numbers 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.560
 use for the numbers above 20 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.140
 excluding the tens and 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.990
 hundreds so 2136 55 6242 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.140
 but you can deregister 20 and 200 again because 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.240
 that tens or hundreds are and 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.680
 finally use your numbers for measurements 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.930
 weights are data addresses 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:08.369
 percentages and account numbers therefore 10 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.560
 August 1996 30 meters four kilos 5 euros 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.510
 50 and 33 degrees 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.700
 you write them all in numbers 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.260
 then you have exceptions and those 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.870
 exceptions 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.709
 write breaks apart except in one 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.010
 composition 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.349
 it is therefore two thirds or three and seven 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.060
 eighth where she loses but he has 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.550
 Do you take a composition 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.530
 as you often see in music 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.470
 for example , you have a 4- quartz size 4 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.830
 quad and the size composition than 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.930
 you slide together like and a sentence 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.269
 numbers and numbers 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.060
 You can avoid digits both times 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.340
 use of the 23 students 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.170
 students have only nine and 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.420
 made homework 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.099
 23 is a number above 20 is none 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.230
 ten that they can write your numbers 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.569
 only 9 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.630
 you can actually do it in full over the number 9 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.569
 write because 9 is a number between 0 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.370
 and the 20 but that is not necessary now and 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.239
 why not because they are earlier in the sentence 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.060
 have used the number 23 if you have 23 with 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.349
 You can now also use 9 with numbers 7 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.420
 a digit digit 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.560
 but watch what those 23 students and 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.359
 not stood 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.569
 then you keep 9 for the fullest 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.910
 write for large round numbers 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.840
 combine your numbers and letters 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.069
 so 65,000 people 65 and numbers a thousand 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.280
 in letters 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.590
 the same goes for 82 billion euros 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.200
 and finally in vowel collision 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.940
 all in letters a trema so three and 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.040
 half a two and half then you see that there 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.040
 a theme appears on the last one 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.269
 then these were the rules and you can 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.280
 start practicing 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.160
 how can you practice it through these two 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.790
 Scan QR code or under this video 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.069
 clicking on the relevant links 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.660
 this was the explanation of the numbers 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.200
 I hope that they claim it is very useful 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.200
 had
