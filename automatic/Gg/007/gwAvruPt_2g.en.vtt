00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.189
 how about bicycle station friends i am 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.900
 the doctor very caves and this time 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:11.719
 let's talk about nutrition bicycle 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.410
 how to make a meal plan pulls out 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.199
 your notebook takes out your pen and let's see 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.480
 what are the basics of making a 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.240
 feeding plan but because I would 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.920
 I comment a lot of people come with me and I 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.470
 you say tell me what to eat 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.279
 tell me write on a sheet what I have 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.430
 I eat day by day and I eat it and 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.170
 look I prefer that you learn and that 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.970
 you do it yourself 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.220
 then the fundamentals understand the 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.070
 basics of how to plan your 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.579
 feed and you're going to have better 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.280
 result that if I tell you to eat ok 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.449
 point number one you have to consider 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.940
 how many calories do you consume per day 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.530
 right now we will not go into details 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.690
 can easily calculate how many 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.510
 calories you need per day but 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.210
 let's assume you need 2000 go 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.939
 speak in closed numbers for phase 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.670
 2000 calories in a day that number of 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:16.520
 2000 we are going to divide it by 5 because 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:20.060
 they are 5 times what we are going to eat 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.270
 we go then 2000 between 5 are 400 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.850
 it means that every meal is going to have 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.850
 400 calories more or less 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.250
 let's talk now about the times 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.880
 If you do not understand anything I am 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.369
 saying later here in the comments 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.619
 from facebook, give me all your questions and 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.140
 there we are answering the then the 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:49.399
 let's say that you get up at 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.860
 six in the morning ideally and eye I'm 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.580
 talking about the ideal you should 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:59.509
 have breakfast between six and a half seven or more 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.700
 take a big mistake that there are in many 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.009
 people is that they wake up at 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.220
 five in the morning and it's nine ten 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.050
 in the morning and have not eaten anything the 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.500
 truth is that this is not very good for 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.620
 your body is better than there is a lapse 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.400
 of half an hour 45 minutes maximum after 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.230
 of getting up to have already had breakfast and 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.100
 then you have to be eating like a baby 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.770
 every three hours maximum four hours you 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.760
 you should be eating something 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.350
 according to obviously that depends on whether 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.070
 you work and study 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.530
 if you have access to food that 's what 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.680
 we are talking about the ideal 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.350
 then another question that I usually do 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.900
 it's the night so late can I 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.799
 dine 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:55.329
 Ideally dinner should be two 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:57.400
 hours before going to sleep maximum what 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.079
 what happens is that if you are very full and 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.799
 then the dinners we do are usually 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.689
 very in some of my at least 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.390
 I prefer docs in light dining but two 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:09.519
 hours before bed so you can give 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.409
 enough time to your body that 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.109
 digest or start the digestion of those 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.390
 food and you have a dream more 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:19.090
 repairing and in fact the dinner ideally 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.909
 you should consume things that fix you 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.680
 let me see my notes that more 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.940
 and a rule that I have with all my 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.740
 patients 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.260
 is that they should not go hungry 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.510
 if you in a lapse and it is and that is the reason 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.900
 of why are you these parameters of 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.540
 nutrition 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.150
 do not go hungry if you're going through 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.189
 hungry something we're doing wrong if you 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.989
 you're really hungry it's already a signal 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:47.569
 of alarm that your body is 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:51.069
 asking for nutrients then you need 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.069
 nutrients as soon as possible 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.580
 prop up because right now I'm going to talk about 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.230
 the characteristics of a food 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.920
 ideal or that we are talking about a 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.099
 ideal nutrition 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.709
 number 1 a food that must 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:10.520
 replenish all the nutrients that you 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.590
 you need we are talking about nutrients 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.870
 give you energy that are the 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.620
 macronutrients carbohydrates proteins 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.720
 and fats and 'number two' micronutrients 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.690
 which are all those nutrients that 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.050
 they serve for the repair of the body and 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.710
 for specific functions all are the 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.620
 micronutrients are mineral vitamins 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.969
 phytonutrients trace elements 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.810
 enzymatic and so on 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:43.110
 what else then number one 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.880
 replenishment of nutrients number 2 that you 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:50.690
 Give enough energy for your entire day 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:54.350
 number 3 that your diet includes the 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:58.040
 water intake that you put liquid and 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:01.689
 number 4 that your glucose levels are 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.759
 keep at a stable value 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:05.949
 that's one of the great 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:09.489
 problems for which there is obesity in 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:12.069
 right now we usually eat so 

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:15.009
 abundant we make a glucose peak 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:16.619
 above normal and this to the 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.299
 long since it brings the problem of obesity 

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:22.739
 diabetes triglycerides high etcetera 

00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:24.669
 then it is better to eat little but 

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:27.699
 constant that is throughout the day 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.829
 fractionated than a single meal that 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.900
 have the 2000 calories 

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:35.639
 that would be wrong 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:39.430
 new let me see more here I signed up 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:41.940
 and for people who have a style 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.190
 of very active life 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.040
 or that they really have little time to 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.009
 prepare your food there is now the 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.009
 alternative of 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:55.369
 and food supplements or 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:57.439
 food replacements for example the 

00:05:55.369 --> 00:06:00.169
 milkshake they prepare at the station 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:01.729
 bicycle that is a replacement for a 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.889
 food is to say you arrive for your 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:05.539
 malted high performance and this 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:09.520
 Milkshake contains the nutrients 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:11.590
 needed macro and micronutrients 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.419
 to replace a full breakfast if 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.669
 you take it tomorrow or if you take it 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:18.280
 at night I would replace your dinner 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.220
 then it is already considered within the 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.400
 calorie intake 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:26.190
 your normal day and also here a lot of eye 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.820
 because we often use supplements 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:32.460
 indiscriminately and then we have 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:35.250
 excess calories or hidden calories 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.530
 they call him and we are consuming more 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.260
 of which we are planning then the 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.870
 task of this occasion is that you design your 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.249
 feed plan do you with those 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.519
 bases 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:50.849
 make your breakfast your food your dinner and two 

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:52.529
 or three snacks without exceeding the 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:55.049
 total calories that you owe from 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:57.389
 consume per day if you have any 

00:06:55.049 --> 00:06:59.549
