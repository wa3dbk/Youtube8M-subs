00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.009
 I hope you're well on them 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.980
 I bring another review in a way you know 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.559
 of good before I start not nerve 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.509
 clarify that if one day and maybe 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.210
 soon will rise of reviews already of amounts of 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.710
 android those that I really find 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.600
 not much but start climbing up 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.949
 how many and good for you what 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.500
 can differentiate whenever I go to 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.869
 upload a review video so 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.760
 Android I will put Android in the title if 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.080
 I do not put android or if I do not put anything if 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.599
 I simply put the name of the mold 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.399
 review or something like 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.750
 you can be sure that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.329
 we will be in the middle is but good 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.329
 lately if i have put ios android 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.010
 we will see these modes when I go up 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.170
 review in a way you will know if it is 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.969
 ios android I will leave soon soon 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.770
 clear but good the mold today as 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.320
 they saw in the description in the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.559
 description that I am so much in the title and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.660
 in the pepper gr because it is the mode of 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.469
 faster mode we are faster the truth 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.520
 that is such a foolish football 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.020
 we could think some but the truth 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.930
 that was very very good can be a 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.660
 back the truth 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.740
 the truth is that I love it when I saw it 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.870
 and I tell you it's not the big deal 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.470
 simply a very simple mode but 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:16.060
 can help us feel we can 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.820
 amuse quite a pig and pigs 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.900
 good pass all the animals run 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.450
 extremely fast they can observe 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.220
 for obviously they are not the ones you say 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.050
 grape as flash but the truth is that they go 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.330
 very very well the pigs go super 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.210
 fast and you will say good this is that 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.280
 the truth is therefore worthless, or it is not 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.140
 is that the help in nothing simply me 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.200
 I think you could add it to a 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.460
 series or if somebody like it to be towards 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.920
 he and he makes a young exit is 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.009
 obviously to play in you alone 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.990
 commotion yesterday is therefore I recommend them 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.940
 widely installed this way because 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.470
 it's like adding something more hardcore 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.130
 to minecraft and the truth is that it does 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.810
 very very funny and if you were asked 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.430
 all the animals run to see if it 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.009
 I can move on to the chickens as you can see 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.080
 also the chickens the villagers I do not know 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.420
 I think it also happens should they should 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.619
 while more perfect to generate is very 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.369
 very funny this is the right thing 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.670
 this fool 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.670
 This is my rival and yes also if I 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.260
 they asked the hostile also they run 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.340
 display the highest quality in the world 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.970
 the flu as you can see run and this 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.019
 is the biggest surge of the mod because 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.510
 they need survival simply 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.549
 they feel a world and they have creepers by 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.019
 or penalties I'm going to show I'm going to 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.590
 provoke I'm going to move away so that I 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.680
 stop following 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.260
 there is already we saw normal biting 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.940
 I'm walking here and suddenly a 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.670
 kripper can see me on his radio 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.290
 he runs so fast that I do not even go 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.290
 to be able to run I 'm running 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:59.280
 just as fast 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.629
 that is, the flu is so fast 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.980
 impossible to escape 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.780
 I the good thing convinced to recommend 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.910
 this way if you want for a series to 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.590
 when you guys alone or something like that because 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.880
 it's also a good one they gave me now we 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.040
 is going to realize that it is a good technique 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.180
 of to hit them game in pictures 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.769
 obviously it's also spiders 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.630
 skeletons let's try it since 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.819
 we are here obviously I will not be able to 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.120
 expose everyone because they burn but to 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:27.390
 see a spider and a line I have 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.530
 curiosity there are these these two these 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.959
 We are always going to try 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.560
 ok also serves us perfect let's 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.560
 see them is line 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:50.010
 just like seriously see how fun 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.300
 is this let's see the lions more not 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.640
 I think 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.980
 or maybe yes it's good that they 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.450
 teleports then it is not very very 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.550
 fun to say more but we like 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.860
 Here I leave the review I see the sheep 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.300
 Running is what you liked and already 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.280
 they know that the more motorcycles they go 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.780
 leaving more serious moves will have here 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.250
 good boy I love you so much we do 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.250
