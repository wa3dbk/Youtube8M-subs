00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
would be good for someone whose skin it

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.870 
would be good for someone whose skin it
pretty<00:01:39.900> sensitive<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> drier

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.130 
side now let me just say that if you had
really<00:01:45.140> tough<00:01:46.909> skin<00:01:47.909> maybe<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.869> would<00:01:49.020> work

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
really tough skin maybe this would work

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.010
