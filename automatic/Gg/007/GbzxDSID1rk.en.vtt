00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.450
 we had it again in the past 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.670
 criticism of Samsung phones 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.039
 especially on the high-end models because those 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.510
 often consisted exclusively of plastic 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.640
 while you have a lot of money for it 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.230
 paid enough other manufacturers that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.550
 that approached better 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.740
 but times change because after the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.330
 samsung galaxy alpha a device with a 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.030
 beautiful aluminum appointed 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.230
 samsung is now introducing the a series 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.170
 devices that complete that aluminum 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.570
 exist and this is the samsung galaxy a5 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.730
 and mid-range smartphone with he and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.590
 traits 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.690
 and we must live in samsung 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.850
 in terms of design, this device is very successful 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.699
 has a beautiful aluminum unibody 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.059
 housing with beautiful chrome accents and 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.319
 is only six point seven mm thick as well 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.239
 I find the angular design personally 

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:52.949
 succeeded and so does this device 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.769
 a bit reminiscent of the older samsung 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.749
 galaxy s2 i think that despite that 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.309
 here is a fairly large 5 inch screen 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:01.260
 the device can be less long 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.569
 that has been samsung in the past with 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.600
 for example the samsung galaxy s4 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:08.580
 after all, the device is already proven 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.960
 specifications between high end and 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.950
 mid range 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.020
 for example, we look at it 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.240
 display that has an HD resolution 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.800
 not in full HD, but it is 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.900
 just a super amoled screen of 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.880
 and we know about Samsung about it 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.440
 overall just very good looking and 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.270
 especially the bright colors and the brightness 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.590
 stand out in this case 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.960
 In addition, the device has a bowl 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.390
 and 2g quad-core processor and 2 gigabytes 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.410
 to ram memory what generally 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.780
 enough for most acts 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.580
 but it contrasts somewhat starkly 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.000
 against being in the current real 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.280
 there is, however, top models again 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.750
 a 16 gigabyte of storage space 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.250
 standard in the device and you can 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.460
 also expand yourself with 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.020
 a ticket up to 64 gigabytes and up 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.880
 the cameras are also given the number 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.490
 megapixels really high and to name 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.320
 on the back of a 13 megapixel camera on the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.750
 front we find a 5 megapixel 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.070
 camera for a nice selfie 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.570
 about the quality photos you take 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.430
 we can be short in good 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.020
 lighting conditions actually fine 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.150
 his photo sharp and they have beautiful 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.009
 colors really becomes a bit darker 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.349
 yes then the quality will soon go anyway 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.420
 backwards, photos often become something 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.189
 focus occurs on ice and doing 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.900
 device also takes quite a long time 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.549
 to focus 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.350
 the camera software, on the other hand, is 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.180
 nice and expanded again like us 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.560
 happiness of samsung are used to and the 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.720
 possibility of making a gif 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.420
 is a very nice addition 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.040
 videos can be recorded in 1080p at most 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.930
 no ultra hd so 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.550
 and unfortunately the slow motion is also missing 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.090
 and then we see you this is virginia 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.870
 would really like to sit in his one 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.340
 last week 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.350
 fortunately we see in the peel of samsung 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.540
 return to the two spa settings 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.950
 and also the private position in which you yourself 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.420
 determines what others on your screen 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.370
 device can see when it's on 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.540
 and of course he wants to again 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.090
 the possibility by turning 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.890
 two apps on the screen simultaneously 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.200
 for the time being the skin is stuck 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.490
 android 4 point four point four or and 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.290
 when this device receives an update 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.380
 to android lollipop 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.060
 is still unclear with this a5 can 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.530
 samsung just a very large target group 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.940
 address 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.440
 who left samsung in the past 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.180
 lie because of the widely used 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.490
 know plastic that can be in that 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.810
 case no longer as a reason 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.100
 however, you must be prepared 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.410
 wallet with one 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.870
 suggested retail price of 400 euros is this device 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.100
 namely anything but cheap and for 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.440
 You can also opt for the same money 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.500
 smartphones with better specifications 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.960
 for example the sony xperia z2 or the lg 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.240
 g3 or choose to save money 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.830
 by choosing the orne 6, albeit 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.600
 a lot less beautiful but just as good 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.250
 more powerfully equipped 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.680
 in short, it is a beautiful smartphone 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.570
 but very expensive priced than samsung 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.640
 galaxy a5 on the verge of 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.110
 the three and half and 4 stars 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.600
 but the price eventually attracts the 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.870
 score down unfortunately after three and a half 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.870
 stars
