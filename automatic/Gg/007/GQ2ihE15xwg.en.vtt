of<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:46.100> recovery<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.430> album<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.210> know<00:01:48.240> what<00:01:48.420> I

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
of a recovery to album you know what I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.270 
of a recovery to album you know what I
mean<00:01:48.509> recovery<00:01:49.259> was<00:01:49.470> dope<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.829> me<00:01:49.860> laughing

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
mean recovery was dope to me laughing

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.819 
mean recovery was dope to me laughing
like<00:01:50.549> recovery<00:01:51.000> recovery<00:01:51.509> was<00:01:51.899> dope<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.320> think

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
like recovery recovery was dope I think

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.280 
like recovery recovery was dope I think
this<00:01:53.070> should<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.430> been<00:01:53.460> recovery<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:55.259> I

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
this should have been recovery to but I

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.230 
this should have been recovery to but I
think<00:01:55.350> from<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.890> marketing<00:01:56.369> standpoint<00:01:56.700> even

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
think from a marketing standpoint even
