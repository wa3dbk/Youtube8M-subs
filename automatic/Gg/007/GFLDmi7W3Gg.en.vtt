as<00:00:09.750> you<00:00:10.080> can<00:00:10.260> see<00:00:10.469> water<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.070> pretty<00:00:11.250> clear

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
as you can see water is pretty clear

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.250 
as you can see water is pretty clear
this<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.400> about<00:00:14.580> two<00:00:14.820> months<00:00:15.179> up<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.990> running

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
this is about two months up and running

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.550 
this is about two months up and running
as<00:00:16.619> you<00:00:17.609> can<00:00:17.760> see<00:00:17.940> also<00:00:18.119> there's<00:00:18.720> quite<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.199> lot

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
as you can see also there's quite a lot

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.900 
as you can see also there's quite a lot
of<00:00:19.590> fish<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.130> bio<00:00:20.340> load<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.910> here

of fish and bio load in here
my<00:00:23.910> filtration<00:00:24.539> seems<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.990> be<00:00:25.109> working<00:00:25.619> pretty

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
my filtration seems to be working pretty

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.820 
my filtration seems to be working pretty
well<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:27.080> have<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.939> overflow<00:00:30.140> pipes<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.529> come

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
well I have to overflow pipes that come

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.860 
well I have to overflow pipes that come
down<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.870> I<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:34.079> them<00:00:34.320> running<00:00:34.559> into<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.870> just

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
down and I have them running into a just

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.700 
down and I have them running into a just
a<00:00:37.020> cheap<00:00:37.260> Walmart<00:00:38.129> filter<00:00:38.670> here<00:00:39.350> now<00:00:40.350> as<00:00:40.530> you

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
a cheap Walmart filter here now as you

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.830 
a cheap Walmart filter here now as you
see<00:00:40.950> there's<00:00:41.129> no<00:00:41.309> filter<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.120> filter<00:00:42.510> media

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
see there's no filter in it filter media

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.340 
see there's no filter in it filter media
but<00:00:43.770> every<00:00:44.550> once<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.910> while<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.360> I'm<00:00:45.570> blowing

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
but every once in a while if I'm blowing

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.810 
but every once in a while if I'm blowing
off<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.680> live<00:00:46.860> rock<00:00:47.100> or<00:00:47.280> something<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
off the live rock or something and

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.279 
off the live rock or something and
there's<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> lot<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.329> debris<00:00:48.600> floating<00:00:49.079> around

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
there's a lot of debris floating around

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.350 
there's a lot of debris floating around
I'll<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.100> stick<00:00:50.520> one<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.789> these<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.120> there

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
I'll just stick one of these in there

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.560 
I'll just stick one of these in there
that's<00:00:51.570> got<00:00:51.750> carbon<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.620> also<00:00:53.420> that<00:00:54.420> gets

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
that's got carbon in it also that gets

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.209 
that's got carbon in it also that gets
expensive<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.410> them<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.739> there<00:00:55.890> all<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
expensive to have them in there all the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.459 
expensive to have them in there all the
time<00:00:56.430> though<00:00:56.670> because<00:00:56.850> they<00:00:57.300> only<00:00:57.420> last<00:00:57.539> two

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
time though because they only last two

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.930 
time though because they only last two
or<00:00:58.500> three<00:00:58.800> days<00:00:58.980> before<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.789> take

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
or three days before you have to take

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.709 
or three days before you have to take
them<00:01:00.090> out<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.340> most<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.670> filtration<00:01:03.149> happens

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
them out so most the filtration happens

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.219 
them out so most the filtration happens
from<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:05.030> planted<00:01:06.030> refugium<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.840> 40

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
from this planted refugium it's a 40

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.690 
from this planted refugium it's a 40
gallon<00:01:07.619> as<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.010> see<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.310> goes<00:01:08.430> all<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
gallon as you can see it goes all the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.140 
gallon as you can see it goes all the
way<00:01:08.820> back<00:01:08.909> there<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.100> I<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.310> lots<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.909> little

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
way back there and I have lots of little

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.630 
way back there and I have lots of little
cocoa<00:01:12.420> pods<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:13.049> there<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.939> lots<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.119> little

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
cocoa pods in there and lots of little

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.520 
cocoa pods in there and lots of little
also<00:01:17.640> mices<00:01:18.299> trim<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.140> some<00:01:19.350> blue

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
also mices trim and I have some blue

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.240 
also mices trim and I have some blue
legs<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:20.040> there<00:01:20.750> couple<00:01:21.750> emerald<00:01:22.200> crabs<00:01:22.860> have

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
legs in there couple emerald crabs have

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.830 
legs in there couple emerald crabs have
a<00:01:23.310> couple<00:01:24.110> little<00:01:25.110> stars<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:26.070> help<00:01:26.670> eat<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
a couple little stars to help eat up the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.319 
a couple little stars to help eat up the
detritus<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.530> everything<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.159> keep<00:01:29.939> my<00:01:30.060> light

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
detritus and everything I keep my light

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.840 
detritus and everything I keep my light
on<00:01:30.710> 24/7<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.640> help<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.240> plants<00:01:33.630> grow<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
on 24/7 just to help the plants grow and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.210 
on 24/7 just to help the plants grow and
as<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.570> clerk<00:01:37.470> was<00:01:37.680> throwing

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
as you can see the clerk was throwing

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.399 
as you can see the clerk was throwing
pretty<00:01:38.579> good<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.840> that's<00:01:40.049> what<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.380> is

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
pretty good I think that's what that is

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.940 
pretty good I think that's what that is
and<00:01:41.570> then<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> little<00:01:43.170> small<00:01:43.530> hanging

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and then I have a little small hanging

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.880 
and then I have a little small hanging
on<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.220> back<00:01:44.610> review<00:01:45.030> put<00:01:45.210> around<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.899> protein

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
on the back review put around a protein

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.620 
on the back review put around a protein
skimmer<00:01:47.070> over<00:01:47.520> there<00:01:47.670> that's<00:01:47.850> an<00:01:48.030> aqua<00:01:48.390> max

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
skimmer over there that's an aqua max

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.920 
skimmer over there that's an aqua max
that<00:01:49.619> thing<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.950> incredible<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.670> love<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.720> it's

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
that thing is incredible I love it it's

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.469 
that thing is incredible I love it it's
I<00:01:52.470> think<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.009> does<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.369> work<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.790> other

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
I think it does the work of other

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.030 
I think it does the work of other
protein<00:01:55.140> skimmers<00:01:55.590> twice<00:01:56.579> its<00:01:56.820> size

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
protein skimmers twice its size

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.340 
protein skimmers twice its size
and<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:58.940> seems<00:01:59.180> to<00:01:59.300> keep<00:01:59.450> up<00:01:59.630> with<00:01:59.930> everything

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
and it seems to keep up with everything

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.550 
and it seems to keep up with everything
just<00:02:00.500> fine<00:02:00.740> in<00:02:01.040> addition<00:02:01.430> to<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.350> only

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
just fine in addition to this the only

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.950 
just fine in addition to this the only
other<00:02:05.470> filtration<00:02:06.470> item<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.460> I<00:02:07.490> have<00:02:07.610> is<00:02:08.149> the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
other filtration item that I have is the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.890 
other filtration item that I have is the
fairly<00:02:09.649> large<00:02:09.770> UV<00:02:10.340> sterilizer<00:02:10.940> that's<00:02:11.540> on<00:02:11.720> the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
fairly large UV sterilizer that's on the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.410 
fairly large UV sterilizer that's on the
return<00:02:12.230> pump<00:02:12.530> one<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.550> returned<00:02:14.030> pumps

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
return pump one of the returned pumps

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.220 
return pump one of the returned pumps
and<00:02:15.850> I'm<00:02:16.850> told<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.240> that<00:02:17.480> really<00:02:17.750> helps<00:02:18.020> cut

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
and I'm told that that really helps cut

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.220 
and I'm told that that really helps cut
down<00:02:18.260> on<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.740> algae<00:02:19.130> as<00:02:19.280> well<00:02:19.660> but<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:20.990> don't

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
down on the algae as well but I don't

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.660 
down on the algae as well but I don't
think<00:02:21.350> there's<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.620> lot<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.890> nutrients<00:02:22.340> in<00:02:22.550> the

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
think there's a lot of nutrients in the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.830 
think there's a lot of nutrients in the
water<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:23.600> begin<00:02:23.750> with<00:02:24.050> because<00:02:24.320> of<00:02:24.560> this

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
water to begin with because of this

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.820 
water to begin with because of this
refugium<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.880> no<00:02:29.150> sump<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:29.930> no<00:02:30.080> bio<00:02:30.470> balls

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
refugium and so no sump and no bio balls

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.890 
refugium and so no sump and no bio balls
and<00:02:31.220> no<00:02:31.400> filter<00:02:31.910> socks<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.510> all<00:02:32.630> that<00:02:32.810> other

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
and no filter socks and all that other

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.850 
and no filter socks and all that other
stuff<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:34.280> think<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:34.940> is<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.260> more<00:02:36.260> natural<00:02:36.290> way

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
stuff I think this is a more natural way

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.640 
stuff I think this is a more natural way
of<00:02:37.310> doing<00:02:37.820> filtration<00:02:38.420> it's<00:02:38.720> also<00:02:39.080> less

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
of doing filtration it's also less

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.440 
of doing filtration it's also less
expensive<00:02:39.680> at<00:02:40.400> least<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.670> was<00:02:40.790> for<00:02:40.820> me<00:02:41.030> cuz<00:02:41.390> I

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
expensive at least it was for me cuz I

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.810 
expensive at least it was for me cuz I
already<00:02:41.600> had<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.020> tank<00:02:42.260> lying<00:02:43.130> around<00:02:43.310> and

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
already had the tank lying around and

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.520 
already had the tank lying around and
most<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.360> live<00:02:44.540> rock<00:02:44.810> was<00:02:45.020> already<00:02:45.320> here

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
most of the live rock was already here

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.750 
most of the live rock was already here
so<00:02:46.000> but<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.470> just<00:02:48.470> wanted<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:48.890> show<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.280> off

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
so but I just wanted to show that off

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.840 
so but I just wanted to show that off
once<00:02:50.690> again<00:02:50.980> that's<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.220> result

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
once again that's the result

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
once again that's the result
clear<00:02:53.480> water<00:02:54.220> not<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.250> lot<00:02:55.459> of<00:02:55.550> algae<00:02:55.940> fish

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
clear water not a lot of algae fish

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.380 
clear water not a lot of algae fish
you're<00:02:57.020> doing<00:02:57.230> well
