00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.130
 O 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.370
 and there will be expense to you the guys 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.210
 Let's talk today about buoy fishing. 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.070
 sword 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.070
 some alternatives let's go there 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.529
 That's it folks coming back so let 's go 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.870
 there is even to question the staff 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.879
 when asking the guy who 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.590
 asked in the video comments only 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.660
 I think if his name was now 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.030
 sorry, there he is asked 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.320
 just there it seems that he said that 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.360
 he had a sword buoy that he uses 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.980
 lipstick and do not use cells good to talk then 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.449
 do not take a little bit of the game here is the 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.150
 next guys you have three 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:03.260
 alternatives here is to change the 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:04.160
 position that surround it finally come is 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.640
 next galera 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:12.740
 we would have the option is more is practical and 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.149
 would be a bathtub here . 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.350
 normal styrofoam 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:20.450
 Okay, this is where the boy is known as a boy. 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.070
 lambari 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.420
 I think this is it here is the kind of 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.520
 model it're that size here that O 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.860
 is on the agenda of the show already a size 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.890
 It's really cool for you to use the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.459
 swords there is the disadvantage here all good 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.739
 here it is a reflective painting but if 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:44.149
 you have a very dark place to 

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:46.039
 I'm the ideal is getting a sword and you're not 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.050
 It's going to take a lot of reflex so you're going 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.690
 make that choice you will not even feel 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.789
 the sword of help blow to the hand 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.149
 It's very difficult that she gives a blow. 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.130
 very big but it's okay, it's a 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.630
 cool alternative you can use this 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.399
 good here ok 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.649
 in the second place now we can use 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.259
 It would be nice to have sword memory. 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.479
 more traditional're 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.470
 the older more traditional model 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.629
 say so 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.010
 and I would say even more used and more 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.080
 Cheap on if I'm not mistaken. 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.610
 so it's very practical here this here 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.470
 already up with whip I did has 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.300
 video on the channel showing how much 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:30.590
 whip is okay 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:32.510
 and she's in here she uses uses two 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.319
 small stacks there's the levezinho here 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.849
 at the tip 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.630
 Okay, so this is the kind of lighting 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.000
 her 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.100
 with two small daughters and I have to say 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.750
 on the bridge has a pseudo also a 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.940
 that she also has a 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.640
 standard flashlight lamp type 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.640
 It's ok, but it 's more used nowadays. 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.590
 kind here by ad hoc and we have 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.480
 this third hotel here is a model 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.430
 plus the younger one is very cool too 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.920
 either with led is also thinking if 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.540
 here and he starts the car and starts 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.420
 walking now, thank you, car. 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.010
 Thanks guys on the agenda, it comes quickly here. 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.730
 we're back to being a noise of this 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.540
 car 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.330
 The statue is so still and the way I 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.550
 It's still up to you to put 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.220
 good, we're going to continue 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.770
 trying to tell Ros staying here and it's the 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.350
 next this one is a little different 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.340
 the system is voting this here in the 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:35.660
 his place 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:39.860
 ready're down here we take that 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:44.810
 here he has a little foot in the future that 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:50.930
 keep her up and inside you go 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:53.120
 put in the case will have a battery you 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.530
 puts battery here instead of those two 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.300
 small daughters 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.760
 This one is a lot more interesting than it is. 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.320
 much later this fishing for a long time 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.200
 much more time 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.340
 if you use ours I'd talk bullshit 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.470
 that if using a battery is alkaline than I 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.030
 I'm telling you this is battery and read. 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.700
 Would it be the people there? 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.470
 but anyway this way it lasts 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.690
 enough the guys then you go fishing 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.980
 all night and only with a battery will 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.560
 left over for another fishery 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.200
 There's a bar here. 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.870
 It is those who excuse and said okay 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.050
