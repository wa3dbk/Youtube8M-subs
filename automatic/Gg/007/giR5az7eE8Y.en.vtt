throughout the year now we're in one of

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.010 
throughout the year now we're in one of
the<00:01:04.280> playground<00:01:04.760> areas<00:01:05.210> which<00:01:05.390> I<00:01:05.540> know<00:01:05.600> is

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
the playground areas which I know is

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.230 
the playground areas which I know is
really<00:01:06.500> popular<00:01:06.890> for<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.310> kids<00:01:07.549> but<00:01:07.729> also<00:01:07.940> the

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
really popular for the kids but also the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.050 
really popular for the kids but also the
parents<00:01:08.870> because<00:01:09.290> you<00:01:09.470> made<00:01:09.740> special<00:01:10.640> areas

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060

from you and you can rest for half an

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.300 
from you and you can rest for half an
hour<00:01:26.870> so<00:01:27.200> while<00:01:27.440> your<00:01:27.560> kid<00:01:27.740> runs<00:01:27.950> off<00:01:28.130> some

hour so while your kid runs off some
energy<00:01:28.660> now<00:01:29.660> I<00:01:30.020> understand<00:01:30.740> there's<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.010> number

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
energy now I understand there's a number

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.120 
energy now I understand there's a number
of<00:01:31.610> new<00:01:31.790> gardens<00:01:32.270> this<00:01:32.540> year<00:01:32.930> 10<00:01:33.470> I<00:01:33.500> think<00:01:33.890> if<00:01:34.010> I

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
of new gardens this year 10 I think if I

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.310 
of new gardens this year 10 I think if I
read<00:01:34.340> correctly<00:01:34.640> including<00:01:35.570> one<00:01:35.870> over<00:01:36.170> in<00:01:36.260> the

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.020 
Elsa and we did it's a challenge but a
fun<00:03:30.650> one<00:03:30.860> now<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.370> we<00:03:31.489> were<00:03:31.580> confident<00:03:31.910> we

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
fun one now and we were confident we

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.430 
fun one now and we were confident we
could<00:03:32.120> do<00:03:32.269> it<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.570> it's<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:32.900> think<00:03:33.140> going<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.320> be

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
could do it and it's I think going to be

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.289 
could do it and it's I think going to be
even<00:03:33.650> more<00:03:33.920> popular<00:03:34.340> than<00:03:34.489> we<00:03:34.610> expected<00:03:35.120> I

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
even more popular than we expected I

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.240 
even more popular than we expected I
think<00:03:36.110> you're<00:03:36.230> probably<00:03:36.440> right<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.070> looks

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
think you're probably right and it looks

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.100 
think you're probably right and it looks
to<00:03:37.370> be<00:03:37.489> another<00:03:37.610> beautiful<00:03:38.180> festival<00:03:38.840> and
