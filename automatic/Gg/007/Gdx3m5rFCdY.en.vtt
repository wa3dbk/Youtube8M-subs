wants a lot more tutorials a lot more

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.300 
wants a lot more tutorials a lot more
gear<00:05:35.510> and<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:36.320> skills<00:05:36.590> actually<00:05:36.950> make<00:05:37.100> more

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
gear and the skills actually make more

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.250 
gear and the skills actually make more
sense<00:05:37.580> now<00:05:37.760> and<00:05:38.270> it's<00:05:38.450> a<00:05:38.510> little<00:05:38.630> bit<00:05:38.750> easy<00:05:38.990> to

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
sense now and it's a little bit easy to

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.350 
sense now and it's a little bit easy to
get<00:05:39.380> along<00:05:39.470> and<00:05:39.680> get<00:05:40.040> into<00:05:40.460> the<00:05:40.580> game<00:05:40.790> so<00:05:41.150> it's

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
get along and get into the game so it's

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.000 
get along and get into the game so it's
definitely<00:05:41.690> worth<00:05:41.960> picking<00:05:41.990> up<00:05:42.530> right<00:05:42.800> now

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
definitely worth picking up right now

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.170 
definitely worth picking up right now

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
else after that it's a lot of gameplay

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.220 
else after that it's a lot of gameplay
for<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:46.669> money<00:05:46.880> definitely<00:05:47.750> get<00:05:47.870> out<00:05:48.020> there
