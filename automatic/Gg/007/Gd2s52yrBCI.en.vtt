 among school students because he is engaged 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.080

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.550
 Mr. Schulze that sounds very little 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.760
 He is a class teacher of a fifth 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.800
 class he still has after teaching 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.920

 consoling and comforting students 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.170
 Helicopter parents calms Mr. Schulze 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.360

 Weeks around with the other teachers

 of the vintage about the classes 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.170
 In addition, he is replacing 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.120
 his lessons in the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.030
 student mats to the current 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.350
 development status of the student 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.870
 Of course, a class would like one 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.140
 christmas party or a zoobesuch in 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.960
 Doing summer with them as well drive 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.590
 he has to blame everyone for a class 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.629
 as well as planning everything by the way 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.989
 almost all of his colleagues, he helps 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.000
 students in the afternoons in ags with 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.979
 additional extra appointment for example 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.270
 for a play or a 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.799
 music performance that takes place in the evening 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.750
 There is something in almost every week 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.180
 Officially there for professional conferences 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.280
 general meetings 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.560
 school committees and educational 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.380
 service meetings city everything 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.810
 in the afternoon if he blames you then 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.119
 Once at home, he sits down immediately 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.729
 at his desk and ready 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.009
 designed his performance course before 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.079
 tests for the little ones and wonders 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.610
 when he gets all the exams 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.180
 Everyone is stacking on his desk 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.159
 should look 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.130
 Mr. Schulze is given after the five 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.290
 School lessons per day often fix and all 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.720
 because the students have a lot of energy 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.180
 pull out and permanently his 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.979
 demand attention 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.110
 why can mister schulze after he vom 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.240
 his additional assignments from school 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.910
 only the lessons for the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.770
 next day prepare everything else 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.250
 stays and waits for the weekend 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.190
 Mr Schulze has some point on him 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.920
 vacation there he can finally everything 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.200
 correct deferred way and reason 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.690
 plan what he will be in the coming time with 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.850
 If the students are lucky, they will do it 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.410
 then he still has time left 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.410
 to recover from school 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.580
 sometimes the schulze realizes that he is quite 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.520
 works a lot he feels tired 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.140
 and she turns pale and over time 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.010
 his work is no fun anymore 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.140
 then he wonders why that is 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.880
 is probably because 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.580
 officially all speak of it that mister 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.470
 Schulze works 24 hours per week 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.230
 Of course that's not true 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.670
 Mr. Schulze works according to the ministry 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.090
 40 hours per week 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.120
 Of course, that's not the case, Herr Schulze 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.570
 works in truth 70 hours per 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.120
 week 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.180
 all things included in it 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.950
 In addition to the lessons we can 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.570
 So understand perfectly that Mr 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.630
 Schulze is annoyed when the 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.650
 society thinks that he is lazy and 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.410
 we can not understand at all 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.860
 why does what Herr Schulze have to do 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.850
 not done by two people 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.370
 after all, this is about the future 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.120
 our country namely the education 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.120
 our children
