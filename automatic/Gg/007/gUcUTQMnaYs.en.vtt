00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
dark however this looks like it's

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.429

growing<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.210> my<00:01:57.299> scalp<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.840> week<00:01:58.049> or

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
growing out of my scalp this week or

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.410 
growing out of my scalp this week or
just<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.829> now<00:01:59.219> I'm<00:01:59.399> happy<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.969> did<00:02:00.240> not

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
just like now I'm happy that I did not

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.380 
just like now I'm happy that I did not
get<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.399> actually<00:02:02.399> they<00:02:02.549> were<00:02:02.610> sold<00:02:03.000> out<00:02:03.240> in

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
get it to actually they were sold out in

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.030 
get it to actually they were sold out in
all<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.689> other<00:02:03.869> colors<00:02:04.290> except<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
all the other colors except for like the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.580 
all the other colors except for like the
blonde<00:02:05.280> color<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.600> really<00:02:06.869> sucks<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.380> if

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
blonde color so that really sucks but if

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.999 
blonde color so that really sucks but if
you<00:02:08.030> even<00:02:09.030> once<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.360> bezel<00:02:09.810> should<00:02:10.679> be<00:02:10.800> your

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
you even once a bezel should be your

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.720 
you even once a bezel should be your
first<00:02:11.160> wig<00:02:11.430> ever<00:02:11.670> if<00:02:11.940> you
