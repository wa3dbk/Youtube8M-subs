00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello friends and welcome to this 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.000
 new blog video the best if 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.030
 any sportsman in your life that I do 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.309
 here live from montelimar where i'm going 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.500
 to run tomorrow the corima drome oise 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.780
 Provencal the first race of the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.480
 season for me to test myself for the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.980
 famous challenge seems to be letting go then 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.410
 today I answer a question 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.710
 that I'm asked often it's finally 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.939
 why work the force for the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.480
 cyclists and for endurance sports 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.440
 strength and care concern bodybuilding 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.780
 at bodybuilding and that's why so 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.260
 why develop the strength for 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.239
 cyclists 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.010
 so for that there are three reasons the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.520
 first is that the force is a 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.140
 component of power forces the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.680
 force times the velocity equals the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.989
 power 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.289
 it's a mathematical formula and the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.030
 power it is clearly related to the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.100
 speed you get the more you are 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.230
 more and more you can go faster than 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.579
 whether on the flat or in cotton side 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.980
 did not talk about the power weight ratio 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.080
 but it's always related to your 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.460
 power so how to develop this 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.040
 low power either by increasing the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.100
 velocity but velocity on a run 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.299
 from three to four five hours she goes fast 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.790
 be limited to 80 85 90 maybe 100 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.820
 rpm for a pro but that's 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.530
 quickly limited while the force 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.110
 it's a variable that you can do 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.840
 gradually increase in steps 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.210
 also today you lift 100 kg 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.229
 at the squat for example you can raised 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.290
 120 kg 102 what kg 110 kg 120 kg 120 kg 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.369
 it's 20% more strength and the same 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.100
 velocity 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.860
 it's almost 20% power in 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.479
 more imagine almost go important 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.340
 the faster it is not negligible 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.229
 okay so we see very quickly that the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.780
 potential for progression for strength 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.700
 is still more important even if the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.799
 vinosity for reasons we already have 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.049
 evoked in the best cyclosportive 1 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.909
 for the oxygenation of the muscles the 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.710
 longevity the pedaling frequency which 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.689
 allows you to skip the neutral and 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.040
 his lands but velocity is a 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.360
 important point the strength 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.959
 it is a point of development 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.970
 almost with the biggest potential 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.790
 the second point 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.930
 is that even if the bike is a sport 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.300
 endurance 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.320
 well it's clear that the more I'm going 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.080
 develop my strength 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.150
 the more I can go quickly 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.660
 very simple examples if today I 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.450
 am able 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.090
 again to put 100 of which 100 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.520
 kg of pressure on the pedal so that this 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.150
 be so easy so in endurance I 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.040
 will ride 100% but sheep at 50 60 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.720
 % of my maximum 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.480
 so let's make it simple at 50 kg if 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.480
 I increase my maximum strength ie 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.110
 of 100 hp able to go to 120 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:55.760
 Ben my 50% of 120 password to 60 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.860
 kg and so I increase the strength that I 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.490
 put on the pedal so the power that 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.940
 I will develop 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.200
 ok so increase my maximum strength even 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.820
 for a cyclist in endurance sports 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.820
 is today in all sports 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.790
 endurance running swimming 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.860
 obviously cycling betrayed them all 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.930
 world strengthens his muscles for a 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.760
 general strengthening but also for 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.120
 develop his power because more 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.110
 I am strong and much more an effort to 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:27.140
 50% good lets me go faster or 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.519
 to get tired less agree if I 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.180
 able to lift 120 kg like 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.950
 publisher 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.900
 when I'm going to make an effort 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.300
 50 kg equivalent I really 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.100
 the impression of being easy so I'm going 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.380
 as fast as before but as I am 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.989
 easy I spoke longer and then 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.299
 the third reason that these 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.709
 recent years the work of strength and 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.170
 much developed in cyclists 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.090
 with the first two I indicated and 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.010
 well it's just that we have 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.519
 discovered ways to develop the 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.930
 strength developed sense of muscle without 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.030
 to take muscle mass 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.660
 yes you have heard of course we can 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.220
 develop strength without getting fat even at 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.080
 muscle level even though again 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.610
 take lean mass mass 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.830
 muscle that allows you to surpass yourself 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.400
 it's less annoying than taking 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.269
 fat mass 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.830
 I think as a sports cyclo 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.570
 amateurs who have activities next door 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.440
 of family life responsibilities 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.080
 professional 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.669
 we all have a bit of fat that around ten 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.050
 belly after quarantine or 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.370
 otherwise okay and it happened 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.110
 it's not interesting to take the 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.400
 lean mass is less annoying but 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.590
 it is true that we can say that if he 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.539
 does a lot of bodybuilding things 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.590
 who make me take the mass 30 of the 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.270
 force I risk taking the mass 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.640
 muscular but in fact no one can 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.580
 increase strength strength endurance 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.140
 agree and significantly and 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.180
 132 muscle mass 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.400
 that I will come back to it in more detail in 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.690
 a next video is very 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.680
 soon with, in particular, 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.840
 very training methods 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.669
 interesting but for you know that 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.190
 Roughly take you take strength 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.460
 what do you have work for 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.820
 bodybuilding so with movements 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.110
 specific 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.330
 we have already talked about a better 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.099
 cyclosportive of your life besides I 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.289
 you just put below the link of 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:11.930
 the article I had made two articles 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:14.780
 I had done for the fifteen golden rule 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.430
 to be successful in bodybuilding for 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.140
 well training you bodybuilding is 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.030
 things to consider 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.479
 okay so it's clear that indoor 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.030
 that you train in bodybuilding 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.900
 she's gaining strength second means of 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.280
 to gain strength 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.250
 well it's doing workouts 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.340
 on bike so this is like 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.660
 things we've seen together but on 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.820
 bike that with a pedaling frequency 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.620
 weak enough put a little gear 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.539
 matter the robber because it's about 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.310
 the dish or who will not be the same 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.560
 but the idea is to turn the legs 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.590
 between 50 and 60 talent per minute 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.360
 So I tah turned on the course you 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.599
 are coming to turn your legs between 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.970
 50 and 75 minutes putting in well the 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.560
 pressure on the entire cycle of pedaling to 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.650
 the descent as the ascent in the 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.479
 thrust phase in front of traction and 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.849
 trying to roll people well 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:06.680
 win the upper body for no shake 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.720
 okay again I'll come back 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.260
 in details later and then there are 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.750
 other methods that are today 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.070
 who are extremely powerful 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.400
 that is, they take us little 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.740
 tired time - you muscle up your 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.909
 organism and that yet allow 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.500
 to obtain better results 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.289
 here is so do not hesitate to do the 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.149
 strength 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:28.169
 during your recovery period actually 

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:30.210
 during all periods of you 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.520
 work stamina is a great 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.379
 complement a great exercise against 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.249
 avoid working the force during 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:37.499
 periods of you work the 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:40.080
 split it's a double 

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:42.899
 solicitation of muscles that risk 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.569
 to cause injuries that's but 

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:47.789
 again all this we'll see more 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:50.430
 late precisely I wish you a 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:51.839
 good evening i 'm telling you now to 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.520
 all of you and see you soon for a 

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:56.779
 next video on the blog the best 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.779
 Cyclosportive of your life
