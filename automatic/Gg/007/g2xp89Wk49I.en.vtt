 is to do nothing here to give her doing more than the minister herself and 160 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.959
 and in case you think the sound got worse with more sizzle something like this 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.079
 can speak 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.460
 that in the near future is something that was never ancient 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.529
 our sack was you as usual 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.419
 because the games launches 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.470
 but the observation that of the form what was the game is a very expected game 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.119
 it was highly anticipated from them 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.990
 and has already leaked act Lord 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.440

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.610
 it's a good 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.020
 the category of downloads

 because recovery from injury is precipitating because this may be more 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.810
 here from the actions 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.810

 I'll post or 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.870
 the politician is here 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.060
 each one or another leaving the description of the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.240
 because it is a program that has that it would be good 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.649
 and the act of yours put in the same bajaki that he is a program 100% 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.320
 free, so no problem 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.550
 half deyvid and turns betrayal very few years 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.320

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.010
 choose your video 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.010
 in case my own here is formatted in itu 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.829
 and here is the dresses 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.260

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.029
 He will come here every day. 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:17.389
 break process reaps height and the 20 regulator did so it will stay the 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.469
 carnaboi to the original bull of the video you downloaded 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.309
 here we did the same thing 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.639
 sheen monkey that is practically not 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.410
 and here as satan suppression 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.559
 leaves this sentence only 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:29.529
 the rock 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.400
 here you choose the destination I'll leave it at 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.679
 work arias 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.249
 the rock 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:36.029
 huh 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.029
 This program he just played with me was 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.069
 The sad case here in the processes 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:52.089
 They will do it again. 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.090
 little melles mendonça is well it will leave the basic scheme 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.889
 here we see per second 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:05.679
 this program here 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:07.569
 I do not know if it's just me 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.629
 for being a deficiency of it 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.249
 that when you buy from every name it makes new talents 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:18.010
 so let's go because your video has three minutes it will take longer or 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.349
 less a three and a half minutes that converts it 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.269
 but this one so little - all cases were defended 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.479
 he was fast 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.439
 I think the average of 130 dogs per second 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.209
 then after that finishes this procedure 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.249
 you take the 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:35.769
 the video in dublin and his and will put that the blocks does not increase already goes 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.769
 execute the couple here with the setut program for you 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.049
 now by the ethical robe 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:48.149
 this program 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:52.399
 here honest that was reelected six place the link of the dew tour for example 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.669
 if you want to download network 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.049
 which I think deprecated that the grass 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.079
 have here 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.209
 and I will have 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.149
 this in the newest option 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:03.209
 If Caesar uses your video 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.369
 here in the case in my vein 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:08.219
 selects your option from ablv 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:09.510
 this year's choice 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.439
 I'm going to leave seven bands playing ok. 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.009
 converts 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:17.009
 to start converts normally 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:20.689
 I'm going to cancel it until here, just show it to you. 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.729
 but that ended by our has given point 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.599
 the pike that was incomplete 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.639
 Let's have the video for you at least the beginning. 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:35.059
 So you see this one is the avaí 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.050
 and he knows it 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.050
 keep show you properties 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:50.349
 on the list that had converted due to the snow 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.110
 Wow, the video's the same to you. 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.110
 the quality remains the same 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.120
 wanted to gm your collection 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.180
 show here for you christian in dublin and see 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.309
 so tense shepherd that property 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.520
 Is this procedure there? 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.809
 interferes in anything in the export this is because many people 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:31.320
 have already been banned or are afraid to enter live 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.770
 no longer be banned 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.340
 this consecrates itself to cut 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.830
 movies came well 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.889
 so when we get to the jon movie and usually on avi or dvd 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.039
 so we make this kind of conversion sense every miner 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.509
 putting stack of assemblies annually 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.509
 has nothing to do with banishment has nothing because of water 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.110
 How can we not lower the part 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.300
 We do the video conversion. 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.389
 and ready 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:59.069
 I'll show you a solution. 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.069
 how does the video stay? 

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:03.819
 it's the homeland 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:05.680
 giving continuity that someone 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.110
 or subtitle 6 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.550
 from tacna 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.550
 Disagree with who knows, right? 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.599
 kubiske through contact and every time see me 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:18.059
 he waits 

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:21.059
 It's in case you did not download 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:23.729
 and who is the chosen one 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.089
 six of this year 

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:28.649
 the body of your television transforms according to your overturned vehicle 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:33.770
 I got it, you can see it here. 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.779
 it does not lose its validity 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.330
 when I make this request from the governor 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.059
 I do everything, cool. 

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:43.059
 it's a wonderful thing 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.919
 What I'm going to let some time for you to see 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:50.729
 also give a little of the goal 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:52.659
 and I'm going to leave a mistake 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:55.369
 the name of the goalkeeper canal telemundo 

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:56.569
 my video of him 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:59.569
 there are several of them 

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:04.189
 our debut for the tour 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:07.300
 the coming fact 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.119
 making it clear that it works in the flower street 

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:13.119
 there in my hand so normal 

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:14.839
 then that's it 

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:16.509
 just converted upload 

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:17.659
 each leader 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:19.800
 There is nothing 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.710
 the themes the group wants the 20%
