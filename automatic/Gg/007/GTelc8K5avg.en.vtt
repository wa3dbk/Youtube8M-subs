think<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:40.720> is<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.019> sort<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.319> an<00:02:41.470> oasis

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
think this is the sort of an oasis

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.710 
think this is the sort of an oasis
somebody<00:02:42.370> who's<00:02:42.519> never<00:02:42.730> used<00:02:43.120> computers

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
somebody who's never used computers

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.259 
somebody who's never used computers
could<00:02:44.349> figure<00:02:44.650> out<00:02:44.769> how<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.069> use<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.670> five

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
could figure out how to use in five

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.059 
could figure out how to use in five
minutes<00:02:46.480> ten<00:02:47.049> minutes<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.470> that's<00:02:47.590> really<00:02:47.920> a

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
minutes ten minutes and that's really a

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.729 
minutes ten minutes and that's really a
major<00:02:48.340> step<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:48.879> guess<00:02:49.720> my<00:02:49.750> first<00:02:50.170> big<00:02:50.409> question

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
major step I guess my first big question

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.440 
major step I guess my first big question
is<00:02:50.859> I<00:02:51.069> know<00:02:51.250> how<00:02:51.489> well<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.790> works<00:02:52.000> when<00:02:52.239> you<00:02:52.299> can

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
is I know how well it works when you can

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.990 
is I know how well it works when you can
do<00:02:52.569> this<00:02:52.720> right<00:02:53.379> or<00:02:53.620> some<00:02:54.579> of<00:02:54.609> these<00:02:54.700> devices

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
do this right or some of these devices

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.030 
do this right or some of these devices
you<00:02:55.150> can<00:02:55.209> just<00:02:55.420> pull<00:02:55.569> it<00:02:55.659> off<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.049> on<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.650> tablet

you can just pull it off and on a tablet

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.619 
you can just pull it off and on a tablet
it'll<00:02:57.250> be<00:02:57.340> absolutely<00:02:57.430> fine<00:02:57.970> yeah<00:02:58.359> how<00:02:58.569> would

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
it'll be absolutely fine yeah how would

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.539 
it'll be absolutely fine yeah how would
it<00:02:58.900> work<00:02:58.930> necessarily<00:02:59.739> with<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.069> keyboard
