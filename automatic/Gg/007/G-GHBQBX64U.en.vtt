speed<00:04:54.360> let's<00:04:55.360> check<00:04:55.509> it<00:04:55.630> out<00:04:59.099> mmm<00:05:00.720> 56.7<00:05:01.720> pretty

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
speed let's check it out mmm 56.7 pretty

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.390 
speed let's check it out mmm 56.7 pretty
consistent<00:05:03.310> here<00:05:03.460> so<00:05:03.729> uh<00:05:03.900> maybe<00:05:04.900> I'll<00:05:05.050> try<00:05:05.259> a

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
consistent here so uh maybe I'll try a

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.080 
consistent here so uh maybe I'll try a
little<00:05:06.400> bit<00:05:06.520> different<00:05:06.789> here

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
little bit different here

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.270 
little bit different here
maybe<00:05:07.449> 3176<00:05:08.319> and<00:05:08.620> see<00:05:08.979> where<00:05:09.099> we<00:05:09.160> go<00:05:09.250> from

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
maybe 3176 and see where we go from

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.860 
maybe 3176 and see where we go from
there<00:05:09.550> tune<00:05:09.910> in<00:05:10.060> next<00:05:10.090> time
