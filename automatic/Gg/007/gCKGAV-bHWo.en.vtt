00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.690
 do something we have to wait for the or 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.060
 that we will occupy in a place where we do not 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.520
 are going to erase you keep it in 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.520
 where they want now if we click on 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.010
 change and this window will appear here 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.200
 we choose the or that comes in the folder and 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.110
 we wait for the changes to be applied 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.620
 once this message appears 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.629
 say that we can close the program 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.060
 well the following will be the animated bar 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.519
 we open this folder and you will see that inside 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.560
 comes the program it's just a matter of 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.370
 double click on this icon and it 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.370
 will open the bar 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.069
 to you all the icons 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.660
 they will appear with question marks 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.790
 this is because the program will not find 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.010
 the applications that I put in their 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.319
 computers is just a matter of 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.569
 drag them out to remove them 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.090
 and if you want to add more just do what 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.370
 opposite and ready now click right 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.860
 and then click on dock options 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.230
 this is to configure the bar you 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.450
 configure everything to your liking I do not 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.060
 I will teach step by step because it 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.950
 would lengthen the video too much but it does not 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.440
 worry that it is very easy to configure 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.110
 this bar now is just a matter of 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.630
 your tastes 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.060
 the next thing that we will put will be the theme 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.030
 we opened this folder and copied all 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.730
 the files that are inside after us 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.240
 we're going to team and local disk now 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.240
 windows 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.280
 then we look for the folder to be solved 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.990
 now the folder you have and in here 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.450
 we paste all the files that we copy 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.450
 you will not ask for replacement 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.620
 and ready now yes they already have the themes 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.230
 installed before putting them I'll put 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.970
 the wallpapers 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.970
 [Music] 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.810

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:05.919

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.919
 put whatever they want 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.099

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:15.169
 customize here we go down and 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.449

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:23.050
 the 6 also in very few things so 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.050
 there is not much difference 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.929
