about birthdays choices next is to it's
a<00:00:14.849> long<00:00:14.969> way<00:00:15.120> off<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.929> they're<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> lot<00:00:16.109> of

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
a long way off and they're a lot of

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.960 
a long way off and they're a lot of
other<00:00:16.379> factors<00:00:16.590> involved<00:00:16.949> but<00:00:17.250> if<00:00:17.760> he<00:00:17.910> starts

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
other factors involved but if he starts

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.880 
other factors involved but if he starts
takes<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.570> hear<00:00:18.690> what<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.050> think<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.410> his

takes to hear what you think is his

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.270 
takes to hear what you think is his
chances<00:00:20.340> are<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.730> room

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.280 
chances are in that room

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.740 
chances are in that room
I<00:00:22.480> think<00:00:23.480> it's<00:00:23.570> good<00:00:24.700> sushi<00:00:25.700> well<00:00:26.530> after<00:00:27.530> all

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
I think it's good sushi well after all

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.550 
I think it's good sushi well after all
that's<00:00:29.080> fine<00:00:29.610> some<00:00:30.610> human<00:00:30.940> sins<00:00:31.180> then<00:00:31.560> my

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
that's fine some human sins then my

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.790 
that's fine some human sins then my
childhood<00:00:33.040> so

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
childhood so

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.960 
childhood so
what<00:00:35.800> do<00:00:35.860> you<00:00:35.920> think<00:00:36.070> of<00:00:36.100> the<00:00:36.190> first<00:00:36.399> week<00:00:36.700> is

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
what do you think of the first week is

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.120 
what do you think of the first week is
Houston<00:00:37.930> hats<00:00:38.260> but<00:00:38.530> they<00:00:38.650> could<00:00:38.800> be<00:00:38.829> a<00:00:38.920> bit

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
Houston hats but they could be a bit

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:45.220 
Houston hats but they could be a bit
surprised<00:00:39.430> that<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:41.770> start

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.960 

go<00:00:45.500> to<00:00:45.560> the<00:00:45.710> cosine<00:00:46.250> to<00:00:46.430> Indies<00:00:48.460> very<00:00:49.460> exciting

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
go to the cosine to Indies very exciting

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.240 
go to the cosine to Indies very exciting
is<00:00:50.750> incomparable<00:00:51.170> to<00:00:51.410> any<00:00:51.559> of<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:51.829> tour<00:00:52.040> that

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
is incomparable to any of the tour that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.980 
is incomparable to any of the tour that
you<00:00:52.430> wrote<00:00:54.430> is<00:00:55.430> different<00:00:56.000> I<00:00:56.440> us<00:00:57.440> tonight

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
you wrote is different I us tonight

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.450 
you wrote is different I us tonight
there's<00:00:59.990> not<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:00.380> many<00:01:00.500> mounted<00:01:00.920> finishes<00:01:01.310> and

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
there's not so many mounted finishes and

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.980 
there's not so many mounted finishes and
there's<00:01:01.610> a<00:01:01.640> lot<00:01:01.790> of<00:01:01.820> lots<00:01:02.270> of<00:01:02.390> time<00:01:02.600> trialing

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
there's a lot of lots of time trialing

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.560 
there's a lot of lots of time trialing
in<00:01:03.110> this<00:01:03.230> year's<00:01:03.440> race<00:01:04.030> perhaps<00:01:05.030> it<00:01:05.390> goes

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
in this year's race perhaps it goes

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.740 
in this year's race perhaps it goes
against<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.320> chances<00:01:06.710> of<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.950> collect<00:01:07.220> do<00:01:08.000> we

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
against the chances of the collect do we

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.560 
against the chances of the collect do we
do<00:01:09.100> well<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.340> can<00:01:10.640> you<00:01:10.820> could<00:01:10.940> say<00:01:11.180> that<00:01:11.210> they

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
do well you can you could say that they

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.140 
do well you can you could say that they
have<00:01:11.600> strong<00:01:12.020> team<00:01:12.260> and<00:01:12.590> they<00:01:13.070> have<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.430> raise

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
have strong team and they have to raise

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.720 
have strong team and they have to raise
differently

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.810 

so<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.870> can<00:01:19.560> make<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> roll

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
so I can make it roll

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.460 
so I can make it roll
but<00:01:22.820> that<00:01:22.940> could<00:01:23.120> help<00:01:23.390> perhaps<00:01:24.140> because

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
but that could help perhaps because

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.470 
but that could help perhaps because
obviously<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.460> other<00:01:25.640> come<00:01:26.030> second<00:01:26.360> and

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
obviously the other come second and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.940 
obviously the other come second and
third<00:01:26.720> a<00:01:26.750> couple<00:01:27.080> of<00:01:27.140> our<00:01:27.260> hands<00:01:27.470> one<00:01:27.620> second

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
third a couple of our hands one second

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.310 
third a couple of our hands one second
if<00:01:28.010> he<00:01:28.100> joins<00:01:28.250> me<00:01:29.060> on<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.240> very<00:01:29.420> to<00:01:29.540> get<00:01:30.230> the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
if he joins me on the very to get the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.020 
if he joins me on the very to get the
help<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.830> fact<00:01:31.010> that<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.250> room<00:01:31.700> is<00:01:31.730> almost

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
help of the fact that the room is almost

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.960 
help of the fact that the room is almost
a<00:01:32.360> slightly<00:01:32.930> unpredictable<00:01:33.670> than<00:01:34.670> they<00:01:34.820> have

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
a slightly unpredictable than they have

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.610 
a slightly unpredictable than they have
to<00:01:35.120> top<00:01:35.270> think<00:01:35.480> outside<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.810> box<00:01:36.080> or<00:01:36.290> changeup

to top think outside the box or changeup

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.290 
to top think outside the box or changeup
there's<00:01:36.830> actually<00:01:37.100> after<00:01:37.580> they're<00:01:37.790> forced<00:01:38.210> to

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
there's actually after they're forced to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.340 
there's actually after they're forced to
know<00:01:38.570> I<00:01:38.780> think<00:01:38.870> that's<00:01:39.170> great<00:01:39.380> for<00:01:41.230> within<00:01:42.230> the

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
know I think that's great for within the
