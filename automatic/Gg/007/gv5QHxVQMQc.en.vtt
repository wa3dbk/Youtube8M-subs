00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 
that just means the game's not totally

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.100 
that just means the game's not totally
over<00:07:25.349> um<00:07:25.770> if<00:07:26.699> it<00:07:27.000> was<00:07:27.120> like<00:07:27.270> you<00:07:27.360> know<00:07:27.509> moon

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 
would have been totally over as they

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.850 
would have been totally over as they
would<00:07:33.000> I<00:07:33.030> mouth<00:07:33.240> anything<00:07:33.659> there<00:07:33.870> and<00:07:34.050> happy

would I mouth anything there and happy

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.279 
would I mouth anything there and happy
got<00:07:35.039> clean<00:07:35.250> wipe<00:07:35.659> but<00:07:36.659> because<00:07:37.139> of<00:07:37.229> those

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:37.289 
got clean wipe but because of those

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:39.409 
got clean wipe but because of those
micro<00:07:37.620> mistakes<00:07:38.039> while<00:07:38.819> we<00:07:38.969> still<00:07:39.210> went<00:07:39.330> ahead

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419 
micro mistakes while we still went ahead

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:42.019 
micro mistakes while we still went ahead
in<00:07:39.599> that<00:07:39.779> fight<00:07:40.020> um<00:07:40.620> I<00:07:41.279> think<00:07:41.430> losing<00:07:41.819> his

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:42.029 
in that fight um I think losing his

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:44.120 
in that fight um I think losing his
forklift<00:07:42.360> means<00:07:42.630> is<00:07:42.750> much<00:07:42.960> worst<00:07:43.259> and<00:07:43.590> then

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.130 
forklift means is much worst and then

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.279 
forklift means is much worst and then
what<00:07:44.279> happened<00:07:44.580> to<00:07:44.669> us<00:07:44.729> because<00:07:45.690> we<00:07:45.870> solve<00:07:46.110> an

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:46.289 
what happened to us because we solve an

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:47.600 
what happened to us because we solve an
army<00:07:46.560> and<00:07:46.650> they<00:07:46.889> don't<00:07:47.009> have<00:07:47.130> their<00:07:47.400> and<00:07:47.550> I

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:47.610 
army and they don't have their and I

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.269 
army and they don't have their and I
think<00:07:47.909> um<00:07:48.650> you<00:07:49.650> know<00:07:49.740> there's<00:07:49.949> still<00:07:50.039> a<00:07:50.159> little

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:50.279 
think um you know there's still a little

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:54.050 
think um you know there's still a little
bit<00:07:50.430> in<00:07:50.580> the<00:07:50.699> game<00:07:52.550> so<00:07:53.550> right<00:07:53.729> now<00:07:53.759> we<00:07:53.909> just

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.060 
bit in the game so right now we just

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.510 
bit in the game so right now we just
crept<00:07:54.270> on<00:07:54.419> my<00:07:54.539> expansion<00:07:54.810> we<00:07:55.710> actually<00:07:56.340> heard

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 
crept on my expansion we actually heard

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.399 
crept on my expansion we actually heard
that<00:07:56.580> the<00:07:56.849> blade<00:07:57.090> master<00:07:57.300> may<00:07:57.960> hear<00:07:58.139> that<00:07:58.289> win

00:07:58.399 --> 00:07:58.409 
that the blade master may hear that win

00:07:58.409 --> 00:08:01.940 
that the blade master may hear that win
walks<00:07:58.620> around<00:07:58.979> and<00:07:59.219> so<00:07:59.909> I
