00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
its traction control system and I would

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.790 
its traction control system and I would
expect<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:14.210> Audi<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.810> get<00:01:14.960> dropped<00:01:15.880> initially

expect the Audi to get dropped initially

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.340 
expect the Audi to get dropped initially
to<00:01:18.800> then<00:01:18.979> get<00:01:19.190> really<00:01:19.610> really<00:01:20.030> badly<00:01:20.570> spanked

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350

by the Ducati up to about 120 and then

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.240 
by the Ducati up to about 120 and then
maybe<00:01:25.490> start<00:01:25.759> to<00:01:26.090> make<00:01:26.330> its<00:01:26.509> way<00:01:26.630> back<00:01:27.250> beyond

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
hundred and thirty before me but the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.360 
hundred and thirty before me but the
Audi<00:02:25.300> was<00:02:25.600> just<00:02:25.990> starting<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.620> come<00:02:26.830> back<00:02:26.860> and

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
Audi was just starting to come back and

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.980 
Audi was just starting to come back and
I<00:02:27.760> definitely<00:02:28.710> came<00:02:29.710> to<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:29.890> stop<00:02:30.840> sooner<00:02:31.840> than

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
I definitely came to a stop sooner than

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.890 
I definitely came to a stop sooner than
Chris<00:02:32.940> that's<00:02:33.940> really<00:02:34.180> interesting<00:02:34.660> I

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
Chris that's really interesting I

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.110 
Chris that's really interesting I
actually<00:02:35.620> think<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.070> Audi<00:02:36.220> has<00:02:36.430> gone<00:02:36.670> just

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
actually think the Audi has gone just

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.790 
actually think the Audi has gone just
slightly<00:02:38.080> quicker<00:02:38.410> on<00:02:39.040> overall<00:02:39.640> time<00:02:40.800> that's

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
slightly quicker on overall time that's

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.699 
slightly quicker on overall time that's
bad

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
bad

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.349 
bad
we'll<00:02:44.219> have<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.459> have<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.609> look<00:02:44.730> at<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:44.969> data<00:02:45.180> to

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
we'll have to have a look at the data to

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.229 
we'll have to have a look at the data to
see<00:02:45.480> but<00:02:46.159> basically<00:02:47.159> what<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.760> what<00:02:47.969> it<00:02:48.000> felt

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
see but basically what it what it felt

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.099 
see but basically what it what it felt
like<00:02:48.329> was<00:02:48.659> that<00:02:48.689> the<00:02:48.989> Ducati<00:02:49.790> absolutely<00:02:51.079> is<00:02:52.079> a

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
like was that the Ducati absolutely is a

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.410 
like was that the Ducati absolutely is a
way<00:02:52.409> to<00:02:52.469> begin<00:02:52.769> with<00:02:53.129> even<00:02:54.090> though<00:02:54.209> there<00:02:54.390> are

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
way to begin with even though there are

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.630 
way to begin with even though there are
8s<00:02:54.870> four-wheel<00:02:55.230> drive<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.829> as<00:02:56.189> traction

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
8s four-wheel drive and as traction

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.640 
8s four-wheel drive and as traction
control<00:02:56.969> etc<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.930> bikes<00:02:58.140> got<00:02:58.379> traction

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
control etc the bikes got traction

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.410 
control etc the bikes got traction
control<00:02:59.069> as<00:02:59.189> well<00:02:59.340> actually<00:02:59.489> but<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.180> don't

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
control as well actually but I don't

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.410 
control as well actually but I don't
think<00:03:00.569> he's<00:03:00.659> using<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:02.489> it's<00:03:02.700> got<00:03:02.849> abs<00:03:03.120> not

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
think he's using it and it's got abs not

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.629 
think he's using it and it's got abs not
anything<00:03:03.569> is<00:03:03.719> using<00:03:03.989> that<00:03:04.109> either<00:03:04.319> but<00:03:05.129> to

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
anything is using that either but to

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.369 
anything is using that either but to
begin<00:03:05.790> with<00:03:05.969> the<00:03:06.239> bike<00:03:06.389> just<00:03:06.599> goes<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.230> then

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
begin with the bike just goes and then

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.679 
begin with the bike just goes and then
it<00:03:07.409> goes<00:03:07.650> even<00:03:08.040> further<00:03:08.430> away<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.090> then<00:03:09.389> at

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
it goes even further away and then at

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:15.319 
it goes even further away and then at
about<00:03:11.150> 120<00:03:12.150> ish<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:14.250> just<00:03:14.579> feels<00:03:14.849> as<00:03:15.060> if<00:03:15.180> the

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
about 120 ish it just feels as if the

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.569 
about 120 ish it just feels as if the
Audi<00:03:15.480> starting<00:03:16.049> to<00:03:16.109> come<00:03:16.349> back<00:03:16.579> well

Audi starting to come back well

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.149 
Audi starting to come back well
basically<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.150> Audi's<00:03:18.450> not<00:03:18.750> really<00:03:19.260> stopping

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
basically the Audi's not really stopping

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.780 
basically the Audi's not really stopping
accelerating<00:03:21.030> whereas<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:22.169> bike<00:03:22.379> the<00:03:23.189> Diavel

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
accelerating whereas the bike the Diavel

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.149 
accelerating whereas the bike the Diavel
because<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.389> hasn't<00:03:24.540> got<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.840> kind<00:03:25.109> of<00:03:25.230> classic

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
because it hasn't got a kind of classic

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.360 
because it hasn't got a kind of classic

when<00:04:53.880> you<00:04:54.000> don't<00:04:54.270> know<00:04:54.510> it<00:04:54.960> but<00:04:55.500> when<00:04:55.680> you're

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
when you don't know it but when you're

when you don't know it but when you're
doing<00:04:56.070> it<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.400> bike<00:04:57.289> just<00:04:58.289> disappears<00:04:58.860> with

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
doing it the bike just disappears with

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.690 
doing it the bike just disappears with
yes<00:04:59.550> it's<00:05:00.270> that<00:05:00.479> when<00:05:01.020> you

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
yes it's that when you

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.970 
yes it's that when you
for<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.150> drafter<00:05:02.630> it's<00:05:03.200> that<00:05:03.410> last<00:05:03.680> little

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
for the drafter it's that last little

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.550 
for the drafter it's that last little
bit<00:05:04.130> from<00:05:04.490> 100<00:05:04.820> miles<00:05:04.940> an<00:05:05.120> hour<00:05:05.240> up<00:05:05.750> to<00:05:05.810> 150

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.190 
bit from 100 miles an hour up to 150
yeah<00:05:07.310> and<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:07.820> look<00:05:07.940> here<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.510> this<00:05:08.960> this

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
yeah and you look here and this this

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.590 
yeah and you look here and this this
graph<00:05:09.470> climbs<00:05:09.860> up<00:05:10.090> see<00:05:11.090> there<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.420> bike

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
graph climbs up see there the bike

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.750 
graph climbs up see there the bike
levels<00:05:11.930> out<00:05:12.110> that<00:05:12.740> is<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:12.980> one<00:05:13.160> part<00:05:13.310> keeps

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
levels out that is the one part keeps

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.670 
levels out that is the one part keeps
going<00:05:14.120> and<00:05:14.210> that's<00:05:14.300> just<00:05:14.600> one<00:05:14.840> bit<00:05:15.020> where<00:05:15.500> it

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680
