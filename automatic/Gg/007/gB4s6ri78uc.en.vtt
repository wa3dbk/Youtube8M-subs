00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
back and forth until we have continuity

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.430 
back and forth until we have continuity
and<00:01:37.010> one<00:01:38.010> thing<00:01:38.220> about<00:01:38.600> these<00:01:39.600> maple<00:01:39.960> shells

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
and one thing about these maple shells

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.160 
and one thing about these maple shells
is<00:01:40.940> that<00:01:41.940> they<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> very<00:01:42.570> nice<00:01:42.810> grain

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
is that they have a very nice grain

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.760 
is that they have a very nice grain

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
pattern so last thing we want to do is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.090 
pattern so last thing we want to do is
cover<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.220> grain<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:48.000> excess<00:01:48.480> stain

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
cover the grain with with excess stain

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.700

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
and they stand up very nicely we just

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.089 
and they stand up very nicely we just

want to gather too much stain and by the
way<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.459> stain<00:02:54.700> I'm<00:02:54.849> using<00:02:55.030> right<00:02:55.269> now<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.630> a

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
way the stain I'm using right now is a

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.289 
way the stain I'm using right now is a
water-based<00:02:56.110> stain<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:57.030> water-based<00:02:58.030> dye

water-based stain a water-based dye

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.640 
water-based stain a water-based dye
actually<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.200> it's<00:02:59.950> very<00:03:00.160> forgiving<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:02.230> if

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
actually and it's very forgiving so if

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.550 
actually and it's very forgiving so if
this<00:03:02.920> were<00:03:03.129> alcohol<00:03:03.730> or<00:03:04.690> lacquer<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.440> would

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
this were alcohol or lacquer it would

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.729 
this were alcohol or lacquer it would
dry<00:03:05.799> extremely<00:03:06.430> quickly<00:03:06.849> and<00:03:07.470> it's<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.560> good

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
dry extremely quickly and it's a good

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.180 
dry extremely quickly and it's a good
possibility<00:03:08.950> winding<00:03:09.849> up<00:03:09.940> with<00:03:10.890> streaks<00:03:11.890> or

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
possibility winding up with streaks or

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.390 
possibility winding up with streaks or
blotches<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:13.510> don't<00:03:13.780> want<00:03:14.220> because<00:03:15.220> that

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
blotches it you don't want because that

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.910 
blotches it you don't want because that
would<00:03:15.519> require<00:03:16.290> you're<00:03:17.290> taking<00:03:17.590> your<00:03:17.739> drum

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
would require you're taking your drum

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.330 
would require you're taking your drum
and<00:03:18.069> Sandy<00:03:18.430> in<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.549> lab<00:03:18.879> again<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:21.130> goes

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
and Sandy in the lab again so it goes

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.349 
and Sandy in the lab again so it goes
rather<00:03:21.549> quickly<00:03:22.030> as<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:22.329> can<00:03:22.450> see<00:03:24.000> our<00:03:25.000> first

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
rather quickly as you can see our first

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.860 
rather quickly as you can see our first
coat<00:03:25.630> is<00:03:25.900> actually<00:03:26.829> done<00:03:27.040> on<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.220> snare<00:03:27.579> drum

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870

the wood this is a very long process
it's<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:38.620> begin<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.519> first<00:03:39.730> of<00:03:39.970> four<00:03:40.540> or<00:03:40.630> five
