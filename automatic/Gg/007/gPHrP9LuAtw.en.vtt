Constellation<00:00:06.240> from<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.540> doomsday<00:00:06.930> machine

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
Constellation from the doomsday machine

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.480 
Constellation from the doomsday machine
and<00:00:09.260> made<00:00:10.260> some<00:00:10.620> progress<00:00:10.800> since<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.309> last

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
and made some progress since the last

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.980 
and made some progress since the last
video<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:12.120> have<00:00:12.840> actually<00:00:14.360> got<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.509> major<00:00:15.690> self

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
video I have actually got the major self

video I have actually got the major self
assemblies<00:00:16.410> put<00:00:16.440> together<00:00:16.850> my<00:00:18.020> people<00:00:19.020> might

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
assemblies put together my people might

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.080 
assemblies put together my people might
think<00:00:19.199> okay<00:00:19.740> not<00:00:20.130> too<00:00:20.250> much<00:00:20.400> further<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.060> go

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
think okay not too much further to go

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.920 
think okay not too much further to go
for<00:00:21.539> paint<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.900> stuff<00:00:22.140> but<00:00:23.480> well<00:00:24.480> there's<00:00:24.840> a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
for paint and stuff but well there's a

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.750 
for paint and stuff but well there's a
few<00:00:25.050> minor<00:00:25.350> tweaks<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.859> still<00:00:26.070> got<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.460> but<00:00:26.699> i

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
few minor tweaks I still got to do but i

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.460 
few minor tweaks I still got to do but i
thought<00:00:26.939> i<00:00:27.000> would<00:00:27.269> show<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.810> update<00:00:28.170> video

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
thought i would show this update video

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.140 
thought i would show this update video
to<00:00:28.560> show<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.010> i<00:00:29.189> am<00:00:29.429> making<00:00:29.760> pretty<00:00:30.060> good

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
to show that i am making pretty good

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.870 
to show that i am making pretty good
progress<00:00:30.269> right<00:00:30.929> now<00:00:31.910> this<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:34.760> kind<00:00:35.760> of

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
progress right now this is kind of

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.290 
progress right now this is kind of
reminiscent<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:37.610> what<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> ship<00:00:38.910> look<00:00:39.120> like

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
reminiscent of what the ship look like

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.119 
reminiscent of what the ship look like
when<00:00:39.480> we<00:00:39.570> first<00:00:39.719> saw<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.969> crooked<00:00:41.969> pylons<00:00:43.129> this

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
when we first saw it crooked pylons this

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.500 
when we first saw it crooked pylons this
one<00:00:44.340> being<00:00:44.550> straighter<00:00:45.030> than<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:47.510> funny

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
one being straighter than this one funny

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.619 
one being straighter than this one funny
enough<00:00:49.820> this<00:00:50.820> python<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.829> angle<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.309> it

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
enough this python here the angle of it

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.350 
enough this python here the angle of it
the<00:00:54.629> way<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:54.899> angled<00:00:55.230> down<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.710> that

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
the way it's angled down like that

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.720 
the way it's angled down like that
that's<00:00:57.360> what<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.750> get<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.550> glue<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
that's what you get if you glue the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.020 
that's what you get if you glue the
pylons<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.710> straight<00:01:01.710> dead<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.460> into<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
pylons in straight dead on into the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.539 
pylons in straight dead on into the
holes<00:01:03.239> because<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.260> holes<00:01:04.470> are<00:01:04.680> not<00:01:04.860> cut

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
holes because the holes are not cut

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.130 
holes because the holes are not cut
right<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> secondary<00:01:06.420> hole<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> long

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
right in the secondary hole on the long

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.620 
right in the secondary hole on the long
box<00:01:07.409> kits<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.189> I'm<00:01:08.850> thinking<00:01:08.909> may<00:01:09.330> probably

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
box kits so I'm thinking may probably

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.719 
box kits so I'm thinking may probably
put<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.080> pile<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.860> said<00:01:11.040> oh<00:01:11.250> that

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
put this pile on in and said oh that

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.870 
put this pile on in and said oh that
don't<00:01:11.850> look<00:01:12.000> right<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.220> one<00:01:14.400> was<00:01:14.549> pretty

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
don't look right so this one was pretty

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300 
don't look right so this one was pretty
easy<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.390> position<00:01:15.509> when<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.140> got<00:01:16.979> around<00:01:17.220> to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
easy to position when I got around to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.940 
easy to position when I got around to
putting<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.630> back<00:01:18.990> file<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> put<00:01:19.770> in

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
putting it in the back file on I put in

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.670 
putting it in the back file on I put in
first<00:01:20.340> because<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.299> had<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.630> do<00:01:21.810> some<00:01:22.140> work<00:01:22.170> to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
first because I had to do some work to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.359 
first because I had to do some work to
the<00:01:22.770> pylon<00:01:22.979> base<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:24.530> get<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.710> warp<00:01:26.009> engine

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the pylon base to get this warp engine

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.499 
the pylon base to get this warp engine
angle<00:01:26.700> up<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.439> where<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.470> wanted<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.509> it's

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
angle up to where I wanted it it's

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.069 
angle up to where I wanted it it's
turning<00:01:30.900> around<00:01:31.020> here

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:48.499 

backview<00:01:38.810> going<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:45.649> not<00:01:46.649> bad<00:01:47.119> all<00:01:48.119> i<00:01:48.270> need<00:01:48.479> is

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
backview going up not bad all i need is

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.230 
backview going up not bad all i need is

this thing in to see how it looks on the
other<00:01:57.600> angle<00:02:03.590> still<00:02:04.590> trashed<00:02:05.240> not<00:02:06.240> quite

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
other angle still trashed not quite

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:18.340 
other angle still trashed not quite
right

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
find interesting was when i was doing my

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.730 
find interesting was when i was doing my
photo<00:02:26.160> interpretation<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.780> seems<00:02:28.320> in<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.560> few

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
photo interpretation it seems in a few

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.420 
photo interpretation it seems in a few
of<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.920> distance<00:02:29.370> shots<00:02:29.640> there<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:31.250> not<00:02:32.250> as

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
of the distance shots there is not as

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.550 
of the distance shots there is not as
much<00:02:32.460> crap<00:02:33.090> built<00:02:33.420> onto<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.840> model<00:02:34.170> as<00:02:34.380> there

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
much crap built onto the model as there

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.610 
much crap built onto the model as there
are<00:02:34.740> for<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.670> one<00:02:35.910> beauty<00:02:36.900> shot<00:02:37.200> right<00:02:37.470> when

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
are for that one beauty shot right when

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.560 
are for that one beauty shot right when
they<00:02:37.740> showed<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.070> credits<00:02:38.490> making<00:02:39.240> me<00:02:39.360> wonder

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
they showed the credits making me wonder

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.290 
they showed the credits making me wonder
that<00:02:40.020> if<00:02:40.830> when<00:02:41.400> they<00:02:41.520> built<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.850> model<00:02:42.000> is

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
that if when they built the model is

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.160 
that if when they built the model is
that<00:02:42.330> ok<00:02:42.750> let's<00:02:43.200> do<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.980> damage<00:02:44.190> shoot<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.240> all

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
that ok let's do the damage shoot it all

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.750 
that ok let's do the damage shoot it all
right<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:46.530> got<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.710> distance<00:02:47.160> shots<00:02:47.370> done<00:02:47.580> but

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
right we got the distance shots done but

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.400 
right we got the distance shots done but
we<00:02:47.850> got<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.090> add<00:02:48.180> more<00:02:48.390> detail<00:02:48.840> now<00:02:49.080> for<00:02:49.320> the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
we got to add more detail now for the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.460 
we got to add more detail now for the
close-ups<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:51.780> looks<00:02:52.020> like<00:02:52.080> they<00:02:52.260> kept

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
close-ups so it looks like they kept

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.320 
close-ups so it looks like they kept
adding<00:02:52.650> more<00:02:52.920> detail<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.610> model<00:02:53.970> as<00:02:54.120> they

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
adding more detail to the model as they

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:03.440 
adding more detail to the model as they
they<00:02:55.110> kept<00:02:55.290> building<00:02:55.530> it<00:03:02.180> turning<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.300> this

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
they kept building it turning it this

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.840 
they kept building it turning it this
way<00:03:03.660> one<00:03:04.200> thing<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:04.410> forgot<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.680> mention<00:03:04.800> in<00:03:05.490> the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
way one thing I forgot to mention in the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.390 
way one thing I forgot to mention in the
last<00:03:06.060> video<00:03:06.270> was<00:03:07.880> conduit<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:09.240> the<00:03:10.400> secondary

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
last video was conduit in the secondary

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.730 
last video was conduit in the secondary
in<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.850> ward<00:03:12.480> nacelle<00:03:12.840> pylon<00:03:13.230> here<00:03:15.650> kind<00:03:16.650> of

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
in the ward nacelle pylon here kind of

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.900 
in the ward nacelle pylon here kind of
see<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:16.980> pretty<00:03:17.190> clearly<00:03:17.720> that's<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.910> couple

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
see it pretty clearly that's a a couple

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.280 
see it pretty clearly that's a a couple
of<00:03:21.000> wiring<00:03:21.209> harnesses<00:03:21.870> from

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290

radio-controlled aircraft Eknath one I

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.680 
radio-controlled aircraft Eknath one I
had<00:03:31.890> an<00:03:32.010> extension<00:03:32.580> a<00:03:32.700> used<00:03:32.970> one<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.480> just

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
had an extension a used one I just

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.460 
had an extension a used one I just
chopped<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:34.080> in<00:03:34.200> half<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:35.220> white<00:03:35.430> areas<00:03:35.910> are

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
chopped it in half the white areas are

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.460 
chopped it in half the white areas are
plaster<00:03:37.470> act<00:03:37.620> half<00:03:37.800> round<00:03:38.100> tubing<00:03:38.550> and<00:03:38.760> then

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
plaster act half round tubing and then

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.750 
plaster act half round tubing and then
after<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.500> glue<00:03:40.739> two<00:03:40.800> min<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.160> attacked<00:03:41.550> them

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
after I glue two min I attacked them

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.390 
after I glue two min I attacked them
with<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.930> dremel<00:03:43.200> engraving<00:03:43.769> tip<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.130> make<00:03:44.280> it

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
with a dremel engraving tip to make it

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.940 
with a dremel engraving tip to make it
look<00:03:44.549> like<00:03:44.820> ok<00:03:45.810> we<00:03:45.930> got<00:03:46.080> some<00:03:46.260> breaks<00:03:46.530> there<00:03:46.830> in

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
look like ok we got some breaks there in

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.789 
look like ok we got some breaks there in
some<00:03:47.130> vents<00:03:47.489> because<00:03:48.110> otherwise<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.620> don't

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
some vents because otherwise I don't

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.830 
some vents because otherwise I don't
know<00:03:50.040> why<00:03:50.220> this<00:03:50.280> panel<00:03:51.150> would<00:03:51.269> get<00:03:51.450> blown<00:03:51.660> off

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
know why this panel would get blown off

00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:01.509 
know why this panel would get blown off
like<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:54.920> of<00:03:55.920> course<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:57.769> front<00:03:58.880> of<00:03:59.880> the

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
like that of course the front of the

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.780 
like that of course the front of the
warp<00:04:02.519> engines<00:04:02.940> as<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.239> were<00:04:04.370> looking<00:04:05.370> at<00:04:05.640> how

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
warp engines as it were looking at how

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.170 
warp engines as it were looking at how
jagged<00:04:06.600> they<00:04:06.750> appear<00:04:10.519> let's<00:04:11.519> raise<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:12.090> up

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
jagged they appear let's raise it up

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.810 
jagged they appear let's raise it up
just<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.600> little

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.500 

pretty<00:04:18.820> happy<00:04:19.240> with<00:04:19.360> how<00:04:19.420> it<00:04:19.690> looked<00:04:21.510> have

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
pretty happy with how it looked have

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.120 
pretty happy with how it looked have
adds<00:04:22.720> a<00:04:22.900> little<00:04:23.140> bit<00:04:23.320> of<00:04:23.410> detail<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.980> these

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
adds a little bit of detail to these

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.460 
adds a little bit of detail to these
engines<00:04:24.550> since<00:04:24.730> last<00:04:24.970> time<00:04:25.240> mostly<00:04:25.840> on<00:04:26.350> the

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
engines since last time mostly on the

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.670 
engines since last time mostly on the
back<00:04:26.680> of<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.780> far<00:04:28.780> pylon<00:04:29.200> here<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.470> get<00:04:29.590> the

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
back of the far pylon here to get the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.530 
back of the far pylon here to get the
appearance<00:04:30.130> a<00:04:30.310> little<00:04:30.970> closer<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.420> what

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
appearance a little closer to what

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.420 
appearance a little closer to what
looked<00:04:31.780> like<00:04:31.840> in<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.140> episode<00:04:32.560> I<00:04:32.620> don't<00:04:33.250> think

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
looked like in the episode I don't think

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.170 
looked like in the episode I don't think
I<00:04:33.460> got<00:04:33.640> a<00:04:33.670> duplicated<00:04:34.300> a<00:04:34.390> hundred<00:04:34.900> percent<00:04:35.050> but

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
I got a duplicated a hundred percent but

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.890 
I got a duplicated a hundred percent but
I'm<00:04:37.180> satisfied<00:04:37.600> with<00:04:38.140> it<00:04:38.250> um<00:04:39.690> another<00:04:40.690> thing

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
I'm satisfied with it um another thing

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:49.460 
I'm satisfied with it um another thing
I'll<00:04:41.200> make<00:04:41.350> mention<00:04:41.590> of<00:04:42.300> let's<00:04:44.580> back<00:04:45.580> it<00:04:45.610> up

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:56.180 

and<00:04:51.930> let's<00:04:52.930> put<00:04:53.140> at<00:04:53.260> that<00:04:53.410> flatter<00:04:53.860> angle

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
and let's put at that flatter angle

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.500 
and let's put at that flatter angle
there<00:04:57.190> we<00:04:57.340> go

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
get ready to blow it up yesterday I had

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.430 
get ready to blow it up yesterday I had
mentioned<00:05:11.040> that<00:05:11.370> these<00:05:11.870> protrusions<00:05:12.870> on<00:05:13.230> top

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
mentioned that these protrusions on top

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.940 
mentioned that these protrusions on top
of<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.590> warp<00:05:13.800> engines<00:05:13.980> that<00:05:14.520> I<00:05:15.650> angled<00:05:16.650> up<00:05:16.800> the

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
of the warp engines that I angled up the

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.360 
of the warp engines that I angled up the
outer<00:05:17.630> section<00:05:18.630> in<00:05:19.340> reality<00:05:20.340> I<00:05:20.370> angled<00:05:20.970> up<00:05:21.120> the

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
outer section in reality I angled up the

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.090 
outer section in reality I angled up the
the<00:05:23.370> inner<00:05:23.580> ones<00:05:23.910> those<00:05:24.270> are<00:05:24.620> those<00:05:25.620> angles

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
the inner ones those are those angles

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.220 
the inner ones those are those angles
were<00:05:26.250> a<00:05:26.280> little<00:05:26.490> too<00:05:26.670> shallow<00:05:27.000> so<00:05:27.450> those<00:05:28.080> are

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
were a little too shallow so those are

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.810 
were a little too shallow so those are
the<00:05:28.260> ones<00:05:28.410> I<00:05:28.620> popped<00:05:28.890> off<00:05:29.100> filled<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:29.610> holes

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
the ones I popped off filled the holes

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.840 
the ones I popped off filled the holes
in<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:30.680> secondary<00:05:31.680> hull<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:32.100> then<00:05:32.220> reglued

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
in the secondary hull and then reglued

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.060 
in the secondary hull and then reglued
these<00:05:33.030> parts<00:05:33.920> this<00:05:34.920> one<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:35.550> this<00:05:36.060> one<00:05:36.120> and

these parts this one and this one and

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.460 
these parts this one and this one and
angle<00:05:38.070> that<00:05:38.190> looked<00:05:38.430> a<00:05:38.520> little<00:05:38.880> bit<00:05:39.410> more<00:05:40.410> to

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
angle that looked a little bit more to

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.990 
angle that looked a little bit more to
my<00:05:40.680> liking<00:05:40.920> not<00:05:41.790> totally<00:05:42.750> accurate<00:05:43.170> for<00:05:44.000> the

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
my liking not totally accurate for the

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.880 
my liking not totally accurate for the
consolation<00:05:45.660> because<00:05:45.900> they<00:05:46.050> just<00:05:46.260> stuck<00:05:46.770> them

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
consolation because they just stuck them
