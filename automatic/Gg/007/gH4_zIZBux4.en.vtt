00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.620
 we bring ours and those 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.130
 forces want to take a player from 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.130
 we 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.370
 the team is not to blame for everything 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.599
 what happens on the court worried about 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.509
 suddenly it's your turn to take advantage of 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.390
 circumstances that he lost in the final 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.130
 well this way and if I was very 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.899
 Annoyed and studied in Uruguay as 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.270
 I feel what the 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:30.660
 Panamanians clear of course you 're upset 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:34.739
 the arbitration was not good you did not deserve no 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.930
 not this but well this is soccer me 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.629
 I also suffered in this way and I did not see that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.789
 the rival grab big criminal there is no or 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.690
 the goal here the metric I'm going a lot to get 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.920
 to a final and I move artist that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.519
 turn the page and think about what 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.219
 follow now it's up to us we're not 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:56.789
 us and then since finishing the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.319
 head of the referees qualify the 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.120
 qualifying and endowing it with a team 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:02.489
 with nothing well we take advantage 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.150
 circumstances one that was not was not 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.580
 clear 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.610
 clear that easy it was not 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.930
 they also received kicked bleachers blows 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.360
 and aggressions and obviously it's hot 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.990
 he also answers and we have to be 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.610
 calming down 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.200
 we approach the bank helps 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.720
 try to help calm people 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.370
 because people were in a situation 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.370
 what has happened inside the court 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.030
 reason I do 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.409
 yes good night the bolillo gómez 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.670
 he says it openly that it was a robbery 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.260
 that you know this triumph that 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.250
 supposedly with the help of arbitration can not 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.250
 generate pride miguel 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.750
 so we find ourselves guilty of what 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.780
 is listening to the press conference that 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.039
 we are not at fault, we are not 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.039
 we were the ones who generated this 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:12.750
 what do you want welfare says concacaf 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.010
 ask them I reiterate we do not play 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.379
 well we do not play well 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.700
 We do not generate your comfort, we do not generate a 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.910
 football 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.459
 Sometimes it 's like that if you make a mistake in your 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.599
 against the take advantage of the exterior color 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.150
 win our favor we have to 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.230
 seize is not ideal because if 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.030
 maybe it's not ideal 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.640
 they are right they can be angry a lot 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.069
 people that was not not ideal was not 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.750
 ideally win in this way we are not 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.700
 nobody happy because we won from this 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.739
 way the dress was quite annoying 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.420
 in our quite annoying and everything 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.220
 we are upset about the way in which 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.810
 we show up on the court because no 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.870
 we did nothing that we did not play that we did not 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.540
 we eat well that we do not generate but at 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.459
 end of account football measurement to 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.200
 sometimes you play very well very nice are you the 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.360
 you have 20 goal arrivals and no 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.500
 you end up winning today you did not play badly 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.500
 waste bad and you won 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.970
 mister that such josé miguel domínguez 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.340
 to have more of panama 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.060
 mexico reaches the final if it qualifies 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.360
 two dubious penalties and 11 the first 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.270
 let's say that 1 and the 11 that rests the 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.430
 hoop 1 as he arrives in Mexico with his head 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.250
 up to the final like any team 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.890
 that reaches the final we always look for 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.570
 we try to play bad plays today 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.050
 I did not mean you did not try not to 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.220
 You went to look for the match to try to 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.600
 try to do what you have to 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:44.230
 work but today you play badly if 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:47.350
 we play badly but we put the 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.500
 idea of ​​trying to propose the 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.360
 I play life to run the idea of ​​doing 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.690
 a game that generates good 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.860
 possibility of reaching the final today you 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.540
 you have nothing to do with all that 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.550
 happened on the court I repeat my daughter sorry 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.950
 in the end, it was the same for me today will be for 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.209
 nothing sad upset with these 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.680
 circumstances but good at the end of 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.950
 accounts to me they did not give me the title by 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.790
 they gave it to the rival 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.440
 the value of the value of football in all 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.799
 sides asks in the world question the 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.690
 global to the people of holland also 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.259
 they also said it was not criminal I've been 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.090
 In Mexico, the referee of the 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:27.720
 fifa and not the penalty silvia is fine 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:31.110
 Mexico and since today it because I can 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:35.729
 tell the bolillo back that it was not criminal 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.729
 that's why I will not do it 

00:04:37.329 --> 00:04:43.189
 just study us as Mexicans 

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:45.889
 we comply with being on the court and 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:47.749
 would have been the other way around if I kicked it or 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.749
 not boots reiterated the other day 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:53.209
 against guatemala a very clear hand 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:56.179
 very clear but a hand that saw everything 

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:57.499
 the world, and not technical or 

00:04:56.179 --> 00:05:01.299
 Guatemalan player wants pear you 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:01.299
 I promised the hand come over here is criminal 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.620
 Costa Rica we already designed them there are two 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.780
 blows against the one of costa rica two 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.340
 knocks down and one up, that is if 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.650
 Then he tells us if it is criminal or does not wait 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.770
 the and enters the controversy this is not 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.600
 do not 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.660
 since the first one we have 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.170
 and not this to see the auto video I said 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.170
 the match comes 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.220
 this first thing always ask for 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.140
 favor 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.300

 gives more to this group of players 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.610
 last he continued to play pretty well 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.650
 you have a late hand 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.039
 good is the press conference of 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.199
