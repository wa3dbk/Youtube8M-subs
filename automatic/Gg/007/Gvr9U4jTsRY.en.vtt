00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
most of the first the fact that all the

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.550 
most of the first the fact that all the
songs<00:02:06.310> sound<00:02:06.849> similar<00:02:07.509> well<00:02:08.079> most<00:02:08.319> of<00:02:08.440> them

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
songs sound similar well most of them

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.350 
songs sound similar well most of them
sound<00:02:08.829> similar<00:02:09.099> anyway<00:02:09.340> shouldn't<00:02:09.789> sell<00:02:10.000> them

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
sound similar anyway shouldn't sell them

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.610 
sound similar anyway shouldn't sell them
because<00:02:10.479> like<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:10.989> said<00:02:11.049> there<00:02:11.319> are<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.440> few

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
because like I said there are a few

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.240 
because like I said there are a few
standouts<00:02:12.130> but<00:02:13.139> you<00:02:14.139> know<00:02:14.260> when<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.590> make<00:02:14.769> an

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
standouts but you know when you make an

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.500 
standouts but you know when you make an
album<00:02:15.549> where<00:02:16.380> everything<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.410> sounds<00:02:17.829> alike

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
album where everything the sounds alike

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.539 
album where everything the sounds alike
you<00:02:19.510> have<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.810> do<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.049> in<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.350> right<00:02:20.470> way<00:02:20.549> the

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
you have to do it in the right way the

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.849 
you have to do it in the right way the
Amity<00:02:21.850> affliction<00:02:22.209> for<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.540> most<00:02:22.690> part<00:02:22.900> my

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:23.859 
Amity affliction for the most part my

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.650 
Amity affliction for the most part my
opinion<00:02:24.250> they<00:02:24.370> didn't<00:02:24.639> do<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.790> in<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.510> right

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
opinion they didn't do it in the right

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
opinion they didn't do it in the right
way<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:26.290> mean<00:02:27.250> everything<00:02:27.519> sounded<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.209> same

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
way I mean everything sounded the same

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.270 
way I mean everything sounded the same
it<00:02:29.680> sounded<00:02:30.190> similar<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:33.430> just<00:02:35.280> everything

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
it sounded similar to just everything

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.059 
it sounded similar to just everything
else<00:02:36.430> in<00:02:36.609> him<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:37.030> mean<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:38.579> it<00:02:39.579> was<00:02:39.790> born

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
else in him I mean it it was born

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.930 
else in him I mean it it was born
somewhat

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.590 

I<00:02:45.000> mean<00:02:45.690> it's<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:46.050> decent<00:02:46.620> album<00:02:47.240> I'm<00:02:48.240> not

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
I mean it's a decent album I'm not

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.370 
I mean it's a decent album I'm not
saying<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:48.930> terrible<00:02:49.470> but<00:02:50.990> it<00:02:51.990> just<00:02:52.170> needs

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
saying it's terrible but it just needs

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.910 
saying it's terrible but it just needs
