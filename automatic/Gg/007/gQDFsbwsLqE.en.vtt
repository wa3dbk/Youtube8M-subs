this<00:01:29.010> look<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.400> guess<00:01:29.610> could<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.880> more<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
this look I guess could be more of a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.500 
this look I guess could be more of a
business<00:01:32.460> type<00:01:32.700> look<00:01:32.940> but<00:01:33.120> it's<00:01:33.270> still<00:01:33.450> a

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
business type look but it's still a

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.500 
business type look but it's still a
little<00:01:33.720> bit<00:01:33.870> on<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.400> fun<00:01:35.400> side<00:01:35.430> know<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
little bit on the fun side know with the

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.650 
little bit on the fun side know with the
different<00:01:36.960> colors<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.410> a<00:01:38.250> little<00:01:39.060> flashy<00:01:39.330> but

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
different colors and a little flashy but

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.060 
different colors and a little flashy but
not<00:01:39.870> too<00:01:40.050> much<00:01:40.230> I<00:01:40.470> think<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.070> not<00:01:41.610> exactly<00:01:41.850> for

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
not too much I think so not exactly for

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.170 
not too much I think so not exactly for
casual<00:01:44.070> walking<00:01:44.460> down<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.670> street<00:01:44.910> I<00:01:44.940> guess

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
casual walking down the street I guess

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.820 
casual walking down the street I guess
then<00:01:45.420> unless<00:01:45.900> you're<00:01:46.110> brave<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.710> just

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
then unless you're brave and you just

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.020 
then unless you're brave and you just
like<00:01:47.010> to<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.340> sort<00:01:47.580> of<00:01:47.640> thing<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:48.000> go

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
like to do that sort of thing then go

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.530 
like to do that sort of thing then go
for<00:01:48.390> it

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
for it

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.840 
for it
this<00:01:49.410> I<00:01:49.560> would<00:01:49.620> wearing<00:01:50.010> more<00:01:50.160> towards<00:01:50.610> like<00:01:50.820> a
