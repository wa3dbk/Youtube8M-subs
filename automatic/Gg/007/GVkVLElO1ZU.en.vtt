very<00:01:26.179> long<00:01:26.450> rose<00:01:26.660> myself<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:27.410> I'm<00:01:27.560> going

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.990 

and<00:01:34.270> just<00:01:35.050> began<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.440> roll<00:01:36.030> down<00:01:37.030> all<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.880> way

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
and just began to roll down all the way

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.130 
and just began to roll down all the way
until<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:40.510> reach<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:42.070> bottom

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.930 

so<00:01:51.140> once<00:01:51.409> we<00:01:51.620> have<00:01:51.830> rules<00:01:52.280> our<00:01:52.520> napkin

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
so once we have rules our napkin

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.360 
so once we have rules our napkin
completely<00:01:53.420> down<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:54.560> doesn't<00:01:54.979> have<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.250> be

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
completely down it doesn't have to be

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.240 
completely down it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:01:55.760> by<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:55.940> way<00:01:56.170> um<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.229> will<00:01:57.680> stand<00:01:57.920> it<00:01:58.100> up

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
perfect by the way um I will stand it up

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.150 
perfect by the way um I will stand it up
and<00:01:58.550> I<00:01:59.210> will<00:01:59.479> then<00:01:59.660> decide<00:02:00.050> where<00:02:00.590> I<00:02:00.620> want<00:02:01.010> my

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
and I will then decide where I want my

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.310 
and I will then decide where I want my
rows<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.850> end<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.360> my<00:02:02.720> stem<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.350> begin<00:02:05.050> and<00:02:06.050> I

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
rows to end and my stem to begin and I

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.900 
rows to end and my stem to begin and I
think<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:06.740> is<00:02:06.890> going<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.250> be<00:02:07.340> perfect<00:02:07.729> here

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
think this is going to be perfect here

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.460 
think this is going to be perfect here
for<00:02:08.090> me<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:09.410> I'm<00:02:09.619> going<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.190> start<00:02:10.490> rolling<00:02:10.759> as

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
for me so I'm going to start rolling as

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:23.770 
for me so I'm going to start rolling as
tight<00:02:12.470> as<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:12.830> can<00:02:14.590> down<00:02:22.180> now<00:02:23.180> I'm<00:02:23.360> going<00:02:23.660> to

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
tight as I can down now I'm going to

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.420 
tight as I can down now I'm going to
make<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.080> nice<00:02:24.200> by<00:02:24.500> adding<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.890> little<00:02:25.130> leaf<00:02:25.250> on

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
make it nice by adding a little leaf on

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.910 
make it nice by adding a little leaf on
the<00:02:25.520> side<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.030> I'm<00:02:26.209> going<00:02:26.600> to<00:02:26.660> take<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.470> top

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
tight enough there is no reason why it

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.540 
tight enough there is no reason why it
should<00:02:57.450> come<00:02:57.570> apart<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.350> there<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.340> have<00:02:59.370> it
