00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
a mop and broom holder it looks like a

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.860 
a mop and broom holder it looks like a
buck-fifty<00:02:43.489> from<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.730> 99-cent<00:02:44.120> store<00:02:44.420> and

buck-fifty from the 99-cent store and

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.500 
buck-fifty from the 99-cent store and
it's<00:02:45.769> self-adhesive<00:02:46.370> tin<00:02:46.700> ceiling<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.269> just

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
it's self-adhesive tin ceiling so I just

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.900 
it's self-adhesive tin ceiling so I just
glued<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.260> ceiling<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.980> put<00:02:49.670> some

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
glued it to the ceiling and put some

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.479 
glued it to the ceiling and put some
more<00:02:50.150> tape<00:02:51.140> on<00:02:51.320> it<00:02:51.470> just<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.739> secure<00:02:52.190> it<00:02:52.250> you

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
more tape on it just to secure it you

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.520 
more tape on it just to secure it you
could<00:02:52.640> probably<00:02:52.820> put<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.299> hooks<00:02:53.540> only<00:02:54.320> reason

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
could probably put the hooks only reason

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.870 
could probably put the hooks only reason
I<00:02:54.560> didn't<00:02:54.769> put<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:54.920> hook<00:02:55.130> is<00:02:55.280> because<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:55.549> don't

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
I didn't put a hook is because I don't

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.210 
I didn't put a hook is because I don't
know<00:02:56.090> where<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.930> stud<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:57.380> in<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.799> ceiling

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
know where the stud is in the ceiling

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.789 
know where the stud is in the ceiling
and<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:59.329> didn't<00:02:59.540> want<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.750> start<00:03:00.019> drilling

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
and I didn't want to start drilling

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.850 
and I didn't want to start drilling
holes<00:03:01.190> through<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.150> sheetrock<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.900> fucking

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
holes through the sheetrock and fucking

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.740 
holes through the sheetrock and fucking
up<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.070> ceiling<00:03:04.430> but<00:03:04.579> if<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.299> could<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.660> know

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
up the ceiling but if you could you know

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.210 
up the ceiling but if you could you know
get<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:05.959> stud<00:03:06.200> finder<00:03:06.350> you<00:03:06.560> find<00:03:06.829> where<00:03:07.040> there's

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
get a stud finder you find where there's

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.370 
get a stud finder you find where there's
a<00:03:07.280> stud<00:03:07.549> or<00:03:07.579> a<00:03:07.760> beam<00:03:08.000> in<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.780> ceiling<00:03:08.810> you're

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
a stud or a beam in the ceiling you're

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.900 
a stud or a beam in the ceiling you're
probably<00:03:09.709> better<00:03:10.040> off<00:03:10.160> putting<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.610> hook<00:03:10.760> up

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
probably better off putting a hook up

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.000 
probably better off putting a hook up
there<00:03:11.090> cause<00:03:11.239> it'd<00:03:11.329> be<00:03:11.420> more<00:03:11.570> secure<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:15.010> hook

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
there cause it'd be more secure so hook

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.250 
there cause it'd be more secure so hook
that<00:03:16.190> up<00:03:16.459> there<00:03:16.790> just<00:03:17.209> tie<00:03:17.360> this<00:03:17.420> around<00:03:17.720> just

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
that up there just tie this around just

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.110 
that up there just tie this around just
to<00:03:18.560> get<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:18.709> tied<00:03:19.040> it<00:03:19.070> just<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.700> get<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:19.940> more

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
to get I tied it just to get it more

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.740 
to get I tied it just to get it more
