00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
came with one terabyte 5400 rpm hard

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.870 
came with one terabyte 5400 rpm hard
drive<00:03:45.000> but<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.660> just<00:03:46.700> installed

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
drive but I just installed

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.449 
drive but I just installed
I<00:03:48.030> just<00:03:48.510> cloned<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.930> drive<00:03:49.139> in<00:03:49.290> installed<00:03:49.799> on

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
I just cloned the drive in installed on

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.440 
I just cloned the drive in installed on
my<00:03:51.349> solid-state<00:03:52.349> drive<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:53.269> it's<00:03:54.269> really

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
my solid-state drive and it's really

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.570 
my solid-state drive and it's really
fast

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
fast

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.950 
fast
and<00:03:56.730> so<00:03:57.540> for<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.020> emissions<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:59.820> air<00:04:00.000> for<00:04:00.810> the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
and so for the emissions the air for the

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.790 
and so for the emissions the air for the
processor<00:04:01.710> and<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:01.980> main<00:04:02.490> processor<00:04:03.060> in<00:04:03.240> the

processor and the main processor in the
graphics<00:04:04.800> card<00:04:05.040> its<00:04:05.540> sucked<00:04:06.540> up<00:04:07.820> there's<00:04:08.820> a

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
graphics card its sucked up there's a

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.740 
graphics card its sucked up there's a
fan<00:04:09.180> over<00:04:09.600> here<00:04:09.960> and<00:04:10.970> it<00:04:11.970> doesn't<00:04:12.210> really<00:04:12.480> get

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
fan over here and it doesn't really get

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.610 
fan over here and it doesn't really get
that<00:04:12.930> very<00:04:13.770> loud<00:04:13.980> when<00:04:14.310> at<00:04:14.760> full<00:04:15.450> speed<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:16.110> it

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
that very loud when at full speed and it

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.720 
that very loud when at full speed and it
cools<00:04:16.860> very<00:04:17.220> well

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
cools very well

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.840 
cools very well
the<00:04:18.540> highest<00:04:19.410> I've<00:04:19.680> seen<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.160> temperature<00:04:20.640> is

the highest I've seen the temperature is
77<00:04:21.600> degrees<00:04:22.470> Celsius<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.310> now<00:04:24.300> as<00:04:24.480> while

heat vents over here inside the speakers

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.320 
heat vents over here inside the speakers
are<00:04:43.020> surprisingly<00:04:43.620> good<00:04:43.890> on<00:04:44.100> this<00:04:44.280> laptop<00:04:44.490> see

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
are surprisingly good on this laptop see

over<00:04:45.510> here<00:04:45.540> you<00:04:45.870> can<00:04:46.050> see<00:04:46.260> that<00:04:46.500> as<00:04:46.710> also<00:04:47.370> as

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
over here you can see that as also as

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
over here you can see that as also as
red<00:04:47.700> accents<00:04:48.330> give<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.470> speaker<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:51.270> two

red accents give the speaker and the two

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.200 
red accents give the speaker and the two
speakers<00:04:51.720> can<00:04:52.200> get<00:04:52.350> pretty<00:04:52.590> loud<00:04:53.160> and<00:04:53.220> fill<00:04:54.090> up

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
speakers can get pretty loud and fill up

speakers can get pretty loud and fill up
the<00:04:54.360> room<00:04:54.510> and<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:56.250> bass<00:04:56.430> is<00:04:56.640> pretty<00:04:56.880> good<00:04:57.150> too

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
the room and the bass is pretty good too

and I and I play games and watch movies

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.710 
and I and I play games and watch movies
on<00:05:02.070> it<00:05:02.100> but<00:05:02.430> I<00:05:02.670> had<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.090> seize<00:05:03.240> my<00:05:03.390> surround

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
on it but I had to seize my surround

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.030 
on it but I had to seize my surround
sound<00:05:04.050> anyway<00:05:04.490> and<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:06.360> battery<00:05:06.690> life<00:05:07.040> it's

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
sound anyway and the battery life it's

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.420 
sound anyway and the battery life it's
it's<00:05:08.610> about<00:05:08.670> four<00:05:09.030> hours<00:05:09.210> but<00:05:10.370> there's<00:05:11.370> no

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
it's about four hours but there's no

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.300 
it's about four hours but there's no
optimist<00:05:12.120> on<00:05:12.300> this<00:05:12.480> machine<00:05:12.870> so<00:05:13.350> you<00:05:13.620> always

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
optimist on this machine so you always

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.120 
optimist on this machine so you always
be<00:05:14.610> running<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:15.300> GeForce<00:05:15.780> graphics<00:05:16.130> so

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
be running the GeForce graphics so

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.280 
be running the GeForce graphics so
that's<00:05:17.310> why<00:05:17.460> you<00:05:17.520> get<00:05:17.730> the<00:05:17.880> low<00:05:18.720> battery<00:05:18.960> life

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
that's why you get the low battery life

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.950 
that's why you get the low battery life
but<00:05:20.190> I<00:05:20.220> always<00:05:20.550> carry<00:05:21.090> on<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.360> charger<00:05:21.720> anyway

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
but I always carry on the charger anyway

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.420 
but I always carry on the charger anyway
so<00:05:22.170> it<00:05:22.260> doesn't<00:05:22.290> matter<00:05:22.560> for<00:05:22.920> me<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:25.430> here's

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
so it doesn't matter for me and here's

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.120 
so it doesn't matter for me and here's
the<00:05:26.490> charger<00:05:27.000> if<00:05:27.150> you<00:05:27.330> wanted<00:05:27.540> to<00:05:27.660> see<00:05:27.840> it's

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
the charger if you wanted to see it's

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.880 
the charger if you wanted to see it's
it's<00:05:29.130> kind<00:05:29.340> of<00:05:29.430> big<00:05:29.730> since<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.870> graphics<00:05:31.650> card

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
it's kind of big since the graphics card

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.610 
it's kind of big since the graphics card
uses<00:05:32.160> lots<00:05:32.310> of<00:05:32.520> power<00:05:33.420> but<00:05:33.750> it's<00:05:33.930> not<00:05:34.080> as<00:05:34.380> big

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
uses lots of power but it's not as big

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.360 
uses lots of power but it's not as big
as<00:05:34.770> like<00:05:35.100> other<00:05:35.760> gaming<00:05:36.120> laptops<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:37.370> it's

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
as like other gaming laptops and it's

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.370 
as like other gaming laptops and it's
pretty<00:05:38.760> portable<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.540> can<00:05:39.720> fit<00:05:39.930> in<00:05:40.050> my<00:05:40.080> bag

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
pretty portable I can fit in my bag

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.430 
pretty portable I can fit in my bag
easily<00:05:40.650> and<00:05:41.070> it<00:05:41.850> adds<00:05:42.360> some<00:05:42.720> weight<00:05:42.930> but<00:05:43.290> it's

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
easily and it adds some weight but it's

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.310 
easily and it adds some weight but it's
not<00:05:43.590> so<00:05:43.770> bad<00:05:45.770> but<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:47.070> Lenovo<00:05:47.940> IdeaPad<00:05:48.210> Y<00:05:48.870> 410
