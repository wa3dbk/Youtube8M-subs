00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
inches because that's what we use and it

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:56.180 
inches because that's what we use and it
will<00:00:51.329> go<00:00:51.600> out<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.899> 24<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.039> into<00:00:53.579> 16<00:00:54.469> so<00:00:55.469> no

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
will go out to 24 and into 16 so no

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.340 
will go out to 24 and into 16 so no
problem<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.690> have<00:00:57.929> the<00:00:58.679> little<00:00:59.010> pin<00:01:00.199> that<00:01:01.199> you
