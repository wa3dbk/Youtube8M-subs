in<00:01:39.119> really<00:01:39.450> build<00:01:39.690> this<00:01:39.840> into<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> world-class

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
in really build this into a world-class

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.760 
in really build this into a world-class
track<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.880> original<00:01:42.720> mascot<00:01:43.110> was<00:01:43.259> one<00:01:43.470> mile

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
track the original mascot was one mile

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.160 
track the original mascot was one mile
so<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.759> cars<00:01:45.420> down<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.690> other<00:01:45.810> side<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
so the cars down the other side of the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.020 
so the cars down the other side of the
track<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.560> could<00:01:46.740> see<00:01:46.979> them<00:01:47.160> very<00:01:47.280> well<00:01:47.399> but

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
track you could see them very well but

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.359 
track you could see them very well but
this<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.180> 5/8<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.020> lot<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.470> all<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.920> action

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
this is 5/8 of a lot so all the action

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.510 
this is 5/8 of a lot so all the action
is<00:01:50.550> right<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:51.330> very<00:01:52.110> close<00:01:52.380> action<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.400> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
is right here very close action and that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.870 
is right here very close action and that
big<00:01:53.850> feels<00:01:54.180> apart<00:01:54.740> we<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.890> 20<00:01:56.340> cars<00:01:56.580> going

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
big feels apart we have 20 cars going

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.219 
big feels apart we have 20 cars going
into<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.170> side-by-side

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
into the side-by-side

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.080 
into the side-by-side
I<00:01:59.259> sort<00:01:59.560> of<00:01:59.590> think<00:01:59.860> that<00:02:00.250> was<00:02:00.399> crowd-pleasing

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
I sort of think that was crowd-pleasing

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.300 
I sort of think that was crowd-pleasing
exciting<00:02:01.750> stuff<00:02:02.049> it<00:02:02.590> was<00:02:02.770> what<00:02:03.189> you<00:02:03.280> might

exciting stuff it was what you might

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.850 
exciting stuff it was what you might

coming<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.400> seeing<00:03:13.580> action<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.750> took<00:03:14.900> place

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
coming and seeing action it took place

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:23.790

here

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.550 

and<00:03:24.370> so<00:03:24.790> when<00:03:25.330> these<00:03:25.480> cards<00:03:25.840> got<00:03:25.960> tangled<00:03:26.260> up

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
and so when these cards got tangled up

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.500 
and so when these cards got tangled up
in<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.160> arrangement<00:03:27.670> very<00:03:27.790> close<00:03:28.060> proximity

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
in the arrangement very close proximity

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.240 
in the arrangement very close proximity
so<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:29.020> wheels<00:03:29.230> can<00:03:29.380> get<00:03:29.560> tangled<00:03:29.980> up<00:03:30.040> cuz

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
so the wheels can get tangled up cuz

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.670 
so the wheels can get tangled up cuz
there's<00:03:30.430> no<00:03:30.460> fenders<00:03:30.790> obviously<00:03:31.480> cars<00:03:32.470> would

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
there's no fenders obviously cars would

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.210 
there's no fenders obviously cars would
flip<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.280> fly<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.320> land<00:03:35.320> in<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.650> fence<00:03:35.890> and

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
flip and fly and land in the fence and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.220 
flip and fly and land in the fence and
and<00:03:36.880> so<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.360> was<00:03:37.480> some<00:03:37.690> really<00:03:37.870> dangerous

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
and so it was some really dangerous

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.250 
and so it was some really dangerous
dangerous<00:03:38.830> racing<00:03:39.810> command<00:03:40.810> that<00:03:40.900> races
