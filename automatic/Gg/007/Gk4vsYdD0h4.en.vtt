00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.380 
going to go for in the long way around
with<00:01:58.649> two<00:01:58.860> golems<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.820> can<00:01:59.969> pick<00:02:00.210> our

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
with two golems so that we can pick our

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.999 
with two golems so that we can pick our
way<00:02:00.600> through<00:02:00.869> slowly<00:02:01.259> now<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.740> bit<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.979> a

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
way through slowly now it's a bit of a

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.230 
way through slowly now it's a bit of a
problem<00:02:02.189> because<00:02:02.310> we<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:02.850> all<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
problem because we have to get all the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.389 
problem because we have to get all the
way<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.750> twist<00:02:04.259> our<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.159> middle

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
way to that twist our in the middle

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.880 
way to that twist our in the middle
there<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:06.240> using<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.960> two<00:02:07.110> golem<00:02:07.439> technique

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
there but using the two golem technique

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.099 
there but using the two golem technique
usually<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.789> can<00:02:09.030> pretty<00:02:09.269> much<00:02:09.420> work<00:02:09.840> your

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:10.109 
usually you can pretty much work your

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:11.479 
usually you can pretty much work your
way<00:02:10.200> through<00:02:10.229> now<00:02:10.799> in<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> past<00:02:11.190> I've

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
way through now in the past I've

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.520 
way through now in the past I've
probably<00:02:11.760> told<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.239> guys<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.109> advice

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
probably told you guys and this advice

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.670 
probably told you guys and this advice
still<00:02:13.890> sticks<00:02:14.340> don't<00:02:15.209> attack<00:02:15.840> with<00:02:16.410> bartsch

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
still sticks don't attack with bartsch

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.530 
still sticks don't attack with bartsch
from<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.130> flat<00:02:17.370> side<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.000> base<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.329> can't

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
from the flat side of a base you can't

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.300 
from the flat side of a base you can't
control<00:02:18.930> where<00:02:19.140> your<00:02:19.260> troops<00:02:19.470> are<00:02:19.620> going<00:02:19.859> so

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
control where your troops are going so

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.310 
control where your troops are going so
this<00:02:20.519> is<00:02:20.549> generally<00:02:21.329> a<00:02:21.359> bad<00:02:21.450> idea<00:02:21.810> but<00:02:22.079> I<00:02:22.140> was

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
this is generally a bad idea but I was

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.020 
this is generally a bad idea but I was
pretty<00:02:22.500> confident<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:23.130> could<00:02:23.190> get<00:02:23.609> through<00:02:23.820> to

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
pretty confident I could get through to

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.330 
pretty confident I could get through to
this<00:02:24.150> town<00:02:24.390> hall<00:02:24.660> which<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.290> what<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.500> was<00:02:25.829> if<00:02:26.100> I

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
this town hall which is what I was if I

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.610 
this town hall which is what I was if I
I<00:02:26.609> to<00:02:27.269> be<00:02:27.390> honest<00:02:27.690> I'm<00:02:27.840> terrible<00:02:28.320> for<00:02:28.470> being

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
I to be honest I'm terrible for being

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.009 
I to be honest I'm terrible for being
tempted<00:02:29.010> into<00:02:29.549> taking<00:02:29.970> attacks<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.959> I

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
tempted into taking attacks that I

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.870 
tempted into taking attacks that I
probably<00:02:31.380> shouldn't<00:02:31.950> but<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.370> went<00:02:32.640> for<00:02:32.760> this

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
probably shouldn't but I went for this

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.729 
probably shouldn't but I went for this
one<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.690> clan<00:02:33.930> troops<00:02:34.199> came<00:02:34.380> out<00:02:34.590> the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.119 
going to do a two golem attack and this
village<00:03:38.730> looks<00:03:39.150> ideal<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.680> we've<00:03:40.889> got<00:03:41.040> the

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
village looks ideal so we've got the

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:42.800 
village looks ideal so we've got the
single<00:03:41.370> inferno<00:03:41.819> who<00:03:42.000> will<00:03:42.209> build<00:03:42.479> up<00:03:42.659> to

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
single inferno who will build up to

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.719 
single inferno who will build up to
multi<00:03:43.139> infernos<00:03:43.620> later<00:03:43.859> in<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.099> series<00:03:44.340> after

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:44.729 
multi infernos later in the series after

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.969 
multi infernos later in the series after
a<00:03:44.909> little<00:03:45.180> bit<00:03:45.299> of<00:03:45.329> practice<00:03:45.900> now<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.500> want<00:03:46.889> to

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:46.979 
a little bit of practice now I want to

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:48.589 
a little bit of practice now I want to
I'm<00:03:47.310> tempted<00:03:47.609> to<00:03:47.729> take<00:03:47.970> this<00:03:48.150> because<00:03:48.569> of

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
I'm tempted to take this because of

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.360 
I'm tempted to take this because of
those<00:03:48.959> three<00:03:49.290> splash<00:03:49.709> next<00:03:50.099> to<00:03:50.159> each<00:03:50.250> other

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
those three splash next to each other

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.949 
those three splash next to each other
there<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:50.639> think<00:03:51.000> we<00:03:51.090> can<00:03:51.209> do<00:03:51.359> this<00:03:51.389> with<00:03:51.720> no

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
there I think we can do this with no

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.199 
there I think we can do this with no
Queen<00:03:52.319> so<00:03:52.799> let's<00:03:52.979> have<00:03:53.129> a<00:03:53.159> go<00:03:53.370> at<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.579> no<00:03:53.819> Queen

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
Queen so let's have a go at a no Queen

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.780 
Queen so let's have a go at a no Queen
bartsch<00:03:54.900> attack<00:03:55.349> now<00:03:55.949> you've<00:03:56.220> seen<00:03:56.400> my<00:03:56.579> waist

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
bartsch attack now you've seen my waist

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.119
