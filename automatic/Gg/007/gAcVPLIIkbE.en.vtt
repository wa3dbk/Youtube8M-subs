malli on QVC which is where I got this

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the mistake of making it actually too

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.760 
the mistake of making it actually too
big<00:00:39.090> because<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.629> only<00:00:39.870> need<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.140> small<00:00:40.440> amount

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
big because you only need a small amount

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.549 
big because you only need a small amount
in<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.460> she<00:00:41.820> was<00:00:41.930> like<00:00:42.930> losing<00:00:43.350> money

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
in that she was like losing money

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.020 
in that she was like losing money
because<00:00:43.800> people<00:00:44.250> would<00:00:44.370> need<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.640> repurchase

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
because people would need to repurchase

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.729 
because people would need to repurchase
it<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.539> often<00:00:46.190> but<00:00:47.190> um<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.850> got<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.469> color

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
because it's almost time for this to

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.640 
because it's almost time for this to
come<00:03:15.629> off<00:03:15.689> anyway<00:03:17.629> so<00:03:18.629> yeah<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.900> just<00:03:19.229> tap<00:03:19.440> it

come off anyway so yeah you just tap it
in<00:03:20.239> until<00:03:21.239> it's<00:03:21.449> pretty<00:03:21.599> much<00:03:21.810> absorbed<00:03:22.229> you

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
in until it's pretty much absorbed you

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.210 
in until it's pretty much absorbed you
don't<00:03:22.650> want<00:03:22.919> to<00:03:24.379> rub<00:03:25.379> it<00:03:25.530> in<00:03:25.620> at<00:03:25.829> all<00:03:25.979> because

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
don't want to rub it in at all because

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.670 
don't want to rub it in at all because
you<00:03:26.519> don't<00:03:26.639> want<00:03:26.909> to<00:03:27.030> pull<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.930> skin<00:03:28.199> up<00:03:28.260> under

you don't want to pull the skin up under
your<00:03:28.829> eye<00:03:29.069> because<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.639> skin<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.120> very

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
your eye because that skin is very

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.619 
your eye because that skin is very

delicate and the older I get the more I

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.069 
delicate and the older I get the more I
appreciate<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:34.319> because<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.979> don't<00:03:35.400> want

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
appreciate that because I don't want

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.360 
appreciate that because I don't want
wrinkles<00:03:37.079> before<00:03:37.620> I'm<00:03:37.709> supposed<00:03:38.069> to<00:03:38.129> have

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
wrinkles before I'm supposed to have

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.009 
wrinkles before I'm supposed to have
wrinkles<00:03:40.760> yeah<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.819> just<00:03:42.180> tap<00:03:42.479> it<00:03:42.659> in<00:03:42.810> like

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019

and<00:03:47.069> I<00:03:47.340> have<00:03:47.519> also<00:03:47.760> noticed<00:03:48.389> that<00:03:48.449> this<00:03:48.780> keeps

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
and I have also noticed that this keeps

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.030 
and I have also noticed that this keeps
me<00:03:49.500> from<00:03:49.859> using<00:03:50.299> concealer<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.329> lot<00:03:51.629> of<00:03:51.780> times

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
me from using concealer a lot of times

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.680 
me from using concealer a lot of times
sometimes<00:03:53.040> concealer<00:03:53.819> just<00:03:53.970> feels<00:03:54.269> like<00:03:54.449> it's

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
sometimes concealer just feels like it's

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.539 
sometimes concealer just feels like it's
a<00:03:54.780> little<00:03:55.260> bit<00:03:55.409> too<00:03:55.620> much<00:03:55.829> for<00:03:56.129> me<00:03:56.250> even<00:03:56.459> though

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
a little bit too much for me even though

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.250 
a little bit too much for me even though
I<00:03:56.579> have<00:03:56.909> two<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.299> them<00:03:57.419> and<00:03:57.599> I<00:03:57.659> really<00:03:58.049> like

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
I have two of them and I really like

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.679 
I have two of them and I really like
times<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.400> just<00:03:59.430> feels<00:03:59.790> like<00:04:00.000> it's<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.359> little

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
times it just feels like it's a little

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
times it just feels like it's a little
too<00:04:01.049> much<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:04.260> that's<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:05.989> put<00:04:06.989> my<00:04:07.139> glasses<00:04:07.379> on

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
too much and that's it put my glasses on

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.610 
too much and that's it put my glasses on
so<00:04:07.769> I<00:04:07.949> can<00:04:08.549> see<00:04:08.579> it<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.449> of<00:04:09.750> course<00:04:10.019> if<00:04:10.229> you<00:04:10.439> are

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
happy with it right now I probably

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.050 
happy with it right now I probably
didn't<00:04:16.799> do<00:04:16.889> it<00:04:17.009> perfectly<00:04:17.430> but<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:17.729> can't

of those little symbols on the bottom

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.720 
of those little symbols on the bottom
that<00:05:03.930> tells<00:05:04.230> you<00:05:04.440> when<00:05:04.650> it<00:05:04.770> expires<00:05:05.310> though

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
that tells you when it expires though

and then I am NOT very happy about

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.920 
and then I am NOT very happy about
because<00:05:08.850> now<00:05:09.000> I<00:05:09.030> meant<00:05:09.360> to<00:05:09.450> know<00:05:09.600> when<00:05:09.810> my

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930
