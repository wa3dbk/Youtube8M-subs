00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:03.730
 1 to all who do the web but for yourself 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.200
 This little video is dedicated to lost objects inside of 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.140
 a washing machine like can be small children pieces coins and so on 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.580
 we have a dream they are easy to find but good is always 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.579
 interesting 4 small functions departments 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.439
 The first thing we have to look at is the union 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.710
 of the door 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.689
 that many times the subjects that should reduce 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.749
 according to the user account 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:34.120
 with a lamp a light bulb an intervention that has deceived the world 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.140
 we can try to look have been located 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.160
 it is difficult but sometimes moving in the form of law sale with the lamp 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.380
 Stuck inside and sticking his head inside the garbage can 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.390
 You can get to meet the object with difficulty but it looks like they can 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.920
 be paid from a woman held 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.000
 wires or similar 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.980
 the first option we have to go 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.470
 Elena check the filter tight 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.869
 before there was a machine case that these machines available 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.890
 we do not find in the lower part of it 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.080
 then depending on the machine model questioned 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.480
 only the other one remains as 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.970
 and possibly we can find more logical 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.970
 that we did not expect that this was 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.930
 ap 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.350
 for example 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.350
 a button appears 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.400
 the coins 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.320
 as no doubt a fairly large year they have not been able to pass a test 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320
 specific 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.470
 let's see happens 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.670
 min 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.080
 10 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.080
 sometimes the centers get stuck 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.180
 water outlet 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.180
 and in a case where a smuggler 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:12.259
 in the party mazatlan as 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:13.839
 I feel like it's coming 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:15.899
 from the bottom of the bass drum 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:17.969
 I was going to throw the fan 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.739
 in order to deactivate the machine 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.200
 it's just too big as a lawyer can not move to the part of the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.919
 filter burning 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:30.479
 in one piece we would find a piece like in a rubber tube though 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:32.589
 we find in this part 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.959
 we had to find the machine from the back 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.609
 inclined 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.069
 to be able to access the club by dismantling one of its sand works 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:44.829
 and it is also logical that we could have stayed 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.149
 in this case came his intention some of the losses 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.389
 have appeared in the filter 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.809
 a two-euro coin in the theater a considerable size to get to 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:56.839
 be in the normal center 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:59.839
 is that it would have been in the lower part of the world 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.729
 together with everything I hope they could have been helpful 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:06.479
 and to follow the track some prepare yourself
