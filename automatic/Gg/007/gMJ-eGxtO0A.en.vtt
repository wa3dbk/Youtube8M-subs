at<00:00:42.610> this<00:00:42.760> time<00:00:43.000> is<00:00:43.180> that<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.570> crash<00:00:44.050> in<00:00:44.290> the

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
at this time is that the crash in the

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.469

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:46.479 
late 80s that happened there was a time

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.869 
late 80s that happened there was a time
of<00:00:46.510> reassessment<00:00:47.199> on<00:00:47.739> its<00:00:47.890> way<00:00:48.159> and<00:00:48.580> if<00:00:48.760> you

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
of reassessment on its way and if you

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.750 
of reassessment on its way and if you
think<00:00:49.089> of<00:00:49.269> fashion<00:00:49.870> as<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.559> banquet<00:00:51.129> table<00:00:51.339> and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
think of fashion as a banquet table and

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.479 
think of fashion as a banquet table and
this<00:00:51.909> was<00:00:52.089> insane<00:00:52.870> dessert<00:00:53.650> which<00:00:54.129> would

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
this was insane dessert which would

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.640 
this was insane dessert which would
probably<00:00:54.940> make<00:00:55.059> you<00:00:55.269> very<00:00:55.690> very<00:00:55.900> high<00:00:56.170> but

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
probably make you very very high but

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.170 
probably make you very very high but
give<00:00:56.949> you<00:00:57.040> a<00:00:57.070> little<00:00:57.250> bit<00:00:57.370> of<00:00:57.400> indigestion<00:00:57.790> and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
give you a little bit of indigestion and

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.410 
give you a little bit of indigestion and
so<00:00:59.309> the<00:01:00.309> show's<00:01:00.670> themselves<00:01:00.909> weren't

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
so the show's themselves weren't

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.899 
so the show's themselves weren't
particularly<00:01:01.930> slick<00:01:02.619> I<00:01:02.890> remember<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:03.760> they

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
back on stage and a rather loving way I

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.490 
back on stage and a rather loving way I
think<00:01:42.850> Diana<00:01:43.210> Ross<00:01:43.450> was<00:01:43.480> somewhere<00:01:44.260> in<00:01:44.380> this

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500
