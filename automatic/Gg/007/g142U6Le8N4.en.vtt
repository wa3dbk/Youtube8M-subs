in<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.970> pinning<00:01:12.299> way<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> larger<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
in this pinning way we have a larger and

this<00:01:16.290> acts<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.860> gear<00:01:17.159> spinning<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
this acts like a gear spinning the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.850 
this acts like a gear spinning the

spinning many times now the diameter of
the<00:01:22.320> larger<00:01:22.680> reel<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:22.979> d1<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.939> amount<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.270> the

the larger reel is d1 the amount of the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.149 
the larger reel is d1 the amount of the
thread<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.020> moves<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.500> one<00:01:25.710> spin<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
larger wheel is pi times d1 now this

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.410 
larger wheel is pi times d1 now this
thread<00:01:28.799> passes<00:01:29.070> over<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> smaller<00:01:30.060> wheel<00:01:30.270> of

thread passes over the smaller wheel of

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.590 
thread passes over the smaller wheel of
diameter<00:01:30.840> D<00:01:30.869> -<00:01:31.170> hence<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.400> one<00:01:32.640> spin<00:01:32.909> smaller

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
diameter D - hence in one spin smaller

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.109 
diameter D - hence in one spin smaller
wheel<00:01:33.840> covers<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.740> thread<00:01:35.009> by<00:01:35.189> pi<00:01:35.520> times<00:01:35.759> T<00:01:35.970> -

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
wheel covers the thread by pi times T -

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.179 
wheel covers the thread by pi times T -
so<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.570> one<00:01:36.720> spin<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.140> larger<00:01:37.560> wheel<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
so in one spin of the larger wheel the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.819 
so in one spin of the larger wheel the
smaller<00:01:38.460> wheel<00:01:38.700> will<00:01:38.909> spin<00:01:38.939> pi<00:01:39.630> times<00:01:39.900> D<00:01:40.079> 1<00:01:40.259> by

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
smaller wheel will spin pi times D 1 by

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.160 
smaller wheel will spin pi times D 1 by
PI<00:01:41.100> times<00:01:41.310> T<00:01:41.549> 2<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> ratio<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.869> spins

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
PI times T 2 so the ratio of the spins

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.920 
PI times T 2 so the ratio of the spins
is<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.950> ratio<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> diameters<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.630> other

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
is the ratio of the diameters in other

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.109 
is the ratio of the diameters in other
case<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.560> ratio<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:46.950> about<00:01:47.159> 10<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
case the ratio is about 10 so the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.030 
case the ratio is about 10 so the
smaller<00:01:48.450> wheel<00:01:48.689> will<00:01:48.899> spin<00:01:48.930> 10<00:01:49.470> times<00:01:49.500> as<00:01:49.979> fast
