00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
that when they went from wherever it was

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.270 
that when they went from wherever it was
being<00:03:25.360> manufactured<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.290> Amish<00:03:26.709> the

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
being manufactured to the Amish the

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.580 
being manufactured to the Amish the
production<00:03:27.850> time<00:03:28.660> went<00:03:28.989> up<00:03:29.080> quite<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.350> bit

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
production time went up quite a bit

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.199 
production time went up quite a bit
because<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:30.070> Amish<00:03:30.220> take<00:03:30.549> their<00:03:30.730> time<00:03:30.940> so

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
because the Amish take their time so

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.210 
because the Amish take their time so
something<00:03:31.540> that<00:03:31.570> might<00:03:31.810> have<00:03:31.930> taken<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.470> can't

remember exactly I think he said
27<00:03:35.000> minutes<00:03:35.240> takes<00:03:36.050> 27<00:03:36.650> hours<00:03:36.800> because<00:03:37.190> they

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
27 minutes takes 27 hours because they

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.230 
27 minutes takes 27 hours because they
