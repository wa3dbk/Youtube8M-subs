00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Welcome to a new video from n-tv 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.420
 My name is yesterday and explain today 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.220
 Let's give you a co2 plant 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.450
 certainly works you have at home 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.920
 ever wonder if we will give you one 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.240
 team or not and maybe 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.049
 have you always wondered why? 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.000
 is working 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.089
 we would like to explain this in this today 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.089
 contribution 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.009
 the two plant the co2 plant is from 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.470
 Many aqua skates and plants 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.570
 a valued product to aquarians 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.400
 of course, especially for the plants 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.860
 But not only the plants benefit 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.559
 from that 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.769
 why is co2 in the aquarium at all 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.760
 important for now we have to understand how 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.320
 the plants use the co2 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.600
 the following cycle is in 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.040
 the reality is more complicated 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.989
 them here in a simplified form 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.150
 is 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.190
 basic material dioxide co2 is produced by the 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.760
 plants are taken and in oxygen 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.610
 o2 converted as far as known as 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.770
 Photosynthesis of oxygen then becomes 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.320
 inhaled by animals or humans 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.450
 which calls energy for this process 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.220
 the plant nutrients from the 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.860
 store in the ground and in the water 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.220
 These are nutrients such as the kicked 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.790
 Phosphate Potassium Iron Magnesium and 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.790
 many more 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.770
 However, there is not enough in the aquarium 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.220
 co2 here in contrast to nature no 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.190
 carbon dioxide is led to 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:46.980
 So we have to manually run co2 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.980
 this is where the co2 system comes into play 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.630
 Construction of the co2 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.180
 the co2 plant consists of three 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.800
 major share together first, the 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.000
 co2 stock in the bottle is the gas 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.950
 carbon dioxide stored the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.780
 classic standard size of a co2 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.880
 Bottle is 500 grams 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.430
 Of course, they are also available for 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.400
 larger aquariums one kilo two kilo etc 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.890
 and more or less tiny bottles 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.180
 for nano plants 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.670
 one differentiates between one way and one 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.140
 returnable bottles are on 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.690
 seen the cheaper alternative 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.959
 as they introduce you to special 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.640
 can be replenished 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.520
 At this connection will be the next one 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.470
 Part connected the pressure reduce the 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.320
 Troops in the reduced pressure of the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.560
 in the bottle prevails from 60 to 1.5 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.180
 bar so the working pressure of the bottle 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.330
 this pressure reduction is necessary 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.680
 because at 60 bar, the co2 becomes liquid and 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.060
 is present at 15 bar in normal gas form 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.400
 with the fine needle valve on 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.890
 Pressure reducer can be adjusted as 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.150
 much co2 through the hose into the aquarium 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.519
 Should a co2 should sleep 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.800
 not a commercial silicone or 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.480
 Air hose as for membranes 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.000
 points used will be used 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.580
 There are special ones for co2 plants 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.750
 especially the tubes 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.340
 more resistant and therefore better for 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.290
 The system is suitable for adding CO2 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.989
 is the third important ingredient there 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.510
 co2 year is gaseous it must be in the first 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.910
 water is dissolved there are many 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.420
 various methods of co2 in the water too 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.150
 to solve 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.980
 the two most popular and best known 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.340
 Methods are the inner reactor of 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.860
 diffuse the gas enters the water 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.690
 the reactor bubbles the co2 so in 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.620
 movement that in the 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.980
 dissolve water 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.830
 the diffuser replaces the co2 with help 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.670
 a fine-pored ceramic in very fine 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.500
 vesicle 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.930
 There are many different ones 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.480
 diffusers for different aquariums 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.370
 volume in the normal case affects one 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.860
 diffuser for smaller pools 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.069
 aesthetic and not as noticeable as 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.870
 a reactor next to these two too 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.849
 There are also management methods 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.930
 others like the outside 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.909
 Reactor of bubbles scene of bubbles 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.590
 counter is not necessary but it does 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.049
 certainly to have one 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.549
 he has a very simple task like 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.010
 The name says you can with the 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.340
 Nasen counter count the co2 bubbles and 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.250
 adjust the system exactly 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.530
 then no co2 is mined so no 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.260
 photosynthesis should take place one 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.240
 night shutdown not much together with 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.120
 A timer switches it on the co2 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.220
 plant at night off gets that 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.940
 solenoid valve current is it so 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.169
 infected the co2 opens before 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.539
 does not get this night shutdown 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.660
 current more closes the valve and 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.450
 The co2 previously will be stopped as well 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.060
 important is a check valve this 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:59.560
 prevents water from the aquarium in 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.260
 we can still grasp the co2 technology 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.090
 briefly the construction together of the 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.860
 bottle is the co2 through the 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.200
 pressure reducer through the hose 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.020
 through the check valve and to 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.550
 blow counter carried here you can 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.430
 read the bubbles number 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:19.630
 then the co2 already arrives 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:22.330
 add factor or diffuser now 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.010
 This is the construction of a co2 plant 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.320
 if you want to know how to get one 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.190
 diffuser could be exactly this 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.620
 watch the video here 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.099
 a link to it is in the video 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.099
 description 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.580
 quite interesting these numbers 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.770
 worked or needed something 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.169
 not yet writing to his tasks 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.460
 good people with the comments you 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.560
 Subscribe to a channel then you have 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.020
 no boy gives the video a thumb 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.240
 highly annoying finer and here you come 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.740
 again with the 2 more lists 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.410
 different videos house me 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.650
 say goodbye with relative 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.650
 sciences are
