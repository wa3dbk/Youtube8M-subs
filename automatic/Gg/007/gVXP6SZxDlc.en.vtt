00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.480
 hello friend in the corner of the floor 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.210
 answering several questions that I have 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.640
 had of how he did to lower the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.760
 tientos I'll show you the ways 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.500
 I know to lower the teeth the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.910
 first at the beginning when newly 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.320
 start working on rope when I 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.690
 I used to play a fish market like this 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.510
 side was good and on the other side the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.690
 hundreds were thicker enough more 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.420
 thick it reduced it to sandpaper and the truth 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.269
 that took me a long time like this with 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.720
 a coarse-grained sandpaper took the part 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.720
 to lower 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.020
 one pass several times 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.020
 until I have left 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.820
 the 2 points equal and takes your time 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.759
 later on later learned another 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.520
 way of lowering that is with a wood and 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.509
 with a glass to the wood we make a 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.509
 diagonal hard cove 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.410
 and for that hard cove we're going to pass the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.020
 time to cut down with a piece of glass 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.490
 being careful not to cut this technique 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.220
 the principle is until you came 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.940
 hand 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.600
 he puts the fifth in the hard cove 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.880
 the edge of the glass is supported and you start 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.180
 to pass the red always on the side 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.180
 thickest 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.430
 and had repeatedly until 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.430
 we get 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.370
 as we search 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.969
 if we guide only one more time 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.650
 ah 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.120
 and there it would be in another good time 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.090
 friends now I 'm going to show you my new 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.440
 tool to lower hundreds is a 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.180
 very practical tool that has 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.490
 sent friend christian wulff have 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.670
 in the description of the video I leave your 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.710
 faith in case you want to communicate with him and 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.420
 he also left his YouTube channel for 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.370
 to see the beautiful tools 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.020
 who sees makes this tool very 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.600
 easy to use we pass the tiento del 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.770
 Thicker keyboard channel first with 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.770
 the fat towards us 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:16.570
 and we had it several times 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:20.040
 with this with this screw we reduce the 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.040
 space between the blade 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.939
 and the support where the wind goes 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.810
 We had varying and if you do not try to 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.820
 reduce the one so that we do not have 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.180
 to do a lot of force and cut the 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.180
 touch 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.829
 good and that's how the time is once 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.840
 reduced is now ready to use 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.220
 remember before using it to look at it 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.290
 so that the work that also tedious 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.600
 good and you saw that this is a 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.770
 very practical and very useful tool I'll 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.870
 to do it has been very useful 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.910
 because I've been using some leaves 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.220
 that if I had not had to sand them 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.410
 a good good time so remember in 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.790
