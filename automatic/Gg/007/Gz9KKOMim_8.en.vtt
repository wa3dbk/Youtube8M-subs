00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.440 
mudroom and the ceiling in the mudroom
is<00:03:12.709> like<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.040> foot<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.550> half<00:03:13.580> shorter<00:03:14.270> than

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
is like a foot and a half shorter than

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.479 
is like a foot and a half shorter than
the<00:03:14.630> main<00:03:14.810> ceiling<00:03:15.320> in<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.500> house<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:15.980> it's

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
the main ceiling in the house so it's

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.850 
the main ceiling in the house so it's
impossible<00:03:16.820> to<00:03:17.209> get<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.600> couch<00:03:18.410> to<00:03:18.620> do<00:03:18.709> it

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
impossible to get the couch to do it

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.289 
impossible to get the couch to do it
because<00:03:18.920> it's<00:03:19.160> just<00:03:19.190> too<00:03:19.400> long<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:20.060> it's<00:03:20.150> too

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
because it's just too long and it's too

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.810 
because it's just too long and it's too
