fiber<00:00:41.370> all<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.000> do<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.360> turn<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.690> parts<00:00:43.020> at<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
fiber all you do is turn the parts at a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.709 
fiber all you do is turn the parts at a
90<00:00:43.559> degree<00:00:43.829> angle<00:00:43.910> so<00:00:44.910> when<00:00:45.210> you're<00:00:45.360> cutting

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
90 degree angle so when you're cutting

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.600 
90 degree angle so when you're cutting
out<00:00:45.989> your<00:00:46.020> late<00:00:46.440> your<00:00:46.739> pattern

out your late your pattern
CF<00:00:48.539> 258<00:00:49.110> here<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> gold<00:00:50.280> carbon<00:00:50.670> fiber

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879

what<00:00:51.600> we're<00:00:51.780> gonna<00:00:51.899> do<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:53.010> see

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
what we're gonna do as you can see

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.069 
what we're gonna do as you can see
instead<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.879> lot<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.329> guys<00:00:54.480> will<00:00:54.750> dip<00:00:54.960> it

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
instead of a lot of guys will dip it

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.520 
instead of a lot of guys will dip it
this<00:00:55.230> way<00:00:55.410> obviously<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.219> use<00:00:56.399> less<00:00:56.699> material

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
this way obviously to use less material

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.170 
this way obviously to use less material
but<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.340> patterns<00:00:59.730> going<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> look<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
but you the patterns going to look the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.639 
but you the patterns going to look the
same<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.750> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> go<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> same<00:01:01.320> way<00:01:01.350> it's

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
same it's going to go the same way it's

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.619 
same it's going to go the same way it's
not<00:01:01.739> going<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:03.149> going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> look

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
not going to do this it's going to look

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.440 
not going to do this it's going to look
like<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.229> both<00:01:04.439> sides<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> car<00:01:05.450> what

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
like this on both sides of the car what

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.539 
like this on both sides of the car what
you<00:01:06.479> do<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.960> turn<00:01:07.170> one<00:01:07.500> part<00:01:07.860> 90<00:01:08.250> degree

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
you do is you turn one part 90 degree

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.060 
you do is you turn one part 90 degree
granted<00:01:09.150> you're<00:01:09.330> using<00:01:09.570> more<00:01:09.900> material<00:01:10.439> but

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
granted you're using more material but

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.980 
granted you're using more material but
you<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> lot<00:01:11.729> better<00:01:11.970> look<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.540> says

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
you have a lot better look and says

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.830 
you have a lot better look and says
professional<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.189> keep<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.240> mind<00:01:15.390> it's

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
professional so keep that in mind it's

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.120 
professional so keep that in mind it's
real<00:01:15.990> easy<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.439> patterns<00:01:17.430> done<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:19.830> do<00:01:20.009> is

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
real easy to do patterns done and do is

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.270 
real easy to do patterns done and do is
we're<00:01:20.310> gonna<00:01:20.369> race<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.619> Rays<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.770> water<00:01:23.009> real

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
all right patterns in the water usually

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.859 
all right patterns in the water usually
I<00:01:47.960> would<00:01:48.229> dip<00:01:48.409> these<00:01:48.590> one<00:01:48.890> at<00:01:49.009> a<00:01:49.159> time<00:01:49.369> but<00:01:49.869> for

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
I would dip these one at a time but for

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.840 
I would dip these one at a time but for
the<00:01:50.929> sake<00:01:51.229> of<00:01:52.689> time<00:01:53.689> on<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:53.990> video<00:01:54.850> we're

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
the sake of time on the video we're

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.580 
the sake of time on the video we're
gonna<00:01:56.000> go<00:01:56.210> ahead<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.569> dip<00:01:56.780> these<00:01:57.049> at<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.350> same

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
gonna go ahead and dip these at the same

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.319 
gonna go ahead and dip these at the same
time<00:01:57.890> which<00:01:58.280> should<00:01:58.549> be<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.729> challenge<00:01:59.210> in

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
time which should be a challenge in

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:06.910 
time which should be a challenge in
itself<00:02:03.789> set<00:02:04.789> for<00:02:04.970> 70<00:02:05.299> seconds<00:02:05.720> normally<00:02:06.170> it

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
itself set for 70 seconds normally it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.229 
itself set for 70 seconds normally it
should<00:02:06.950> be<00:02:07.280> 60<00:02:07.700> seconds<00:02:08.119> but<00:02:09.819> that's<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:11.000> time

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
should be 60 seconds but that's the time

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.600 
should be 60 seconds but that's the time
on<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.480> clock<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:11.900> just<00:02:12.110> noticed<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:13.430> is

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
on the clock I just noticed so it is

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.430 
on the clock I just noticed so it is
what<00:02:13.819> it<00:02:13.910> is<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.599> other<00:02:14.720> thing<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:14.930> guys<00:02:15.230> are

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
what it is the other thing you guys are

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.250 
what it is the other thing you guys are
going<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.620> notice<00:02:15.830> is<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.099> I<00:02:16.549> taped<00:02:17.420> all<00:02:17.750> four

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
going to notice is that I taped all four

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.350 
going to notice is that I taped all four
sides<00:02:18.590> what<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.250> does<00:02:19.489> is<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.760> controls

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
sides what that does is that controls

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.110 
sides what that does is that controls
the<00:02:20.540> carbon<00:02:20.900> fibre<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:22.250> lines<00:02:22.489> in<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.910> what

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
the carbon fibre the lines in it what

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.180 
the carbon fibre the lines in it what
you<00:02:23.269> guys<00:02:23.420> may<00:02:24.049> have<00:02:24.080> noticed<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.799> that<00:02:24.830> when

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
you guys may have noticed is that when

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.449 
you guys may have noticed is that when
you're<00:02:25.370> dipping<00:02:25.580> parts<00:02:26.090> especially<00:02:26.269> long

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
you're dipping parts especially long

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.400 
you're dipping parts especially long
single<00:02:28.459> parts<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.329> pattern<00:02:29.750> of<00:02:29.900> leafed

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
single parts the pattern of leafed

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.259 
single parts the pattern of leafed
is<00:02:30.680> because<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.340> pattern<00:02:31.700> is<00:02:31.760> moving<00:02:32.090> in<00:02:32.180> the

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
is because the pattern is moving in the

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.979 
is because the pattern is moving in the
water<00:02:32.829> by<00:02:33.829> taping<00:02:34.160> all<00:02:34.459> four<00:02:34.730> sides<00:02:35.030> you'll

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
water by taping all four sides you'll

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.309 
water by taping all four sides you'll
control<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:36.950> weave<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.579> pattern<00:02:38.319> better

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
control that weave of the pattern better

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.199 
control that weave of the pattern better
you<00:02:40.130> don't<00:02:40.280> want<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.519> use<00:02:40.640> in<00:02:40.819> all<00:02:41.000> your

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
you don't want to use in all your

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.620 
you don't want to use in all your
applications<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.019> may<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.500> don't

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
applications you may I don't

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.270 
applications you may I don't
but<00:02:44.630> there<00:02:44.930> sometimes<00:02:45.590> there's<00:02:45.829> carbon

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
but there sometimes there's carbon

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.900 
but there sometimes there's carbon
fibers<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.500> parts<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:48.859> don't<00:02:49.430> allow<00:02:49.850> for

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
fibers and parts that don't allow for

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.629 
fibers and parts that don't allow for
curvatures<00:02:50.630> in<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.650> pattern<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:52.280> they<00:02:52.430> look

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
curvatures in the pattern and they look

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.949 
curvatures in the pattern and they look
better<00:02:52.850> if<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.209> can<00:02:53.359> keep<00:02:53.540> them<00:02:53.630> as<00:02:53.780> straight

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
better if you can keep them as straight

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.559 
better if you can keep them as straight
as<00:02:54.079> possible<00:02:54.670> in<00:02:55.670> a<00:02:55.790> perfect<00:02:56.180> world<00:02:56.299> they'd

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
as possible in a perfect world they'd

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.809 
as possible in a perfect world they'd
all<00:02:56.720> be<00:02:56.900> straight<00:02:57.200> but<00:02:57.530> let's<00:02:57.859> face<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.069> it

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
all be straight but let's face it it

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.879 
all be straight but let's face it it
doesn't<00:02:59.150> always<00:02:59.269> happen<00:02:59.480> so<00:02:59.930> anyhow<00:03:00.709> we've

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
doesn't always happen so anyhow we've

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.030 
doesn't always happen so anyhow we've
got<00:03:00.980> about<00:03:01.130> 13<00:03:01.519> seconds<00:03:02.530> I'm<00:03:03.530> kind<00:03:03.769> of<00:03:03.829> trying

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
got about 13 seconds I'm kind of trying

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.890 
got about 13 seconds I'm kind of trying
to<00:03:04.160> dip<00:03:04.310> both<00:03:04.519> these<00:03:04.670> parts<00:03:05.000> at<00:03:05.120> once<00:03:05.150> this

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
to dip both these parts at once this

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:22.240 
to dip both these parts at once this
ought<00:03:06.079> to<00:03:06.109> be<00:03:06.230> fun

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:37.750 

okay<00:03:24.650> let<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.770> sit<00:03:26.070> there<00:03:26.280> for<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.520> second<00:03:27.180> go<00:03:27.360> to

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.550 

Glasgow<00:03:38.760> watch

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
Glasgow watch

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:58.520 
Glasgow watch
well<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.590> show<00:03:40.980> them<00:03:41.190> how<00:03:41.220> this<00:03:41.460> was<00:03:41.610> done

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.360 

no<00:03:59.750> look<00:04:00.750> like<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:01.050> couple<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.440> idiots

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.130 

it's<00:04:05.819> like<00:04:06.000> we've<00:04:06.150> caught<00:04:06.300> some<00:04:06.569> water<00:04:06.780> some

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
it's like we've caught some water some

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.380 
it's like we've caught some water some
air<00:04:07.319> there<00:04:07.530> but<00:04:07.769> you<00:04:07.890> can<00:04:08.010> see<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:09.060> pattern

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
air there but you can see the pattern

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.220 
air there but you can see the pattern
goes<00:04:09.599> the<00:04:10.110> opposite<00:04:10.910> so<00:04:11.910> we'll<00:04:12.720> touch<00:04:12.930> that<00:04:13.200> up

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
goes the opposite so we'll touch that up

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.030 
goes the opposite so we'll touch that up
a<00:04:13.440> little<00:04:13.560> bit

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
a little bit

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.349 
a little bit
nothing's<00:04:14.790> ever<00:04:14.910> perfect<00:04:15.060> oh<00:04:16.970> but<00:04:17.970> that's<00:04:18.120> how

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
nothing's ever perfect oh but that's how

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.270 
nothing's ever perfect oh but that's how
you<00:04:18.419> uh<00:04:20.209> that's<00:04:21.209> how<00:04:21.359> you<00:04:21.419> dip<00:04:21.949> and<00:04:22.949> get<00:04:23.130> your

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
you uh that's how you dip and get your

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.210 
you uh that's how you dip and get your
pattern<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.790> go<00:04:23.940> in<00:04:24.270> different<00:04:24.449> directions<00:04:25.220> if
