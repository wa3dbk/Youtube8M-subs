00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.200
 now 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.179
 how about friends let's start 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.309
 making the volume of chocolate not 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.250
 I knew where to present this dessert mug 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.420
 glass mold bowl and I say look at me what 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.910
 I'm going to manufacture, I will not do it with 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.880
 chocolate beige bathroom maria I put the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.349
 chocolate to melt and with the 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.609
 temperature that does not burn the bathroom 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.560
 Mary is an extraordinary way 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.650
 melt it with him ensures that that 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.780
 well taken care of it out of the fire and already with 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.300
 its own heat as it goes away it goes 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.130
 I'm practically melting and 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.100
 perfect, well, this is a balloon if 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.560
 presents you the life of the little ones 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.450
 well I'm going to smear the following and 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.980
 I also want it to come out like 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.540
 small waves by the edges of not 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.880
 I want a straight edge like it's a 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.500
 saucepan I do not want there to come out as 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.200
 little ears you see 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.900
 that's there because if I have it perfect 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.850
 well then now I'm going carefully 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.800
 put it on a glass so that the 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.140
 chocolate that is hot then 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.780
 descend but descend doing these 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.890
 forms that we want according to 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.250
 let's let it harden a 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.250
 bit 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.500
 and now prepare a tray with paper 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.049
 vegetable and what I do is put a 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.580
 this little bit of chocolate at the base 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.870
 to be the foot and now let's hope that 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.390
 the chocolate hardens completely 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.310
 i 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.690
 and already with the chocolate absolutely 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.060
 hardened you see a small incision 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.070
 at the end of the globe so that the air 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.560
 leave very slowly because if we do not 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.900
 will break the voley very little to little you see 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.540
 how is it coming out little by little and we have left 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.229
 the bowl perfectly constructed very well 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.460
 air you have work and what a good thing 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.400
 we put a spray 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.890
 it will serve you for the base of our 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.800
 succulent dessert of strawberry there go the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.720
 strawberries 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.280
 perfect there you have it good because this 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.220
 everything is as you see it has been very simple 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.510
 but it's a practical bowl because it's pretty 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.070
 and then you gomez 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.070
 a hug friends until next time
