so<00:00:00.240> we<00:00:00.390> have<00:00:00.510> a<00:00:00.539> question<00:00:01.020> here<00:00:01.199> from<00:00:01.260> one<00:00:01.650> of

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
so we have a question here from one of

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.190 
so we have a question here from one of
the<00:00:01.890> raw<00:00:02.550> till<00:00:02.760> 4<00:00:02.790> people<00:00:03.419> brought<00:00:03.840> up<00:00:03.990> for

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
the raw till 4 people brought up for

the raw till 4 people brought up for
facebook<00:00:04.650> group<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.100> recently<00:00:05.759> turned<00:00:06.240> vegan

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
facebook group I recently turned vegan

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.890 
facebook group I recently turned vegan
and<00:00:06.839> for<00:00:07.770> about<00:00:07.859> almost<00:00:08.160> two<00:00:08.370> months<00:00:08.900> these

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
and for about almost two months these

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.720 
and for about almost two months these
last<00:00:10.200> couple<00:00:10.410> weeks<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.010> feel<00:00:11.219> like<00:00:11.309> I'm<00:00:11.490> losing

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
last couple weeks I feel like I'm losing

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.690 
last couple weeks I feel like I'm losing
muscle<00:00:12.150> especially<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.200> my<00:00:13.380> cards<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:14.040> have

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
muscle especially on my cards I have

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.460 
muscle especially on my cards I have
been<00:00:14.910> maintaining<00:00:15.420> weight<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.929> I'm<00:00:16.020> active

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
been maintaining weight and I'm active

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.290 
been maintaining weight and I'm active
at<00:00:16.590> least<00:00:16.770> five<00:00:17.039> times<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.520> week<00:00:17.550> I've<00:00:18.240> been

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
at least five times a week I've been

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.670 
at least five times a week I've been
doing<00:00:18.869> 95<00:00:19.710> 5<00:00:20.160> breakdown<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.359> 92%<00:00:21.900> carbs<00:00:22.439> five

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
doing 95 5 breakdown so 92% carbs five

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.759 
doing 95 5 breakdown so 92% carbs five
percent<00:00:23.010> fat<00:00:23.250> five<00:00:23.519> percent<00:00:23.820> protein<00:00:24.529> is<00:00:25.529> this

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
percent fat five percent protein is this

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.800 
percent fat five percent protein is this
normal<00:00:26.130> because<00:00:26.279> my<00:00:26.550> protein<00:00:27.000> intake<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.599> so

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
normal because my protein intake is so

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.959 
normal because my protein intake is so
low<00:00:28.550> well<00:00:29.929> you<00:00:30.929> will<00:00:31.080> not<00:00:31.260> lose<00:00:31.759> protein<00:00:32.759> you

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
low well you will not lose protein you

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.180 
low well you will not lose protein you
will<00:00:33.090> not<00:00:33.180> lose<00:00:33.390> muscle<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.620> lifestyle

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
will not lose muscle on this lifestyle

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.720 
will not lose muscle on this lifestyle
especially<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:36.559> in<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.770> couple<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.190> weeks<00:00:38.250> it

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
especially in in a couple of weeks it

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.049 
especially in in a couple of weeks it
just<00:00:39.300> doesn't<00:00:39.510> happen<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:40.079> mean<00:00:40.550> check<00:00:41.550> check

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
just doesn't happen I mean check check

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.290 
just doesn't happen I mean check check
out<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.360> guy<00:00:42.600> here<00:00:42.870> 70<00:00:43.350> grams<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.739> protein

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
out this guy here 70 grams of protein

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.660 
out this guy here 70 grams of protein
and<00:00:45.300> his<00:00:45.629> he's<00:00:46.230> got<00:00:46.440> more<00:00:46.649> muscle<00:00:46.890> mass<00:00:47.070> than

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
and his he's got more muscle mass than

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.690 
and his he's got more muscle mass than
most<00:00:48.329> people<00:00:48.719> most<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> population<00:00:49.710> even

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
most people most of the population even

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.420 
most people most of the population even
the<00:00:50.850> gym<00:00:51.120> population<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.110> he's<00:00:52.800> actually<00:00:52.980> 50

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the gym population and he's actually 50

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.680 
the gym population and he's actually 50
years<00:00:53.460> old<00:00:55.280> I'm<00:00:56.280> another<00:00:56.640> example<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.360> probably

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
years old I'm another example I probably

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.450 
years old I'm another example I probably
going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> get<00:00:58.140> about<00:00:58.379> 70<00:00:58.800> 80<00:00:59.039> grams<00:00:59.280> of

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
going to get about 70 80 grams of

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.740 
going to get about 70 80 grams of
protein<00:00:59.670> about<00:01:00.270> 85<00:01:00.719> kilos<00:01:01.129> so<00:01:02.329> it's<00:01:03.329> kind<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.660> a

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
protein about 85 kilos so it's kind of a

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.649 
protein about 85 kilos so it's kind of a
myth<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.010> need<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.430> much<00:01:05.549> protein<00:01:06.090> in

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
myth that you need so much protein in

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.080 
myth that you need so much protein in
order<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.049> maintain<00:01:07.200> muscle<00:01:07.710> mass

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
order to maintain muscle mass

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.340 
order to maintain muscle mass
maintaining<00:01:09.090> muscle<00:01:09.240> mass<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.840> actually<00:01:10.049> very

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
maintaining muscle mass is actually very

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.710 
maintaining muscle mass is actually very
easy<00:01:10.770> your<00:01:11.640> body<00:01:11.880> doesn't<00:01:12.150> need<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> lot<00:01:12.689> of

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
easy your body doesn't need a lot of

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.260 
easy your body doesn't need a lot of
protein<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.439> good<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.610> maintaining<00:01:14.970> muscle

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
protein for good for maintaining muscle

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.060 
protein for good for maintaining muscle
most<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.960> protein<00:01:16.380> actually<00:01:16.619> goes

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
most of the protein actually goes

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.840 
most of the protein actually goes
towards<00:01:17.939> other<00:01:18.240> functions<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.170> body<00:01:19.850> DNA

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
towards other functions in the body DNA

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.249 
towards other functions in the body DNA
synthesis<00:01:21.450> all<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.900> kind<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.200> stuff

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
synthesis all that kind of stuff

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.749 
synthesis all that kind of stuff
repairing<00:01:22.979> your<00:01:24.080> intestinal<00:01:25.080> cells<00:01:25.580> all<00:01:26.580> that

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
repairing your intestinal cells all that

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.530 
repairing your intestinal cells all that
kind<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.030> stuff<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.350> only<00:01:29.040> about<00:01:29.430> five<00:01:29.820> to

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
kind of stuff so and only about five to

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.260 
kind of stuff so and only about five to
10<00:01:30.840> grams<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.650> actually<00:01:32.400> used<00:01:32.670> for<00:01:32.909> muscle

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
10 grams is actually used for muscle

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.230 
10 grams is actually used for muscle
growth<00:01:33.860> per<00:01:34.860> day<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.119> imagine

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
growth per day so you can imagine

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.990 
growth per day so you can imagine
someone<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.200> only<00:01:37.350> build<00:01:37.680> about<00:01:38.040> was<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> 30

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
someone can only build about was the 30

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.910 
someone can only build about was the 30
days<00:01:39.270> 300<00:01:39.930> grams<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.500> muscle<00:01:42.259> in<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.470> month<00:01:43.710> so

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
days 300 grams of muscle in a month so

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.639 
days 300 grams of muscle in a month so
they<00:01:44.009> don't<00:01:44.189> need<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.490> much<00:01:44.729> extra<00:01:45.090> protein

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
they don't need that much extra protein

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.940 
they don't need that much extra protein
so<00:01:46.729> my<00:01:47.729> answer<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.210> question<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.920> do<00:01:49.920> you

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
so my answer that question is do you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.770 
so my answer that question is do you
need<00:01:50.220> more<00:01:50.460> protein<00:01:50.700> or<00:01:51.090> are<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.420> losing

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
need more protein or are you losing

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.109 
need more protein or are you losing
muscle<00:01:52.040> it's<00:01:53.040> unlikely<00:01:53.280> you're<00:01:53.759> losing

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
muscle it's unlikely you're losing

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.179 
muscle it's unlikely you're losing
muscle<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.780> most<00:01:55.079> likely<00:01:55.200> you're<00:01:55.740> losing

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
muscle it's most likely you're losing

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.370 
muscle it's most likely you're losing
weight<00:01:56.219> or<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:57.450> you're<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:57.750> eating<00:01:57.990> enough

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
weight or that you're not eating enough

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.109 
weight or that you're not eating enough
and<00:01:58.619> therefore<00:01:59.009> your<00:01:59.130> glycogen<00:01:59.430> stores<00:01:59.939> are

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
and therefore your glycogen stores are

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.300 
and therefore your glycogen stores are
lower<00:02:00.240> because<00:02:01.049> what<00:02:01.290> happens<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.890> when<00:02:02.189> you

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
lower because what happens is when you

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.010 
lower because what happens is when you
switch<00:02:02.520> over<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.909> high-carb<00:02:03.450> diet<00:02:03.719> you

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
switch over to a high-carb diet you

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.440 
switch over to a high-carb diet you
actually<00:02:04.409> reduce<00:02:04.920> your<00:02:05.490> fat<00:02:05.909> intake<00:02:05.939> of

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
