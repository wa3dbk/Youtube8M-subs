Windows a 64-bit operating system 8 gig

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.530 
Windows a 64-bit operating system 8 gig
ram<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:08.730> same<00:04:09.030> cpu<00:04:09.840> is<00:04:09.959> mine<00:04:10.310> but<00:04:11.310> he's<00:04:11.640> got<00:04:11.820> a

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
ram the same cpu is mine but he's got a

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.270

hybrid<00:04:14.510> yeah<00:04:15.510> XD<00:04:16.019> hi<00:04:16.140> Bruno<00:04:16.560> hard<00:04:16.919> drive<00:04:17.100> so

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
hybrid yeah XD hi Bruno hard drive so

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.409 
hybrid yeah XD hi Bruno hard drive so
it's<00:04:17.430> like<00:04:18.019> it's<00:04:19.019> both<00:04:19.380> SSD<00:04:19.950> and<00:04:20.220> hard<00:04:21.180> drive

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
it's like it's both SSD and hard drive

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.750 
it's like it's both SSD and hard drive
together<00:04:21.780> I<00:04:22.019> think<00:04:22.410> that's<00:04:22.680> good<00:04:22.950> on<00:04:23.070> the

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
together I think that's good on the

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.590 
together I think that's good on the
smaller<00:04:24.090> in<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.480> buggy<00:04:24.720> 1<00:04:25.290> SSD<00:04:25.800> just<00:04:26.600> it

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
smaller in the buggy 1 SSD just it

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.380 
smaller in the buggy 1 SSD just it
doesn't<00:04:27.750> comes<00:04:27.990> closest<00:04:28.470> is<00:04:29.250> is<00:04:30.030> do<00:04:30.210> nothing

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
doesn't comes closest is is do nothing

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.150 
doesn't comes closest is is do nothing
