00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.650
 we will continue to do everything with him 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.310
 our strategy and today we will deal with those 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.440
 to 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.559
 fix some bugs and start doing 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.120
 cities for here these on shuhera giving well and 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.950
 we will have a very simple cancer 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.830
 start making it about this lesson and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.990
 finish the next lesson so what 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.850
 let's start fixing bugs not first 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.800
 the bug that we fix it we fix 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.789
 such a bug that we did not appear here 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.580
 these crumbs and a strip of life at the start 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.650
 level when we run our game so 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.350
 that this should be done to us, we 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.360
 will just put invisible when 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.180
 start and our here these circles and 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.950
 stripes with lives and see what we have 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.120
 It turned out that's what we have now 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.690
 no imagine the level of these strips 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.030
 and life so but if we introduce only 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.449
 believe strip and life with us 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.530
 there Well let's do not collect 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.100
 2 bar 2 baku is that we 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.720
 when we introduce our here these units 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.490
 when we remove this winding 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.010
 we still remain as if chosen 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.580
 and even if these units are not allowed 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.130
 I chose how I wanted to be valid if 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.350
 let only wanted to choose two 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.299
 of these and randomly choose one another 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.710
 unit then we will have to drop our 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.350
 Stroke I re-enter but do not want 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.000
 so that we have it and therefore I will do 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.280
 new event which is 1 this tank for 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.549
 this we go events and did this 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.549
 event 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.640
 if we let go of our mouse if we 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.450
 only let our mouse go 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.680
 found give junkies become selected 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:59.530
 that's how they see at the start not 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:03.880
 chosen like this they are chosen from us well 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:08.320
 let's say if i chose only let's say 2 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.230
 units here are co2 emissions and no of the our 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.960
 the third is not chosen from them, that is, from us 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.890
 everything works well well let's 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.870
 let's start creating an enemy program let's start 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.209
 create what we say in this lesson and 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.920
 finished in the next lesson you need 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.920
 will make to start creating 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.870
 our enemy first we will need 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.910
 add 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.540
 our enemy's sprites and life's sprites for 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.580
 our enemy 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.820
 well let's say our enemy will be brown 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.190
 colors then we measure these all 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.910
 pictures on real sprites on 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.769
 real graphics which we will have well 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.250
 but for now we will have this brown 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:56.080
 sprite and let's add a strip right away 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:03:01.630
 lives well what's just red 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:05.310
 a strip with sizes you fit 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.310
 Now I will say with what size with 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.709
 24 by 5 sizes 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:22.560
 23 on 5 so well let's add ours here 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.069
 this strip of life in a container to ours 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.599
 to the enemy 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:32.489
 this is you 28 sprite add object to 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:34.799
 container and look 28 sprite yes all 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.260
 right and here it is our strip lives 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:41.099
 tied to our therefore brown 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.260
 sprites that is to our enemy so what 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.950
 let's do our strip 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.620
 I would always was here at the top and at the 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.280
 this lesson is over in the next part we 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.760
 We go so that ours is this strip 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.560
 decreased when 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:01.409
 of our here these units coming to our 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:05.159
 the enemy and our units could 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:08.459
 make life well then give or he 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:11.220
 so that our our strip would fasten 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.019
 above and on this lesson is over well 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.620
 let's first create a new group 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:21.260
 and call the enemy so called our group 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:27.409
 enemy and make such an event so system 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:33.000
 always us 2080 krayt determines the position 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:38.370
 on the object our brown sprite is 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.510
 spray 27 and point one so well point we have 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:46.949
 still not worth it let's put this point 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:49.500
 So we call our point 1 and put it 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.840
 over here 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.910
 and see what we did well 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.180
 let's say on the post of our enemy here 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:01.600
 and see that our lives over here 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.810
 automatically when you put in the Well 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.729
 Basically everything I think on this lesson 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.990
 finished next part as i say we 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.400
 do this found enemies and everything to everyone 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.830
