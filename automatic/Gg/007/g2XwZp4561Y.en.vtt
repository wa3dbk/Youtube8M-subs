00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.540
 and that's it 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.309
 I will proceed to approve the project 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:13.150
 remember an image made 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.150
 daimon tools to see what 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.160
 I recommend you play here windows 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.230
 media player nose in payment the liberia to 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.140
 its not yet because the divine has 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.840
 built good all here are the 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.340
 poster presentation 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.199
 well here is expanded to maximum 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.190
 screen that I do it very neat I do not know 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.660
 if you catch it 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.660
 take it so it looks the same 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.670
 i 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.840
 the highlight 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.690
 and that it has moved a bit does not matter 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.269
 because I expand 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.860
 the menu at the end to make it look good 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:56.230
 in square pixels 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.230
 could expand then 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:05.120
 on the vertical sides with the buttons 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.800
 it is static term and achieved movement 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.540
 but 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.610
 but not what I'm explaining that 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.180
 just that it's a menu of this definition 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.180
 nothing else 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.320
 with the navigation buttons 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:28.070
 I recommend trying the images or 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.050
 and the number in something bad always have 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.330
 sancor open to simply become 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.270
 the project when it was codified from 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.090
 about 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.090
 five minutes create the image 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.010
 but let's go to the side since it 's okay 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.570
 and here I am checking ahead 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.320
 the presentation of each clip of each 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.970
 chapter 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.040
 but they are not reading again and again 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.780
 when you are not watching the disc 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.540
 and if it's okay all that would be left is 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.540
 record in my projects images or 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.350
 the proof that you have to be 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.900
 but they end up doing this when the 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.900
 poster at the end is outdated 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.820
 Y 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.620
 I would say that this tide I recommend that 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.720
 Dismantle images or 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.170
 and a program to burn this the 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.799
 directly issues would be in the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.130
 divided that is not updated on 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.110
 2010-2011 but 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.510
 but I recommend that if you 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.970
 works well then yes 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.860
 if you do not know baseball stan ero 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.040
 I like this one because that's just 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.660
 grab here I do not even need to have 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.840
 the smooth mounted and I only proceed to 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.730
 burn it and I recommend that yes 6x that is 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.860
 a speed standard for any 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.710
 / 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.210
 in what is film and good everything would be 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.590
 Thank you very much for watching the video 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.590
 tutorial see you later
