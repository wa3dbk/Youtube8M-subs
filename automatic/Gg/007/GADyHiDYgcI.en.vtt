00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:34.260
 for me it's the 2015 tour will be mine 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.320
 fourth tour I made the tunnel in 2004 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.760
 in 2008 2014 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.670
 this year's will be the fourth tour 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.210
 I started cycling from 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.540
 very small at the age of eight I have 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.280
 made all the youth categories to 8 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.210
 years 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.699
 8th in the first race I now have 35 then 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.699
 I have been running many for 27 years 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.019
 let's say that in the years in the end years 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.060
 eighties fine years early nineties e 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.909
 I watched the tour of Italy the tour de 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.520
 france and I saw the clashes between 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.909
 chiappucci dark indurain and I liked them 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.770
 all three of us say that in that period 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.119
 I had a great time looking at the races of 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.890
 honeycomb clearly for big mummies 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.010
 at the beginning a little more for chiappucci a 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.930
 a little more ashamed and it was nice to see them 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.370
 all three struggling to win the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.710
 tour and the tour 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.270
 we say that as a child almost always 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.970
 those first categories won 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.700
 juveniles from very young to 8 amino 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.980
 I won a lot then clearly 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.690
 victories that count on those from 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.520
 professional and professional la 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.500
 he won first in 2002 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.500
 first my first professional year 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.920
 Lombard week 2002 according to peres 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.920
 first boots 2002 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.950
 but it's in mine during my keys 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.340
 career I never had big 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.350
 physical problems 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.080
 I had more or less difficulties 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:15.270
 difficult and I've always overcome it, we say 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.970
 thanks to the help of my family 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.739
 and my wife 's as always seen 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:25.010
 always leaning on the family like 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.570
 as support it is still less always now 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.190
 made to feel calm and always have 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.450
 difficulties overcome difficulties 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.040
 so pretty much I knew mine 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.800
 wife thanks to the bicycle because 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.050
 why 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.770
 the brother ran as an amateur e 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.960
 We were married from 2000 crismi 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.310
 cancer if I'm wrong we have been married for a long time 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:52.070
 time and and we have twins my wife 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.140
 they are called Venetian and we have two 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.300
 giacomo and tommaso twins than in August 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.440
 they will be three years old 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.180
 I believe that there is little there is little to 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.880
 say part chickpea we have in the team 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:09.260
 nibali which starts as the number one who 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.810
 last year we left almost with the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.010
 yellow jersey arrived in paris 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.780
 triumphant so I believe that morale 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.840
 trust is very high because 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.010
 vincenzo already already tripping then moral 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.930
 in the app 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.930
