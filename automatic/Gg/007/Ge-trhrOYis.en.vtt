and we come into slide master and you
can<00:00:55.559> see<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.920> I've<00:00:56.070> got<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> custom<00:00:56.789> slide

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
drew out the flow instructor of the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.560 
drew out the flow instructor of the
PowerPoint<00:01:58.049> slides<00:01:58.350> if<00:01:58.740> you'll<00:01:59.340> remember

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
PowerPoint slides if you'll remember

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.120 
PowerPoint slides if you'll remember
slide<00:02:00.570> number<00:02:00.930> one<00:02:01.140> actually<00:02:01.380> had<00:02:01.770> three

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
slide number one actually had three

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.160 
slide number one actually had three
hyperlinks<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:02.969> went<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.570> respective

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
hyperlinks that went to the respective

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.600 
hyperlinks that went to the respective
slides<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.799> was<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> simple<00:02:05.219> branching

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
slides so it was a simple branching

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.850 
slides so it was a simple branching
interaction<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.899> we<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.140> see<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.530> story

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
interaction and we can see that story

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.889 
interaction and we can see that story
view<00:02:08.099> actually<00:02:08.399> shows<00:02:08.670> us<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:08.970> way<00:02:09.629> that

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
view actually shows us the way that

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.170 
view actually shows us the way that
branches<00:02:10.550> let's<00:02:11.550> go<00:02:11.640> ahead<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.910> double<00:02:12.150> click

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
branches let's go ahead and double click

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.670 
branches let's go ahead and double click
on<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.599> first<00:02:12.870> slide

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
on the first slide

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.500 
on the first slide
so<00:02:13.950> if<00:02:14.069> we<00:02:14.220> look<00:02:14.340> at<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.579> timeline<00:02:15.150> you'll

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
so if we look at the timeline you'll

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.360 
so if we look at the timeline you'll
notice<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.959> all<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.379> objects<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.220> had

notice that all the objects that you had

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.460 
notice that all the objects that you had
on<00:02:17.519> your<00:02:17.640> slide<00:02:18.000> are<00:02:18.299> are<00:02:18.659> objects<00:02:19.200> on<00:02:19.379> the

on your slide are are objects on the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.259 
on your slide are are objects on the
timeline<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.250> means<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:20.700> can<00:02:20.849> edit<00:02:21.060> your

storyline let's go ahead and look at the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.319 
storyline let's go ahead and look at the
slide<00:02:45.810> master<00:02:46.079> so<00:02:46.500> if<00:02:46.590> we<00:02:46.680> go<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.829> view<00:02:47.329> slide

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
slide master so if we go to view slide

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.869 
slide master so if we go to view slide
master<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.379> should<00:02:49.620> have<00:02:49.769> two<00:02:49.980> slide<00:02:50.310> masters

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
master you should have two slide masters

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.000 
master you should have two slide masters
so<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.629> should<00:02:51.930> have<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.230> original<00:02:52.739> slide

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
so you should have the original slide

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.979 
so you should have the original slide
master<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.670> came<00:02:53.909> as<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.120> default<00:02:54.599> when<00:02:54.900> you

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
master that came as a default when you

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.140 
master that came as a default when you
opened<00:02:55.349> up<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.560> project<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.159> then<00:02:56.879> now<00:02:57.090> you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
opened up the project and then now you

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.240 
opened up the project and then now you
have<00:02:57.450> your<00:02:57.569> imported<00:02:58.200> slide<00:02:58.500> master<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.040> you

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
have your imported slide master and you

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.039 
have your imported slide master and you
can<00:02:59.430> see<00:02:59.579> we<00:02:59.670> also<00:02:59.819> have<00:02:59.970> those<00:03:00.209> custom

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
can see we also have those custom

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.699 
can see we also have those custom
layouts<00:03:02.689> now<00:03:03.689> let's<00:03:03.930> look<00:03:04.079> at<00:03:04.200> what<00:03:04.349> happened

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
layouts now let's look at what happened

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.649 
layouts now let's look at what happened
to<00:03:04.739> those<00:03:04.950> hyperlinks<00:03:05.220> you'll<00:03:06.150> remember<00:03:06.540> on

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
to those hyperlinks you'll remember on

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.300 
to those hyperlinks you'll remember on
the<00:03:06.780> first<00:03:07.049> slide<00:03:07.230> we<00:03:07.500> have<00:03:07.620> hyperlinks<00:03:08.069> that

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
the first slide we have hyperlinks that

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.640 
the first slide we have hyperlinks that
went<00:03:08.609> to<00:03:08.700> these<00:03:08.849> three<00:03:09.150> different<00:03:09.329> slides<00:03:09.870> so

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
went to these three different slides so

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.619 
went to these three different slides so
those<00:03:10.889> shapes<00:03:11.250> here<00:03:11.819> like<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.150> art<00:03:12.329> team

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
those shapes here like the art team

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.110 
those shapes here like the art team
shape<00:03:13.079> had<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.739> hyperlink<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.579> our<00:03:14.790> team

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
shape had a hyperlink to the our team

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.080 
shape had a hyperlink to the our team
slide<00:03:15.709> instead<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.799> hyperlinks<00:03:17.250> now<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.849> have

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
slide instead of hyperlinks now you have

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.479 
slide instead of hyperlinks now you have
triggers<00:03:18.599> so<00:03:19.139> that's<00:03:19.319> a<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.769> rectangle<00:03:20.340> as<00:03:20.459> a

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
triggers so that's a the rectangle as a

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.509 
triggers so that's a the rectangle as a
trigger<00:03:20.849> that<00:03:21.150> goes<00:03:21.359> to<00:03:21.569> slide<00:03:21.840> 2.2<00:03:22.650> this

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
trigger that goes to slide 2.2 this

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.640 
trigger that goes to slide 2.2 this
rectangle<00:03:24.239> has<00:03:24.419> a<00:03:24.720> trigger<00:03:25.079> that<00:03:25.349> goes<00:03:25.500> to

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
rectangle has a trigger that goes to

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.650 
rectangle has a trigger that goes to
slide<00:03:25.919> 2.3<00:03:26.760> so<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.090> can<00:03:27.239> see<00:03:27.389> that<00:03:27.540> the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
slide 2.3 so you can see that the

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.710 
slide 2.3 so you can see that the
hyperlinks<00:03:28.230> were<00:03:28.349> converted<00:03:28.859> to<00:03:28.889> triggers

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
hyperlinks were converted to triggers

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.599 
hyperlinks were converted to triggers
now<00:03:30.720> when<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.049> import<00:03:31.500> PowerPoint<00:03:31.769> slides

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
now when you import PowerPoint slides

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.490 
now when you import PowerPoint slides
into<00:03:33.090> storyline<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.930> may<00:03:34.049> have<00:03:34.169> to<00:03:34.319> do<00:03:34.470> a

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
into storyline you may have to do a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.020 
into storyline you may have to do a
little<00:03:34.680> bit<00:03:34.889> of<00:03:34.980> tweaking<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.579> here's<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.849> good

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
little bit of tweaking and here's a good

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.420 
little bit of tweaking and here's a good
example<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.810> if<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.680> click<00:03:37.739> on<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.220> blue

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
example of that if I click on the blue

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.970 
example of that if I click on the blue
slide<00:03:38.959> you'll<00:03:39.959> notice<00:03:40.019> I<00:03:40.409> have<00:03:40.560> three

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
slide you'll notice I have three

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.670 
slide you'll notice I have three
triggers<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:42.299> I<00:03:42.359> have<00:03:42.479> my<00:03:42.629> player<00:03:42.959> trigger<00:03:43.409> so

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
triggers so I have my player trigger so

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.259 
triggers so I have my player trigger so
I<00:03:43.739> have<00:03:43.829> my<00:03:43.949> next<00:03:44.250> button<00:03:44.639> in<00:03:44.729> my<00:03:44.849> previous

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
I have my next button in my previous

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.659 
I have my next button in my previous
button<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.870> those<00:03:46.440> come<00:03:46.769> from<00:03:46.799> storyline<00:03:47.519> by

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
button and those come from storyline by

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.729 
button and those come from storyline by
default<00:03:48.150> but<00:03:48.690> you'll<00:03:48.840> also<00:03:49.019> notice<00:03:49.409> I<00:03:49.590> have

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
default but you'll also notice I have

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.289 
default but you'll also notice I have
this<00:03:49.889> slide<00:03:50.069> trigger<00:03:50.609> and<00:03:50.879> that<00:03:50.909> slide

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
this slide trigger and that slide

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.270 
this slide trigger and that slide
triggers<00:03:51.780> jump<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.409> next<00:03:52.680> slide<00:03:52.889> when<00:03:53.159> the

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
triggers jump to next slide when the

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.280 
triggers jump to next slide when the
timeline<00:03:53.549> ends<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.359> that<00:03:54.389> came<00:03:55.109> from

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
timeline ends and that came from

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.159 
timeline ends and that came from
PowerPoint<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.909> reason<00:03:57.269> PowerPoint<00:03:57.810> created

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
PowerPoint the reason PowerPoint created

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.050 
PowerPoint the reason PowerPoint created
that<00:03:58.290> trigger<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:58.739> because<00:03:59.069> it's<00:03:59.280> linear<00:03:59.819> and

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
that trigger is because it's linear and

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.030 
that trigger is because it's linear and
it<00:04:00.540> expects<00:04:01.139> that<00:04:01.349> I'm<00:04:01.440> going<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:01.859> auto

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
it expects that I'm going to auto

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.430 
it expects that I'm going to auto
advance<00:04:02.579> from<00:04:02.790> one<00:04:03.000> slide<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.329> the<00:04:03.569> next<00:04:03.659> so

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
advance from one slide to the next so

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.589 
advance from one slide to the next so
when<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.590> bring<00:04:04.889> it<00:04:05.010> into<00:04:05.159> storyline<00:04:05.940> it's

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
when I bring it into storyline it's

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.300 
when I bring it into storyline it's
going<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.870> bring<00:04:07.109> in<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.379> trigger<00:04:07.769> as<00:04:08.010> well

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
going to bring in that trigger as well

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.860 
going to bring in that trigger as well
so<00:04:08.609> I<00:04:08.639> need<00:04:08.849> to<00:04:08.909> get<00:04:09.030> rid<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:09.299> that<00:04:09.540> trigger

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
so I need to get rid of that trigger

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.780 
so I need to get rid of that trigger
because<00:04:10.409> I<00:04:10.590> don't<00:04:10.799> want<00:04:10.979> it<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.159> auto<00:04:11.340> advance

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
because I don't want it to auto advance

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.580 
because I don't want it to auto advance
I<00:04:11.970> only<00:04:12.180> wanted<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.569> advance<00:04:12.959> when<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.349> user

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
I only wanted to advance when the user

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.009 
I only wanted to advance when the user
clicks<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.129> next<00:04:14.549> button<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.599> get<00:04:15.780> rid<00:04:15.959> of

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
clicks the next button so to get rid of

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.270 
clicks the next button so to get rid of
those<00:04:16.260> triggers<00:04:16.799> we're<00:04:16.949> going<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.130> go<00:04:17.220> to

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
those triggers we're going to go to

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.060 
those triggers we're going to go to
story<00:04:17.669> view<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.780> can<00:04:18.989> just<00:04:19.169> select<00:04:19.349> all<00:04:19.769> of

story view and I can just select all of
my<00:04:20.250> slides<00:04:20.699> I'm<00:04:21.060> going<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.209> hit<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.510> control

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
my slides I'm going to hit the control

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.019 
my slides I'm going to hit the control
key<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.229> select<00:04:22.380> those<00:04:22.889> I'm<00:04:23.669> going<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:23.880> come

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:24.029 
key to select those I'm going to come

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:26.240 
key to select those I'm going to come
over<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.300> slide<00:04:24.750> properties<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.979> where<00:04:26.159> it

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
over to slide properties and where it

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.530 
over to slide properties and where it
says<00:04:26.400> slide<00:04:26.729> advances

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
says slide advances

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.930 
says slide advances
instead<00:04:27.960> of<00:04:28.050> automatically<00:04:28.740> we're<00:04:29.730> going<00:04:29.880> to

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
instead of automatically we're going to

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.500 
instead of automatically we're going to
choose<00:04:30.210> by<00:04:30.450> user<00:04:31.130> so<00:04:32.130> what<00:04:32.340> happens<00:04:32.790> is<00:04:33.000> these

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
choose by user so what happens is these

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.600 
choose by user so what happens is these
slides<00:04:33.960> will<00:04:34.170> only<00:04:34.380> advance<00:04:34.800> if<00:04:35.040> I<00:04:35.160> if<00:04:35.430> the

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
slides will only advance if I if the

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.850 
slides will only advance if I if the
user<00:04:35.880> clicks<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.450> previous/next<00:04:36.900> button<00:04:37.080> or

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
user clicks the previous/next button or

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.790 
user clicks the previous/next button or
in<00:04:38.280> this<00:04:38.430> case<00:04:38.700> clicks<00:04:39.120> one<00:04:39.390> of<00:04:39.540> these<00:04:39.800> trigger

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
in this case clicks one of these trigger

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.370 
in this case clicks one of these trigger
objects<00:04:41.610> so<00:04:42.270> if<00:04:42.360> we<00:04:42.450> look<00:04:42.600> at<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.840> blue<00:04:43.020> slide

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
objects so if we look at the blue slide

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.560 
objects so if we look at the blue slide
now<00:04:43.740> we<00:04:43.770> only<00:04:44.100> have<00:04:44.310> two<00:04:44.550> triggers<00:04:45.030> we<00:04:45.420> have

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
now we only have two triggers we have

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.330 
now we only have two triggers we have
the<00:04:45.690> next<00:04:45.960> button<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.710> previous<00:04:47.100> button

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
the next button and the previous button

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.670 
the next button and the previous button
and<00:04:47.550> we<00:04:47.640> got<00:04:47.820> rid<00:04:48.000> of<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.480> trigger<00:04:49.200> that<00:04:49.440> came

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
and we got rid of the trigger that came

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.130 
and we got rid of the trigger that came
from<00:04:49.980> PowerPoint<00:04:50.820> one<00:04:51.540> other<00:04:51.720> consideration

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
from PowerPoint one other consideration

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.860 
from PowerPoint one other consideration
when<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:52.830> import<00:04:53.190> PowerPoint<00:04:53.820> slides<00:04:54.180> it's

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
when you import PowerPoint slides it's

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.960 
when you import PowerPoint slides it's
kind<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.140> the<00:04:55.230> interactive<00:04:55.830> feel<00:04:56.370> of<00:04:56.610> the

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
kind of the interactive feel of the

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.540 
kind of the interactive feel of the
course<00:04:57.330> so<00:04:58.020> for<00:04:58.290> example<00:04:58.860> we<00:04:59.010> click<00:04:59.250> on<00:04:59.400> this

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
course so for example we click on this

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.270 
course so for example we click on this
first<00:04:59.850> slide<00:05:00.170> these<00:05:01.170> right<00:05:01.440> here<00:05:01.770> are<00:05:01.830> button

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
first slide these right here are button

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.300 
first slide these right here are button
so<00:05:02.700> if<00:05:02.790> we<00:05:02.940> preview<00:05:03.390> this<00:05:03.510> scene<00:05:04.040> when<00:05:05.040> we<00:05:05.160> look

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
so if we preview this scene when we look

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.980 
so if we preview this scene when we look
at<00:05:05.400> this<00:05:05.550> slide<00:05:05.700> we<00:05:05.970> see<00:05:06.120> we<00:05:06.270> have<00:05:06.300> buttons<00:05:06.840> so

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
at this slide we see we have buttons so

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.140 
at this slide we see we have buttons so
when<00:05:07.110> I<00:05:07.140> click<00:05:07.410> on<00:05:07.590> this<00:05:07.770> it<00:05:08.100> goes<00:05:08.310> to<00:05:08.610> its

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
when I click on this it goes to its

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.710 
when I click on this it goes to its
respective<00:05:09.810> slide<00:05:10.340> but<00:05:11.340> there's<00:05:12.240> really<00:05:12.450> no

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
respective slide but there's really no

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.900 
respective slide but there's really no
interactive<00:05:13.410> feedback<00:05:13.620> so<00:05:14.610> one<00:05:14.760> of<00:05:14.790> the

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
interactive feedback so one of the

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.880 
interactive feedback so one of the
advantages<00:05:15.510> that<00:05:15.570> storyline<00:05:16.230> has<00:05:16.470> over

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
advantages that storyline has over

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.740 
advantages that storyline has over
PowerPoint<00:05:17.520> is<00:05:17.760> the<00:05:18.180> interactive

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
PowerPoint is the interactive

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.990 
PowerPoint is the interactive
capabilities<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:19.740> features<00:05:20.130> so<00:05:20.760> what<00:05:20.910> we

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
capabilities and the features so what we

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.820 
capabilities and the features so what we
can<00:05:21.180> do<00:05:21.390> is<00:05:21.540> make<00:05:21.780> these<00:05:22.050> buttons<00:05:22.470> a<00:05:22.620> little

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
can do is make these buttons a little

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.290 
can do is make these buttons a little
bit<00:05:22.950> more<00:05:23.100> interactive<00:05:23.310> so<00:05:23.700> I'll<00:05:23.910> show<00:05:24.060> you<00:05:24.150> an

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
bit more interactive so I'll show you an

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.510 
bit more interactive so I'll show you an
easy<00:05:24.510> way<00:05:24.720> to<00:05:24.900> do<00:05:25.170> that<00:05:25.410> and<00:05:25.650> then<00:05:26.040> in<00:05:26.190> a<00:05:26.280> future

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
easy way to do that and then in a future

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.210 
easy way to do that and then in a future
tutorial<00:05:26.820> we'll<00:05:27.270> actually<00:05:27.420> go<00:05:27.750> into

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
tutorial we'll actually go into

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.650 
tutorial we'll actually go into
interactivity<00:05:29.220> in<00:05:29.280> more<00:05:29.490> depth<00:05:29.820> so<00:05:30.090> let's

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
interactivity in more depth so let's

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.280 
interactivity in more depth so let's
close<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.050> preview<00:05:32.270> so<00:05:33.270> if<00:05:33.330> I<00:05:33.420> select<00:05:33.630> my<00:05:33.870> our

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
close the preview so if I select my our

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.740 
close the preview so if I select my our
team<00:05:34.620> button<00:05:35.070> I'm<00:05:35.760> going<00:05:35.910> to<00:05:36.000> go<00:05:36.090> to<00:05:36.210> States

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
team button I'm going to go to States

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.680 
team button I'm going to go to States
any<00:05:37.520> object<00:05:38.520> that<00:05:38.550> you<00:05:38.760> put<00:05:38.940> on<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.180> slide<00:05:39.420> in

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
any object that you put on the slide in

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.200 
any object that you put on the slide in
storyline<00:05:39.890> can<00:05:40.890> have<00:05:40.980> multiple<00:05:41.400> states<00:05:41.970> in

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
storyline can have multiple states in

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.270 
storyline can have multiple states in
this<00:05:42.690> case<00:05:42.930> we<00:05:43.110> just<00:05:43.140> have<00:05:43.350> a<00:05:43.440> normal<00:05:43.740> state

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
this case we just have a normal state

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.580 
this case we just have a normal state
and<00:05:44.670> we<00:05:44.880> want<00:05:45.090> to<00:05:45.150> add<00:05:45.300> a<00:05:45.330> simple<00:05:45.720> hover<00:05:46.140> effect

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
and we want to add a simple hover effect

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.890 
and we want to add a simple hover effect
so<00:05:47.130> when<00:05:47.280> I'm<00:05:47.400> rolling<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:47.940> mouse<00:05:47.970> over<00:05:48.720> that

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
so when I'm rolling the mouse over that

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.500 
so when I'm rolling the mouse over that
button<00:05:49.290> it<00:05:49.500> moves<00:05:50.190> so<00:05:51.030> we're<00:05:51.150> going<00:05:51.270> to<00:05:51.360> go

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
button it moves so we're going to go

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.290 
button it moves so we're going to go
ahead<00:05:51.660> and<00:05:52.080> choose<00:05:52.320> edit<00:05:52.590> States<00:05:53.180> we're<00:05:54.180> going

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
ahead and choose edit States we're going

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.260 
ahead and choose edit States we're going
to<00:05:54.360> create<00:05:54.600> a<00:05:54.660> new<00:05:54.900> state<00:05:55.640> the<00:05:56.640> hover<00:05:56.910> is<00:05:57.120> one

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
to create a new state the hover is one

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.180 
to create a new state the hover is one
of<00:05:57.360> those<00:05:57.480> pre-built<00:05:58.050> States<00:05:58.440> and<00:05:58.680> storylines

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
of those pre-built States and storylines

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.340 
of those pre-built States and storylines
so<00:05:59.340> if<00:05:59.430> I<00:05:59.520> just<00:05:59.730> click<00:05:59.880> the<00:06:00.120> drop<00:06:00.390> down<00:06:00.420> you<00:06:01.290> can

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
so if I just click the drop down you can

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.570 
so if I just click the drop down you can
see<00:06:01.590> I've<00:06:01.710> got<00:06:01.830> a<00:06:01.890> number<00:06:02.070> of<00:06:02.280> pre-built

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
see I've got a number of pre-built

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.550 
see I've got a number of pre-built
States<00:06:03.180> we're<00:06:03.600> just<00:06:03.810> going<00:06:03.960> to<00:06:04.020> choose<00:06:04.230> hover

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
States we're just going to choose hover

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.060 
States we're just going to choose hover
I'm<00:06:05.520> going<00:06:05.700> to<00:06:05.760> hit<00:06:05.880> add<00:06:06.180> and<00:06:06.540> now<00:06:07.500> I<00:06:07.530> can<00:06:07.800> edit

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
I'm going to hit add and now I can edit

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.490 
I'm going to hit add and now I can edit
this<00:06:08.490> so<00:06:09.210> it<00:06:09.360> looks<00:06:09.570> a<00:06:09.690> little<00:06:09.810> different<00:06:10.320> so

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
this so it looks a little different so

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.990 
this so it looks a little different so
I'm<00:06:10.590> going<00:06:10.740> to<00:06:10.800> make<00:06:11.040> sure<00:06:11.070> I<00:06:11.220> double<00:06:11.670> click<00:06:11.850> on

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
that so I'm in my active state and I'm

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.520 
that so I'm in my active state and I'm
just<00:06:15.180> going<00:06:15.330> to<00:06:15.390> change<00:06:15.660> the<00:06:15.840> color<00:06:16.080> right<00:06:16.290> now

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
just going to change the color right now

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.590 
now we've got our normal state we've got
our<00:06:22.320> hover<00:06:22.560> State<00:06:22.980> I'm<00:06:23.880> going<00:06:24.030> to<00:06:24.090> close<00:06:24.300> this

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
our hover State I'm going to close this

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.220 
our hover State I'm going to close this
let's<00:06:24.900> preview<00:06:25.400> this<00:06:26.400> slide<00:06:26.970> now<00:06:27.390> and<00:06:27.840> as<00:06:28.200> you

interactive feedback will cover

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.950 
interactive feedback will cover
interactivity<00:06:33.000> in<00:06:33.090> more<00:06:33.240> detail<00:06:33.660> in<00:06:33.810> an

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
interactivity in more detail in an

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.230 
interactivity in more detail in an
upcoming<00:06:33.990> tutorial<00:06:34.880> but<00:06:35.880> for<00:06:36.060> right<00:06:36.180> now

upcoming tutorial but for right now
that's<00:06:36.630> a<00:06:36.720> simple<00:06:37.110> way<00:06:37.230> to<00:06:37.260> convert<00:06:37.770> the

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
that's a simple way to convert the

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.340 
that's a simple way to convert the
PowerPoint<00:06:38.520> buttons<00:06:39.450> and<00:06:39.930> make<00:06:40.110> them<00:06:40.290> a

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
PowerPoint buttons and make them a

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.320 
PowerPoint buttons and make them a
little<00:06:40.440> bit<00:06:40.650> more<00:06:40.680> interact

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
little bit more interact

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.140 
little bit more interact
and<00:06:42.229> now<00:06:42.319> to<00:06:42.379> summarize<00:06:42.830> the<00:06:43.250> tutorial<00:06:43.460> what

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
and now to summarize the tutorial what

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.689

hyperlinks were converted to triggers we

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.779 
hyperlinks were converted to triggers we
saw<00:06:55.819> that<00:06:56.060> the<00:06:56.509> slide<00:06:57.500> masters<00:06:58.069> in<00:06:58.250> PowerPoint

editable<00:07:06.830> and<00:07:07.190> we'll<00:07:07.879> cover<00:07:08.090> interactivity

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
editable and we'll cover interactivity

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.379 
editable and we'll cover interactivity
in<00:07:09.050> more<00:07:09.289> detail<00:07:09.710> in<00:07:09.889> a<00:07:09.979> future<00:07:10.190> tutorial<00:07:10.460> but

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.089 
in this case we learn how to convert a
simple<00:07:13.789> button<00:07:14.030> into<00:07:14.449> a<00:07:14.479> hover<00:07:14.900> button<00:07:15.379> to<00:07:15.919> add

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:16.099 
simple button into a hover button to add

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:17.379 
simple button into a hover button to add
a<00:07:16.129> little<00:07:16.370> bit<00:07:16.460> more<00:07:16.610> interactive<00:07:16.879> feedback

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:17.389 
a little bit more interactive feedback

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:19.330 
a little bit more interactive feedback
go<00:07:18.110> ahead<00:07:18.259> and<00:07:18.349> practice<00:07:18.560> importing

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.340 
go ahead and practice importing

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.790 
go ahead and practice importing

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:24.169 
slides and then in the next tutorial

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:25.300 
slides and then in the next tutorial
we'll<00:07:24.289> actually<00:07:24.650> look<00:07:24.800> at<00:07:24.949> how<00:07:25.039> to<00:07:25.099> build

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.310 
we'll actually look at how to build

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.469 
we'll actually look at how to build
interactive<00:07:25.849> e-learning<00:07:26.060> and<00:07:26.539> storyline
