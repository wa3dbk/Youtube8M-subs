00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.290
 edible mushrooms are considered healthy 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.260
 only the largest consumers of these products are the Asian countries 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.069
 mainly to china in japan 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:17.720
 in brazil a large part of the production of mushrooms is made in the municipality of mogi 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.880
 of the crosses and region and it was there that the owner of the food site 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.089
 showed us how it is done with the kind of most species of these people 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:28.089
 well first effect 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.050
 the substrate mixture here 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.230
 which is composed of wheat bran 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.960
 soybean meal 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.020
 p corn 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.050
 afp after mixing 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.570
 this time despairs 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.570
 this composite player inside that equipment 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.970
 these three points pass through the cistern 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.210
 redone in empty 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.170
 of substrate 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.370
 right after process is not capped 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.700
 all sports 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.960
 and goes to the autoclave for sterilization with 7-20 degrees above the mind for 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.670
 one hour 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.080
 preliminary 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.340
 every kind of fund he would have to pose 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.770
 harms the development of the same 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.330
 so after sterilized they go through the incorporation processes 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.430
 How does this process work? 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.540
 good and in the heart and 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.670
 you put 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.980
 the seed does not enter the substrate that new procedural phase 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.230
 free 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.710
 4th that maps chamber 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.930
 is changed from 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.830
 colonization or a right 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.830
 begins to develop within the substrate 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.510
 good after keita completed the colonization cycle we do the scraping 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.380
 so he can leave in a uniform way 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.210
 ie the fruiting is more uniform 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.170
 after affecting the stops is 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.430
 we throw water 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.430
 we had to wake up a thermal shock on the bottom 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.270
 then afterwards as the coach has the qualifying phase 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.229
 the temperature here we are not around 15 degrees 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.629
 How does the expansion process work? 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.359
 after the draw has been made 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:11.209
 it is 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.190
 begin 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.880
 the certification by the publisher itself here you see the beginning of crisis 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.259
 developing 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:19.870
 these are the first 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.859
 two three days 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.999
 now when it reaches 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.599
 around seven days 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.699
 he is already 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:27.610
 this morning 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.490
 what are you seeing in
