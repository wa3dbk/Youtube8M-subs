00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
skewers are not quite long enough to go

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.609 
skewers are not quite long enough to go
right<00:01:25.860> across<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.430> box<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.380> easiest

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
right across the box so the easiest

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.069 
right across the box so the easiest
thing<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.340> extend<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.820> skewer<00:01:33.270> make

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
thing I can do is extend the skewer make

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.719 
thing I can do is extend the skewer make
it<00:01:34.229> longer<00:01:35.000> let's<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:37.369> got<00:01:38.369> some<00:01:38.579> very

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
it longer let's do that I got some very

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.969 
it longer let's do that I got some very
thin<00:01:39.210> drinking<00:01:39.600> straws<00:01:40.170> here

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.690 

the<00:01:47.979> just<00:01:48.640> about<00:01:48.939> big<00:01:49.180> enough<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.630> go<00:01:49.750> over<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
the just about big enough to go over the

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:03.899 
the just about big enough to go over the
barbecue<00:01:52.240> skewer<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.340> can<00:02:03.520> make<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.700> that

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
barbecue skewer so I can make it that

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.680 
barbecue skewer so I can make it that
little<00:02:04.179> bit<00:02:04.299> bigger<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.160> will<00:02:09.280> do<00:02:09.690> to

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
little bit bigger and that will do to

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.990 
little bit bigger and that will do to
get<00:02:10.840> across<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.410> width<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:12.040> cardboard

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
get across the width of the cardboard

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.300 
get across the width of the cardboard
box<00:02:13.269> then<00:02:13.540> I'll<00:02:14.379> pop<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.650> little<00:02:14.890> bit<00:02:15.069> of<00:02:15.129> hot

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
box then I'll pop a little bit of hot

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.750 
box then I'll pop a little bit of hot
glue<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.549> there<00:02:15.849> just<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.239> hold<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.900> still<00:02:17.200> and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
glue in there just to hold it still and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.390 
glue in there just to hold it still and
that<00:02:18.760> will<00:02:18.880> do<00:02:19.030> for<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.269> front<00:02:19.480> axle<00:02:20.190> then<00:02:21.190> for

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
that will do for the front axle then for

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.490

hole<00:02:47.349> drilled<00:02:47.709> in<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.069> already<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:48.700> I'll<00:02:49.690> drill

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
hole drilled in it already so I'll drill

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.039 
hole drilled in it already so I'll drill
a<00:02:49.930> hole<00:02:50.109> through<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.980> middle<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.459> then<00:02:52.049> use

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
a hole through the middle and then use

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.259 
a hole through the middle and then use
that<00:02:54.000> on<00:02:55.000> another<00:02:55.299> barbecue<00:02:55.900> skewer<00:02:57.269> that's

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
that on another barbecue skewer that's

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.199 
that on another barbecue skewer that's
the<00:02:58.450> axle<00:02:59.459> for<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.519> back<00:03:00.700> wheel<00:03:03.000> right<00:03:04.000> that

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
the axle for the back wheel right that

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.479 
the axle for the back wheel right that
hole<00:03:04.480> that's<00:03:04.690> drilled<00:03:05.049> through<00:03:06.040> there<00:03:06.280> it's

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
hole that's drilled through there it's

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.490 
hole that's drilled through there it's
not<00:03:06.609> very<00:03:06.850> accurate<00:03:10.230> but<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.350> should<00:03:11.470> be

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
not very accurate but it should be

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:27.730 
not very accurate but it should be
alright

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.900 

so<00:03:28.400> that's<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.730> back<00:03:28.910> wheel<00:03:30.640> I'll<00:03:31.640> put<00:03:31.880> a

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
so that's the back wheel I'll put a

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.470 
so that's the back wheel I'll put a
little<00:03:32.060> peg<00:03:32.980> in<00:03:33.980> here<00:03:34.400> for<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.850> rubber<00:03:35.210> band

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
little peg in here for the rubber band

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.070 
little peg in here for the rubber band
to<00:03:35.630> grip<00:03:35.870> onto<00:03:37.210> then<00:03:38.210> we<00:03:38.300> can<00:03:38.450> just<00:03:38.630> wind<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:38.960> up

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
to grip onto then we can just wind it up

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.330 
to grip onto then we can just wind it up
on<00:03:39.320> one<00:03:39.650> side<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:42.070> that<00:03:43.070> should<00:03:43.250> be<00:03:43.310> good

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
on one side and that should be good

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.570 
on one side and that should be good
enough<00:03:43.960> got<00:03:44.960> a<00:03:45.020> big<00:03:45.260> hole<00:03:45.530> in<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.220> back<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.400> the

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
enough got a big hole in the back of the

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:59.530 
enough got a big hole in the back of the
box<00:03:49.420> so<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:50.450> we<00:03:50.810> all<00:03:51.020> can<00:03:51.200> go<00:03:51.380> there<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:58.540> think

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
box so that we all can go there I think

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.370 
box so that we all can go there I think
what<00:03:59.870> I'll<00:03:59.960> do<00:04:00.140> is<00:04:00.260> I'll<00:04:00.410> put<00:04:00.440> some<00:04:02.380> drinking

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
what I'll do is I'll put some drinking

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.440 
what I'll do is I'll put some drinking
straws<00:04:03.740> there<00:04:04.070> just<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.780> hold<00:04:05.780> it<00:04:05.960> in<00:04:06.080> place

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
straws there just to hold it in place

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.510 
straws there just to hold it in place
couple<00:04:08.450> more<00:04:08.600> bits<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:09.020> drinking<00:04:09.410> straw<00:04:09.770> at

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520
