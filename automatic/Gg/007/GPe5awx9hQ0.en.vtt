 a first meeting which is announced 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.379

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.690
 teams and it's the visitors who get 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.800

 see a the new recruit given in 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.659

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.090
 to make a small bridge on -2 before 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.250
 to uncheck a rolled right strike 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.939

 cross-bar 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.080

 right but the balloon flies frederic 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.960

 in 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.160
 we managed to play like how we 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.110
 hope and we try to recover on the 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.480
 first to half time to be able to 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.140
 From the brunt will be second 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.880

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.650
 we went down we went back we avoided

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.560
 in two so we had to make a 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.450
 sacrifice of sacrifices that's what will 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.610

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.490
 the referee of the meeting slowed on 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.970

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.230

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.570
 second half justin that one 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.580
 found in front positions for a head 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.370
 stung and you need a beautiful parade 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.670
 reflex bonnet monkeys or even side 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.220
 right for a center you can not manage 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.290
 deflect collonges honda the old 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.150

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.470
 toulouse on the occasion to come back with this 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.860
 free kick to doubt nor shot in the 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.959
 box 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.360
 the balloon sails into the surface of 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.489
 repair finally that so strikes the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.200
 right but you still need a new 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.910
 once a cup parade and then just 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.209
 before stoppage time - two misses 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.880
 past 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.400
 but the teen intercept him the new 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.739
 incoming accelerates 1.3 against 1 is looming 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.450
 but the attacker prefers to go alone there 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.430
 strike in the closed side and mark 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.769
 two goals to zero for onet-le-château 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.079
 Toulouse will not recover 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.170
 final victory of Aveyron in the ground 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.670
 Toulouse failed home starts for 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.140
 toulouse saint jo who will not have to 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.940
 leave too many points on the way 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.820
 if they want to succeed the same 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.310
 performance that last season we 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.620
 did not have the emissions coming to his 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.269
 days 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.870
 to win at least had come why 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:41.599
 lose and we took the match by the good 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.790
 tip and that allowed us to double the 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.379
 score is to hold until the end the 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.740
 the main thing is to maintain 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.640
 and after 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.230
 if we can do better than the year 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.460
 last by finishing fifth and 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.650
 last time we will take 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.910
 understand before the game will be a lot 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.670
 more than the championship will be a lot 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.050
 more complicated than radio and radio 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.180
 I would say that I saw good things 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.660
 in the offensive sector he missed the 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.030
 success 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.790
 the success of marking one think it 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.140
 is played on the missed penalty 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.430
 I think about the entry of the second half 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.290
 time because next to that we do a 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.280
 very big second half was created 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.049
 many situations 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.640
 after there is definitely a lack 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.169
 experience for some players who 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.430
 also discover the level so this is 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.799
 it's all learning that's it 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.330
 so that's the 7th defeat actually 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.300
 she represents well the dh with all the 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.190
 rigor that it imposes determination so 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.169
 I think rather that we will use 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.389
 this defeat to try to understand 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.180
 also why we lost it and then 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.289
 ce2 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.639
 to work well to bounce well 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.960
 next Saturday because after at 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.340
 side of that we also showed real 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.350
 interesting possibilities 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.570
 tonight the kicks stopped 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.080
 it was a weapon with us and we 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.080
 hurts tonight
