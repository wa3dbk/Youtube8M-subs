more accurate name for it is probably

out of your mouth now the way this works

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.450 
out of your mouth now the way this works
is<00:00:34.030> there's<00:00:34.269> some<00:00:34.480> kind<00:00:34.750> of<00:00:34.930> valve<00:00:35.320> in<00:00:36.160> your

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
is there's some kind of valve in your

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
there and when you do it if you stop

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.950 
there and when you do it if you stop
halfway<00:00:44.890> you'll<00:00:45.190> notice<00:00:45.489> that<00:00:45.640> your<00:00:45.910> mouth<00:00:46.690> is

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
halfway you'll notice that your mouth is

no longer connected to your lungs and
you<00:00:48.910> can't<00:00:49.120> breathe<00:00:49.390> can<00:00:49.719> you<00:00:49.750> tell<00:00:50.170> that<00:00:50.199> for

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
you can't breathe can you tell that for

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.459 
you can't breathe can you tell that for
me<00:00:50.649> going<00:00:50.859> like<00:00:51.219> fifths<00:00:51.969> but<00:00:52.839> you'll<00:00:53.050> notice

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
me going like fifths but you'll notice

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.200 
me going like fifths but you'll notice
if<00:00:53.620> you<00:00:53.649> try<00:00:53.949> and<00:00:54.100> breathe<00:00:54.339> in<00:00:54.579> through<00:00:55.120> your

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
if you try and breathe in through your

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.450 
if you try and breathe in through your
nose<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.820> can<00:00:58.409> but<00:00:59.409> you're<00:00:59.589> not<00:00:59.739> connected

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
nose you can but you're not connected

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.069 
nose you can but you're not connected
between<00:01:00.609> your<00:01:00.850> lungs<00:01:01.089> and<00:01:01.329> your<00:01:01.480> mouth<00:01:01.659> here's

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
between your lungs and your mouth here's

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.200 
between your lungs and your mouth here's
how<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.379> works<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:02.829> air<00:01:03.100> between<00:01:03.640> there<00:01:04.059> in

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
how it works the air between there in

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.010 
how it works the air between there in
your<00:01:04.330> mouth<00:01:04.540> runs<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.650> instrument<00:01:06.130> while<00:01:06.370> you

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
your mouth runs the instrument while you

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.470 
your mouth runs the instrument while you
take<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.050> breath<00:01:08.350> through<00:01:08.590> your<00:01:08.650> nose<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:09.880> it's

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
take a breath through your nose now it's

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.550 
take a breath through your nose now it's
not<00:01:10.600> going<00:01:10.720> to<00:01:10.810> work<00:01:10.900> if<00:01:11.020> you<00:01:11.110> just<00:01:11.140> try<00:01:11.500> it

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
not going to work if you just try it

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.890 
not going to work if you just try it
like<00:01:11.770> that<00:01:11.950> or<00:01:12.160> might<00:01:12.610> if<00:01:12.880> you're<00:01:13.090> lucky<00:01:13.240> so

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
like that or might if you're lucky so

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.020 
like that or might if you're lucky so
the<00:01:14.020> way<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.200> practice<00:01:14.710> it<00:01:14.860> is<00:01:15.040> and<00:01:15.460> I've<00:01:15.790> got

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
the way to practice it is and I've got

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.250 
the way to practice it is and I've got
one<00:01:16.180> right<00:01:16.210> here<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:18.880> a<00:01:18.910> glass<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.390> water<00:01:19.600> with

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
one right here get a glass of water with

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.340 
one right here get a glass of water with
a<00:01:20.290> straw<00:01:20.650> in<00:01:20.830> it<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:21.330> blow<00:01:22.330> bubbles<00:01:22.480> the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
a straw in it and blow bubbles the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.690 
a straw in it and blow bubbles the
reason<00:01:23.680> we<00:01:23.770> do<00:01:23.920> this<00:01:23.950> is<00:01:24.100> very<00:01:24.460> little

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
reason we do this is very little

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.700 
reason we do this is very little
pressure<00:01:24.970> is<00:01:25.300> required<00:01:25.930> to<00:01:26.230> blow<00:01:26.410> through<00:01:26.650> a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
pressure is required to blow through a

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.890 
pressure is required to blow through a
straw<00:01:26.980> compared<00:01:27.400> to<00:01:27.460> a<00:01:27.520> trumpet<00:01:27.940> and<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.600> start

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
straw compared to a trumpet and to start

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.300 
straw compared to a trumpet and to start
with<00:01:29.080> doing<00:01:29.260> this<00:01:29.440> with<00:01:29.590> a<00:01:29.620> low<00:01:29.770> pressure<00:01:30.070> is

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
with doing this with a low pressure is

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.790 
with doing this with a low pressure is
easier<00:01:30.790> and<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.570> bubbles<00:01:31.930> are<00:01:32.020> so<00:01:32.140> we<00:01:32.260> can<00:01:32.290> see

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
easier and the bubbles are so we can see

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.380 
easier and the bubbles are so we can see
the<00:01:33.010> Airstream<00:01:33.550> otherwise<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:33.940> can<00:01:34.030> go<00:01:34.120> am<00:01:34.300> i

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
the Airstream otherwise you can go am i

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.120 
the Airstream otherwise you can go am i
blowing<00:01:34.630> am<00:01:35.140> i<00:01:35.230> getting<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.560> good<00:01:35.710> Airstream

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
blowing am i getting a good Airstream

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.070 
blowing am i getting a good Airstream
until<00:01:36.850> very<00:01:37.150> easily<00:01:37.360> with<00:01:37.630> bubbles<00:01:37.930> in<00:01:38.020> a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
until very easily with bubbles in a

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.630 
until very easily with bubbles in a
glass<00:01:38.290> you're<00:01:38.500> getting<00:01:38.680> a<00:01:38.740> constant<00:01:39.370> stream

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
glass you're getting a constant stream

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.480 
glass you're getting a constant stream
of<00:01:39.700> air<00:01:40.230> the<00:01:41.230> way<00:01:41.440> to<00:01:41.500> start<00:01:41.890> doing<00:01:42.220> this<00:01:42.310> is

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
of air the way to start doing this is

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.450 
of air the way to start doing this is
quite<00:01:42.760> simply<00:01:43.150> to<00:01:43.720> do<00:01:43.930> it<00:01:44.080> just<00:01:44.920> get<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.190> straw

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.220 

now<00:02:59.760> it's<00:03:00.760> easier<00:03:01.330> if<00:03:01.450> you've<00:03:01.570> got<00:03:01.750> more<00:03:01.990> air

cheeks out quite a lot while they do it

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.480 
cheeks out quite a lot while they do it
it's<00:03:12.580> simply<00:03:13.210> to<00:03:13.750> fit<00:03:14.050> more<00:03:14.290> air<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.800> and<00:03:15.280> about

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
if you're doing some sort of improvised

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.259 
if you're doing some sort of improvised
solo<00:03:52.159> and<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:52.400> want<00:03:52.549> to<00:03:52.640> hang<00:03:52.760> on<00:03:52.909> to<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.030> note

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
solo and you want to hang on to a note

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.780 
solo and you want to hang on to a note
for<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.540> really<00:03:53.840> long<00:03:54.019> time<00:03:54.080> and<00:03:54.680> build<00:03:55.280> the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
for a really long time and build the

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.420 
for a really long time and build the
tension<00:03:56.060> in<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:57.019> music<00:03:57.379> it<00:03:57.769> certainly<00:03:58.220> does

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
tension in the music it certainly does

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.100 
tension in the music it certainly does
when<00:03:58.700> there's<00:03:58.879> no<00:03:59.000> breath<00:03:59.269> a<00:03:59.420> continuous<00:03:59.900> note

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
when there's no breath a continuous note

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.259 
when there's no breath a continuous note
really<00:04:00.530> has<00:04:00.799> the<00:04:01.010> audience<00:04:01.340> gasping<00:04:01.940> for<00:04:02.150> air

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
really has the audience gasping for air

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.850 
really has the audience gasping for air
I've<00:04:02.510> noticed<00:04:03.140> when<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.319> do<00:04:03.440> it

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
I've noticed when I do it

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.819 
I've noticed when I do it
so<00:04:04.549> to<00:04:05.090> recap<00:04:05.299> to<00:04:05.780> circular<00:04:06.260> breathe<00:04:06.290> start

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
so to recap to circular breathe start

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.259 
so to recap to circular breathe start
with<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.129> straw<00:04:07.400> in<00:04:07.549> the<00:04:07.640> glass<00:04:07.819> of<00:04:08.000> water<00:04:08.180> and

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
with the straw in the glass of water and

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.300 
with the straw in the glass of water and
just<00:04:08.450> blow<00:04:08.659> bubbles<00:04:09.049> and<00:04:09.650> don't<00:04:09.890> wait<00:04:10.069> too

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
just blow bubbles and don't wait too

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.460 
just blow bubbles and don't wait too
much<00:04:10.340> before<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.150> start<00:04:11.420> just<00:04:11.660> try<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:12.319> make

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
much before you start just try and make

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.839 
much before you start just try and make
that<00:04:12.680> case<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:13.160> in<00:04:13.310> your<00:04:13.400> throat<00:04:13.579> so<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:13.760> know

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
that case and in your throat so you know

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.550 
that case and in your throat so you know
what<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.000> feeling<00:04:14.359> is<00:04:14.480> but<00:04:14.989> then<00:04:15.109> don't<00:04:15.349> think

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
what the feeling is but then don't think

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.960 
what the feeling is but then don't think
about<00:04:15.890> that<00:04:16.100> when<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:16.340> do<00:04:16.489> it<00:04:16.579> just<00:04:16.760> blow

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
about that when you do it just blow

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.599 
about that when you do it just blow
bubbles<00:04:17.650> concentrate<00:04:18.650> on<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.919> bubbles<00:04:19.280> keep

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
bubbles concentrate on the bubbles keep

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.750 
bubbles concentrate on the bubbles keep
them<00:04:19.850> going<00:04:20.209> and<00:04:20.389> then<00:04:20.870> snatch<00:04:21.260> a<00:04:21.440> breath

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
them going and then snatch a breath

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.980 
them going and then snatch a breath
through<00:04:22.760> your<00:04:22.789> nose<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.419> you'll<00:04:23.810> notice

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
through your nose and you'll notice

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.659 
through your nose and you'll notice
after<00:04:24.289> a<00:04:24.320> couple<00:04:24.500> of<00:04:24.680> tries<00:04:24.889> of<00:04:25.100> that<00:04:25.250> the

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
after a couple of tries of that the

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.640 
after a couple of tries of that the
bubbles<00:04:25.970> don't<00:04:26.120> stop<00:04:26.479> your<00:04:27.199> circular

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
bubbles don't stop your circular

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.860 
bubbles don't stop your circular
breathing
