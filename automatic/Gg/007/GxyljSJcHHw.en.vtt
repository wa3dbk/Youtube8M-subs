really interesting because now kubo has

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.560 
really interesting because now kubo has
added<00:02:52.540> another<00:02:52.720> dynamic<00:02:52.990> aspect<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:54.570> bleach

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
added another dynamic aspect of bleach

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.980 
added another dynamic aspect of bleach
into<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.990> series<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.530> that's<00:02:56.770> how<00:02:57.640> good<00:02:58.150> were

of the noble families as you can see but
huge<00:03:27.040> as<00:03:27.190> mentioned<00:03:27.790> see<00:03:28.120> it's<00:03:28.239> pretty<00:03:28.390> noble

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
huge as mentioned see it's pretty noble

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.110 
huge as mentioned see it's pretty noble
to<00:03:28.900> me<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:29.440> so<00:03:30.160> possibly<00:03:30.580> that<00:03:30.820> may<00:03:30.970> be<00:03:31.030> the

we get to the ending oh shit it starts
raining<00:03:45.060> start<00:03:46.060> training<00:03:46.390> and<00:03:46.570> it<00:03:46.690> was<00:03:46.780> said

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
raining start training and it was said

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.560 
raining start training and it was said

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
by the two random Shinigami is that this

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.410 
by the two random Shinigami is that this
thing<00:03:50.230> attacks<00:03:50.799> when<00:03:51.010> it<00:03:51.100> begins<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.459> rain<00:03:51.580> so
