00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.319 
goes for but I'm going to assume it's
something<00:01:30.659> pretty<00:01:30.990> decent<00:01:31.530> like<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.579> didn't

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
something pretty decent like I didn't

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.730 
something pretty decent like I didn't
know<00:01:33.420> what<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.630> expect<00:01:33.659> right<00:01:34.229> there<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:34.590> I'm

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
know what to expect right there but I'm

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.710 
know what to expect right there but I'm
guessing<00:01:35.189> that's<00:01:35.549> something<00:01:35.640> pretty<00:01:36.240> decent

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
guessing that's something pretty decent

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.999 
guessing that's something pretty decent
something<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.200> goes<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> decent<00:01:37.770> amount

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
something that goes for a decent amount

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.800 
something that goes for a decent amount
of<00:01:38.189> coin<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.640> I'm<00:01:38.729> happy<00:01:38.939> with<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.210> depending

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
of coin so I'm happy with that depending

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.940 
of coin so I'm happy with that depending
on<00:01:39.900> how<00:01:40.079> much<00:01:40.200> he<00:01:40.320> actually<00:01:40.380> goes<00:01:40.619> for<00:01:40.860> I'm

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
on how much he actually goes for I'm

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.429 
on how much he actually goes for I'm
