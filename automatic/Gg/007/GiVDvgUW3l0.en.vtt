00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.240
 I'm home 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.500
 There is no one even though 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.029

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.230
 There is no money 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.180
 Not smart 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.730
 It's not about saying so much 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.730

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.720

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.720
 You can see what you are doing this time 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.410

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.340

 Hospitalization is 34 days 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.559
 Everybody falls back 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.559
 But 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:34.419
 After all it is not hard 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.519
 In the plan 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.519
