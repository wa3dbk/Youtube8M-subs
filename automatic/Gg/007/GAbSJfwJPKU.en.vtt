00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
okay about the cabinet why in fact we'll

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.260 
okay about the cabinet why in fact we'll
talk<00:01:27.930> about<00:01:28.050> the<00:01:28.140> driver<00:01:28.320> again<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.830> quickly

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
talk about the driver again just quickly

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.160 
talk about the driver again just quickly
we've<00:01:30.270> gone<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> ribbon<00:01:30.810> tweeter

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
we've gone for a ribbon tweeter

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.149 
we've gone for a ribbon tweeter
basically<00:01:31.500> because<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:31.920> actually

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
basically because we can actually

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.710 
basically because we can actually
achieve<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.430> much<00:01:32.670> much<00:01:33.030> higher<00:01:33.270> bandwidth

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
achieve a much much higher bandwidth

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.510 
achieve a much much higher bandwidth
with<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.140> rather<00:01:34.620> than<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.920> dome<00:01:35.100> tweeters

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
with that rather than the dome tweeters

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.580 
with that rather than the dome tweeters
so<00:01:35.700> more<00:01:36.510> technical<00:01:36.870> details<00:01:37.140> on<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.440> website

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
so more technical details on the website

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.969 
so more technical details on the website
the<00:01:38.490> drivers<00:01:38.940> actually<00:01:39.320> another<00:01:40.320> advance<00:01:40.650> for

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
the drivers actually another advance for

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.820 
the drivers actually another advance for
us<00:01:41.159> again<00:01:41.640> using<00:01:42.000> our<00:01:42.120> SECAM<00:01:42.600> technology<00:01:43.200> but

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
us again using our SECAM technology but

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.770 
us again using our SECAM technology but
it's<00:01:43.979> really<00:01:44.159> an<00:01:44.310> what<00:01:45.060> we've<00:01:45.210> done<00:01:45.420> here<00:01:45.630> is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
it's really an what we've done here is

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.090 
it's really an what we've done here is
used<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.909> honeycomb<00:01:47.909> Nomex<00:01:48.630> material<00:01:49.320> which<00:01:49.950> is

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
used a honeycomb Nomex material which is

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.859 
used a honeycomb Nomex material which is
sandwiched<00:01:50.460> between<00:01:50.640> two<00:01:51.150> layers<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.510> very

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
sandwiched between two layers a very

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.710 
sandwiched between two layers a very
very<00:01:52.200> thin<00:01:52.500> c<00:01:52.830> cam<00:01:53.130> which<00:01:53.670> makes<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.119> extremely

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
very thin c cam which makes it extremely

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.820 
very thin c cam which makes it extremely
rigid<00:01:55.140> extremely<00:01:56.010> strong<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:58.500> don't<00:01:58.680> get

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
rigid extremely strong and you don't get

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.710 
rigid extremely strong and you don't get
any<00:01:59.100> sort<00:01:59.400> of<00:01:59.460> disparity<00:01:59.909> across<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.510> the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
any sort of disparity across that the

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.350 
any sort of disparity across that the
dome<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.260> the<00:02:02.130> driver<00:02:02.400> so<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.240> actually

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
dome of the the driver so it's actually

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.389 
dome of the the driver so it's actually
a<00:02:03.960> very<00:02:04.260> very<00:02:05.090> good<00:02:06.740> speaker<00:02:07.740> driver<00:02:08.220> which

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
a very very good speaker driver which

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.980 
a very very good speaker driver which
we've<00:02:08.549> been<00:02:08.670> actually<00:02:08.910> developing<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:09.929> some
