00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 all beaver dear friends with you windows and 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.370
 recently 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.130
 gil kinan who is a producer 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.860
 new movie five nights at freddy's 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.340
 laid out a little picture teaser that 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.230
 depicted like a pirate bay who does not 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.199
 remembers the pirate bay is the one 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.180
 foxy dwelling cove in fnaf 1 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.100
 belkin reddit is a great guy who 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.720
 constantly on Twitter lays out 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.630
 some kind of picture of the answer to 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.029
 questions and so on about the movie and here's one 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.640
 of these baskets was this one there 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.800
 written attention curtains will be 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.410
 rise and fall without any 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.390
 warnings and the same topic on 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.790
 I don’t know Spanish 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.579
 spanish however as far as i suppose 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.829
 five nights at freddy's just one thing 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.510
 very connected with the curtains it 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.090
 actually pirate bay from which 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.250
 pops up foxy judging by the inscription you can 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.739
 suggest that the pirate bay will 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.079
 work in the movie I remind you that in fnaf 1 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.210
 it for some reason is closed a because 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.670
 attention writing pirate bay but 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.860
 opens there back and forth becomes 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.140
 it is clear that the pirate bay works and 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.180
 so the company warns children a 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.340
 also their parents about what a pirate 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.020
 the bay can open suddenly and in short 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.700
 don't be scared especially have on you 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.100
 a giant animatronic forest pops up 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.200
 worry everything is fine 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.130
 a little oddity in fnaf 1 where 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.080
 Foxy inhabits 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.610
 slightly different color scheme here 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.670
 kind of so reddish 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.220
 and while u foxy but at least 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.350
 it is different there in general wood looks 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.090
 Well, just like a piece of wood, but maybe 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.310
 the filmmakers decided to go a little bit 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.159
 from the usual design of the pizzeria fazbers 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.290
 pizza and slegonetsa change this design and 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.079
 make your version so guys 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.600
 similar in the movie we will be expected foxy 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.000
 at least know what we know judging by 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.610
 previous post or rather pictures 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.649
 called the sudden bear we can 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.540
 suggest that there will be Freddie but this 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.759
 not unexpected because the movie 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.009
 called five nights at freddy's so 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.880
 that women of strangeness there was not Freddie 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.460
 by itself 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.399
 however, apparently there will also be 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.300
 our favorite foxy and he judging by 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.430
 everything will again be behind the curtains 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.400
 Well, in general, sort of like with curtains, we 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.830
 only saw him in two places this is five 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.570
 nights at freddy's 1 as well as this in mini 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.540
 a game with purple guys or rather 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.970
 pink guy in fnaf 2 in fnaf 2 itself 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.610
 game in fnaf 4 in fnaf 3 for foxy 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.230
 no more curtains found so 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.090
 can this be a hint of 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.400
 time frame when will occur 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.590
 I don’t know the film is not sure but quite 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.540
 it is possible that all this will somehow have 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.580
 connection with this very purple or 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.040
 pink guy who commits 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.380
 killing with foxy but remember 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.600
 when he stands and foxy goes to the kids 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.640
 time goes out to children 2 and the third time he 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.000
 comes out and all the kids are dead and standing next to 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.560
 pink couple staring at it smiles 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.900
 it is possible that the event of the film will somehow 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.180
 related to this one more thing which 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.950
 worth noting apparently five nights 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.500
 at freddy's one at least that 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.780
 the curtain itself opens to the left well 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.030
 the tourists understood horizontally at the time 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.770
 as here it seems she will 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.930
 rise vertically but because 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.390
 she goes up and down they are left and right 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.430
 i would say five nights at freddy's one 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.739
 at least it opens to the left and 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.330
 right you know so little detail to 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.970
 but she hardly has any big 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.709
 value but still considering the fact that gil 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.959
 kinan on your twitter quite often 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.330
 laying out all sorts of posts and he sees that 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.489
 many fnofer and signed on him and and he 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.410
 knows that many theorists and so on 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.940
 will disassemble each that's kind of 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.140
 pieces and try to figure out what 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.140
 information is hidden in it 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.670
 it is quite possible that he decided the same 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.530
 way by the way as i expected 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.680
 peeking spread small 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.420
 kartinochki teasers on the subject of the film is also 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.400
 how does scott do it as he did 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.500
 scott so maybe soon 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.690
 we will see more and more pictures 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.760
 chip teasers associated with the movie by the way 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.190
 saying I ask you not to forget that he 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.350
 said that next month 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.480
 something else will also be associated with 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.360
 the film is not yet clear what it is 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.459
 persuaded but yes judging because he 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.380
 begins to lay out picture teasers 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.760
 maybe next month waiting for us 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.470
 something pretty interesting and 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.840
 Well, that's all my dear friends hope 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.840
 did you like bye bye good luck
