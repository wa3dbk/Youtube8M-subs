that<00:01:04.409> long<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.400> look<00:01:05.880> back<00:01:06.090> at<00:01:06.240> all<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.689> I

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
that long so I look back at all and I

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.230 
that long so I look back at all and I
had<00:01:06.900> rendered<00:01:07.140> two<00:01:07.530> episodes<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.310> rain

had rendered two episodes and rain

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.420 
had rendered two episodes and rain
during<00:01:09.390> each<00:01:09.630> episode<00:01:10.110> took<00:01:10.500> me<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.979> my<00:01:11.220> laptop

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
during each episode took me on my laptop

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.010 
during each episode took me on my laptop
I<00:01:11.729> don't<00:01:11.880> know<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.060> saw<00:01:12.210> my<00:01:12.360> setup<00:01:12.600> video<00:01:12.720> i

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
I don't know if you saw my setup video i

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.280 
I don't know if you saw my setup video i
only<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> dell<00:01:14.100> inspiron<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:16.049> took<00:01:16.259> me

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
only have a dell inspiron and it took me

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.499 
only have a dell inspiron and it took me
three<00:01:16.680> hours<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.040> render<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.610> single<00:01:18.000> video<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
three hours to render a single video and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.109 
three hours to render a single video and
then<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.950> thought<00:01:20.340> stuff<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.759> going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.000> take

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
then I thought stuff is going to take

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.760 
then I thought stuff is going to take
that<00:01:21.240> long<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.479> render<00:01:21.990> it's<00:01:22.229> probably<00:01:22.619> gonna

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that long to render it's probably gonna

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.760 
that long to render it's probably gonna
take<00:01:22.830> me<00:01:23.100> about<00:01:23.970> two<00:01:24.360> maybe<00:01:24.780> two<00:01:25.140> hours<00:01:25.409> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
take me about two maybe two hours to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.130 
take me about two maybe two hours to
upload<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.460> really<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.689> thought

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
upload it and I really I just thought

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.749 
upload it and I really I just thought
it's<00:01:28.770> not<00:01:28.950> gonna<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.130> worth<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.520> because<00:01:29.610> I'm

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
it's not gonna be worth it because I'm

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.490 
it's not gonna be worth it because I'm
gonna<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.360> every<00:01:30.689> day<00:01:30.720> and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
gonna have to do that every day and

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.710 
gonna have to do that every day and
that's<00:01:31.619> five<00:01:31.979> hours<00:01:32.030> probably<00:01:33.030> every<00:01:33.540> day

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
that's five hours probably every day

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.020 
that's five hours probably every day
spent<00:01:34.409> doing<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.610> thought<00:01:35.820> you

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
spent doing that and I just thought you

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.510
