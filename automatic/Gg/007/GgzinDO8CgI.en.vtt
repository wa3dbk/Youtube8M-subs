00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
smoke voices which is quite fitting for

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.270 
smoke voices which is quite fitting for
the<00:01:07.860> name<00:01:08.100> smoke<00:01:08.820> breath<00:01:09.740> but<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.220> said

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the name smoke breath but like I said

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.429 
the name smoke breath but like I said
this<00:01:11.580> dragon<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.030> really<00:01:12.420> really<00:01:12.570> small<00:01:13.049> and

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
this dragon is really really small and

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.499 
this dragon is really really small and
that<00:01:14.010> also<00:01:14.189> means<00:01:14.520> when<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.060> move<00:01:15.270> him<00:01:15.390> around

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
that also means when you move him around

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.390 
that also means when you move him around
when<00:01:16.020> he's<00:01:16.140> running<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.740> looks<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.189> he's

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
when he's running it looks like he's

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.399 
when he's running it looks like he's
running<00:01:17.700> really<00:01:18.119> really<00:01:18.420> fast<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:19.229> he's<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
running really really fast like he's a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.160 
running really really fast like he's a
super<00:01:19.799> fast<00:01:20.070> dragon<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:21.150> it's<00:01:21.360> probably<00:01:22.020> just

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
super fast dragon but it's probably just

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.929 
super fast dragon but it's probably just
because<00:01:22.560> he's<00:01:22.799> smaller<00:01:23.220> than<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.640> rest<00:01:23.820> of

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
because he's smaller than the rest of

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.200 
because he's smaller than the rest of
the<00:01:24.060> Dragons<00:01:24.560> but<00:01:25.560> move<00:01:25.799> as<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.030> same

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the Dragons but move as as in the same

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.910 
the Dragons but move as as in the same
speed<00:01:27.570> as<00:01:27.780> they<00:01:27.990> do<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.500> looks<00:01:28.650> kind<00:01:28.860> of

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
speed as they do so it looks kind of

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.819 
speed as they do so it looks kind of
funny<00:01:29.159> now<00:01:29.509> I<00:01:30.509> was<00:01:31.020> kind<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.350> having<00:01:31.500> my<00:01:31.770> doubts

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
funny now I was kind of having my doubts

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.520 
funny now I was kind of having my doubts
because<00:01:32.670> he<00:01:32.820> was<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.150> small<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.140> flying

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
because he was so small that the flying

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.460 
because he was so small that the flying
might<00:01:35.040> look<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.729> bit<00:01:35.759> off<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.720> once<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.140> get<00:01:37.290> up

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
might look a bit off but once you get up

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.940 
might look a bit off but once you get up
there

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
there

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.399 
there
it<00:01:38.009> actually<00:01:38.970> looks<00:01:39.299> kind<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.750> great<00:01:40.049> because

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
it actually looks kind of great because

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.190 
it actually looks kind of great because
the<00:01:40.560> smokebreath<00:01:41.189> has<00:01:41.610> such<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> long<00:01:42.360> tail<00:01:42.810> so

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the smokebreath has such a long tail so

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.690 
the smokebreath has such a long tail so
it<00:01:43.259> kind<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.560> makes<00:01:43.770> up<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.490> actually

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
it kind of makes up for it and actually

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.719 
it kind of makes up for it and actually
make<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.299> look<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.110> big<00:01:46.649> dragon<00:01:46.979> even

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
make it look like a big dragon even

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.340 
make it look like a big dragon even
though<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.060> not<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:50.000> compared<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:52.200> your

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
though it's not and compared to to your

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.219 
though it's not and compared to to your
Viking<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.100> wings<00:01:53.369> actually<00:01:54.180> did<00:01:54.810> they<00:01:55.020> have

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
Viking the wings actually did they have

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.319 
Viking the wings actually did they have
some<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.040> kind<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.369> white<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:57.119> they

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
some you know that kind of white so they

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.270 
some you know that kind of white so they
probably<00:01:57.659> would<00:01:58.049> be<00:01:58.259> able<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.469> carry<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.860> can

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
probably would be able to carry I can

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.899 
probably would be able to carry I can
even<00:01:59.549> oil

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
even oil

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.510 
even oil
looks<00:01:59.999> a<00:02:00.149> bit<00:02:00.469> funny<00:02:01.469> because<00:02:01.859> your<00:02:02.130> writing

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
looks a bit funny because your writing

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.929 
looks a bit funny because your writing
is<00:02:02.609> so<00:02:02.789> big<00:02:03.090> compared<00:02:03.569> to<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.020> Dragons<00:02:04.469> but

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
is so big compared to the Dragons but

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.249 
is so big compared to the Dragons but
surprisingly<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.149> looks<00:02:06.359> more<00:02:07.079> or<00:02:07.140> less

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
surprisingly it looks more or less

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.589 
surprisingly it looks more or less
natural<00:02:07.890> when<00:02:08.069> you're<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.519> air<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.000> I

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
natural when you're in the air and I

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.449 
natural when you're in the air and I
really<00:02:09.840> like<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.229> coloration<00:02:10.830> options<00:02:11.340> you

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
really like the coloration options you

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.940 
really like the coloration options you
have<00:02:11.640> with<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:11.910> dragon<00:02:12.269> I<00:02:12.629> mean<00:02:13.620> no<00:02:13.739> matter

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
have with this dragon I mean no matter

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.830 
have with this dragon I mean no matter
what<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.280> do<00:02:14.430> mostly<00:02:15.000> turns<00:02:15.269> out<00:02:15.540> gray

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
what you do mostly turns out gray

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.800 
what you do mostly turns out gray
greyish<00:02:16.440> color<00:02:16.830> because<00:02:17.190> that's<00:02:17.430> just<00:02:17.640> the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
greyish color because that's just the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.750 
greyish color because that's just the
the<00:02:18.810> filter<00:02:19.230> day<00:02:19.379> I<00:02:19.410> put<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.799> this<00:02:19.980> dragon<00:02:20.400> but

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
cute very small it's the smallest dragon

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.289 
cute very small it's the smallest dragon
in<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.209> game<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:03.660> far<00:03:04.639> but<00:03:05.639> there<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.120> a

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
in the game so far but there is a

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.420 
in the game so far but there is a
downside<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:07.109> this<00:03:07.500> dragon<00:03:07.980> though<00:03:08.160> because

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
downside to this dragon though because

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.039 
downside to this dragon though because
even<00:03:08.849> though<00:03:08.970> it's<00:03:09.150> small<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.900> looks

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
even though it's small and it looks

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.809 
even though it's small and it looks
really<00:03:10.200> cute<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.829> it<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.040> really<00:03:11.220> like<00:03:11.430> unique

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
really cute and it is really like unique

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.879 
really cute and it is really like unique
compared<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.599> rest<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.900> Dragons<00:03:13.290> the

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
compared to the rest of the Dragons the

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.199 
compared to the rest of the Dragons the
stats<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:15.030> dragon<00:03:15.569> is<00:03:16.489> not<00:03:17.489> that

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
stats of this dragon is not that

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.569 
stats of this dragon is not that
satisfying<00:03:18.930> if<00:03:19.200> we<00:03:19.950> take<00:03:20.099> a<00:03:20.160> look<00:03:20.340> at<00:03:20.489> the

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
satisfying if we take a look at the

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.390 
satisfying if we take a look at the
stats<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:21.329> mean<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.380> pitch<00:03:22.560> rate<00:03:22.919> the<00:03:23.130> turn

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
stats I mean the pitch rate the turn

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.879 
stats I mean the pitch rate the turn
rate<00:03:23.669> and<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.000> acceleration<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.900> good<00:03:25.560> they

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
rate and the acceleration is good they

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.830 
rate and the acceleration is good they
are<00:03:25.919> in<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.340> high<00:03:26.519> level<00:03:26.940> but<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.269> max<00:03:27.569> speed

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
are in the high level but the max speed

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.789 
are in the high level but the max speed
is<00:03:28.019> only<00:03:28.739> 2<00:03:29.069> which<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:30.209> really<00:03:30.810> really<00:03:31.169> bad<00:03:31.440> so

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
is only 2 which is really really bad so

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.620 
is only 2 which is really really bad so
you<00:03:31.859> might<00:03:32.310> not<00:03:32.489> want<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.790> use<00:03:32.849> this<00:03:33.180> dragon

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
you might not want to use this dragon

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.720 
you might not want to use this dragon
for<00:03:33.840> racing<00:03:34.290> because<00:03:35.069> that<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.579> really

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
for racing because that is a really

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.920 
for racing because that is a really
really<00:03:36.209> bad<00:03:37.160> score<00:03:38.160> on<00:03:38.430> max<00:03:38.730> speed<00:03:39.209> it's<00:03:39.569> even

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
really bad score on max speed it's even

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.860 
really bad score on max speed it's even
slower<00:03:40.260> than<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:41.130> scauldron<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:42.480> scauldron

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
slower than the scauldron the scauldron

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.069 
slower than the scauldron the scauldron
has<00:03:43.109> about<00:03:43.349> 4<00:03:43.650> max<00:03:44.280> speed<00:03:44.669> and<00:03:44.940> that's<00:03:45.870> really

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
has about 4 max speed and that's really

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.240 
has about 4 max speed and that's really
slow<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:47.160> this<00:03:47.400> guy<00:03:47.639> is<00:03:48.030> even<00:03:48.750> slower<00:03:49.139> when<00:03:50.099> you

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
slow so this guy is even slower when you

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.190 
slow so this guy is even slower when you
do<00:03:50.430> race<00:03:50.700> with<00:03:50.940> him<00:03:51.120> or<00:03:51.269> fly<00:03:51.510> with<00:03:51.720> him<00:03:51.900> you

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
do race with him or fly with him you

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.569 
do race with him or fly with him you
don't<00:03:52.230> really<00:03:52.500> notice<00:03:52.739> it<00:03:53.040> when<00:03:53.280> you're<00:03:53.430> out

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
don't really notice it when you're out

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.580 
don't really notice it when you're out
there<00:03:53.609> and<00:03:54.239> just<00:03:54.720> playing<00:03:54.959> around<00:03:55.109> with<00:03:55.380> him

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
there and just playing around with him

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.039 
there and just playing around with him

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
but if you do a race this dragon is

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.449 
but if you do a race this dragon is
probably<00:03:58.620> not<00:03:58.859> your<00:03:58.980> first<00:03:59.250> choice<00:03:59.870> so<00:04:01.129> all<00:04:02.129> in

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
probably not your first choice so all in

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.430 
probably not your first choice so all in
all<00:04:02.639> this<00:04:02.970> smothering<00:04:03.480> smokebreaths<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.410> a

all this smothering smokebreaths is a
really<00:04:04.769> cute<00:04:05.040> dragon<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.700> model<00:04:06.090> is<00:04:06.209> nice

really cute dragon the model is nice
moves<00:04:07.640> smoothly<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:08.629> looks<00:04:08.840> great<00:04:09.140> and

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 
moves smoothly and it looks great and

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.300 
moves smoothly and it looks great and
it's<00:04:09.829> very<00:04:10.099> true<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.819> the<00:04:10.849> race<00:04:11.390> species<00:04:12.310> smoke

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
it's very true to the race species smoke

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.619 
it's very true to the race species smoke
breath<00:04:13.549> because<00:04:13.879> I<00:04:13.969> was<00:04:14.090> afraid<00:04:14.299> that<00:04:14.390> they

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
breath because I was afraid that they

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.740 
breath because I was afraid that they
would<00:04:14.780> make<00:04:14.959> it<00:04:15.079> big<00:04:15.319> make<00:04:16.100> it<00:04:16.220> really<00:04:16.489> big<00:04:16.750> in

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
would make it big make it really big in

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.509 
would make it big make it really big in
order<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.229> you<00:04:18.320> for<00:04:18.680> your<00:04:18.739> biking<00:04:19.100> to<00:04:19.220> fit<00:04:19.400> it

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
order to you for your biking to fit it

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.550 
order to you for your biking to fit it
but<00:04:19.669> it<00:04:19.789> actually<00:04:20.180> is<00:04:20.269> a<00:04:20.630> part<00:04:21.169> of<00:04:21.229> a<00:04:21.320> bit

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
but it actually is a part of a bit

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.740 
but it actually is a part of a bit
bigger<00:04:21.829> than<00:04:22.220> it<00:04:22.430> was<00:04:22.460> in<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.090> serious<00:04:23.509> but

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
bigger than it was in the serious but

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.100 
bigger than it was in the serious but
still<00:04:23.990> pretty<00:04:24.229> small<00:04:24.470> and<00:04:24.970> it<00:04:25.970> looks<00:04:26.570> great<00:04:26.870> it

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
still pretty small and it looks great it

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.409 
still pretty small and it looks great it
looks<00:04:27.350> just<00:04:27.530> like<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:27.860> smoke<00:04:28.100> breath<00:04:28.430> so<00:04:29.150> but

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
looks just like the smoke breath so but

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.659 
looks just like the smoke breath so but
this<00:04:29.539> dragon<00:04:29.810> is<00:04:30.020> probably<00:04:30.350> just<00:04:30.620> for<00:04:31.340> you

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
this dragon is probably just for you

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.499 
this dragon is probably just for you
know<00:04:32.410> for<00:04:33.410> completing<00:04:34.310> quests<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:35.030> fooling

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
know for completing quests and fooling

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.090 
know for completing quests and fooling
around<00:04:35.780> because<00:04:36.080> racing<00:04:36.620> it<00:04:36.740> probably

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
around because racing it probably

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.129 
around because racing it probably
wouldn't<00:04:37.280> be<00:04:37.340> suitable<00:04:37.520> but<00:04:38.300> it's<00:04:38.449> definitely

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
wouldn't be suitable but it's definitely

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.960 
wouldn't be suitable but it's definitely
