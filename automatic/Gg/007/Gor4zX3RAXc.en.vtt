going<00:00:40.510> back<00:00:40.840> to<00:00:40.870> where<00:00:41.350> it<00:00:41.379> began<00:00:41.830> so<00:00:42.489> we

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
going back to where it began so we

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.189 
going back to where it began so we
thought<00:00:42.790> it'd<00:00:42.940> be<00:00:42.970> really<00:00:43.210> cool<00:00:43.629> to<00:00:43.690> include

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
thought it'd be really cool to include

some<00:00:44.410> visual<00:00:44.800> references<00:00:45.460> like<00:00:45.699> this<00:00:46.030> one

some visual references like this one

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.030 
some visual references like this one
that<00:00:46.390> are<00:00:46.449> metaphors<00:00:47.110> to<00:00:47.440> emphasize<00:00:48.010> that

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
that are metaphors to emphasize that

point if we jump back into the movie for

point if we jump back into the movie for
a<00:00:55.809> second<00:00:56.140> now<00:00:56.199> you'll<00:00:56.379> see<00:00:56.440> here<00:00:56.830> that<00:00:56.860> the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
a second now you'll see here that the

a second now you'll see here that the
the<00:00:57.460> vintage<00:00:57.760> vehicle<00:00:58.150> gets<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.420> bit<00:00:58.570> of<00:00:58.659> air

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
time as well which is obviously a nod to

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
wipeout takes place in to where we begin

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.000 
wipeout takes place in to where we begin
in<00:01:17.400> 2048<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:19.450> also<00:01:19.660> to<00:01:19.900> how<00:01:20.170> ground<00:01:20.560> a<00:01:20.770> little

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
in 2048 but also to how ground a little

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.640 
in 2048 but also to how ground a little
in<00:01:21.280> reality<00:01:21.820> especially<00:01:22.450> through<00:01:23.020> our<00:01:23.230> choice

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
in reality especially through our choice

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.530 
in reality especially through our choice
of<00:01:23.860> vehicles<00:01:24.340> in<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.580> early<00:01:24.880> stages<00:01:25.150> of<00:01:25.450> the

of vehicles in the early stages of the

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:43.210 
of vehicles in the early stages of the
intro<00:01:25.900> like<00:01:26.110> this<00:01:26.350> one

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.650 

the<00:01:44.220> next<00:01:44.430> transition<00:01:44.730> takes<00:01:45.090> us<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.540> an

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
the next transition takes us to an

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.630 
the next transition takes us to an
intermediate<00:01:45.990> stage<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:47.100> call<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> shop

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
intermediate stage we call the shop

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.970 
intermediate stage we call the shop
blueprint<00:01:48.150> it's<00:01:49.020> kind<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> design

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
blueprint it's kind of like the design

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.520 
blueprint it's kind of like the design
that<00:01:50.190> actually<00:01:50.430> never<00:01:50.670> made<00:01:50.940> it<00:01:51.120> into<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.110> into

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
that actually never made it into it into

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.040 
that actually never made it into it into
real<00:01:52.740> life<00:01:52.800> and<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:54.180> next<00:01:54.390> stage<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.750> go<00:01:54.870> into

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
real life and the next stage we go into

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.990 
real life and the next stage we go into
a<00:01:55.140> transition<00:01:55.770> into<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.160> open<00:01:56.790> wheeled

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
a transition into the open wheeled

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.130 
a transition into the open wheeled
contemporary<00:01:57.660> race<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.050> category

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.430 

the<00:02:06.740> game<00:02:07.010> these<00:02:07.370> are<00:02:07.670> really<00:02:08.060> cool<00:02:08.450> annotated

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
the game these are really cool annotated

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.770 
the game these are really cool annotated
visual<00:02:09.979> transitions<00:02:10.729> are<00:02:11.090> just<00:02:11.330> another<00:02:11.540> way

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
visual transitions are just another way

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.170 
visual transitions are just another way
to<00:02:11.840> show<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.380> how<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.250> sport<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.910> motor

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
to show you how the sport of motor

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.960 
to show you how the sport of motor
racing<00:02:14.360> evolved<00:02:15.260> over<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.620> years<00:02:15.970> eventually

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
racing evolved over the years eventually

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.710 
racing evolved over the years eventually
settling<00:02:17.690> on<00:02:17.900> Formula<00:02:18.500> One<00:02:18.709> style<00:02:19.100> racing

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
settling on Formula One style racing

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:36.430 
settling on Formula One style racing
which<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:20.930> right<00:02:21.530> where<00:02:21.770> we<00:02:21.920> are<00:02:22.040> now<00:02:22.310> in<00:02:22.550> 2012

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.199 

so<00:02:37.440> if<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.830> blinked<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.640> may<00:02:38.819> have<00:02:38.849> missed

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
so if you blinked you may have missed

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.150 
so if you blinked you may have missed
the<00:02:39.390> fires<00:02:39.660> are<00:02:39.900> logo<00:02:40.319> appearing<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.920> top

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
the fires are logo appearing in the top

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.400 
the fires are logo appearing in the top
left<00:02:41.430> corner<00:02:41.520> there<00:02:42.090> if<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:43.050> know<00:02:43.230> your

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
left corner there if you know your

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.900 
left corner there if you know your
wipeout<00:02:43.830> history<00:02:44.040> then<00:02:44.550> you'll<00:02:44.700> know<00:02:44.880> that

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
wipeout history then you'll know that

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.180 
wipeout history then you'll know that
fire<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:45.630> one<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.170> longest<00:02:46.349> running<00:02:46.830> teams

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
fire is one of the longest running teams

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.460 
fire is one of the longest running teams
in<00:02:47.489> school

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.200 

so<00:02:51.950> here<00:02:52.160> we<00:02:52.190> wanted<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.670> have<00:02:52.820> a<00:02:52.940> little<00:02:52.970> fun

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
so here we wanted to have a little fun

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.950 
so here we wanted to have a little fun
by<00:02:53.660> fast<00:02:53.990> forward<00:02:54.350> into<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.680> year<00:02:55.300> 2025<00:02:56.300> with

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
by fast forward into the year 2025 with

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.230 
by fast forward into the year 2025 with
the<00:02:57.080> advent<00:02:57.410> of<00:02:57.560> what<00:02:58.010> we<00:02:58.130> call<00:02:58.310> in<00:02:58.490> all<00:02:58.730> racing

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
the advent of what we call in all racing

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.300 
the advent of what we call in all racing
so<00:02:59.450> it's<00:02:59.660> almost<00:02:59.810> like<00:03:00.080> more<00:03:00.530> wheel<00:03:00.740> racing<00:03:01.040> is

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
so it's almost like more wheel racing is

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.150 
so it's almost like more wheel racing is
the<00:03:01.750> intermediate<00:03:02.750> step<00:03:03.080> between

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
the intermediate step between

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.040 
the intermediate step between
antigravity<00:03:04.160> being<00:03:04.400> fully<00:03:05.050> commercialized

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
antigravity being fully commercialized

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.100 
antigravity being fully commercialized
you<00:03:06.440> know<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.680> started<00:03:07.480> but<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.540> hadn't<00:03:08.870> really

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
you know it started but it hadn't really

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.070 
you know it started but it hadn't really
made<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.350> into<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:09.920> commercial<00:03:10.550> entity

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.020 

the<00:03:14.200> sequence<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.100> vehicles<00:03:15.550> actually

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
the sequence that the vehicles actually

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.470 
the sequence that the vehicles actually
drive<00:03:16.420> up<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.810> side<00:03:17.020> of<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.410> wall<00:03:18.360> what<00:03:19.360> we

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
drive up the side of the wall what we

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.180 
drive up the side of the wall what we
did<00:03:19.690> didn't<00:03:20.200> want<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.410> do<00:03:20.500> at<00:03:20.590> this<00:03:20.680> stage<00:03:20.740> is

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
did didn't want to do at this stage is

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.670 
did didn't want to do at this stage is
that<00:03:21.220> say<00:03:21.670> that<00:03:21.700> this<00:03:22.090> is<00:03:22.330> AG<00:03:22.750> right<00:03:23.020> now<00:03:23.230> this

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
that say that this is AG right now this

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.050 
that say that this is AG right now this
is<00:03:23.830> still<00:03:24.040> very<00:03:24.250> much<00:03:24.520> a<00:03:24.580> surface-based

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
is still very much a surface-based

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.240 
is still very much a surface-based
racing<00:03:25.720> game<00:03:25.870> so<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.320> theme<00:03:26.710> ugh<00:03:26.980> strips

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
racing game so the a theme ugh strips

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.680 
racing game so the a theme ugh strips
off<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.580> was<00:03:27.670> obviously<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.120> next<00:03:28.390> phase<00:03:28.510> that

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
off it was obviously the next phase that

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.140 
off it was obviously the next phase that
we<00:03:28.780> go<00:03:28.900> into

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.660 

okay<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.170> now<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.379> money<00:03:34.739> shot<00:03:35.129> the<00:03:35.400> fires

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
okay and now the money shot the fires

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.509 
okay and now the money shot the fires
are<00:03:35.939> speed<00:03:36.390> AG<00:03:36.870> racer<00:03:37.170> where<00:03:37.829> we<00:03:37.950> arrived<00:03:38.310> on

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
are speed AG racer where we arrived on

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.720 
are speed AG racer where we arrived on
the<00:03:38.640> starting<00:03:39.180> grid<00:03:39.209> in<00:03:39.709> 2048<00:03:40.709> for<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.489> birth

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
the starting grid in 2048 for the birth

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.360 
the starting grid in 2048 for the birth
of<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.299> antigravity<00:03:42.689> racing<00:03:43.590> championships

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
of the antigravity racing championships

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.729 
of the antigravity racing championships
and<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:44.939> quick<00:03:45.180> glimpse<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.780> Nova<00:03:46.530> state<00:03:46.799> City

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
and a quick glimpse of Nova state City

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.229 
and a quick glimpse of Nova state City
for<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.799> final<00:03:50.159> shot<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.549> really<00:03:50.909> didn't<00:03:51.120> want

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
for the final shot I really didn't want

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.759 
for the final shot I really didn't want
to<00:03:51.299> give<00:03:51.390> too<00:03:51.540> much<00:03:51.659> away<00:03:51.840> here<00:03:52.230> but<00:03:52.409> I<00:03:52.470> did

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
to give too much away here but I did

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.339 
to give too much away here but I did
want<00:03:53.099> to<00:03:53.340> show<00:03:53.579> how<00:03:54.209> beautiful<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.780> city<00:03:55.200> was

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
want to show how beautiful the city was

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.679 
want to show how beautiful the city was
but<00:03:55.620> at<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.829> same<00:03:56.069> time<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.609> is<00:03:57.000> still<00:03:57.239> very

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
but at the same time it is still very

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.720 
but at the same time it is still very
much<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.959> city<00:03:58.349> that<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:58.560> recognize<00:03:59.129> you<00:03:59.609> know

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
much a city that you recognize you know

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.640 
much a city that you recognize you know
you've<00:04:00.180> got<00:04:00.209> this<00:04:00.450> this<00:04:00.720> beautiful<00:04:01.290> vehicle

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
you've got this this beautiful vehicle

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.860 
you've got this this beautiful vehicle
speeding<00:04:02.579> up<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.909> mud<00:04:03.090> stripping<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.659> the

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
speeding up the mud stripping in the

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.990 
speeding up the mud stripping in the
center<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.409> which<00:04:04.829> suggests<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.579> future

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
center of it which suggests the future

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.300 
center of it which suggests the future
but<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.840> vehicle<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.470> buildings<00:04:07.950> on<00:04:08.129> either

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
but the vehicle the buildings on either

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.220 
but the vehicle the buildings on either
side<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.790> very<00:04:09.120> much<00:04:09.359> contemporary<00:04:09.810> sort<00:04:10.139> of

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
side of very much contemporary sort of

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.619 
side of very much contemporary sort of
style<00:04:10.409> but<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.310> higher<00:04:11.609> up<00:04:11.849> we<00:04:11.879> go<00:04:12.209> we<00:04:12.420> see

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
style but the higher up we go we see

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.960 
style but the higher up we go we see
that<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:13.230> technology<00:04:14.010> is<00:04:14.280> changing<00:04:14.370> in

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
that the technology is changing in

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.090 
that the technology is changing in
construction<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:15.870> we<00:04:16.289> also<00:04:16.410> see<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.919> fact

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
construction and we also see the fact

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.409 
construction and we also see the fact
that<00:04:17.190> we<00:04:17.489> have<00:04:17.579> a<00:04:17.639> lot<00:04:17.850> more<00:04:18.000> airborne

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
that we have a lot more airborne

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.509 
that we have a lot more airborne
vehicles<00:04:18.600> in<00:04:18.989> there<00:04:19.139> again<00:04:19.440> given<00:04:19.979> up<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:20.310> bit

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
vehicles in there again given up a bit

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.310 
vehicles in there again given up a bit
bigger<00:04:21.030> indication<00:04:21.600> of<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.810> year<00:04:22.019> that<00:04:22.199> we're

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
bigger indication of the year that we're

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.870 
bigger indication of the year that we're
actually<00:04:22.410> in<00:04:22.650> right<00:04:22.830> now<00:04:22.949> so<00:04:23.280> really<00:04:23.580> what<00:04:23.729> we

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
actually in right now so really what we

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.000 
actually in right now so really what we
want<00:04:23.910> you<00:04:24.360> to<00:04:24.510> take<00:04:24.690> from<00:04:24.840> this<00:04:25.020> intro<00:04:25.620> is<00:04:25.860> that

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
want you to take from this intro is that

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.670 
want you to take from this intro is that
although<00:04:26.190> wipeout<00:04:26.880> is<00:04:27.150> about<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.900> racing<00:04:28.380> and

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
although wipeout is about the racing and

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.409 
although wipeout is about the racing and
that's<00:04:28.889> what<00:04:29.010> we'll<00:04:29.130> focus<00:04:29.490> on<00:04:29.639> focusing<00:04:30.270> on

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
that's what we'll focus on focusing on

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.300 
that's what we'll focus on focusing on
there's<00:04:30.960> so<00:04:31.139> much<00:04:31.320> more<00:04:31.530> at<00:04:31.710> play<00:04:31.830> here<00:04:32.130> behind

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
there's so much more at play here behind

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.520 
there's so much more at play here behind
the<00:04:32.520> scenes<00:04:32.990> absolutely<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.169> know<00:04:34.289> I<00:04:34.320> think

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
the scenes absolutely you know I think

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.339 
the scenes absolutely you know I think
the<00:04:35.430> world<00:04:35.669> it<00:04:35.849> takes<00:04:35.880> place<00:04:36.300> it<00:04:36.630> is<00:04:36.750> vast<00:04:37.020> and

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
the world it takes place it is vast and

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.100 
the world it takes place it is vast and
we<00:04:38.130> all<00:04:38.220> feel<00:04:38.550> out<00:04:38.789> such<00:04:39.060> a<00:04:39.090> richly<00:04:39.930> detailed

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
we all feel out such a richly detailed

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
history we feel really that really just

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.040 
history we feel really that really just
scratching<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.860> surface<00:04:44.479> by<00:04:45.479> going<00:04:45.750> back<00:04:45.900> to

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
scratching the surface by going back to

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.689 
scratching the surface by going back to
where<00:04:46.199> it<00:04:46.229> all<00:04:46.470> began<00:04:46.650> particularly<00:04:47.550> with

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
where it all began particularly with

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:52.409 
space you know maybe not slowly

space you know maybe not slowly
possibilities<00:04:53.400> in<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.550> future<00:04:53.960> where<00:04:54.960> we

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
possibilities in the future where we

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:02.810 
possibilities in the future where we
