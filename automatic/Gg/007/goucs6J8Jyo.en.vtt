00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.390
 circuit breakers allow to control 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.830
 the flow of energy by cutting or 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:28.470
 establishing the currents in all 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:29.670
 safety in an electrical network 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.560
 open position 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.630
 they must insure isolation on the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.450
 switching distance between phases 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.100
 and with the earth in closed position they 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.690
 must allow the circulation of 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.690
 energy by minimizing losses 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.129
 they can interrupt and currents 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.379
 short circuit reliably without 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.059
 suffer damage or deteriorate 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.870
 neighboring equipment even after 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.870
 long periods of inactivity 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.270
 different breaker technologies 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.369
 are used depending on the level of 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.640
 application voltage and their 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.640
 seniority 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.180
 the interruption of the current occurs 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.250
 in the room of air interruptions to 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.250
 sf6 or vacuum water oil 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.880
 circuit breakers may have recourse to 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.410
 contact contact systems 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.410
 main and arc contacts 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.170
 the main contacts allow to 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.300
 drive the nominal current 100 losses 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.890
 while arc contacts can 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.020
 cut short circuit currents into 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.020
 minimizing erosion due to arcs 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.140
 the cuts element is usually 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.940
 operate mechanically by a 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.940
 device storing energy 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.770
 the energy to open and close the 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.659
 contacts and stored in a resort or 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.210
 in a hydraulic device or 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.800
 pneumatic stored energy released 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.100
 by the signal of opening or 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.100
 closing 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.830
 the command signal activates the 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.019
 trigger coils or 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:21.530
 interlocking mechanism 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:23.810
 which open or close the 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.880
 break chamber and mechanism are 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.880
 the main components that wear out and 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.739
 aging thermal stresses 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.200
 imposed by load currents 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.430
 causes corrosion and oxidation and 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.830
 interruption of the currents of 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.420
 short circuit uses the contacts the 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.459
 environmental constraints such as 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.140
 the humidity temperature where the 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:59.239
 dust affects the bonds 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:03:01.130
 mechanical auxiliary components 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.630
 like the terminals are also subject to 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.660
 Aging constraints 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.400
 electric to guarantee the good 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.170
 operation of a circuit breaker on 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.390
 its entire lifespan of the tests of 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.280
 diagnosis are made we measure the 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:19.730
 resistances the times the minimum of 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.359
 tension the displacement and the factor of 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.310
 dissipation to achieve 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.500
 optimal safety conditions for 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.720
 the engineer death the circuit breaker must 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.310
 be grounded on both sides for 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.810
 most of these tests the first test 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.970
 usually performed on a 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.980
 breaker and the one on the 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.640
 static contact resistance in 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.980
 closed position the contact resistance 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.510
 static is determined by injecting 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.269
 high intensity direct current 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.959
 while the attention is measured with 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.959
 other cables 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.810
 the analysis of opening times and 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.670
 closing the circuit breaker contacts 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.300
 validate performance 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.300
 mechanical 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.470
 the differences between each contact and 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.670
 each phase must be in 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:25.070
 defined limits compared these results to 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.670
 factory or earlier measurements allows 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.600
 to reveal trends 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.120
 recording currents in the 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.440
 opening and closing coils 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.390
 informs about their mechanical state and 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.020
 electrical energy and the state of 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.730
 snaps the minimum attention 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.860
 necessary for opening and 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.870
 closing the circuit breaker is also 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.340
 measured to verify the thresholds of 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.340
 under voltage operation 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.180
 if the circuit breaker is equipped with a 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.620
 multi-contact system the measure 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.230
 of dynamic resistance during 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.730
 opening and closing will inform 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.730
 on the wear of the arc contact 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.970
 in addition the displacement curve of 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.260
 circuit breaker makes it possible to evaluate 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.890
 mechanical parameters 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.260
 for example speed moving 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.820
 total acceleration a race 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.820
 excessive and rebounds 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.010
 by carrying out these measures the operator of the 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.380
 post can verify that the equipment is 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.950
 in good condition or possibly plan 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.950
 maintenance
