00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
I didn't see any movement of a breath in

I didn't see any movement of a breath in
the<00:03:48.090> inner<00:03:48.810> chest<00:03:49.110> area<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.769> didn't<00:03:50.340> see<00:03:50.489> any

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
the inner chest area I didn't see any

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.050 
the inner chest area I didn't see any
movement<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.180> breath<00:03:51.750> in<00:03:51.959> them<00:03:52.110> in<00:03:52.349> a<00:03:52.849> slur<00:03:53.849> of

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
movement of breath in them in a slur of

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.660 
movement of breath in them in a slur of
the<00:03:54.150> mouth<00:03:54.330> area<00:03:54.659> didn't<00:03:55.140> move<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.980> when<00:03:56.549> they

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
the mouth area didn't move and when they

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.580 
the mouth area didn't move and when they
move<00:03:56.909> they<00:03:57.209> seem<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.599> move<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:58.140> something

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
move they seem to move is something

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.039 
move they seem to move is something
mechanically<00:03:59.220> that<00:04:00.000> could<00:04:00.150> move<00:04:00.330> their<00:04:00.540> arms

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
mechanically that could move their arms

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.360 
mechanically that could move their arms
like<00:04:01.319> this<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:02.659> in<00:04:03.659> the<00:04:03.870> shoulders<00:04:04.379> but<00:04:05.159> their

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
like this and in the shoulders but their

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.070 
like this and in the shoulders but their
head<00:04:05.580> didn't<00:04:05.849> move<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.390> when<00:04:06.510> they<00:04:06.629> move<00:04:06.870> they

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
head didn't move and when they move they

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.949 
head didn't move and when they move they
seemed<00:04:07.319> to<00:04:07.470> turn<00:04:07.709> as<00:04:08.400> if<00:04:08.610> mechanically<00:04:09.239> it

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
seemed to turn as if mechanically it

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.809 
seemed to turn as if mechanically it
appeared<00:04:10.379> to<00:04:10.409> me<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.620> they<00:04:11.010> they<00:04:11.610> had

appeared to me that they they had

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.429 
appeared to me that they they had
something<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.299> they<00:04:12.599> were<00:04:12.659> going<00:04:13.290> around

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
something that they were going around

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.259 
something that they were going around

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
you might say to do something they had

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.960 
you might say to do something they had
something<00:04:15.720> specific<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:17.009> and<00:04:17.340> they<00:04:17.759> just

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
something specific to and they just

something specific to and they just
simply<00:04:18.150> done<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.630> their<00:04:18.840> attention<00:04:19.320> wouldn't

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
simply done it their attention wouldn't

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.470 
took hold of my left arm in this arm
here<00:04:34.650> just<00:04:34.890> instantly<00:04:35.430> I<00:04:35.520> felt<00:04:35.850> pain<00:04:36.150> but<00:04:36.390> it

was gone just that quick and then once

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.500 
was gone just that quick and then once
the<00:04:39.330> Borobudur<00:04:40.050> craft<00:04:40.620> at<00:04:41.130> one<00:04:41.640> time<00:04:41.910> I<00:04:42.240> felt

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
the Borobudur craft at one time I felt

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.680 
the Borobudur craft at one time I felt
this<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:43.680> same<00:04:43.950> pain<00:04:44.610> in<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.000> same<00:04:45.240> area

again but it was just instantly and

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.040 
again but it was just instantly and
that's<00:04:47.640> healing<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.090> physical<00:04:48.510> pain<00:04:48.750> in<00:04:48.990> a

head through the entire foot now

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.090 
head through the entire foot now
approximately<00:04:51.570> how<00:04:51.690> long<00:04:51.750> do<00:04:52.200> you<00:04:52.260> figure<00:04:52.560> you

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
approximately how long do you figure you

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.230 
approximately how long do you figure you
were<00:04:53.220> in<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.550> craft<00:04:53.820> itself<00:04:55.790> well<00:04:56.790> I'm<00:04:57.060> not

it's<00:05:38.250> hard<00:05:38.520> for<00:05:38.670> me<00:05:38.820> to<00:05:38.940> say<00:05:39.210> which<00:05:39.450> I<00:05:39.600> can't

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
it's hard for me to say which I can't

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.560 
it's hard for me to say which I can't
say<00:05:40.170> whether<00:05:41.160> the<00:05:41.310> craft<00:05:41.610> was<00:05:41.850> round<00:05:42.210> like<00:05:42.420> a

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
say whether the craft was round like a

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.440 
say whether the craft was round like a
desk<00:05:42.930> or<00:05:43.350> what<00:05:43.560> it<00:05:43.680> was<00:05:43.770> long<00:05:44.400> or<00:05:44.700> oblong<00:05:45.150> like

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
desk or what it was long or oblong like

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.490 
desk or what it was long or oblong like
a<00:05:45.480> cigar<00:05:45.960> because<00:05:46.830> I<00:05:47.220> it<00:05:47.820> was<00:05:47.970> it<00:05:48.240> was<00:05:48.410> let<00:05:49.410> me

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
a cigar because I it was it was let me

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.830 
a cigar because I it was it was let me
give<00:05:49.680> you<00:05:49.770> an<00:05:49.860> example<00:05:50.250> like<00:05:51.060> the<00:05:51.240> craft<00:05:51.540> was

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
give you an example like the craft was

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.530 
give you an example like the craft was
sitting<00:05:52.200> here<00:05:52.760> we're<00:05:53.760> assuming<00:05:54.030> that<00:05:54.240> this<00:05:54.480> is

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
sitting here we're assuming that this is

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.300 
sitting here we're assuming that this is
the<00:05:54.720> front<00:05:54.960> end<00:05:55.290> of<00:05:55.410> it<00:05:55.530> that<00:05:55.650> was<00:05:55.800> in<00:05:56.040> it<00:05:56.190> was

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
the front end of it that was in it was

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.960 
the front end of it that was in it was
Taurus

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
Taurus

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.790 
Taurus
well<00:05:57.660> I'm<00:05:57.810> looking<00:05:58.140> at<00:05:58.290> it<00:05:58.410> from<00:05:58.560> this<00:05:58.740> angle

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
well I'm looking at it from this angle

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.300 
well I'm looking at it from this angle
so<00:05:59.550> all<00:05:59.970> I<00:06:00.000> can<00:06:00.150> see<00:06:00.510> is<00:06:00.660> what<00:06:00.870> is<00:06:01.350> this<00:06:01.680> side<00:06:02.010> if

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
so all I can see is what is this side if

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.920 
so all I can see is what is this side if
what<00:06:02.460> I'm<00:06:02.580> assumed<00:06:02.910> to<00:06:03.030> be<00:06:03.090> the<00:06:03.360> front<00:06:03.660> and

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
what I'm assumed to be the front and

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.380 
what I'm assumed to be the front and
maybe<00:06:04.170> it's<00:06:04.410> a<00:06:04.710> little<00:06:04.980> bit<00:06:05.220> of<00:06:05.340> the<00:06:05.490> back<00:06:05.670> so<00:06:06.330> I

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
maybe it's a little bit of the back so I

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.900 
maybe it's a little bit of the back so I
can't<00:06:06.660> be<00:06:06.810> sure<00:06:07.080> whether<00:06:07.410> the<00:06:07.680> craft<00:06:07.980> was<00:06:08.220> was

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
can't be sure whether the craft was was

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.850 
can't be sure whether the craft was was
round<00:06:09.240> like<00:06:09.450> a<00:06:09.570> deer<00:06:09.870> stall<00:06:10.200> was<00:06:10.380> long<00:06:10.560> or

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
round like a deer stall was long or

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.100 
round like a deer stall was long or
oblong<00:06:11.310> but<00:06:12.090> it<00:06:12.210> appeared<00:06:12.570> to<00:06:12.630> me<00:06:12.810> there<00:06:13.020> was

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
oblong but it appeared to me there was

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.960 
oblong but it appeared to me there was
about<00:06:13.230> 30<00:06:13.500> or<00:06:13.740> 40<00:06:13.770> foot<00:06:14.340> long<00:06:14.370> and<00:06:15.030> maybe<00:06:16.640> 8<00:06:17.640> or

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
about 30 or 40 foot long and maybe 8 or

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.970 
about 30 or 40 foot long and maybe 8 or
10<00:06:18.240> foot<00:06:18.570> high

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
10 foot high

10 foot high
