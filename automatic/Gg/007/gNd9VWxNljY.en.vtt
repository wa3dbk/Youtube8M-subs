00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.890
 she was everything albeit her new video on 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.170
 my channel I am the best closer as 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.910
 always having a new video and good 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.640
 gentlemen in this case we are going to talk about 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.110
 damage of weapons software too 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.150
 it is apparently and it is an information 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.180
 official since they are the forums of pic and 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.250
 they commented on it in a kind of podcast 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.720
 Mercedes a lot of information are many 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.570
 the weapons so let's start to 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.250
 do not do so long this video 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.010
 The first thing they tell us is that 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.050
 Fire rifles are now faster 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.050
 say they shoot faster but with less 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.450
 bullet damage so I think it's going to 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.050
 be almost the same but you're going to 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.699
 spend bullets faster after 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.550
 the lcd release good that's not 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.199
 imports the weapons that they did not mention in 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.309
 this case were the heavy weapons like 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.620
 the mortar the woman or the guangzhou and the 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.780
 energy weapons like the hammer of 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.370
 ok ok but let's move on now to 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.410
 the weapons that they mentioned in the first 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.970
 is the lancer says it will not cause 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.670
 head shots in multiplayer 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.680
 in nothing new the retro launches is says that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.470
 it's harder to nail now requires 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.120
 more skill in parentheses says that 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.340
 not everything not 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.950
 which now makes less damage says 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.530
 apparently he is now following his 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.510
 purpose the combat at close range and 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.540
 a good weapon is no longer considered viable 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.180
 long-range that's good let's see 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.310
 how much they fulfill it 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.320
 well we went to the hummer bus totally 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.710
 semiautomatic modified controls 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.740
 they do not work right now that's perfect 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.420
 for those who complain about rap fire and the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.000
 bigger say they move faster 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.440
 underground right now what I am to them 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.270
 mentioning are the changes that have 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.540
 the weapons or more or less how are they going to be 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.160
 the sherwell flamer score are as 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.420
 know they say that the damage is very 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.990
 similar gears of war 3 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.509
 but now it crosses the armored shield 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.659
 we just have the gun back more 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.310
 powerful a single shot to the head kills 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.050
 what's up farc 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.610
 if I have a lap that is super super 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.739
 powerful I imagine that you will have less 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.510
 bullets and with a shot gives you the head but 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.640
 Well, it's not a sign of 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.040
 interrogation this let's see what wave 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.280
 the gordon say that it is similar to 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.650
 previous versions the armored shield 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.310
 can be used with any weapon the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.640
 brand says that a shot to the body and then 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.100
 a shot to the head does not kill someone 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.690
 has a recoil rate I do not know what 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.540
 do what they mean by that and says 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.400
 that two shots to the head has done 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.219
 the grenades or fragmentation grenades 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.620
 or fax or as you know them says that your 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:51.769
 damage and your radio has been reduced 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.719
 estimated at 50% referring to go 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.969
 software 3 so that the wins carry 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.680
 to be a gentleman pope if you do not hit it 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:00.140
 you will not notice in almost anyone you can 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.079
 fall on the foot the ink says that now 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.769
 it does not impact or it is not going to stop you 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:09.500
 but it's going to go down a bit more because of 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.480
 time the smoke is only a grenade that 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.970
 is chosen or we can not collect it in 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.220
 the map insta of note 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.720
 with the impact this means that no 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.669
 will bounce if it does not fall 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.799
 soil exploits this I think it's 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.480
 better for a smoke grenade and I do not know 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.250
 you can paste 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.930
 ok let's stop at the grenades 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.900
 incendiary says he has made a 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.730
 collection of viable energy weapons or 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.800
 be they did not say anything gentlemen of the 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.330
 incendiary we do not know anything that hits 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.520
 sniper or long show like what 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.710
 know they say clichés are already 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.050
 resolved now will have two layers of 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.540
 zoom the bullets penetrate several enemies 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.140
 with this we can say that it could 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.380
 be multiple headsets with a bullet like 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.220
 happens in the bow the blow body blow to 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.800
 body now does more damage 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.120
 the nation - the ammunition apparently 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.379
 is 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.710
 mitigated with ammunition pills 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.540
 ammo boxes 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.810
 with the coefficients 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.349
 the cropped is now called nasser 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.049
 juniors I do not know why he says that multiple 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.359
 deaths can still be or that a 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.039
 bullet you can kill several the shot is 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.680
 faster than nasa I imagine that in 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.449
 the time the bullet goes out the damage and 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.900
 the amplitude is the same and now it has 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:33.070
 two bullets per loader that binds me the 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.710
 Labrit shot says decent decent damage 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.380
 damage to the body by shot or that a 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.479
 bullet to the body is not going to lower both weapon 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.580
 for medium distance and with a shot to the 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:46.300
 head you have definitely done 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.410
 exceeds the mark us say here that is 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.539
 that brightness that is a weapon more 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.090
 powerful that the mark in the next 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.969
 weapon is the bosca considered at par 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.639
 with the boom show or with the boomers 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:59.019
 with a bullet rebound system is 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.399
 as a great base shoot as if 

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:02.409
 they were fragmentation grenades do not go 

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:05.559
 to bounce and 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:07.599
 and then exploit it for a few seconds the 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:10.839
 fertilizer says that now he's still having 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.999
 three bullets per charger and also we 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:15.129
 they talk about the classic hummer bus that kills 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:17.800
 with three full bursts of sant that 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:20.139
 the camerbús is for with bursts of bullets 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.360
 if you give him three full bursts so what 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.610
 you will kill and they also make us a signal 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.349
 melee action still 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.959
 you can react bear can still 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:32.169
 take off and requires two strokes to 

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:34.989
 kill and those gentlemen were all 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:38.739
 changes or modifications or 

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:40.599
 specifications of their weapons of 

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:42.669
 your type of damage and how to spend it but 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.800
 listen interesting and well let's see 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.110
