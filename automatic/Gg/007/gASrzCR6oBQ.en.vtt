00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
really sure what can play yet because

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.690 
really sure what can play yet because
actually<00:00:13.650> i'm<00:00:13.769> recording<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.190> before<00:00:14.670> i

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
actually i'm recording this before i

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.250 
actually i'm recording this before i
recorded<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.269> gameplay<00:00:15.599> which<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.960> first

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
recorded the gameplay which is a first

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.170 
recorded the gameplay which is a first
so<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.070> audio<00:00:17.340> might<00:00:17.550> sound<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.850> little<00:00:17.880> bit

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
so the audio might sound a little bit

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.099 
so the audio might sound a little bit
different<00:00:18.480> because<00:00:18.539> i'm<00:00:18.779> actually<00:00:18.930> using

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
different because i'm actually using

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.990 
different because i'm actually using
garageband<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.920> record<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.340> voice<00:00:20.490> over<00:00:20.820> and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
garageband to record the voice over and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.240 
garageband to record the voice over and
usually<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.170> thing<00:00:22.350> with<00:00:22.470> GarageBand<00:00:23.010> on<00:00:23.160> my

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
usually the thing with GarageBand on my

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.310 
usually the thing with GarageBand on my
computer<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.150> when<00:00:24.359> i<00:00:24.390> record<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
computer is that when i record it in the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.890 
computer is that when i record it in the
program<00:00:25.710> itself<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.340> sounds<00:00:26.670> fantastic<00:00:27.090> but

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
program itself it sounds fantastic but

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.810 
program itself it sounds fantastic but
then<00:00:28.380> when<00:00:28.500> i<00:00:28.529> export<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.340> import<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.760> into

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
then when i export and import it into

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.060 
then when i export and import it into
imovie<00:00:30.390> over<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> gameplay<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.859> usually

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
imovie over the gameplay it usually

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.459 
imovie over the gameplay it usually
sounds<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.640> little<00:00:32.850> bit<00:00:32.940> fuzzy<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.600> strange<00:00:34.110> so

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
sounds a little bit fuzzy and strange so

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.100 
sounds a little bit fuzzy and strange so
this<00:00:35.070> could<00:00:35.309> go<00:00:35.579> either<00:00:35.790> way<00:00:35.969> because<00:00:36.719> i'm<00:00:36.989> not

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
this could go either way because i'm not

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.299 
this could go either way because i'm not
really<00:00:37.230> sure<00:00:37.350> i<00:00:37.530> don't<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:37.980> too<00:00:38.190> much

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
really sure i don't have too much

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.860 
really sure i don't have too much
experience<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:38.879> GarageBand<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:39.600> hopefully

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
experience with GarageBand but hopefully

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.049 
experience with GarageBand but hopefully
it<00:00:39.989> sounds<00:00:40.320> alright<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:41.489> today<00:00:41.700> i<00:00:41.730> wanted<00:00:42.000> to

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
a pretty interesting topic and I was

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.870 
a pretty interesting topic and I was
thinking<00:03:56.300> that<00:03:56.570> I<00:03:56.959> could<00:03:57.440> actually<00:03:57.800> read<00:03:58.280> my

thinking that I could actually read my
essay<00:03:59.269> to<00:03:59.330> you<00:03:59.540> guys<00:03:59.690> when<00:04:00.019> I<00:04:00.050> complete<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:00.530> and

essay to you guys when I complete it and

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.890 
essay to you guys when I complete it and
thought<00:04:02.150> that<00:04:02.300> would<00:04:02.360> be<00:04:02.510> pretty<00:04:02.780> cool

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
thought that would be pretty cool

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.060 
thought that would be pretty cool
commentary<00:04:03.470> and

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
commentary and

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.050 
commentary and
hopefully<00:04:05.070> I<00:04:05.100> get<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.310> good<00:04:05.460> great<00:04:05.670> if<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:05.880> get<00:04:06.030> a

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
because it'll be shitty but so far it's

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.000 
because it'll be shitty but so far it's
it's<00:04:11.820> seven<00:04:12.150> pages<00:04:12.390> of<00:04:12.750> pure<00:04:13.290> gold<00:04:13.320> in<00:04:13.830> my
