00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.580
 hello welcome, I'm a teacher 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.379
 engineer nothing is my last video of 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.110
 Atomic structure I hope that you have 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.300
 seen the previous ones to understand already 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.039
 is perfectly nothing are you going to be about 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.170
 cracks of chemistry in your classes 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.849
 they are going to decide you are crazy or that you are already 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.070
 ready the day reading chemistry to know 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.320
 this but it's very important and it's going to 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.789
 give a lot of good wisdom I'm going to 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.360
 explain what is the theory of the 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:39.229
 Hybridization at the most basic level because 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.980
 well then well I'll explain the 

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:43.690
 carbon hybridization is worth 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.940
 at the most basic level as I said 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.890
 then hybridization is a little bit more more 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.300
 complex but all derive from this or 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.670
 whether you understand this you can understand 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.760
 any other type of hybridization is worth 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.800
 how do you do this 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.079
 carbon let's go again to the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.339
 isotope of carbon 12 which is the one 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.980
 I've been explaining in all my examples 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.399
 It's worth it because I like it so much it's beautiful 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.540
 it's amazingly beautiful is wonder 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.790
 its configuration is worth it in the first place 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.530
 electronic good remember one of the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.710
 three I have drawn up to 7 they put 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.390
 stools were put p stories were put 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.399
 towards the arrows and this already 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.950
 explain at the time then the 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.189
 carbon as in its atomic number is the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.750
 6 ok we have to fill 6 electrons 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.750
 can be done 1 s 2 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.750
 2 s 22 p 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.539
 2 this is the carbon configuration 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.869
 then theoretically carbon would have 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.869
 to be like that 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.090
 I should have 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.360
 here 6 protons 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.700
 I should have 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.969
 6 neutrons 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.229
 and I would have to have your layer 1 s 2 with 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:02.880
 two electrons its layer 2 s 2 with 2 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:07.500
 electrons and their layer 2 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.289
 p 2 with 2 electrons nothing more 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.280
 could fit 6 and you will have seen my 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.710
 video explaining this 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.660
 Y 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.060
 could have six only have two 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.290
 then how is this drawn in pictures 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.710
 of electrons 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.520
 then nothing would have his layer 1s with his two 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:31.960
 electrons fills his 2s layer with his two 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.030
 electrons fills and its layer two p 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.700
 nothing more when it electrons then one 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.900
 here and another here and there would be three more here 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.340
 link below 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.680
 here the arrow down and here the 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.840
 two that there were four bad electrons 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.000
 so what happens in reality that 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.190
 for stability reasons because it 's 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.650
 more symmetrical the component component 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.940
 how is the reality that as it is here in 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.250
 theory is going to happen a situation that 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.430
 called hybridization in which they are going to 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.280
 join the 2s orbitals and two p for 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.600
 form a hybridization 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.960
 s &amp; p is as it is and this because we 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.310
 we forget about this there is inside us 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.040
 we forget we go to the orbitals 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.260
 external is worth the 2 orbitals will happen 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.020
 that are going to come together 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.410
 and there will be an orbital 2 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.960
 s &amp; p vale 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.700
 what will be something like that 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.440
 It will be like that if you look at the three 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.870
 small boxes of the pe and the dl if it is going to join 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.900
 everything in such a way that the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.079
 electrons 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.010
 1 2 3 4 will be ordered in this new 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.329
 box 2 esp 1 2 3 and 4 and it will be like this 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.680
 there will not be any thorn left 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.150
 down you know that electrons are 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.890
 they are training the first one fits in 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.860
 different boxes and then when 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.110
 they are all full they go to the looks 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.480
 boxes that are busy 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.670
 and nothing then will be left in the 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.330
 real carbon atom will keep us 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:05.380
 well with its six neutrons 2 3 4 5 and 6 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:08.950
 with its 6 protons is worth in the nucleus 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.980
 and then he's going to have his 1s orbital with his 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.860
 two electrons 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.050
 which is and is here the 1s but then not 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.750
 will see how I have drawn here a 12 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:22.420
 following this is going to be the same orbital 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.070
 Hybridized that is going to be called orbital 2 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:30.070
 esp where there will be 4 electrons 1 2 3 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.200
 and 4 that's what the theory explains 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.940
 Hybridization that can occur even 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:39.160
 with tails after psd orbitals 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.960
 there may be a lot of orbitals that 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.260
 good if you are interested I will explain 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.360
 our life but let's go 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.480
 with what you understand this is the basis 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.210
 it's like a whole come a lot of greetings and 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.970
 luck with your chemistry remember but 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:58.470
 please never forget that the 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:02.360
 chemistry is the basis of life is water 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.360
 the carbon I love
