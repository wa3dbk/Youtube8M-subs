00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
love about music the most and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.080 
love about music the most and
skateboarding<00:00:37.190> as<00:00:37.309> well<00:00:37.580> it's<00:00:37.820> just<00:00:37.910> that

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
skateboarding as well it's just that

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.320 
skateboarding as well it's just that
skateboarding<00:00:38.660> has<00:00:38.720> more<00:00:39.020> of<00:00:39.080> a<00:00:39.140> physical

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
skateboarding has more of a physical

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.180 
skateboarding has more of a physical
side<00:00:41.330> to<00:00:41.570> it<00:00:41.600> which<00:00:41.930> has<00:00:42.620> a<00:00:42.650> different<00:00:43.220> sort<00:00:43.520> of

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
side to it which has a different sort of

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.100 
side to it which has a different sort of
therapeutic<00:00:46.190> effect<00:00:46.580> I<00:00:46.850> think<00:00:47.270> that<00:00:47.449> music<00:00:47.870> is

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
therapeutic effect I think that music is

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.410 
therapeutic effect I think that music is
more<00:00:48.980> of<00:00:49.100> a<00:00:49.160> mental<00:00:49.370> stimulant<00:00:50.030> you<00:00:50.150> know<00:00:50.270> it's

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
more of a mental stimulant you know it's

more of a mental stimulant you know it's
uh<00:00:50.570> it's<00:00:50.809> it's<00:00:51.620> it's<00:00:52.040> a<00:00:52.190> little<00:00:52.460> deeper<00:00:52.850> than

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
uh it's it's it's a little deeper than

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.210 
uh it's it's it's a little deeper than
the<00:00:53.060> mental<00:00:53.440> creativity<00:00:54.440> zone<00:00:54.500> because<00:00:55.070> it's

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
the mental creativity zone because it's

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.210 
the mental creativity zone because it's
