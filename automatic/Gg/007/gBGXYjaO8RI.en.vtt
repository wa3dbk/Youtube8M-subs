00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
stable become also a little bit easier

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.890 
stable become also a little bit easier
to<00:02:46.260> exploit<00:02:47.249> the<00:02:47.819> consumer<00:02:48.359> base<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.750> it's

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
to exploit the consumer base that it's

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.390 
to exploit the consumer base that it's
established<00:02:49.260> because<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:49.859> doesn't<00:02:50.159> have<00:02:50.219> to

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
established because it doesn't have to

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.069 
established because it doesn't have to
make<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.549> case<00:02:50.879> for<00:02:50.909> something<00:02:51.719> that's<00:02:51.900> lower

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
make a case for something that's lower

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.220 
make a case for something that's lower
price<00:02:52.439> or<00:02:52.829> a<00:02:53.010> broader<00:02:53.579> amount<00:02:54.359> of<00:02:54.569> content<00:02:55.049> if

they're the only ones out there it's III
don't<00:02:58.319> think<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.739> somehow<00:02:59.010> going<00:02:59.280> to

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
don't think this is somehow going to

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.110 
don't think this is somehow going to
negate<00:02:59.849> all<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.280> great<00:03:02.280> excitement<00:03:02.879> that

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
negate all of the great excitement that

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.399 
negate all of the great excitement that
people<00:03:03.359> are<00:03:03.449> going<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.629> have<00:03:03.780> these<00:03:03.959> consoles

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.750 
quality Star Wars product because there
was<00:05:11.470> a<00:05:11.500> period<00:05:11.860> of<00:05:12.010> time<00:05:12.220> where<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.490> market

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
was a period of time where the market

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.360 
was a period of time where the market
was<00:05:12.850> so<00:05:12.880> saturated<00:05:13.240> with<00:05:13.630> Star<00:05:13.810> Wars<00:05:14.020> and<00:05:14.370> it

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
was so saturated with Star Wars and it

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.580 
was so saturated with Star Wars and it
got<00:05:15.880> the<00:05:16.090> point<00:05:16.120> where<00:05:16.540> gamestop<00:05:17.230> was

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
got the point where gamestop was

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.070 
got the point where gamestop was
actually<00:05:18.130> telling<00:05:18.580> lucasarts<00:05:19.360> to<00:05:19.720> stop

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
putting out Star Wars games because it

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.970 
putting out Star Wars games because it
just<00:05:22.480> didn't<00:05:22.750> have<00:05:22.900> that<00:05:22.930> special<00:05:23.320> ring<00:05:23.680> to<00:05:23.860> it

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
just didn't have that special ring to it

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.460 
just didn't have that special ring to it
they<00:05:24.430> clearly<00:05:24.970> have<00:05:25.210> probably<00:05:25.630> paid<00:05:25.900> a<00:05:26.110> lot<00:05:26.440> of

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
they clearly have probably paid a lot of

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.020 
they clearly have probably paid a lot of
money<00:05:26.620> although<00:05:27.100> I've<00:05:27.310> heard<00:05:27.550> some<00:05:27.730> rumors

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
that they're going to be paying

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.680 
that they're going to be paying
royalties<00:05:29.140> on<00:05:29.830> these<00:05:30.550> games<00:05:30.880> and<00:05:31.210> if<00:05:31.300> that<00:05:31.510> is

the<00:05:31.840> case<00:05:31.870> the<00:05:32.500> games<00:05:32.710> have<00:05:32.890> to<00:05:33.310> be<00:05:33.430> good<00:05:33.640> the

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
the case the games have to be good the

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.500 
the case the games have to be good the
games<00:05:34.180> have<00:05:34.419> to<00:05:35.020> sell<00:05:35.260> and<00:05:35.530> there<00:05:35.680> really<00:05:35.830> is

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
games have to sell and there really is

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.450 
games have to sell and there really is
for<00:05:37.510> the<00:05:37.660> most<00:05:37.840> part<00:05:38.230> you<00:05:38.560> know<00:05:38.680> good<00:05:39.160> games

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
for the most part you know good games

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.340 
for the most part you know good games
especially<00:05:39.880> the<00:05:40.150> Star<00:05:40.419> Wars<00:05:40.540> license<00:05:40.900> will

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
especially the Star Wars license will

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.590 
especially the Star Wars license will
sell<00:05:41.650> very<00:05:41.680> very<00:05:42.190> well<00:05:42.430> my<00:05:42.760> question<00:05:43.000> is<00:05:43.240> what

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
sell very very well my question is what

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.540 
sell very very well my question is what
makes<00:05:43.900> a<00:05:44.080> good<00:05:44.230> star<00:05:44.590> wars<00:05:44.830> game<00:05:44.919> Rogue

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
makes a good star wars game Rogue

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.430 
makes a good star wars game Rogue
Squadron<00:05:45.580> is<00:05:46.090> a<00:05:46.180> great<00:05:46.390> example<00:05:46.540> I<00:05:46.990> think<00:05:47.350> the

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
Squadron is a great example I think the

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.100 
Squadron is a great example I think the
game's<00:05:47.680> x-wing<00:05:48.280> vs.<00:05:48.730> thai<00:05:48.940> fighter<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.810> ones

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
game's x-wing vs. thai fighter the ones

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.560 
game's x-wing vs. thai fighter the ones
that<00:05:50.350> are<00:05:50.740> kind<00:05:51.130> of<00:05:51.160> a<00:05:51.250> slice<00:05:51.730> of<00:05:52.030> what<00:05:52.270> you<00:05:52.390> can

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
that are kind of a slice of what you can

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.440 
that are kind of a slice of what you can
do<00:05:52.900> in<00:05:53.350> the<00:05:53.830> Star<00:05:54.040> Wars<00:05:54.160> universe<00:05:54.300> tend<00:05:55.300> to

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
do in the Star Wars universe tend to

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.390 
do in the Star Wars universe tend to
work<00:05:55.600> the<00:05:55.780> best<00:05:55.990> the<00:05:56.290> one<00:05:56.470> exception<00:05:56.620> is<00:05:57.130> nice

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
work the best the one exception is nice

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.070 
work the best the one exception is nice
of<00:05:57.580> the<00:05:57.669> older<00:05:57.910> public<00:05:58.330> and<00:05:58.480> I<00:05:58.600> think<00:05:58.870> that's

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
of the older public and I think that's

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.560 
of the older public and I think that's
really<00:05:59.169> because<00:05:59.730> Bioware<00:06:00.730> had<00:06:01.030> such<00:06:01.390> a

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
really because Bioware had such a

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.890 
really because Bioware had such a
wonderful<00:06:02.010> elegant<00:06:03.010> RPG<00:06:03.610> formula<00:06:04.180> that<00:06:04.720> you

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
wonderful elegant RPG formula that you

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.510 
wonderful elegant RPG formula that you
just<00:06:05.080> put<00:06:05.260> star<00:06:05.470> wars<00:06:05.620> on<00:06:05.710> top<00:06:05.950> of<00:06:06.130> it<00:06:06.220> and<00:06:06.280> it

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
just put star wars on top of it and it

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.400 
just put star wars on top of it and it
really<00:06:06.730> works<00:06:07.030> but<00:06:07.270> it<00:06:07.360> tends<00:06:07.660> to<00:06:07.780> be<00:06:07.870> those

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
really works but it tends to be those

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.170 
really works but it tends to be those
smaller<00:06:08.770> slices<00:06:09.130> battlefront<00:06:09.760> falls<00:06:10.000> into

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
smaller slices battlefront falls into

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.000 
smaller slices battlefront falls into
that<00:06:10.390> as<00:06:10.540> well<00:06:10.570> with<00:06:11.200> your<00:06:11.320> examples<00:06:11.770> of<00:06:11.830> like

that as well with your examples of like
