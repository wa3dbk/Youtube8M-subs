00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
last week we did the original this week

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.690 
last week we did the original this week
we're<00:00:15.040> doing<00:00:15.160> chaos<00:00:15.900> energy<00:00:16.900> plus<00:00:17.500> juice<00:00:17.980> this

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
we're doing chaos energy plus juice this

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.620 
we're doing chaos energy plus juice this
is<00:00:18.760> made<00:00:19.090> with<00:00:19.120> a<00:00:19.300> 30%<00:00:20.280> juice<00:00:21.280> I<00:00:21.790> believe<00:00:22.480> it's

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
is made with a 30% juice I believe it's

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.140 
is made with a 30% juice I believe it's
probably<00:00:22.830> non-carbonated<00:00:23.830> it's<00:00:24.730> a<00:00:24.790> hundred

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
probably non-carbonated it's a hundred

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.090 
probably non-carbonated it's a hundred
and<00:00:25.300> fifty<00:00:25.780> calories<00:00:26.080> a<00:00:26.350> can<00:00:26.680> so<00:00:26.890> if<00:00:26.980> you're

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
and fifty calories a can so if you're

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.680 
and fifty calories a can so if you're
trying<00:00:27.250> to<00:00:27.340> save<00:00:27.520> some<00:00:27.670> calories<00:00:27.850> this<00:00:28.540> was

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690 
trying to save some calories this was

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.010 
trying to save some calories this was
210<00:00:29.470> this<00:00:29.950> is<00:00:30.100> 150<00:00:30.820> so<00:00:31.090> right<00:00:31.390> off<00:00:31.420> the<00:00:31.570> top<00:00:31.840> you

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
210 this is 150 so right off the top you

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.660 
210 this is 150 so right off the top you
want<00:00:32.170> to<00:00:32.230> check<00:00:32.349> pick<00:00:32.560> probably<00:00:33.100> pick<00:00:33.520> this

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
want to check pick probably pick this

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.550 
want to check pick probably pick this
one<00:00:33.850> unless<00:00:34.330> you<00:00:34.450> like<00:00:34.600> that<00:00:34.720> one<00:00:34.840> better

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
one unless you like that one better

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.830 
one unless you like that one better
it<00:00:36.160> also<00:00:36.370> has<00:00:36.640> I<00:00:36.790> think<00:00:36.820> seventy<00:00:37.480> seven

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.380 
it also has I think seventy seven
milligrams<00:00:39.270> sort<00:00:40.270> of<00:00:41.160> 154<00:00:42.160> milligrams<00:00:42.790> per

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
milligrams sort of 154 milligrams per

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.260 
milligrams sort of 154 milligrams per
can<00:00:43.690> of<00:00:44.220> caffeine<00:00:45.220> so<00:00:45.790> if<00:00:45.850> you're<00:00:45.970> looking<00:00:46.180> for

don't<00:00:51.790> know<00:00:51.880> anything<00:00:52.150> never<00:00:52.540> had<00:00:52.810> this<00:00:52.930> one

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
don't know anything never had this one

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.319 
don't know anything never had this one
before<00:00:53.430> they<00:00:54.430> don't<00:00:54.610> really<00:00:54.730> tell<00:00:55.000> you<00:00:55.150> what

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
before they don't really tell you what

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.360 
before they don't really tell you what
these<00:00:55.420> things<00:00:55.630> taste<00:00:55.989> like<00:00:56.200> it<00:00:56.980> just<00:00:57.160> says

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
these things taste like it just says

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.590 
these things taste like it just says
thirty<00:00:58.060> percent<00:00:58.390> juice<00:00:58.800> 100%<00:00:59.800> monster<00:01:00.399> and<00:01:01.270> of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
thirty percent juice 100% monster and of

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.240 
thirty percent juice 100% monster and of
course<00:01:01.810> it<00:01:01.930> has<00:01:02.110> their<00:01:02.380> website<00:01:02.860> and<00:01:03.010> all<00:01:03.070> that

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
course it has their website and all that

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.310 
course it has their website and all that
stuff<00:01:03.520> on<00:01:03.760> it<00:01:04.180> so<00:01:04.809> let's<00:01:05.110> give<00:01:05.320> it<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.500> shot<00:01:05.800> I

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
stuff on it so let's give it a shot I

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.390 
stuff on it so let's give it a shot I
don't<00:01:08.320> know<00:01:08.440> I've<00:01:08.710> never<00:01:08.920> gotten<00:01:09.100> any

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
don't know I've never gotten any

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.149 
don't know I've never gotten any
feedback<00:01:09.670> from<00:01:10.090> anybody<00:01:10.540> ever<00:01:10.900> on<00:01:11.290> this<00:01:11.800> drink

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
feedback from anybody ever on this drink

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.200 
feedback from anybody ever on this drink
so<00:01:12.250> let's<00:01:12.690> try<00:01:13.690> it<00:01:13.750> for<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.080> very<00:01:14.200> first<00:01:14.440> time

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
so let's try it for the very first time

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.600 
so let's try it for the very first time
when<00:01:16.210> I<00:01:16.240> first<00:01:16.600> opened<00:01:16.750> it<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:18.280> didn't<00:01:18.520> have

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
when I first opened it it didn't have

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.510 
when I first opened it it didn't have
the<00:01:18.729> same<00:01:18.970> powerful<00:01:20.700> aroma<00:01:21.700> as<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.420> original

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the same powerful aroma as the original

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.950 
the same powerful aroma as the original
so<00:01:24.520> this<00:01:24.670> is<00:01:24.790> probably<00:01:25.120> non-carbonated<00:01:25.930> right

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
so this is probably non-carbonated right

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.230 
so this is probably non-carbonated right
no<00:01:28.960> it's<00:01:29.320> carbonated<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.790> it's<00:01:30.970> carbonated

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
no it's carbonated so it's carbonated

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.440 
no it's carbonated so it's carbonated
with<00:01:31.690> juice<00:01:33.540> like<00:01:34.540> they<00:01:34.750> said<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.790> I'm<00:01:37.090> going

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
with juice like they said so I'm going

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.240 
with juice like they said so I'm going
to<00:01:37.479> guess<00:01:38.190> that<00:01:39.190> this<00:01:39.430> is<00:01:39.670> very<00:01:40.390> citrusy

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
to guess that this is very citrusy

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.070 
to guess that this is very citrusy
possibly<00:01:42.250> on<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.400> orange<00:01:42.909> taste<00:01:43.420> because<00:01:43.960> it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
possibly on the orange taste because it

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.670 
possibly on the orange taste because it
is<00:01:44.260> orange<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:46.360> again<00:01:47.200> let<00:01:47.380> me<00:01:47.439> know<00:01:47.560> in<00:01:47.650> the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
is orange so again let me know in the

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.990 
is orange so again let me know in the
comments<00:01:48.010> below<00:01:48.100> if<00:01:48.189> you've<00:01:48.520> actually<00:01:48.670> tried

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
comments below if you've actually tried

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.910 
comments below if you've actually tried
this<00:01:49.150> one<00:01:49.390> what<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:49.720> think<00:01:49.990> give<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.650> a<00:01:50.710> rating

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
this one what you think give it a rating

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.630 
this one what you think give it a rating
on<00:01:51.159> your<00:01:51.369> by<00:01:52.000> yourself<00:01:52.450> for<00:01:53.020> yourself

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.770 

this<00:01:59.640> one<00:01:59.790> actually<00:01:59.910> tastes<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.660> other

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
this one actually tastes like the other

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.730 
this one actually tastes like the other
one<00:02:00.960> but<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.770> smoother<00:02:02.990> if<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.410> can<00:02:04.560> try<00:02:04.710> to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
one but it's smoother if you can try to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.020 
one but it's smoother if you can try to
figure<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.160> one<00:02:05.310> out<00:02:05.370> it's<00:02:05.520> not<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.760> powerful

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
figure that one out it's not as powerful

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.750 
figure that one out it's not as powerful
in<00:02:06.420> flavor<00:02:06.750> but<00:02:07.440> it<00:02:07.560> tastes<00:02:07.980> the<00:02:08.130> same<00:02:08.160> and

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
in flavor but it tastes the same and

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:16.430 
in flavor but it tastes the same and
almost<00:02:09.150> has<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> tea<00:02:09.720> flavor<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.650> it<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:16.410> is

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
almost has a tea flavor to it it is

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.340 
almost has a tea flavor to it it is
almost<00:02:16.680> identical<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.930> but<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.050> just<00:02:19.170> a

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
almost identical to this but it's just a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.080 
almost identical to this but it's just a
little<00:02:19.500> bit<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:20.310> guess

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
little bit I guess

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.000 
little bit I guess
