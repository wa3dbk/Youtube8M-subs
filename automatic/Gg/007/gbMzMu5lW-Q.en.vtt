00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.590
 the permanent crisis 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.480
 Earlier turn the foundation of our monetary system and that's weird 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.249
 We all got so used to it that no one questions what 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.710
 but that actually means it's weird that we all believe that 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.359
 such a piece of paper can be of much value just was someone imprinted 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.329
 50 Euros 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.669
 signed 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:28.720
 Trichet 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.960
 ECB 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.199
 There were times when it was different there was behind each of these bills 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.100
 Chem Gold 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.630
 in the same value the most gold in the US in the legendary 4 points Oaks 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.420
 President Nixon broke up with it exactly 40 years ago, and all of us 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 asked for this paper 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.710
 in the expansion of our finances of their songs there are two stands 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.360
 the gold is the sun the dollar the month 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.200
 That said the former US Treasury Secretary Henry V was stuck and 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.240
 unalterable 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.060
 not only knowing these two certainties Bolt and there it was 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.580
 Security for every dollar was gold 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.140
 until 15 August 1971 as President Bridget Nixon before the nation 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.800
 So right-handed IPCom would properly guarantee light waves 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.880
 I have dishonestly instructed the Minister of Finance the convertibility of 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.670
 Temporarily suspend dollars and bury only under conditions 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.580
 to serve the purpose of monetary stability and to meet US interests 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.630
 relentless the Fed the world that even the huge gold deposits of 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.440
 NOx is not enough to cover all the printed dollars 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.870
 Since 1944 committed to the Bretton Woods agreement with the us bank 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.550
 Spending $ 35 an ounce of gold the dollar had its fixed value 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.420
 Only do what if you need more money than you have gold 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.810
 As the US in the 1960s the B-Plan war devoured billions 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.750
 The war with the money press will finance the French as 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.430
 first suspicion and want in 1969 their Dorner foreign currency against gold ostrich 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.430
 Do not you like the US? 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.079
 In August 1970, the American gold population was already at only 8,000 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.079
 Tons melted off after World War II were super 22 00 tons 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.900
 Unix NADA the problem that Americans alone short-term 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:29.299
 Foreign debts of 60 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.239
 Billions of dollars had piled up but the value of this gold stock in the 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.999
 August was Sat 1 was just 10 billion dollars so it went that way 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:40.099
 not further and he then closed the gold window but nothing 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.039
 other than a breach of the law of the United States 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:47.369
 our current financial systems spheres never emerged without the decoupling of the 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:48.629
 Dollars of gold 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.529
 cheap money has brought growth and prosperity 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.649
 and a financial crisis with unknown hands 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.649
 Now take a step back to the gold standard 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:01.329
 I do not believe that we will return to the gold standard because 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.729
 but the gold deposits on our planet are far too easy for that 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:06.729
 This interest has always been 1 in the last two years 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:09.429
 I think that many countries have something against it here in certain 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:13.589
 Dependencies so that the gold standard does not percent to percent 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:16.539
 but we do of course need the books 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:18.799
 who a garden 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.189
 since 1971, it is no longer the worst his money invested 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:25.629
 it is only our belief
