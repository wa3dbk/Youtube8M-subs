00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.810

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.850 

it<00:01:47.020> would<00:01:47.140> be<00:01:47.259> more<00:01:47.439> like<00:01:47.680> a<00:01:47.710> partial<00:01:48.369> G<00:01:48.759> shape

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
it would be more like a partial G shape

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.170 
it would be more like a partial G shape
which<00:01:50.860> is<00:01:50.890> what<00:01:51.189> you're<00:01:51.310> playing<00:01:51.490> over<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.000> C

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
which is what you're playing over the C

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.719 
which is what you're playing over the C
chord<00:01:52.509> there<00:01:52.720> okay<00:01:53.619> so<00:01:53.860> you<00:01:53.920> can<00:01:54.100> do<00:01:54.189> this<00:01:54.369> one

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
chord there okay so you can do this one

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.859 
chord there okay so you can do this one
of<00:01:54.759> two<00:01:54.850> ways<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:55.540> can<00:01:55.720> use<00:01:55.869> your<00:01:57.540> your<00:01:58.540> ring

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
of two ways you can use your your ring

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.170 
of two ways you can use your your ring
finger<00:01:59.259> and<00:01:59.290> pinky<00:01:59.470> to<00:02:00.040> do<00:02:00.189> the<00:02:00.399> higher<00:02:00.610> parts

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
finger and pinky to do the higher parts

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.570 
finger and pinky to do the higher parts
or<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.600> could<00:02:01.869> use<00:02:02.710> your<00:02:03.549> middle<00:02:03.759> finger<00:02:04.270> and

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
or you could use your middle finger and

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.550 
or you could use your middle finger and
ring<00:02:06.580> finger<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:07.180> your<00:02:07.479> pinky<00:02:07.630> so<00:02:08.110> it's<00:02:08.259> just

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
ring finger and your pinky so it's just

is<00:02:59.190> you're<00:02:59.310> just<00:02:59.490> changing<00:03:01.130> what<00:03:02.130> fret<00:03:02.640> you're

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
is you're just changing what fret you're

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.280 
is you're just changing what fret you're
fretting<00:03:03.090> on<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.420> second<00:03:03.810> string<00:03:04.080> it's

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
fretting on the second string it's

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.840 
fretting on the second string it's
either<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.650> fifth<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.280> seventh<00:03:05.700> or<00:03:05.820> the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850

either the fifth the seventh or the
eighth

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.480 

that's<00:03:13.210> really<00:03:13.480> what<00:03:13.720> creates<00:03:14.020> the<00:03:14.410> the

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
that's really what creates the the

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.830 
that's really what creates the the
little<00:03:15.490> melodic<00:03:15.940> part<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:16.420> everything

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
little melodic part of it everything

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.070 
little melodic part of it everything

else is just going along for the ride so
to<00:03:20.140> say<00:03:20.790> but<00:03:21.790> again<00:03:22.060> if<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.300> just<00:03:22.360> kind<00:03:22.690> of

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
to say but again if you just kind of

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.280 
to say but again if you just kind of
listen<00:03:23.050> to<00:03:23.080> it<00:03:23.290> you're<00:03:23.410> just<00:03:23.500> kind<00:03:23.830> of<00:03:25.290> you're

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
just kind of keep it a steady jug with

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.450 
just kind of keep it a steady jug with
the<00:03:29.530> right<00:03:29.740> hand<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:31.800> then<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:32.980> left<00:03:33.220> hands

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
the right hand and then the left hands

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.280 
the right hand and then the left hands
just<00:03:33.700> changing<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.330> chord<00:03:34.600> shapes

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.770 

and<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.379> really<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.830> just<00:03:40.860> starts<00:03:41.760> out<00:03:41.940> like

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
and it really is just starts out like

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.759 
and it really is just starts out like
with<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.110> fifth<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.159> seventh<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.180> fifth<00:03:45.769> and

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
with the fifth and seventh and fifth and

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.729 
with the fifth and seventh and fifth and
then<00:03:47.580> you're<00:03:47.790> just<00:03:47.909> going<00:03:49.940> so<00:03:50.940> it's<00:03:51.120> once<00:03:51.739> with

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
then you're just going so it's once with

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.569 
then you're just going so it's once with
a<00:03:52.769> seventh<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.340> fifth<00:03:54.349> -<00:03:55.349> with<00:03:55.799> this<00:03:55.920> seventh

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
a seventh and fifth - with this seventh

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.640 
a seventh and fifth - with this seventh
and<00:03:56.730> seventh<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:00.959> do<00:04:01.079> it<00:04:01.200> again<00:04:01.290> like

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
and seventh and you do it again like

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.000 
and seventh and you do it again like
that<00:04:01.680> once<00:04:02.430> with<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.760> fifth<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.329> Sabbath

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.920 

you<00:04:09.010> do<00:04:09.190> yes<00:04:09.850> I<00:04:10.030> guess<00:04:10.210> that's<00:04:10.330> actually<00:04:10.720> three

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
you do yes I guess that's actually three

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.320 
you do yes I guess that's actually three
times<00:04:11.110> there<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:11.620> then<00:04:12.550> you<00:04:12.700> bring<00:04:12.970> this<00:04:13.120> up

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
times there and then you bring this up

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.960 
times there and then you bring this up
here<00:04:15.600> so<00:04:16.600> you're<00:04:16.840> really<00:04:17.170> fretting<00:04:17.680> the

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
here so you're really fretting the

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.610 
here so you're really fretting the
seventh<00:04:18.970> fret<00:04:19.120> of<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.330> g<00:04:19.840> string<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.500> 8th

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
seventh fret of the g string and the 8th

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:43.490 
seventh fret of the g string and the 8th
fret<00:04:20.860> of<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.040> B<00:04:21.190> string

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.480 

okay<00:04:44.500> so<00:04:44.560> if<00:04:44.770> we<00:04:44.860> were<00:04:44.920> to<00:04:45.040> break<00:04:45.160> this<00:04:45.310> down

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
okay so if we were to break this down

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.390 
okay so if we were to break this down
even<00:04:45.760> further<00:04:45.970> and<00:04:46.270> we<00:04:46.360> just<00:04:46.540> took<00:04:46.720> it<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:47.400> the

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
even further and we just took it to the

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.890 
even further and we just took it to the
one<00:04:48.550> string<00:04:48.880> that's<00:04:49.030> changing<00:04:49.510> is<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.660> B

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
one string that's changing is the B

00:04:49.900 --> 00:05:00.140 
one string that's changing is the B
string<00:04:50.260> and<00:04:50.440> now<00:04:50.590> you're<00:04:50.770> doing<00:04:50.890> here<00:04:51.250> is

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.930 

again<00:05:01.150> so<00:05:01.360> then<00:05:01.479> your<00:05:01.630> right<00:05:01.780> hand<00:05:02.139> is<00:05:02.349> just

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
again so then your right hand is just

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.890 
again so then your right hand is just
it's<00:05:03.940> just<00:05:04.150> down<00:05:04.479> stroking<00:05:05.199> pretty<00:05:05.680> much<00:05:05.919> just

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
it's just down stroking pretty much just

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.950 
it's just down stroking pretty much just
consistent<00:05:11.160> like<00:05:12.160> that<00:05:12.419> so<00:05:13.419> again<00:05:13.630> if<00:05:13.750> we<00:05:13.810> get

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
consistent like that so again if we get

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:25.930 
consistent like that so again if we get
this<00:05:14.139> shape<00:05:14.349> going

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.490 

that's<00:05:26.450> really<00:05:26.720> all<00:05:26.840> there<00:05:26.960> is<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.260> it<00:05:27.350> it's

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
that's really all there is to it it's

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.270 
that's really all there is to it it's
pretty<00:05:27.650> simple<00:05:28.010> but<00:05:28.130> I<00:05:28.250> uh<00:05:28.280> it's<00:05:28.940> just<00:05:29.240> really

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
pretty simple but I uh it's just really

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.360 
pretty simple but I uh it's just really
nice<00:05:31.280> and<00:05:31.310> tasteful<00:05:31.820> and<00:05:32.180> kind<00:05:32.480> of<00:05:32.600> aggressive

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
nice and tasteful and kind of aggressive

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:48.180 
nice and tasteful and kind of aggressive
little<00:05:34.370> riff<00:05:34.580> there

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.370 

and<00:05:49.060> that<00:05:49.150> goes<00:05:49.360> into<00:05:49.540> the<00:05:49.690> law<00:05:49.840> in<00:05:50.080> that<00:05:50.110> first

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
and that goes into the law in that first

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.890 
and that goes into the law in that first
section<00:05:50.850> and<00:05:51.850> it<00:05:52.000> repeats<00:05:52.390> that<00:05:52.630> riff

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
section and it repeats that riff

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.720 
section and it repeats that riff
throughout<00:05:53.440> the<00:05:53.650> song<00:05:53.890> and<00:05:54.190> between<00:05:54.370> some<00:05:54.670> of

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
throughout the song and between some of

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.570 
throughout the song and between some of
the<00:05:54.820> vocal<00:05:55.120> lines<00:05:55.360> it'll<00:05:55.960> actually<00:05:56.580> actually

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
the vocal lines it'll actually actually

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.570 
the vocal lines it'll actually actually
repeat<00:05:58.000> that<00:05:58.180> riff<00:05:58.360> so<00:05:58.980> once<00:05:59.980> you<00:06:00.100> can<00:06:00.250> get<00:06:00.430> it

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
repeat that riff so once you can get it

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.730 
repeat that riff so once you can get it
down<00:06:00.730> for<00:06:01.090> the<00:06:01.180> intro<00:06:01.540> you'll<00:06:01.990> use<00:06:02.260> it<00:06:02.470> plenty

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
down for the intro you'll use it plenty

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.880 
down for the intro you'll use it plenty
of<00:06:02.890> times<00:06:03.130> throughout<00:06:03.610> the<00:06:03.760> rest<00:06:03.940> of<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.120> song

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
of times throughout the rest of the song

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.840 
of times throughout the rest of the song
but<00:06:05.890> that's<00:06:06.070> pretty<00:06:06.220> much<00:06:06.340> it

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
but that's pretty much it

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.030
