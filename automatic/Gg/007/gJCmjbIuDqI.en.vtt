00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
if you look back than the playoff run

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.149 
if you look back than the playoff run

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
where at Atlanta brick thrown the ball

where at Atlanta brick thrown the ball
around<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.030> mean<00:01:24.150> amazon<00:01:24.659> fire<00:01:25.110> he's

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
around and just I mean amazon fire he's

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.530 
around and just I mean amazon fire he's
thrown<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.159> anyone<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.700> everyone<00:01:26.850> who<00:01:27.150> was

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
thrown it to anyone and everyone who was

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.270 
thrown it to anyone and everyone who was
out<00:01:28.049> there<00:01:28.320> we're<00:01:28.530> destroying<00:01:28.890> our<00:01:29.070> routes

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
out there we're destroying our routes

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.340 
out there we're destroying our routes
and<00:01:29.490> he<00:01:29.610> was<00:01:29.759> stoned<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.329> open<00:01:30.600> guy<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.140> i

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and he was stoned to the open guy so i

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.770 
and he was stoned to the open guy so i
think<00:01:32.189> our<00:01:32.549> run<00:01:32.759> game<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:33.150> pick<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.570> little

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
think our run game can pick up a little

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.319 
think our run game can pick up a little
bit<00:01:33.900> more<00:01:34.159> but<00:01:35.159> again<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:35.640> hard<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.150> be

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
bit more but again it's hard to be

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.390 
bit more but again it's hard to be
consistent<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.020> when<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.829> know<00:01:37.950> throw

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
consistent that when we you know throw

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.580 
consistent that when we you know throw

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
all the time how exactly he wants it ran

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.580 
all the time how exactly he wants it ran
or<00:02:59.730> if<00:02:59.820> you<00:02:59.910> would<00:03:00.030> rather<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.300> know<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.590> fit

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
or if you would rather you know a fit

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.620 
or if you would rather you know a fit
and<00:03:01.830> so<00:03:02.010> run<00:03:02.250> out<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.700> or<00:03:02.850> stuff<00:03:03.420> like<00:03:03.570> that

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
and so run out of it or stuff like that

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.250 
and so run out of it or stuff like that
so<00:03:05.000> again<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.030> think<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.360> more<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:06.690> asked<00:03:07.080> when

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
so again I think the more you asked when

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.949 
so again I think the more you asked when
we<00:03:07.380> find<00:03:07.620> out<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:08.100> better<00:03:08.540> position<00:03:09.540> you'll

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
we find out the better position you'll

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.660 
we find out the better position you'll
be<00:03:10.110> in<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.440> then<00:03:10.560> once<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.890> make<00:03:11.040> plays<00:03:11.310> the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
be in and then once you make plays the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.570 
be in and then once you make plays the
confidence<00:03:12.709> that<00:03:13.709> he'll<00:03:13.890> have<00:03:14.070> in<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.400> will

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
confidence that he'll have in you will
