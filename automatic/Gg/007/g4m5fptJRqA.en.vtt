00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
image I don't know I think he'll come

image I don't know I think he'll come
out<00:00:24.029> i<00:00:24.210> think<00:00:24.420> his<00:00:24.630> game<00:00:24.840> plans<00:00:25.080> going<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.320> come

out i think his game plans going to come

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.750 
out i think his game plans going to come
at<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.619> slower<00:00:25.800> pace<00:00:25.920> but<00:00:26.279> i<00:00:26.310> think<00:00:26.490> he'll<00:00:26.640> go

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
at a slower pace but i think he'll go

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.040 
at a slower pace but i think he'll go
crazy<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.210> start<00:00:27.269> swinging<00:00:27.630> when<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.869> bell

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
crazy and start swinging when the bell

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.779 
crazy and start swinging when the bell
rings<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.439> he<00:00:29.070> does<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.400> all<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.580> fight

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
rings like he does it in all this fight

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.060 
rings like he does it in all this fight
so<00:00:30.119> if<00:00:30.720> he<00:00:30.840> does<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.019> that's<00:00:31.289> good<00:00:31.590> for<00:00:31.769> me<00:00:31.890> as

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
so if he does that that's good for me as

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.959 
so if he does that that's good for me as
long<00:00:32.130> as<00:00:32.279> he<00:00:32.340> doesn't<00:00:32.460> hurt<00:00:32.640> me<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> first

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
long as he doesn't hurt me in the first

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.120 
long as he doesn't hurt me in the first
minute<00:00:33.270> or<00:00:33.360> two<00:00:33.510> or<00:00:34.410> if<00:00:34.500> he<00:00:34.559> wants<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.800> try<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
minute or two or if he wants to try to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.950 
minute or two or if he wants to try to
pace<00:00:35.309> himself<00:00:35.399> that's<00:00:35.730> good<00:00:35.910> too<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.600> would

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
pace himself that's good too so I would

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.299 
pace himself that's good too so I would
rather<00:00:37.050> not<00:00:37.290> fight<00:00:37.500> somebody<00:00:37.710> fighting<00:00:38.100> crazy

night<00:01:05.309> we'll<00:01:05.489> see<00:01:05.689> who<00:01:06.689> think<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.460> he<00:01:08.460> had<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
night we'll see who think that he had a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.090 
night we'll see who think that he had a
chance<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.600> such<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> short<00:01:10.320> period<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.710> time<00:01:10.770> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
chance in such a short period of time to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.300 
chance in such a short period of time to
improve<00:01:11.369> his<00:01:11.909> ground<00:01:12.420> game<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:13.140> example<00:01:13.590> his

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
improve his ground game for example his

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.649 
improve his ground game for example his
ground<00:01:14.549> game<00:01:14.610> felt<00:01:14.939> good<00:01:15.090> when<00:01:15.119> he<00:01:15.330> was<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.540> top

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
ground game felt good when he was on top

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.749 
ground game felt good when he was on top
of<00:01:15.720> me<00:01:15.840> he<00:01:15.990> felt<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.229> he<00:01:16.530> was<00:01:16.680> strong<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.549> top

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
of me he felt like he was strong on top

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.520 
of me he felt like he was strong on top
and<00:01:17.909> rogue<00:01:18.060> had<00:01:18.240> real<00:01:18.420> good<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> posture<00:01:19.470> and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and rogue had real good a posture and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.469 
and rogue had real good a posture and
good<00:01:19.680> balance<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.280> think<00:01:20.790> his<00:01:20.880> strategy<00:01:21.299> last

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
good balance I think his strategy last

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.350 
good balance I think his strategy last
time<00:01:21.689> was<00:01:22.290> bad<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:23.820> we'll<00:01:23.970> see<00:01:24.090> if<00:01:24.119> he<00:01:24.240> improves

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
time was bad so we'll see if he improves

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.730 
time was bad so we'll see if he improves
it<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.780> time<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.960> didn't<00:01:25.229> expect<00:01:25.439> him<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.680> come

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
it this time I didn't expect him to come

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.800 
it this time I didn't expect him to come
out<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.369> aggressively<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.659> that

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
out like that that aggressively and that

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.969 
out like that that aggressively and that
works<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.350> win<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> first<00:01:28.770> two

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
works if you win in the first two

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.050 
works if you win in the first two
minutes<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.490> don't<00:01:29.640> win<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.909> first

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
minutes but if you don't win the first

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.460 
minutes but if you don't win the first
two<00:01:30.119> minutes<00:01:30.329> then<00:01:30.570> you're<00:01:30.659> going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.960> you

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
two minutes then you're going to be you

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.810 
two minutes then you're going to be you
know<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.740> my<00:01:31.860> son<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> little<00:01:32.340> boy<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.579> smell

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
know it's my son a little boy I smell

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.679 
know it's my son a little boy I smell
time<00:01:32.970> why<00:01:33.090> don't<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.299> come<00:01:33.420> out<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.540> fight

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
time why don't you come out and fight

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.330 
time why don't you come out and fight
like<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.900> sex<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.680> don't<00:01:34.710> want<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.040> done<00:01:35.189> in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
like that sex I don't want to be done in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.590 
like that sex I don't want to be done in
two<00:01:35.430> minutes<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.210> doesn't<00:01:36.479> work

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
two minutes because if it doesn't work

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.410 
two minutes because if it doesn't work
early<00:01:37.049> you're<00:01:37.350> done<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.770> know<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:39.030> think

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
early you're done you know so I think

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.640 
early you're done you know so I think
I'm<00:01:39.630> prepared<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.110> whatever<00:01:40.259> he<00:01:40.380> wants<00:01:40.619> to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
I'm prepared to do whatever he wants to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.810 
I'm prepared to do whatever he wants to
do<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:40.860> he<00:01:40.920> wants<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.100> stand<00:01:41.280> up<00:01:41.460> I'll<00:01:41.579> stand<00:01:41.759> up

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
do if he wants to stand up I'll stand up

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.730 
do if he wants to stand up I'll stand up
bona<00:01:42.030> fide<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.329> doesn't<00:01:42.540> matter<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.780> me<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.680> if

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
bona fide it doesn't matter to me or if

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.780 
bona fide it doesn't matter to me or if
you<00:01:43.829> want<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.009> go<00:01:44.070> around<00:01:44.340> that's<00:01:44.549> even<00:01:44.729> better

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
you want to go around that's even better

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.740 
you want to go around that's even better
for<00:01:45.030> me<00:01:45.500> so<00:01:46.500> what's<00:01:47.100> your<00:01:47.220> prediction<00:01:47.750> I'm

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
for me so what's your prediction I'm

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.550 
for me so what's your prediction I'm
going<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.960> say<00:01:49.079> I'm<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.439> win

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
going to say I'm going to win

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.950 
going to say I'm going to win
probably<00:01:51.460> not<00:01:51.549> decision<00:01:52.060> I'll<00:01:52.570> win<00:01:52.780> in<00:01:52.899> the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
probably not decision I'll win in the

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.990 
probably not decision I'll win in the
second<00:01:53.290> round<00:01:53.520> toward<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.610> end<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.790> second
