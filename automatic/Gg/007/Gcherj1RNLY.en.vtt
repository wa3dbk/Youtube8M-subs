the<00:01:57.799> battle<00:01:58.039> for<00:01:58.069> third<00:01:58.219> place<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:59.239> that's<00:01:59.509> a

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
the battle for third place and that's a

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.719 
the battle for third place and that's a
wild<00:02:00.110> old<00:02:00.229> place<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.709> overtake<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:01.369> I<00:02:01.459> think

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
wild old place to overtake and I think

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.569 
wild old place to overtake and I think
that<00:02:01.879> is<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.450> number<00:02:02.719> 26<00:02:03.229> car<00:02:03.500> yes<00:02:04.159> that's<00:02:04.399> the
