hemisphere the right hemisphere is

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.890 
hemisphere the right hemisphere is
responsible<00:00:20.699> for<00:00:20.730> imagination

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
responsible for imagination

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.490 
responsible for imagination
for<00:00:22.740> example<00:00:23.330> combat<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.510> various<00:00:25.080> karate
