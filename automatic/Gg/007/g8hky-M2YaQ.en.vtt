path<00:00:37.860> tracing<00:00:38.190> gives<00:00:38.760> us<00:00:38.969> several<00:00:39.420> advantages

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
path tracing gives us several advantages

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.950 
path tracing gives us several advantages
over<00:00:40.350> other<00:00:40.800> iners<00:00:41.280> out<00:00:41.520> there<00:00:41.760> one<00:00:42.750> big

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
over other iners out there one big

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.380 
over other iners out there one big
advantage<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:44.100> don't<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.120> care

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
advantage is that you don't have to care

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.930 
advantage is that you don't have to care
about<00:00:45.629> how<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.649> rendering<00:00:47.219> process<00:00:47.399> works

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
about how the rendering process works

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.720 
about how the rendering process works
there's<00:00:48.719> no<00:00:48.960> complex<00:00:49.410> setup<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.039> easy<00:00:50.489> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
there's no complex setup it's easy and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.450 
there's no complex setup it's easy and
simple<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.600> turn<00:00:52.110> on<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:53.129> global

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
simple you just turn on the global

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.220 
simple you just turn on the global
illumination<00:00:53.640> switch<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.570> example<00:00:55.020> and

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
illumination switch for example and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.439 
illumination switch for example and
there<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.739> go<00:00:55.949> there's<00:00:56.550> no<00:00:56.789> complicated

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
there you go there's no complicated

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.279 
there you go there's no complicated
setups<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.890> few<00:00:59.129> settings<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.059> that's<00:01:00.960> it

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
setups just a few settings and that's it

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.759 
setups just a few settings and that's it
it<00:01:01.980> reduces<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.820> learning<00:01:03.180> curve<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.769> zero

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
it reduces the learning curve to zero

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.910 
it reduces the learning curve to zero
and<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.030> only<00:01:06.330> possible<00:01:06.510> because<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.680> use

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
and this is only possible because we use

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.750 
and this is only possible because we use
unbiased<00:01:08.610> path<00:01:08.790> tracing<00:01:09.240> without<00:01:09.840> compromise

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
unbiased path tracing without compromise

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.240 
unbiased path tracing without compromise
now<00:01:11.760> let's<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.299> look<00:01:12.479> at<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.840> scene<00:01:13.250> we're

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
now let's have a look at the scene we're

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.240 
now let's have a look at the scene we're
using<00:01:14.430> active<00:01:14.939> shade<00:01:15.439> to<00:01:16.439> render<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.979> scene

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
using active shade to render the scene

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.499 
using active shade to render the scene
in<00:01:17.700> an<00:01:17.850> interactive<00:01:18.390> mode<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:20.000> just<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.119> short

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
in an interactive mode and just a short

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.210 
in an interactive mode and just a short
information<00:01:22.020> about<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> scene<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:22.770> got<00:01:22.979> that

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
information about the scene we got that

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.960 
information about the scene we got that
scene<00:01:23.520> from<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.000> internet<00:01:25.009> so<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.640> just

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
scene from the internet so we just

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.080 
scene from the internet so we just
download<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> date<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.770> uses<00:01:29.250> materials<00:01:29.939> we

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
download a date it uses materials we

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.020 
download a date it uses materials we
didn't<00:01:30.360> set<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> materials<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:32.030> mesquite

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
didn't set up the materials and mesquite

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.060 
didn't set up the materials and mesquite
arena<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.450> very<00:01:33.720> good<00:01:33.960> at<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:34.890> now

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
arena is very good at it so we're now

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.340 
arena is very good at it so we're now
adjusting<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.420> more<00:01:36.840> important

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
adjusting one of the more important

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.130 
adjusting one of the more important
parameters<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.400> iterations<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.299> that

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
parameters it's the iterations and that

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.560 
parameters it's the iterations and that
means<00:01:40.409> right<00:01:41.250> now<00:01:41.460> we're<00:01:41.790> sending<00:01:42.000> one<00:01:42.360> ray

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
means right now we're sending one ray

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.859 
means right now we're sending one ray
per<00:01:42.899> pixel<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:44.100> adjust<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.119> two<00:01:45.360> rays<00:01:45.600> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
per pixel we adjust it to two rays and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.719 
per pixel we adjust it to two rays and
you<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.680> image<00:01:46.950> becomes<00:01:47.250> clear<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
you can see the image becomes clear and

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.210 
you can see the image becomes clear and
now<00:01:47.850> less<00:01:48.210> noise<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.840> especially<00:01:49.829> when<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
now less noise and especially when you

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.399 
now less noise and especially when you
look<00:01:50.430> at<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.850> blurry<00:01:51.210> reflections<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.049> can

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
look at the blurry reflections you can

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.490 
look at the blurry reflections you can
see<00:01:52.970> what<00:01:53.970> influence<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.899> amount<00:01:55.229> of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
see what influence the amount of

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.000 
see what influence the amount of
iterations<00:01:56.189> has

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
iterations has

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.290 
iterations has
on<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.430> quality<00:01:58.180> of<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.480> image<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:01.030> let's

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
on the quality of the image so let's

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.360 
on the quality of the image so let's
increase<00:02:01.480> that<00:02:01.930> a<00:02:02.260> little<00:02:02.320> bit<00:02:02.740> further<00:02:03.010> and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
increase that a little bit further and

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.700 
increase that a little bit further and
you<00:02:03.430> can<00:02:03.730> see<00:02:03.940> now<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.360> blurry<00:02:04.840> reflections

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
you can see now the blurry reflections

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.520 
you can see now the blurry reflections
become<00:02:06.220> much<00:02:06.610> clearer<00:02:06.940> out<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.450> much<00:02:07.720> nicer

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
become much clearer out and much nicer

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.880 
become much clearer out and much nicer
that's<00:02:09.250> how<00:02:10.000> unbiased<00:02:10.840> path<00:02:11.080> tracing<00:02:11.500> works

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
that's how unbiased path tracing works

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.250 
that's how unbiased path tracing works
we<00:02:12.310> are<00:02:12.430> not<00:02:12.640> sending<00:02:13.030> rays<00:02:13.480> in<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:14.020> specific

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
bounces inside a scene so right now we

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.770 
bounces inside a scene so right now we
set<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:56.890> bounces<00:02:57.400> up<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.850> 1<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.570> means

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
set the bounces up to 1 so that means

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.390 
set the bounces up to 1 so that means
one<00:02:59.020> bounce<00:02:59.290> we<00:02:59.530> get<00:02:59.709> a<00:02:59.740> little<00:03:00.130> bit<00:03:00.220> of

one bounce we get a little bit of

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.820 
one bounce we get a little bit of

and yes mosquito ender is able to just

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.460 
and yes mosquito ender is able to just
hand<00:04:12.250> this<00:04:12.549> as<00:04:12.879> well<00:04:13.209> as<00:04:13.480> you<00:04:13.690> would<00:04:13.810> expect<00:04:13.989> it

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
hand this as well as you would expect it

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.590

from any other renderer as well and
let's<00:04:19.600> just<00:04:20.280> try<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.340> adjust<00:04:22.090> one<00:04:22.479> material

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
let's just try to adjust one material

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.570 
let's just try to adjust one material
the<00:04:23.350> wood<00:04:23.949> floor<00:04:24.250> and<00:04:25.410> for<00:04:26.410> that<00:04:26.560> we<00:04:26.830> change<00:04:27.430> a

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
the wood floor and for that we change a

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.719 
the wood floor and for that we change a
little<00:04:28.000> bit<00:04:28.120> our<00:04:28.650> viewing<00:04:29.650> angle<00:04:30.280> so<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.610> we

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
little bit our viewing angle so that we

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.490 
little bit our viewing angle so that we
can<00:04:30.970> see<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.389> reflections<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.139> little<00:04:32.380> bit

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
can see the reflections a little bit

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.920 
can see the reflections a little bit
better<00:04:32.710> so<00:04:33.160> you<00:04:33.220> see<00:04:33.699> now<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.000> reflections

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
better so you see now the reflections

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.900 
better so you see now the reflections
much<00:04:35.290> better<00:04:35.620> on<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.040> floor<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:38.580> then<00:04:39.580> we<00:04:39.790> are

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
much better on the floor and then we are

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.909 
much better on the floor and then we are
going<00:04:40.270> to<00:04:40.510> adjust<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.229> amount<00:04:41.530> of

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
going to adjust the amount of

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.879 
going to adjust the amount of
reflectivity<00:04:42.699> on<00:04:43.240> our<00:04:43.479> floor<00:04:43.870> so<00:04:44.320> we<00:04:44.470> increase

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
reflectivity on our floor so we increase

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.219 
reflectivity on our floor so we increase
that<00:04:45.130> we<00:04:45.430> get<00:04:45.639> much<00:04:46.060> more<00:04:46.090> reflections<00:04:46.960> on<00:04:47.110> the

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
that we get much more reflections on the

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.010 
that we get much more reflections on the
floor<00:04:47.500> so<00:04:48.100> it<00:04:48.190> looks<00:04:48.430> more<00:04:48.729> polished<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:49.870> we

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
floor so it looks more polished and we

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.960 
floor so it looks more polished and we
can<00:04:50.229> reduce<00:04:50.530> that<00:04:50.590> we<00:04:51.010> can<00:04:51.220> control<00:04:51.699> the

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
can reduce that we can control the

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.529 
can reduce that we can control the
glossiness<00:04:52.389> how<00:04:53.110> polished<00:04:53.680> how<00:04:54.060> blurry<00:04:55.060> it<00:04:55.360> is

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
glossiness how polished how blurry it is

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.219 
glossiness how polished how blurry it is
and<00:04:55.919> that's<00:04:56.919> the<00:04:57.100> great<00:04:57.310> beauty<00:04:57.669> about

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
and that's the great beauty about

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.350 
and that's the great beauty about
mosquito<00:04:59.229> render<00:04:59.680> being<00:04:59.949> a<00:05:00.190> GPU<00:05:00.669> render<00:05:01.120> with

mosquito render being a GPU render with
path<00:05:01.990> tracing<00:05:02.410> you<00:05:02.979> can<00:05:03.190> adjust<00:05:03.610> all<00:05:03.910> these

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
path tracing you can adjust all these

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.800 
path tracing you can adjust all these
aspects<00:05:04.660> in<00:05:04.990> real<00:05:05.830> time<00:05:06.220> and<00:05:07.000> you<00:05:07.180> get<00:05:07.389> instant

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
aspects in real time and you get instant

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.900 
aspects in real time and you get instant
feedback<00:05:10.620> this<00:05:11.620> is<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.830> power<00:05:12.190> of<00:05:12.310> mosquito

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
feedback this is the power of mosquito

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.350 
feedback this is the power of mosquito
render<00:05:13.270> and<00:05:13.560> you<00:05:14.560> can<00:05:14.830> really<00:05:15.580> adjust<00:05:15.849> and

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
render and you can really adjust and

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.129 
render and you can really adjust and
rely<00:05:16.690> on<00:05:16.720> the<00:05:17.289> physically<00:05:17.979> accurate<00:05:19.139> light

mosquito<00:05:23.470> render<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:23.919> don't<00:05:24.220> have<00:05:24.460> to<00:05:24.610> think

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
mosquito render you don't have to think

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.440 
mosquito render you don't have to think
about<00:05:25.150> it

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
about it

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.110 
about it
light<00:05:25.870> is<00:05:26.169> bouncing<00:05:26.680> around<00:05:27.120> automatically

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
light is bouncing around automatically

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.050 
light is bouncing around automatically
and<00:05:28.360> it's<00:05:28.960> properly<00:05:29.530> calculated<00:05:30.160> you<00:05:30.460> so<00:05:31.000> you

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
and it's properly calculated you so you

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.690 
and it's properly calculated you so you
can<00:05:31.360> concentrate<00:05:31.720> on<00:05:32.260> your<00:05:32.500> point<00:05:33.099> of<00:05:33.220> view<00:05:33.280> on

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
can concentrate on your point of view on

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.170 
can concentrate on your point of view on
your<00:05:34.000> illumination<00:05:34.870> setup<00:05:35.349> and<00:05:35.560> if<00:05:36.550> you<00:05:36.910> want

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
your illumination setup and if you want

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.560 
your illumination setup and if you want
you<00:05:37.479> can<00:05:37.690> add<00:05:37.930> our<00:05:38.320> physical<00:05:38.919> camera<00:05:39.310> on<00:05:39.760> top

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
you can add our physical camera on top

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.980 
you can add our physical camera on top
of<00:05:40.870> it<00:05:41.229> and<00:05:41.440> this<00:05:42.130> will<00:05:42.340> allow<00:05:42.520> to<00:05:42.729> adjust<00:05:43.419> the

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
of it and this will allow to adjust the

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.110 
of it and this will allow to adjust the
exposure<00:05:44.169> for<00:05:44.800> example<00:05:44.860> now<00:05:45.610> we're<00:05:45.820> changing

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
exposure for example now we're changing

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.560 
exposure for example now we're changing
the<00:05:46.449> exposure<00:05:46.840> you<00:05:47.830> can<00:05:48.070> change<00:05:48.520> all<00:05:48.789> kinds<00:05:49.419> of

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
the exposure you can change all kinds of

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.680 
the exposure you can change all kinds of
aspects<00:05:50.169> so<00:05:50.289> mosquito<00:05:51.190> render<00:05:51.610> exactly<00:05:52.449> works

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
aspects so mosquito render exactly works

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.260 
aspects so mosquito render exactly works
like<00:05:53.050> a<00:05:53.080> real-world<00:05:53.500> camera<00:05:54.250> so<00:05:55.000> there's

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
like a real-world camera so there's

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.420 
like a real-world camera so there's
nothing<00:05:55.570> new<00:05:55.810> you<00:05:56.440> have<00:05:56.620> to<00:05:56.650> learn<00:05:56.979> if<00:05:57.280> you

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
nothing new you have to learn if you

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.100 
nothing new you have to learn if you
know<00:05:57.639> how<00:05:57.910> to<00:05:57.970> take<00:05:58.270> a<00:05:58.300> picture<00:05:58.599> with<00:05:58.960> your
