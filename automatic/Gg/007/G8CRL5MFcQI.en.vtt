blade it's made out of 400 series

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.389 
blade it's made out of 400 series
stainless<00:00:55.719> steel<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.910> handle<00:00:58.660> is<00:00:59.219> made<00:01:00.219> out

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
stainless steel the handle is made out

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.280 
stainless steel the handle is made out

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
of g10 polymer and is 4.9 inches long

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.980 
of g10 polymer and is 4.9 inches long
and<00:01:05.290> this<00:01:05.470> knife<00:01:05.710> weighs<00:01:06.010> in<00:01:06.400> at<00:01:06.900> 3.7<00:01:07.900> ounces

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
and this knife weighs in at 3.7 ounces

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.410 
and this knife weighs in at 3.7 ounces
so<00:01:08.530> for<00:01:09.070> how<00:01:09.159> large<00:01:09.460> of<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.760> knife<00:01:09.939> it<00:01:10.090> is<00:01:10.180> it's

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
so for how large of a knife it is it's

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.789 
so for how large of a knife it is it's
still<00:01:10.720> actually<00:01:12.000> pretty<00:01:13.000> lightweight

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
still actually pretty lightweight

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.670 
still actually pretty lightweight
so<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:15.100> features<00:01:15.760> on<00:01:15.970> this<00:01:16.119> knife<00:01:16.390> it<00:01:17.170> has<00:01:17.439> a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
so the features on this knife it has a

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.890 
so the features on this knife it has a
single<00:01:18.100> thumb<00:01:18.520> stud<00:01:18.820> which<00:01:19.150> is<00:01:19.299> just<00:01:19.659> on<00:01:19.869> the

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
top left of the knife so that's not

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.649
