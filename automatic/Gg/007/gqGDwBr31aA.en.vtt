00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
welcome back Wolfpack rolls here and

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.050 
welcome back Wolfpack rolls here and
this<00:00:01.560> is<00:00:01.680> how<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.829> use<00:00:01.979> cricket<00:00:02.610> Tunes<00:00:02.790> so

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
this is how to use cricket Tunes so

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.400 
this is how to use cricket Tunes so
cricket<00:00:03.360> tune<00:00:03.480> is<00:00:03.659> going<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.929> be<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.049> Pokemon

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
cricket tune is going to be a Pokemon

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.070 
cricket tune is going to be a Pokemon
with<00:00:04.589> low<00:00:05.190> base<00:00:05.580> stats<00:00:05.940> so<00:00:06.569> these<00:00:06.690> seven<00:00:06.960> hit

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
with low base stats so these seven hit

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.810 
with low base stats so these seven hit
points<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.529> 50s<00:00:07.859> on<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.010> fences<00:00:08.610> means

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
points and 50s on the fences means

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.890 
points and 50s on the fences means
you're<00:00:09.030> not<00:00:09.120> really<00:00:09.360> going<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.630> be<00:00:09.690> able<00:00:09.780> to

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
you're not really going to be able to

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.900 
you're not really going to be able to
tank<00:00:10.200> out<00:00:10.349> too<00:00:10.559> much<00:00:10.679> sixty-five<00:00:11.490> speed<00:00:11.730> which

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
tank out too much sixty-five speed which

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.160 
tank out too much sixty-five speed which
means<00:00:12.120> we're<00:00:12.300> not<00:00:12.389> really<00:00:12.540> finding<00:00:12.840> any<00:00:12.990> out

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
means we're not really finding any out

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.099 
means we're not really finding any out
speeds<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.710> 85<00:00:14.400> attack<00:00:14.759> means<00:00:15.089> well<00:00:15.509> we're

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
speeds and 85 attack means well we're

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.390 
speeds and 85 attack means well we're
not<00:00:16.230> gonna<00:00:16.320> hit<00:00:16.470> too<00:00:16.619> much<00:00:16.770> hard<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.100> cricket

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
not gonna hit too much hard so cricket

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.179 
not gonna hit too much hard so cricket
tune<00:00:17.550> going<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.210> be<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.570> very<00:00:19.109> very<00:00:19.680> difficult

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
tune going to be a very very difficult

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.189 
tune going to be a very very difficult
Pokemon<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.850> use<00:00:20.970> competitively<00:00:21.630> might<00:00:22.050> have

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
Pokemon to use competitively might have

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.240 
Pokemon to use competitively might have
to<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:22.439> some<00:00:22.680> kind<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.890> gimmick<00:00:23.039> or

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
to have some kind of gimmick or

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.769 
to have some kind of gimmick or
something<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.850> that's<00:00:24.180> gonna<00:00:24.330> make<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.539> kind

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
something and that's gonna make it kind

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.250 
something and that's gonna make it kind
of<00:00:24.840> tough

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
of tough

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.050 
of tough
well<00:00:25.560> guess<00:00:25.710> typing<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.400> pure<00:00:26.640> bug<00:00:26.849> type

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
well guess typing it's a pure bug type

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.000 
well guess typing it's a pure bug type
so<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.599> flying<00:00:27.900> rock<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.380> fire<00:00:28.560> weakness

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
so we have flying rock and fire weakness

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.589 
so we have flying rock and fire weakness
and<00:00:29.160> then<00:00:29.550> fighting<00:00:29.849> ground<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.390> grasp

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and then fighting ground and grasp

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.450 
and then fighting ground and grasp
resistances<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.529> it's<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:32.040> kind<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.219> pretty

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
resistances so it's just kind of pretty

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.860 
resistances so it's just kind of pretty
balanced<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.270> three<00:00:33.690> weaknesses

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
balanced that we have three weaknesses

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.930 
balanced that we have three weaknesses
three<00:00:34.380> resistances<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.100> that's<00:00:35.430> kind<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.730> all

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
three resistances and that's kind of all

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.310 
three resistances and that's kind of all
we're<00:00:36.090> getting<00:00:36.210> out<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.660> now<00:00:36.989> before<00:00:37.110> we

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
we're getting out of it now before we

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.840 
we're getting out of it now before we
look<00:00:37.500> at<00:00:37.620> anything<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.980> Pokemon<00:00:38.280> showdown<00:00:38.309> I

look at anything in Pokemon showdown I

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.369 
look at anything in Pokemon showdown I
got<00:00:39.180> curious<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.660> decided<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.050> go<00:00:40.110> into<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
got curious I decided to go into the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.170 
got curious I decided to go into the
pokémon<00:00:40.530> Global<00:00:40.950> Link<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.760> find<00:00:41.940> out<00:00:42.059> how

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
pokémon Global Link to find out how

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.940 
pokémon Global Link to find out how
people<00:00:42.450> are<00:00:42.540> using<00:00:42.570> cricket<00:00:43.140> tuned<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.530> all

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
people are using cricket tuned and all

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.319 
people are using cricket tuned and all
three<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> people<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.180> brought

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
three of the people that have brought

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.720 
three of the people that have brought
cricket<00:00:45.960> into<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> battle<00:00:46.680> spot<00:00:46.890> they<00:00:47.550> can't

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
cricket into a battle spot they can't

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.639 
cricket into a battle spot they can't
even<00:00:47.820> make<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.149> their<00:00:48.300> mind<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.260> want

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
even make up their mind what do you want

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.340 
even make up their mind what do you want
from<00:00:49.920> me<00:00:50.840> hopping<00:00:51.840> into<00:00:51.960> Pokemon<00:00:52.289> showdown

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
from me hopping into Pokemon showdown

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.290 
from me hopping into Pokemon showdown
we'd<00:00:52.860> see<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.190> cricket<00:00:53.520> hoon<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
we'd see that cricket hoon is going to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.610 
we'd see that cricket hoon is going to
have<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> focus<00:00:54.989> sash<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.379> lot<00:00:55.530> of

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
have to have a focus sash in a lot of

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.049 
have to have a focus sash in a lot of
situations<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.579> solve<00:00:56.789> out<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
situations and then we solve out in the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.580 
situations and then we solve out in the
battle<00:00:57.329> spot<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.780> everyone<00:00:58.109> brought<00:00:58.320> a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
battle spot that everyone brought a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.439 
battle spot that everyone brought a
focus<00:00:59.190> sash<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.640> that's<00:00:59.910> because<00:01:00.149> Prickett

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
focus sash and that's because Prickett

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.060 
focus sash and that's because Prickett
hoon<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.809> going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.289> some<00:01:01.559> kind<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.829> setup

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
hoon it's going to do some kind of setup

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.920 
hoon it's going to do some kind of setup
gimmicks<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.090> sticky<00:01:03.390> web<00:01:03.600> and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
gimmicks that you have sticky web and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.109 
gimmicks that you have sticky web and
endeavour<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.250> idea<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.820> trade

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
endeavour so the idea is you trade

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.820 
endeavour so the idea is you trade
sticky<00:01:06.540> webs<00:01:06.689> or<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.049> trade<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.470> some<00:01:07.650> kind

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
sticky webs or you trade like some kind

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.080 
sticky webs or you trade like some kind
of<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.010> know<00:01:08.100> they<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.400> stealth<00:01:08.700> rock<00:01:08.909> they

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
of you know they do a stealth rock they

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.910 
of you know they do a stealth rock they
do<00:01:09.150> some<00:01:09.420> kind<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.200> get<00:01:10.350> your<00:01:10.439> setup<00:01:10.799> with

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
do some kind of you get your setup with

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.320 
do some kind of you get your setup with
sticky<00:01:11.159> web<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.580> then<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.790> at<00:01:11.909> least<00:01:11.939> try<00:01:12.299> to

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
sticky web and then you at least try to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.789 
sticky web and then you at least try to
knock<00:01:12.570> them<00:01:12.750> down<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.140> hit<00:01:13.320> points<00:01:13.560> really

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
knock them down to one hit points really

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.039 
knock them down to one hit points really
quickly<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.640> you're<00:01:15.210> expecting<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.840> get

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
quickly that you're expecting just get

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.050 
quickly that you're expecting just get
outs<00:01:16.200> fed<00:01:16.470> take<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> lot<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.189> damage<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.820> then

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
outs fed take a lot of damage and then

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.910 
your opponents from there you can go
with<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.420> chest<00:02:33.780> arrest<00:02:34.140> oh<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.530> tends<00:02:34.800> to

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
with a chest arrest oh that tends to

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.190 
with a chest arrest oh that tends to
work<00:02:35.100> pretty<00:02:35.160> well<00:02:35.460> a<00:02:35.790> rest<00:02:36.390> talk<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.960> bit

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
work pretty well a rest talk is a bit

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.050 
work pretty well a rest talk is a bit
more<00:02:37.320> gimmicky<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:37.860> can<00:02:38.070> also<00:02:38.220> work<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.640> then

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
more gimmicky and can also work and then

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.460 
more gimmicky and can also work and then
you<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.300> follow<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.600> up<00:02:39.720> with<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.930> dark<00:02:40.290> pulse

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
you can follow it up with a dark pulse

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.020 
you can follow it up with a dark pulse
now<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.010> reason<00:02:41.310> why<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.460> choose<00:02:41.610> dark<00:02:41.880> pulse

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
now the reason why I choose dark pulse

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.580 
now the reason why I choose dark pulse
over<00:02:42.270> something<00:02:42.570> like<00:02:42.600> psyshock<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.410> that

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
over something like psyshock is that

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.140 
over something like psyshock is that
dark<00:02:43.860> pulse<00:02:44.010> isn't<00:02:44.490> going<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.730> get<00:02:44.820> immuned

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
dark pulse isn't going to get immuned

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.340 
dark pulse isn't going to get immuned
that<00:02:45.540> if<00:02:45.600> they<00:02:45.720> have<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> dark-type<00:02:46.080> pokémon

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
that if they have a dark-type pokémon

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.680 
that if they have a dark-type pokémon
and<00:02:46.860> you're<00:02:46.980> using<00:02:47.130> psyshock<00:02:47.910> it's<00:02:48.360> not<00:02:48.570> gonna

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
and you're using psyshock it's not gonna

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.090 
and you're using psyshock it's not gonna
work<00:02:48.870> out<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.290> now<00:02:49.350> we're<00:02:49.590> just<00:02:49.740> more<00:02:49.830> getting

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
work out so now we're just more getting

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.680 
work out so now we're just more getting
into<00:02:50.340> like<00:02:50.460> Generic<00:02:50.730> golf<00:02:50.970> hotel<00:02:51.240> strategies

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
into like Generic golf hotel strategies

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.690 
into like Generic golf hotel strategies
but<00:02:52.200> overall<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.680> can<00:02:52.830> bring<00:02:53.010> in<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.280> shadow

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
but overall you can bring in a shadow

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.400 
but overall you can bring in a shadow
tag<00:02:53.880> Pokemon<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.570> wouldn't<00:02:55.230> really<00:02:55.320> recommend

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410

mega<00:02:56.130> Gengar<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.700> they<00:02:56.790> can<00:02:56.910> still<00:02:57.120> switch<00:02:57.390> out

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
mega Gengar so they can still switch out

mega Gengar so they can still switch out
if<00:02:57.900> you're<00:02:58.470> trying<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.920> set<00:02:59.100> up<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.310> parish

so<00:03:00.000> it's<00:03:00.210> more<00:03:00.630> of<00:03:00.720> like<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> super<00:03:01.260> gimmick<00:03:01.530> but

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
so it's more of like a super gimmick but

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.960 
so it's more of like a super gimmick but
best-case<00:03:02.250> scenario<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.670> can<00:03:02.820> actually

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
best-case scenario that can actually

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.060 
best-case scenario that can actually
work<00:03:03.270> out<00:03:03.420> really<00:03:03.630> well<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:03.990> sometimes<00:03:04.950> you

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
work out really well and sometimes you

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.620 
work out really well and sometimes you
know<00:03:05.190> if<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.400> maybe<00:03:05.550> switch<00:03:05.970> out<00:03:06.180> cricket

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
go off and then you endeavor the other

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.810 
go off and then you endeavor the other
pokemon<00:03:55.620> those<00:03:56.070> make<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.459> where<00:03:56.520> now<00:03:56.670> they

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
pokemon those make it to where now they

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.250 
pokemon those make it to where now they
have<00:03:56.910> two<00:03:57.030> pokemon<00:03:57.420> at<00:03:57.540> one<00:03:57.690> hit<00:03:57.840> points<00:03:58.140> and

have two pokemon at one hit points and

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.710 
have two pokemon at one hit points and
you<00:03:58.890> go<00:03:59.190> for<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.790> rockslide

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
you go for the rockslide

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.120 
you go for the rockslide
so<00:04:00.989> rockslide<00:04:01.560> is<00:04:01.680> gonna<00:04:01.890> be<00:04:01.950> interesting

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
so rockslide is gonna be interesting

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.550 
so rockslide is gonna be interesting
because<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:02.790> doesn't<00:04:02.820> matter<00:04:03.450> or<00:04:03.780> any<00:04:04.230> kind<00:04:04.470> of

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
because it doesn't matter or any kind of

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.320 
because it doesn't matter or any kind of
move<00:04:04.680> like<00:04:04.860> snarl<00:04:05.400> something<00:04:05.910> that<00:04:06.030> hits<00:04:06.180> both

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
move like snarl something that hits both

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.120 
move like snarl something that hits both
opponents<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:07.260> cops<00:04:07.530> tell<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.860> rockslide

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
opponents so cops tell the rockslide

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.530 
opponents so cops tell the rockslide
would<00:04:08.370> be<00:04:08.489> really<00:04:08.670> interesting<00:04:09.120> but<00:04:09.330> I<00:04:09.420> just

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
would be really interesting but I just

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.940 
would be really interesting but I just
like<00:04:09.690> golf<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.020> Telep<00:04:10.200> sits<00:04:10.380> a<00:04:10.440> very<00:04:10.650> tanky

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
like golf and Telep sits a very tanky

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.949 
like golf and Telep sits a very tanky
very<00:04:11.580> reliable<00:04:11.940> trick<00:04:12.209> from<00:04:12.330> Pokemon<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:12.870> it

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
very reliable trick from Pokemon and it

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.540 
very reliable trick from Pokemon and it
doesn't<00:04:13.260> have<00:04:13.380> access<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.800> a<00:04:13.980> double<00:04:14.370> hitting

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
doesn't have access to a double hitting

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.490 
doesn't have access to a double hitting
move<00:04:14.760> like<00:04:15.060> rockslide<00:04:15.510> so<00:04:16.080> interestingly

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
move like rockslide so interestingly

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.289 
move like rockslide so interestingly
enough<00:04:16.560> this<00:04:17.250> can<00:04:17.459> actually<00:04:17.609> work<00:04:17.790> for<00:04:18.209> its

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
enough this can actually work for its

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.460 
enough this can actually work for its
own<00:04:18.390> little<00:04:18.630> set<00:04:18.780> of<00:04:18.840> shenanigans

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
own little set of shenanigans

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.719 
own little set of shenanigans
now<00:04:19.709> you're<00:04:19.890> knocking<00:04:20.190> out<00:04:20.280> your<00:04:20.430> opponent
