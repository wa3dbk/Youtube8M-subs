moderate or open or I think there's also
like<00:01:23.250> restricted<00:01:24.060> or<00:01:24.180> something<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.630> that

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
like restricted or something like that

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.800 
like restricted or something like that
but<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.200> either<00:01:25.409> between<00:01:25.740> moderate<00:01:26.040> or<00:01:26.310> open

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
but it's either between moderate or open

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.350 
but it's either between moderate or open
now<00:01:27.810> what<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.619> found<00:01:28.920> out<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.460> whenever<00:01:29.970> my

going into the campaign playing for a
bit<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.790> then<00:01:48.689> going<00:01:48.930> back<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
bit and then going back to the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.569 
bit and then going back to the
multiplayer<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.829> that's<00:01:50.040> supposed<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.460> open

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
multiplayer and that's supposed to open

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.340 
multiplayer and that's supposed to open
to<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.880> type<00:01:51.119> but<00:01:51.270> doesn't<00:01:51.540> always<00:01:52.170> work

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
to that type but doesn't always work

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.770 
to that type but doesn't always work
sometimes<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.220> doesn't<00:01:53.460> work<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.270> most<00:01:54.630> of

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
sometimes it doesn't work but most of

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.560 
sometimes it doesn't work but most of
the<00:01:54.869> time<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.229> does<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.950> yeah<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.670> didn't<00:01:57.060> feel

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
that that's that's a boost that I

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.939 
that that's that's a boost that I
