in<00:00:03.560> evolution<00:00:04.560> one<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.890> major<00:00:05.480> concepts

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
in evolution one of the major concepts

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.020 
in evolution one of the major concepts
is<00:00:06.629> what<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.379> species<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.309> species<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:09.000> a

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
is what is a species and a species is a

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.190 
is what is a species and a species is a
group<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.389> organisms<00:00:09.719> that<00:00:10.019> are

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
group of organisms that are

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.259 
group of organisms that are
reproductively<00:00:10.800> isolated<00:00:11.190> from<00:00:11.940> each<00:00:12.059> other

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
reproductively isolated from each other

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.669 
reproductively isolated from each other
now<00:00:12.690> what<00:00:12.929> does<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.110> mean

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
now what does that mean

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.740 
now what does that mean
well<00:00:13.950> reproductive<00:00:14.580> isolation<00:00:14.730> depends<00:00:15.630> on

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
well reproductive isolation depends on

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.160 
well reproductive isolation depends on
various<00:00:16.170> mechanisms<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:17.220> keep<00:00:17.580> one<00:00:18.170> species

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
various mechanisms that keep one species

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.620 
various mechanisms that keep one species
from<00:00:19.859> being<00:00:20.310> able<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.699> successfully<00:00:21.150> mate

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
from being able to successfully mate

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.000 
from being able to successfully mate
with<00:00:21.840> other<00:00:22.109> species

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
with other species

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.700 
with other species
now<00:00:23.609> these<00:00:23.910> fall<00:00:24.240> into<00:00:24.480> two<00:00:24.750> categories<00:00:25.109> these

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
now these fall into two categories these

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.109 
now these fall into two categories these

are<00:00:41.640> okay<00:00:41.969> we've<00:00:42.149> got<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> sperm<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.989> egg

are okay we've got the sperm to the egg
this<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.680> what<00:00:43.920> prevents<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.460> formation<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
this is what prevents the formation of a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.440 
this is what prevents the formation of a
fertile<00:00:45.629> viable<00:00:46.230> hybrid<00:00:47.039> offspring<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.820> just

this<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.840> reasons<00:01:10.170> why<00:01:10.470> we

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
this is one of the reasons why we

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.679 
this is one of the reasons why we
consider<00:01:10.830> lions<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.640> tigers<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.330> two

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
separate species even though some of you

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.300 
separate species even though some of you
that<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.020> paid<00:01:16.320> attention<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.979> some<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
that have paid attention to some of the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.770 
that have paid attention to some of the
freakier<00:01:17.670> parts<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.030> your<00:01:18.150> textbook<00:01:18.450> may<00:01:18.659> have

freakier parts of your textbook may have

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
they're completely disinterested

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.139 
they're completely disinterested
meanwhile<00:02:04.439> fall<00:02:04.860> comes<00:02:05.070> around<00:02:05.369> they<00:02:05.820> come<00:02:06.060> up

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
meanwhile fall comes around they come up

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.809 
meanwhile fall comes around they come up
to<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.360> or<00:02:06.869> animate<00:02:07.110> no<00:02:07.439> not<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.340> time<00:02:08.489> for<00:02:08.729> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
to you or animate no not the time for it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.940 
to you or animate no not the time for it
so<00:02:09.360> that's<00:02:09.569> another<00:02:10.050> way<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.379> keeping<00:02:10.530> two

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
so that's another way of keeping two

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.640 
so that's another way of keeping two
perhaps<00:02:11.520> closely<00:02:12.300> related<00:02:12.569> species

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
perhaps closely related species

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.520 
perhaps closely related species

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
separate from each other mechanical

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.100 
separate from each other mechanical
isolation<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:17.459> put<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.909> in<00:02:18.000> quotes<00:02:18.360> and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
isolation and put that in quotes and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.509 
isolation and put that in quotes and
I'll<00:02:19.260> put<00:02:19.560> some<00:02:19.739> other<00:02:19.890> things<00:02:20.099> into<00:02:20.310> quotes

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
I'll put some other things into quotes

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.770 
I'll put some other things into quotes
this<00:02:20.879> is<00:02:21.090> when<00:02:21.329> the<00:02:21.540> mechanics<00:02:22.230> prevent<00:02:22.890> it

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
this is when the mechanics prevent it

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.589 
this is when the mechanics prevent it
essentially<00:02:24.780> when<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.079> mail<00:02:25.760> key<00:02:26.760> doesn't

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
essentially when the mail key doesn't

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.670 
essentially when the mail key doesn't
fit<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.019> females<00:02:28.409> lock<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:30.109> if<00:02:31.109> you<00:02:31.349> want<00:02:31.560> to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
fit the females lock and if you want to

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.309 
fit the females lock and if you want to
do<00:02:32.189> some<00:02:32.400> interesting<00:02:32.730> reading<00:02:33.120> gone<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
do some interesting reading gone to the

do some interesting reading gone to the
internet<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:34.829> see<00:02:34.890> if<00:02:35.159> you<00:02:35.250> can<00:02:35.400> find<00:02:35.579> out

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
internet and see if you can find out

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.220 
internet and see if you can find out
about<00:02:35.909> some<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.359> different<00:02:36.659> shapes<00:02:37.049> of

about some of the different shapes of

about some of the different shapes of
the<00:02:37.319> keys<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.640> try<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.390> imagine<00:02:39.569> your<00:02:39.810> head

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
the keys and try to imagine your head

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.809 
the keys and try to imagine your head
how<00:02:40.109> do<00:02:40.170> they<00:02:40.349> manage<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.739> get<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.159> into<00:02:41.700> the

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
how do they manage to get that into the

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.360 
how do they manage to get that into the
lock<00:02:42.030> but<00:02:42.930> basically<00:02:43.260> that's<00:02:43.799> what's<00:02:44.159> going

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
lock but basically that's what's going

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.839 
lock but basically that's what's going
on<00:02:44.519> there

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
on there

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.740 
on there
then<00:02:45.840> there's<00:02:46.349> Gami<00:02:46.829> isolation<00:02:47.670> that's<00:02:48.359> when

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
then there's Gami isolation that's when

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.410 
then there's Gami isolation that's when
the<00:02:49.230> gametes<00:02:49.829> are<00:02:50.159> incompatible<00:02:51.000> with<00:02:51.269> each

other where the sperm even if it somehow

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.660 
other where the sperm even if it somehow
manages<00:02:54.329> to<00:02:54.840> get<00:02:55.109> its<00:02:55.349> way<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:56.099> egg<00:02:56.280> it

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
manages to get its way to the egg it

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.490 
manages to get its way to the egg it
doesn't<00:02:57.299> have<00:02:57.389> the<00:02:57.510> right<00:02:57.629> enzymes<00:02:58.260> or

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
doesn't have the right enzymes or

doesn't have the right enzymes or

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
receptor proteins to be able to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.580

now<00:03:05.280> there's<00:03:05.489> one<00:03:05.730> more<00:03:05.939> that<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.180> forgot<00:03:06.450> to

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
now there's one more that I forgot to

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.929 
now there's one more that I forgot to
put<00:03:06.629> up<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.079> that's<00:03:07.349> behavioral<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.639> this<00:03:08.790> is

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
put up and that's behavioral and this is

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.300 
put up and that's behavioral and this is
perhaps<00:03:09.150> one<00:03:09.569> of<00:03:09.599> my<00:03:09.720> favorite<00:03:10.470> ones<00:03:10.889> to<00:03:11.069> talk

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
perhaps one of my favorite ones to talk

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.210 
perhaps one of my favorite ones to talk
about<00:03:14.209> behavioral<00:03:15.209> isolation<00:03:16.220> involves

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
about behavioral isolation involves

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.699 
about behavioral isolation involves
things<00:03:17.459> like<00:03:17.549> courtship<00:03:18.120> rituals<00:03:18.599> if<00:03:19.079> you

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
things like courtship rituals if you

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.349 
things like courtship rituals if you
want<00:03:19.889> to<00:03:19.980> see<00:03:20.099> behavioral<00:03:20.639> isolation<00:03:21.239> in

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
want to see behavioral isolation in

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.050 
want to see behavioral isolation in

the<00:03:24.510> dance<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.989> lot<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.680> behaviors<00:03:26.129> that

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
the dance a lot of the behaviors that

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.589 
the dance a lot of the behaviors that
you<00:03:26.400> see<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.730> kids<00:03:26.940> going<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.269> there<00:03:27.449> are

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
you see the kids going on there are

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.349 
you see the kids going on there are
actually<00:03:28.430> part<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.879> behavioral

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
they put it on the head of a male who

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.770 
they put it on the head of a male who
had<00:05:40.890> a<00:05:40.920> small<00:05:41.100> little<00:05:41.400> comb<00:05:41.700> he<00:05:42.360> walked<00:05:42.600> out

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
had a small little comb he walked out

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.450 
had a small little comb he walked out
barely<00:05:43.290> able<00:05:43.440> to<00:05:43.620> stand<00:05:43.950> but<00:05:44.190> he<00:05:44.220> started

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
barely able to stand but he started

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.040 
barely able to stand but he started
wobbling<00:05:44.820> around<00:05:44.910> with<00:05:45.120> this<00:05:45.240> gigantic<00:05:45.690> comb

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
wobbling around with this gigantic comb

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.720 
wobbling around with this gigantic comb
and<00:05:46.230> all<00:05:46.350> the<00:05:46.440> females<00:05:46.740> would<00:05:46.800> and<00:05:47.490> almost

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
and all the females would and almost

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.410 
and all the females would and almost
killed<00:05:48.060> him

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
killed him

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.930 
killed him
well<00:05:49.140> after<00:05:49.860> they<00:05:49.980> did<00:05:50.160> some<00:05:50.310> investigation

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
well after they did some investigation

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.730 
well after they did some investigation
they<00:05:51.060> found<00:05:51.090> out<00:05:51.510> that<00:05:51.690> that<00:05:51.870> particular<00:05:52.200> bird

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
they found out that that particular bird

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.390 
they found out that that particular bird
then<00:05:53.520> has<00:05:54.420> a<00:05:54.450> parasite<00:05:55.110> these<00:05:55.770> worms<00:05:56.070> that<00:05:56.250> can

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
then has a parasite these worms that can

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.220 
then has a parasite these worms that can
get<00:05:56.550> into<00:05:56.730> the<00:05:56.850> blood<00:05:57.090> vessels<00:05:57.510> of<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:57.750> comb

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
get into the blood vessels of the comb

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.640 
get into the blood vessels of the comb
and<00:05:58.500> it's<00:05:58.980> most<00:05:59.280> active<00:05:59.700> at<00:05:59.880> dawn<00:06:00.330> and<00:06:00.720> so<00:06:01.140> by

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
and it's most active at dawn and so by

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.590 
and it's most active at dawn and so by
inflating<00:06:02.250> their<00:06:02.370> combs<00:06:02.670> if<00:06:03.150> they<00:06:03.450> can

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.920 
animals but they're sterile because they
are<00:07:32.100> this<00:07:32.310> hybrid<00:07:32.790> so<00:07:33.150> donkeys<00:07:33.600> and<00:07:33.750> horses

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930 
are this hybrid so donkeys and horses

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.070 
are this hybrid so donkeys and horses
are<00:07:34.680> two<00:07:34.920> separate<00:07:35.310> species<00:07:35.760> because<00:07:36.450> of<00:07:36.720> this

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 
are two separate species because of this

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.710 
are two separate species because of this
hybrid<00:07:37.260> sterility<00:07:37.650> a<00:07:38.240> last<00:07:39.240> one<00:07:39.450> that's<00:07:39.630> a

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 
hybrid sterility a last one that's a

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.030 
hybrid sterility a last one that's a
little<00:07:39.870> bit<00:07:40.020> unusual<00:07:40.170> as<00:07:40.620> this<00:07:40.770> concept

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:41.040 
little bit unusual as this concept

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.740 
little bit unusual as this concept
called<00:07:41.340> hybrid<00:07:41.760> breakdown<00:07:42.270> and<00:07:42.450> that's<00:07:42.570> where

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:42.750 
called hybrid breakdown and that's where

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.140 
called hybrid breakdown and that's where
okay<00:07:43.140> the<00:07:43.590> first<00:07:43.920> generation<00:07:44.550> of<00:07:44.610> the<00:07:44.730> hybrid

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:45.150 
okay the first generation of the hybrid

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.810 
okay the first generation of the hybrid
maybe<00:07:45.960> it<00:07:46.140> can<00:07:46.260> survive<00:07:46.620> and<00:07:47.250> maybe<00:07:47.460> it<00:07:47.580> could

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:47.820 
maybe it can survive and maybe it could

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.490 
maybe it can survive and maybe it could
be<00:07:47.910> maybe<00:07:48.210> it<00:07:48.360> can<00:07:48.450> even<00:07:48.660> have<00:07:48.840> some<00:07:48.870> offspring

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 
be maybe it can even have some offspring

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.740 
be maybe it can even have some offspring
but<00:07:50.190> the<00:07:50.430> next<00:07:50.700> generation<00:07:51.150> after<00:07:51.270> that<00:07:51.419> but

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:51.750 
but the next generation after that but

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.600 
but the next generation after that but
children<00:07:52.620> of<00:07:52.770> the<00:07:52.890> children<00:07:53.310> and<00:07:53.520> the

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:53.610 
children of the children and the

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.430 
children of the children and the
grandchildren<00:07:53.640> and<00:07:54.360> so<00:07:54.419> on<00:07:54.630> they<00:07:55.140> start

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 
grandchildren and so on they start

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.530 
grandchildren and so on they start
having<00:07:55.650> greater<00:07:56.400> and<00:07:56.580> greater<00:07:56.700> problems<00:07:57.330> and

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:57.540 
having greater and greater problems and

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.330 
having greater and greater problems and
typically<00:07:58.230> these<00:07:58.530> sorts<00:07:58.770> of<00:07:58.830> things<00:07:58.890> are<00:07:59.160> due

00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.340 
typically these sorts of things are due

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.310 
typically these sorts of things are due
to<00:07:59.460> mismatches<00:08:00.180> in<00:08:00.210> the<00:08:00.419> chromosomes<00:08:01.020> of<00:08:01.200> the

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:01.320 
to mismatches in the chromosomes of the

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.610 
to mismatches in the chromosomes of the
two<00:08:01.500> separate<00:08:02.280> species<00:08:02.520> parents<00:08:03.450> and<00:08:04.350> there

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:04.620 
two separate species parents and there

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.960 
two separate species parents and there
you<00:08:04.770> go<00:08:04.950> those<00:08:05.220> are<00:08:05.669> the<00:08:05.790> reproductive

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:05.970 
you go those are the reproductive

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.780 
you go those are the reproductive
isolating<00:08:06.690> mechanisms
