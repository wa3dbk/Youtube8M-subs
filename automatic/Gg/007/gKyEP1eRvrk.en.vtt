and then smush it into an oval shape so
that<00:00:58.399> we<00:00:58.670> can<00:00:58.899> start<00:00:59.899> to<00:01:00.110> get<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:00.350> nice<00:01:01.450> leaf

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
that we can start to get a nice leaf

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.419

easy to follow or what you could do is

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.069 
easy to follow or what you could do is
um<00:02:24.400> use<00:02:25.400> anything<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.970> kind<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.870> has<00:02:27.049> a

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
um use anything that kind of has a

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.569 
um use anything that kind of has a
rounded<00:02:27.620> edge<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.340> just<00:02:28.910> start<00:02:29.239> to<00:02:29.390> poke<00:02:29.630> it

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
rounded edge and just start to poke it

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.759 
rounded edge and just start to poke it
to<00:02:31.579> make<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.299> UM<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:33.370> little<00:02:34.370> edges<00:02:34.880> and

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
to make the UM the little edges and

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.789 
to make the UM the little edges and
stuff<00:02:36.769> of<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.880> leaf<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:38.900> just<00:02:39.170> flattened<00:02:39.590> it

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
stuff of the leaf so I just flattened it

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.910 
stuff of the leaf so I just flattened it
and<00:02:40.329> started<00:02:41.329> to<00:02:41.420> poke<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:42.320> use<00:02:42.530> my<00:02:42.709> nail

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
and started to poke it and I use my nail

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.810 
and started to poke it and I use my nail
to<00:02:43.190> curve<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:44.380> shape<00:02:45.380> upwards<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.549> really

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
to curve the shape upwards and I really

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.670 
to curve the shape upwards and I really
hope<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.269> could<00:02:50.540> like<00:02:50.750> see<00:02:51.170> what<00:02:51.590> I'm

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
hope that you could like see what I'm

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.759 
hope that you could like see what I'm
doing<00:02:52.069> well<00:02:52.670> because<00:02:52.910> it's<00:02:53.840> too<00:02:54.200> hard<00:02:54.230> for<00:02:54.500> me

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
doing well because it's too hard for me

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.680 
doing well because it's too hard for me
to<00:02:54.920> explain<00:02:55.190> I<00:02:55.519> don't<00:02:55.700> really<00:02:55.940> know<00:02:56.180> what<00:02:56.600> I'm

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
to explain I don't really know what I'm

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.699 
to explain I don't really know what I'm
doing<00:02:56.720> there<00:02:58.750> okay<00:02:59.750> and<00:02:59.930> after<00:03:00.049> that<00:03:00.319> I<00:03:00.470> did

doing there okay and after that I did
that<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:00.920> made<00:03:01.250> sure<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.609> there<00:03:01.819> was<00:03:01.910> space

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
that I made sure that there was space

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.000 
that I made sure that there was space
for<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.910> whole<00:03:05.150> cuz<00:03:05.780> we're<00:03:06.319> making<00:03:06.680> beans

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
for the whole cuz we're making beans

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.849 
for the whole cuz we're making beans
pretty<00:03:07.730> much<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.359> you<00:03:09.139> can't<00:03:09.380> have<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.590> bead

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
pretty much and you can't have a bead

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.920 
pretty much and you can't have a bead
without<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.400> hole<00:03:10.609> cuz

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
without a hole cuz

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.660 
without a hole cuz
you<00:03:12.079> can't<00:03:12.349> and<00:03:12.829> I<00:03:12.890> would<00:03:13.040> do<00:03:13.159> anything<00:03:13.280> with

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.440 
polish and I just started to paint that
on<00:03:38.569> top<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:39.680> make<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:40.069> veins<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:40.790> stuff<00:03:41.209> of

on top to make the veins and stuff of
the<00:03:41.599> leaf<00:03:42.459> then<00:03:43.459> what<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:43.730> did<00:03:44.060> for<00:03:44.389> the<00:03:44.689> berries

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
the leaf then what I did for the berries

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.409 
the leaf then what I did for the berries
is<00:03:45.560> I<00:03:45.709> took<00:03:45.769> a<00:03:45.980> piece<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.250> wire<00:03:46.609> and<00:03:46.909> I'm<00:03:47.120> using

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
is I took a piece of wire and I'm using

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.159 
is I took a piece of wire and I'm using
a<00:03:47.629> thin<00:03:47.900> gold<00:03:48.379> one<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:49.090> i<00:03:50.090> placed<00:03:50.419> a<00:03:50.599> bead<00:03:50.840> into

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
a thin gold one and i placed a bead into

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:56.339 
a thin gold one and i placed a bead into
it<00:03:52.450> then<00:03:53.450> what<00:03:53.659> I<00:03:53.689> did<00:03:53.959> was<00:03:54.169> I<00:03:54.319> twisted<00:03:54.829> it<00:03:54.980> and

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
it then what I did was I twisted it and

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.089 
it then what I did was I twisted it and
I<00:03:57.349> separated<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:58.099> sides<00:03:58.400> so<00:03:59.799> they<00:04:00.799> look<00:04:00.980> like

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
I separated the sides so they look like

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.030 
I separated the sides so they look like
a<00:04:01.159> V<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.700> then<00:04:02.659> I<00:04:02.750> took<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:03.139> bead<00:04:03.409> and<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:03.769> place

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
a V and then I took a bead and I place

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.929 
a V and then I took a bead and I place
that<00:04:04.280> on<00:04:04.459> each<00:04:05.180> of<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.659> ends<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:07.340> after<00:04:07.459> I<00:04:07.639> did

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:07.939 
that on each of the ends so after I did

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.550 
that on each of the ends so after I did
that<00:04:07.969> what<00:04:08.450> I<00:04:08.480> did<00:04:08.569> was<00:04:08.780> I<00:04:09.909> twisted<00:04:10.909> it<00:04:11.260> all<00:04:12.260> the

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
that what I did was I twisted it all the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.000 
that what I did was I twisted it all the
way<00:04:13.239> completely<00:04:14.239> and<00:04:15.049> i<00:04:15.139> took<00:04:15.200> some<00:04:15.680> pliers

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
way completely and i took some pliers

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.839 
way completely and i took some pliers
and<00:04:16.419> I<00:04:17.419> bent<00:04:18.229> that<00:04:18.530> into<00:04:19.159> a<00:04:19.190> circle<00:04:19.760> or<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.150> loop

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
and I bent that into a circle or a loop

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:27.240 
and I bent that into a circle or a loop
that<00:04:22.849> way<00:04:23.090> we<00:04:23.330> can<00:04:23.539> um<00:04:25.150> allow<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:26.539> dangle

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
that way we can um allow it to it dangle

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.170 
that way we can um allow it to it dangle
then<00:04:28.250> I'm<00:04:28.370> just<00:04:28.490> going<00:04:28.699> to<00:04:28.760> take<00:04:28.880> another

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
then I'm just going to take another

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.140 
then I'm just going to take another
piece<00:04:29.449> of<00:04:29.599> wire<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:29.840> I'm<00:04:30.349> going<00:04:30.740> to<00:04:31.039> do<00:04:32.030> this

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
piece of wire and I'm going to do this

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.700 
piece of wire and I'm going to do this
exact<00:04:32.659> same<00:04:32.840> thing<00:04:33.050> that<00:04:33.199> I<00:04:33.260> did<00:04:33.320> for<00:04:33.620> the

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
exact same thing that I did for the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.860 
exact same thing that I did for the
berries<00:04:34.010> place<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:34.820> through<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.389> make<00:04:35.599> a<00:04:35.630> loop

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
berries place it through and make a loop

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.860 
berries place it through and make a loop
and<00:04:36.400> then<00:04:37.400> taking<00:04:37.699> another<00:04:38.150> piece<00:04:38.479> of<00:04:38.659> wire

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
and then taking another piece of wire
