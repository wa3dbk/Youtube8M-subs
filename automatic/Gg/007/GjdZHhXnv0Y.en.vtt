00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
some exposure on a big channel like

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.030 
some exposure on a big channel like
cinema<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:31.700> my<00:00:32.700> my<00:00:33.620> intentions<00:00:34.620> were

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
cinema and my my intentions were

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.060 
cinema and my my intentions were
probably<00:00:35.340> bigger<00:00:35.910> than<00:00:36.200> what<00:00:37.200> machinima<00:00:37.890> had

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
probably bigger than what machinima had

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.670 
probably bigger than what machinima had
planned<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.760> my<00:00:39.660> contact<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.559> at

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
planned and my contact and I at

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.950 
planned and my contact and I at
machinima<00:00:41.100> were<00:00:41.219> talking<00:00:41.610> about<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.090> he

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
machinima were talking about it and he

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.459 
machinima were talking about it and he
kind<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.230> persuaded<00:00:43.890> me<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
kind of persuaded me to not do this and

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.950 
kind of persuaded me to not do this and
the<00:00:47.430> reasoning<00:00:47.910> behind<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.750> can

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the reasoning behind it and I can

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.150 
the reasoning behind it and I can
totally<00:00:49.320> understand<00:00:49.860> where<00:00:49.980> he's<00:00:50.100> coming

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
totally understand where he's coming

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.080 
totally understand where he's coming
from<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:52.260> reasoning<00:00:52.649> behind<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:53.070> was<00:00:53.430> if<00:00:53.730> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
from the reasoning behind this was if I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.090 
from the reasoning behind this was if I
start<00:00:54.390> doing<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> consistent<00:00:55.500> basis

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
start doing this on a consistent basis

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.240 
start doing this on a consistent basis
other<00:00:57.030> directors<00:00:57.660> are<00:00:57.960> going<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.770> notice<00:00:58.949> it

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
other directors are going to notice it

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.189 
other directors are going to notice it
and<00:00:59.399> probably<00:00:59.789> start<00:01:00.300> doing<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.600> too<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and probably start doing it too and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.830 
and probably start doing it too and
before<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.219> know<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.489> all<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.539> videos

to go I'll have to think about that a
bit<00:03:48.239> you<00:03:48.900> know<00:03:48.930> dual<00:03:49.260> commentary<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.949> don't

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
bit you know dual commentary I don't

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.280 
bit you know dual commentary I don't
feel<00:03:50.549> that<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:51.000> my<00:03:51.209> strong<00:03:51.479> point<00:03:51.810> that's<00:03:52.109> why

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
feel that is my strong point that's why

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.740 
feel that is my strong point that's why
I've<00:03:52.409> not<00:03:52.680> really<00:03:52.829> done<00:03:52.919> any<00:03:53.669> other<00:03:54.479> than<00:03:54.659> the

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
I've not really done any other than the

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.839 
I've not really done any other than the
one<00:03:54.780> with<00:03:55.079> junkyard<00:03:55.590> but<00:03:55.799> that's<00:03:55.949> because<00:03:56.129> we

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
one with junkyard but that's because we

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.670 
one with junkyard but that's because we
know<00:03:57.000> each<00:03:57.150> other<00:03:57.359> now<00:03:57.449> we<00:03:57.659> play<00:03:57.989> together<00:03:58.139> and

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
know each other now we play together and

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.679 
know each other now we play together and
I<00:03:59.189> think<00:03:59.609> that<00:03:59.760> commentary<00:04:00.180> went<00:04:00.479> over<00:04:00.659> very

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
I think that commentary went over very

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.830 
I think that commentary went over very
well<00:04:01.280> but<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.579> might<00:04:02.879> try<00:04:03.030> something<00:04:03.120> like<00:04:03.449> that

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
well but I might try something like that

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.409 
well but I might try something like that
you<00:04:04.199> never<00:04:04.379> know<00:04:04.669> don't<00:04:05.669> start<00:04:05.939> sending<00:04:06.299> me
