gonna<00:00:26.130> see<00:00:26.550> what<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.359> difference<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.109> boot

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
gonna see what the difference is in boot

00:00:28.439 --> 00:01:29.499 
gonna see what the difference is in boot
time

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.539 

look<00:01:30.049> at<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:30.350> they're<00:01:30.590> both<00:01:30.829> about<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:31.250> same

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
look at that they're both about the same

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.510 
look at that they're both about the same
it's<00:01:31.759> just<00:01:31.820> pretty<00:01:32.119> cool<00:01:32.979> it's<00:01:33.979> pretty<00:01:34.369> cool

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
it's just pretty cool it's pretty cool

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.810 
it's just pretty cool it's pretty cool
when<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.820> consider<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.329> this<00:01:35.689> laptop<00:01:36.820> was

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
when you consider that this laptop was

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.649 
when you consider that this laptop was
built<00:01:38.119> at<00:01:38.299> night

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
built at night

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.709 
built at night
and<00:01:39.429> 2006<00:01:40.429> which<00:01:40.640> means<00:01:40.909> it's<00:01:41.090> coming<00:01:41.420> up<00:01:41.539> on

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
and 2006 which means it's coming up on

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.990 
and 2006 which means it's coming up on
being<00:01:41.990> seven<00:01:42.380> years<00:01:42.560> old<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:43.100> laptop<00:01:43.369> was

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
being seven years old this laptop was

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.210 
being seven years old this laptop was
built<00:01:44.240> in<00:01:44.390> 2009<00:01:47.710> you<00:01:48.710> know<00:01:48.799> some<00:01:49.039> of<00:01:49.100> the

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
built in 2009 you know some of the

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.429 
built in 2009 you know some of the
technical<00:01:49.579> differences<00:01:50.210> would<00:01:50.899> be<00:01:50.960> that<00:01:51.289> this

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
technical differences would be that this

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.880 
technical differences would be that this
is<00:01:52.189> running<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:52.819> core<00:01:53.420> duo<00:01:53.750> processor<00:01:54.560> which<00:01:54.710> it

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
is running a core duo processor which it

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.219 
is running a core duo processor which it
wasn't<00:01:55.280> even<00:01:55.369> 64-bit<00:01:56.360> don't<00:01:56.750> like<00:01:56.869> it<00:01:57.020> only

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
wasn't even 64-bit don't like it only

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.620 
wasn't even 64-bit don't like it only
install<00:01:57.710> 32-bit<00:01:58.610> windows<00:01:58.939> on<00:01:59.119> this<00:01:59.270> computer

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
install 32-bit windows on this computer

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.649 
install 32-bit windows on this computer
I<00:01:59.990> mean<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.039> still<00:02:01.310> runs<00:02:01.640> really<00:02:02.030> well<00:02:02.209> with

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
I mean it still runs really well with

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.660 
I mean it still runs really well with
the<00:02:02.780> language<00:02:03.110> but<00:02:03.289> it<00:02:03.409> ran<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:04.520> this

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
the language but it ran and this

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.779 
the language but it ran and this
computer<00:02:05.060> came<00:02:05.840> with<00:02:05.990> Windows<00:02:06.319> 7<00:02:06.590> 64<00:02:06.979> but<00:02:07.579> it's

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
computer came with Windows 7 64 but it's

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.680 
computer came with Windows 7 64 but it's
a<00:02:07.939> 64-bit<00:02:08.690> operating<00:02:09.280> computer<00:02:10.280> has<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.360> core

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
a 64-bit operating computer has a core

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.449 
a 64-bit operating computer has a core
i3<00:02:13.090> 350m<00:02:14.090> first-generation<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:17.829> you<00:02:18.829> know<00:02:18.950> of

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
i3 350m first-generation and you know of

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.130 
i3 350m first-generation and you know of
course<00:02:20.000> they're<00:02:20.209> gonna<00:02:20.360> be<00:02:20.569> differences

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
course they're gonna be differences

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.930 
course they're gonna be differences
within<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.560> operating<00:02:21.980> system<00:02:22.519> but<00:02:22.730> which

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
within the operating system but which

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.350 
within the operating system but which
one<00:02:23.180> can<00:02:23.769> perform<00:02:24.769> better<00:02:24.950> because<00:02:25.360> obviously

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
one can perform better because obviously

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.199 
one can perform better because obviously
with<00:02:26.930> 6<00:02:27.170> gigabytes<00:02:27.530> of<00:02:27.709> RAM<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.220> being<00:02:28.400> 64-bit

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
with 6 gigabytes of RAM and being 64-bit

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.059 
with 6 gigabytes of RAM and being 64-bit
it's<00:02:29.420> going<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.750> multitask<00:02:30.349> better<00:02:30.739> but<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
it's going to multitask better but the

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.740 
it's going to multitask better but the
thing<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:31.340> is<00:02:31.819> that<00:02:33.760> being<00:02:34.760> able<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.150> use<00:02:35.450> this

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
thing is is that being able to use this

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.430 
thing is is that being able to use this
operating<00:02:36.319> system<00:02:37.690> on<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.780> six-year-old

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
operating system on a six-year-old

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.259 
operating system on a six-year-old
computer<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.130> how<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.310> perform<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:41.000> well

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
computer and how to perform this well

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.970 
computer and how to perform this well
and<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.600> actually<00:02:41.750> started<00:02:42.290> up<00:02:42.470> at<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.739> same

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
and it actually started up at the same

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.160 
and it actually started up at the same
speed<00:02:43.400> as<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.269> newer<00:02:44.660> one

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
speed as the newer one

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.840 
speed as the newer one
it's<00:02:45.739> actually<00:02:46.100> really<00:02:46.639> incredible<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:48.850> you

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
it's actually really incredible and you

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.590 
it's actually really incredible and you
know<00:02:50.000> people<00:02:51.670> need<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.819> stop<00:02:53.030> dot<00:02:53.299> there

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
know people need to stop dot there

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.449 
know people need to stop dot there
they're<00:02:53.900> gonna<00:02:54.019> have<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.350> stop<00:02:54.560> dogging<00:02:55.069> it<00:02:55.190> so

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
they're gonna have to stop dogging it so

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.599 
they're gonna have to stop dogging it so
much<00:02:56.049> because<00:02:57.049> it's<00:02:57.500> actually<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.920> quite<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.340> bit

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
much because it's actually a quite a bit

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.539 
much because it's actually a quite a bit
quite<00:02:58.940> an<00:02:59.060> accomplishment<00:02:59.829> for<00:03:00.829> Microsoft<00:03:01.400> to

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
quite an accomplishment for Microsoft to

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.009 
quite an accomplishment for Microsoft to
basically<00:03:02.510> start<00:03:02.900> on<00:03:03.160> an<00:03:04.569> operating<00:03:05.569> system

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
basically start on an operating system

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.870 
basically start on an operating system
designed<00:03:06.380> for<00:03:06.500> phones<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.220> tablets<00:03:07.670> and

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
designed for phones and tablets and

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.420 
designed for phones and tablets and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.490 

it's<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:13.880> just<00:03:14.120> works<00:03:14.810> better<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.880> know

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
it's just it just works better you know

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.839 
it's just it just works better you know
there's<00:03:18.500> such<00:03:18.799> an<00:03:18.950> there's<00:03:19.310> such<00:03:19.489> a<00:03:19.519> battle

over smartphone markets on how to
utilize<00:03:21.889> the<00:03:23.470> smaller<00:03:24.470> hardware<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.639> get<00:03:25.880> a

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
utilize the smaller hardware and get a

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.229 
utilize the smaller hardware and get a
great<00:03:26.269> performance<00:03:26.840> out<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.200> it's<00:03:27.470> it's

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
great performance out of it it's it's

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.629 
great performance out of it it's it's
kind<00:03:29.239> of<00:03:29.450> teaching<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.769> larger<00:03:31.280> software

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
kind of teaching the larger software

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.960 
kind of teaching the larger software
companies<00:03:32.269> how<00:03:32.480> to<00:03:33.190> incorporate<00:03:34.190> this<00:03:34.760> do

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
companies how to incorporate this do

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.390 
companies how to incorporate this do
these<00:03:35.209> design<00:03:36.549> architectures<00:03:37.549> into<00:03:38.140> larger

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
these design architectures into larger

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.130 
these design architectures into larger
machines<00:03:40.400> like<00:03:40.700> laptops<00:03:41.239> and<00:03:41.450> desktops<00:03:41.870> so

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
machines like laptops and desktops so

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.210 
machines like laptops and desktops so
what<00:03:42.319> you'll<00:03:42.439> be<00:03:42.620> seeing<00:03:42.829> is

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
what you'll be seeing is

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.190 
what you'll be seeing is
lighter-weight<00:03:43.760> operating<00:03:44.540> systems<00:03:44.960> and

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
lighter-weight operating systems and

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.570 
lighter-weight operating systems and
like<00:03:45.970> just<00:03:46.970> an<00:03:47.150> example

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.800 

the<00:03:52.580> UI's<00:03:53.620> on<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:54.830> operating<00:03:55.280> system<00:03:55.810> run

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
the UI's on this operating system run

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.080 
the UI's on this operating system run
kind<00:03:57.110> of<00:03:57.230> like<00:03:57.380> opaque<00:03:57.830> graphics<00:03:58.400> as<00:03:58.640> compared

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
kind of like opaque graphics as compared

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.770 
kind of like opaque graphics as compared
to<00:03:59.330> like<00:03:59.600> windows<00:03:59.990> 7<00:04:00.440> which<00:04:01.130> had<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:04.660> with<00:04:05.660> the

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
to like windows 7 which had the with the

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.260 
to like windows 7 which had the with the
arrow<00:04:05.990> style<00:04:06.500> like<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.340> fake<00:04:07.550> glass<00:04:07.880> you<00:04:08.150> know

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
arrow style like the fake glass you know

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.120 
arrow style like the fake glass you know
that<00:04:08.600> runs<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:08.960> lot<00:04:09.080> of<00:04:09.200> memory<00:04:09.500> it<00:04:09.650> takes<00:04:09.890> up<00:04:10.040> a

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
that runs a lot of memory it takes up a

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.610 
that runs a lot of memory it takes up a
lot<00:04:10.250> of<00:04:10.280> resources<00:04:10.550> so<00:04:11.300> kind<00:04:12.140> of<00:04:12.200> going<00:04:12.380> to

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
lot of resources so kind of going to

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.449 
lot of resources so kind of going to
this<00:04:12.820> newer<00:04:13.820> style

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
this newer style

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.759 
this newer style
it<00:04:16.459> really<00:04:16.790> makes<00:04:17.150> quite<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:17.930> big<00:04:18.200> a<00:04:18.230> difference

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
it really makes quite a big a difference

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:26.470 
it really makes quite a big a difference
an<00:04:19.070> impact<00:04:20.030> on<00:04:20.239> performance<00:04:25.090> I'm<00:04:26.090> not<00:04:26.360> really

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
an impact on performance I'm not really

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.540 
an impact on performance I'm not really
too<00:04:26.750> sure<00:04:27.100> we're<00:04:28.100> to<00:04:28.220> continue<00:04:28.340> this<00:04:28.880> but<00:04:30.550> you

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
too sure we're to continue this but you

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.610 
too sure we're to continue this but you
can<00:04:31.700> see<00:04:31.940> that<00:04:32.150> basically<00:04:32.510> the<00:04:32.960> fluidity<00:04:33.470> of

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
can see that basically the fluidity of

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.060 
can see that basically the fluidity of
the<00:04:33.860> operating<00:04:34.310> system<00:04:34.880> is<00:04:35.120> pretty<00:04:35.630> cool<00:04:36.070> it's

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
the operating system is pretty cool it's

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.210 
the operating system is pretty cool it's
pretty<00:04:37.160> well<00:04:37.730> thought<00:04:38.060> out<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:39.560> even<00:04:39.920> on<00:04:40.040> this

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
pretty well thought out and even on this

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:51.810 
pretty well thought out and even on this
older<00:04:40.820> laptop<00:04:44.410> it<00:04:45.410> runs<00:04:46.070> quite<00:04:46.310> well<00:04:46.580> and<00:04:46.850> I

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.030 

would<00:04:52.820> do<00:04:53.060> a<00:04:53.090> benchmark<00:04:53.510> for<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.050> guys<00:04:54.260> on<00:04:54.620> on

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
would do a benchmark for you guys on on

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.150 
would do a benchmark for you guys on on
both<00:04:55.250> PC<00:04:55.790> side<00:04:56.150> by<00:04:56.360> side<00:04:56.660> to<00:04:57.650> show<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:57.890> how<00:04:58.100> the

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
both PC side by side to show you how the

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.620 
both PC side by side to show you how the
browser's<00:04:58.669> work<00:05:00.490> but<00:05:01.490> it<00:05:01.640> takes<00:05:01.850> like<00:05:02.090> five<00:05:02.419> to

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
browser's work but it takes like five to

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.860 
browser's work but it takes like five to
ten<00:05:02.840> minutes<00:05:03.230> so<00:05:03.440> it's<00:05:03.890> not<00:05:04.010> really<00:05:04.340> worth<00:05:04.550> it

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
ten minutes so it's not really worth it

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.350 
ten minutes so it's not really worth it
I'm<00:05:05.870> gonna<00:05:06.080> go<00:05:06.290> ahead<00:05:06.410> and<00:05:07.000> post<00:05:08.000> this<00:05:08.180> video
