that you can do a dumbbell row and none
of<00:00:21.310> them<00:00:21.520> are<00:00:22.140> necessarily<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.290> right<00:00:23.560> or

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
are different factors into making the

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.050 
are different factors into making the
dumbbell<00:00:28.270> row<00:00:28.480> such<00:00:29.290> as<00:00:29.669> what<00:00:30.669> angle<00:00:30.910> your

dumbbell row such as what angle your
back<00:00:31.210> is<00:00:31.419> to<00:00:31.630> the<00:00:31.720> ground<00:00:31.930> some<00:00:32.590> people<00:00:32.829> who

back is to the ground some people who

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.860 
back is to the ground some people who
dumbbell<00:00:33.220> rows<00:00:33.400> standing<00:00:33.880> like<00:00:33.970> this<00:00:34.000> some

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
dumbbell rows standing like this some

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.780 
dumbbell rows standing like this some
people<00:00:35.170> do<00:00:35.350> them<00:00:35.560> bent<00:00:35.890> over<00:00:36.070> like<00:00:36.310> this<00:00:36.550> and

people do them bent over like this and
some<00:00:37.450> people<00:00:37.750> do<00:00:37.900> them<00:00:38.079> pretty<00:00:38.440> much

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
some people do them pretty much

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.520 
some people do them pretty much
horizontal<00:00:39.750> or<00:00:40.750> parallel<00:00:41.140> to<00:00:41.200> the<00:00:41.350> ground

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
horizontal or parallel to the ground

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.790 
horizontal or parallel to the ground
like<00:00:41.739> this<00:00:42.210> now<00:00:43.210> things<00:00:44.109> to<00:00:44.260> consider<00:00:44.620> is<00:00:44.770> that

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
like this now things to consider is that

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.670 
like this now things to consider is that
the<00:00:45.579> more<00:00:45.789> upright<00:00:46.180> you<00:00:46.420> are<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.989> less<00:00:47.199> range

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
the more upright you are the less range

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.160 
the more upright you are the less range
of<00:00:47.829> motion<00:00:48.250> you<00:00:48.280> pretty<00:00:48.879> much<00:00:49.030> have<00:00:49.329> and<00:00:49.570> the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
of motion you pretty much have and the

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.720 
of motion you pretty much have and the
more<00:00:50.379> horizontal<00:00:51.070> or<00:00:51.219> parallel<00:00:51.579> to<00:00:51.640> the

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
more horizontal or parallel to the

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.369 
more horizontal or parallel to the
ground<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.120> are<00:00:52.269> the<00:00:52.719> greater<00:00:53.019> range<00:00:53.230> of

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
ground you are the greater range of

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.049 
ground you are the greater range of
motion<00:00:53.559> that<00:00:53.890> your<00:00:54.039> elbow<00:00:54.579> is<00:00:54.609> going<00:00:54.760> to<00:00:54.910> have

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
motion that your elbow is going to have

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.299 
motion that your elbow is going to have
from<00:00:55.269> here<00:00:55.570> to<00:00:55.929> here<00:00:56.170> as<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.590> can<00:00:56.710> see<00:00:56.890> the

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
from here to here as you can see the

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.040 
from here to here as you can see the
greater<00:00:57.670> distance<00:00:58.239> you'll<00:00:58.390> be<00:00:58.480> able<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:58.780> pull

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
greater distance you'll be able to pull

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.500 
greater distance you'll be able to pull
it<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.710> more<00:00:59.739> horizontal<00:01:00.579> you<00:01:00.699> are<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.239> next

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
it the more horizontal you are the next

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.240 
it the more horizontal you are the next
thing<00:01:01.660> to<00:01:01.780> consider<00:01:01.960> is<00:01:02.379> where<00:01:02.769> you're<00:01:03.039> rowing

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
thing to consider is where you're rowing

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.640 
thing to consider is where you're rowing
in<00:01:03.879> terms<00:01:04.180> of<00:01:04.330> your<00:01:04.449> elbow<00:01:04.839> now<00:01:05.350> you<00:01:05.440> can<00:01:05.590> do

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
in terms of your elbow now you can do

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.440 
in terms of your elbow now you can do
rows<00:01:05.860> like<00:01:06.070> this<00:01:06.400> say<00:01:06.670> I'm<00:01:06.790> bent<00:01:06.970> over<00:01:07.180> doing

part of the back a little higher lats
upper<00:01:17.650> back<00:01:17.799> still<00:01:18.159> now<00:01:19.030> if<00:01:19.119> I<00:01:19.180> pull<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.420> right

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
upper back still now if I pull it right

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.109 
upper back still now if I pull it right
here<00:01:20.049> I'll<00:01:20.320> be<00:01:20.680> hitting<00:01:20.979> really<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.610> lats<00:01:21.820> and

here I'll be hitting really the lats and
if<00:01:22.689> I<00:01:22.780> pull<00:01:23.020> lower<00:01:23.259> hitting<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.159> lats<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:24.579> the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
if I pull lower hitting the lats and the

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.730 
if I pull lower hitting the lats and the
lower<00:01:24.790> last<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:26.170> last<00:01:26.290> thing<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.649> consider

lower last the last thing to consider
when<00:01:27.520> you're<00:01:27.640> doing<00:01:27.820> your<00:01:27.850> rows<00:01:28.119> is<00:01:28.420> which

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
when you're doing your rows is which

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.100 
when you're doing your rows is which
direction<00:01:29.590> you're<00:01:30.130> pulling<00:01:30.670> it<00:01:30.820> right<00:01:31.149> so<00:01:31.780> I

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
direction you're pulling it right so I

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.410 
direction you're pulling it right so I
may<00:01:32.409> be<00:01:32.470> pulling<00:01:32.799> it<00:01:32.950> this<00:01:33.130> way<00:01:33.549> I<00:01:33.790> may<00:01:34.360> be

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
may be pulling it this way I may be

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.389 
may be pulling it this way I may be
pulling<00:01:34.689> it<00:01:34.840> that<00:01:35.079> way<00:01:35.290> may<00:01:35.860> be<00:01:35.920> pulling<00:01:36.220> it

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
pulling it that way may be pulling it

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.130 
pulling it that way may be pulling it
really<00:01:36.909> far<00:01:37.149> this<00:01:37.360> way<00:01:37.600> so<00:01:37.659> I<00:01:37.869> could<00:01:37.990> pull<00:01:38.110> it

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
really far this way so I could pull it

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.590 
really far this way so I could pull it
here<00:01:38.469> like<00:01:38.680> this<00:01:38.890> I<00:01:39.189> could<00:01:40.000> pull<00:01:40.149> it<00:01:40.180> here<00:01:40.450> like

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
here like this I could pull it here like

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.859 
here like this I could pull it here like
this

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
this

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.920 
this
or<00:01:41.590> I<00:01:41.619> could<00:01:41.740> pull<00:01:41.920> it<00:01:42.009> back<00:01:42.189> here<00:01:42.520> like<00:01:42.700> this

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
or I could pull it back here like this

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.990 
or I could pull it back here like this
so<00:01:43.930> that's<00:01:44.079> the<00:01:44.350> other<00:01:44.560> variable<00:01:45.219> it's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
so that's the other variable it's

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.510 
so that's the other variable it's
honestly<00:01:46.509> up<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.259> how<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.130> want<00:01:48.460> to

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
honestly up to you how you want to

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.920 
honestly up to you how you want to
combine<00:01:48.700> those<00:01:48.969> variables<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.540> do<00:01:49.780> your

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
combine those variables and do your

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.420 
combine those variables and do your
dumbbell<00:01:50.229> row<00:01:50.380> now<00:01:50.829> let's<00:01:50.979> talk<00:01:51.100> about<00:01:51.250> the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
dumbbell row now let's talk about the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.620 
dumbbell row now let's talk about the
main<00:01:51.610> principles<00:01:52.149> that<00:01:52.329> you're<00:01:52.450> going<00:01:52.600> to

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
main principles that you're going to

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.020 
main principles that you're going to
hold<00:01:52.810> constant<00:01:53.200> no<00:01:53.890> matter<00:01:54.130> how<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:54.520> dumbbell

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
hold constant no matter how you dumbbell

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.179 
hold constant no matter how you dumbbell
row<00:01:55.270> first<00:01:55.750> things<00:01:56.049> first<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.619> it's<00:01:56.740> pretty

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
row first things first and it's pretty

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.160 
row first things first and it's pretty
common<00:01:57.969> to<00:01:58.180> hear<00:01:58.450> this<00:01:58.630> is<00:01:58.840> that<00:01:58.990> you're<00:01:59.079> gonna

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
common to hear this is that you're gonna

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.630 
common to hear this is that you're gonna
want<00:01:59.380> to<00:01:59.409> feel<00:01:59.560> like<00:01:59.680> you're<00:01:59.799> pulling<00:01:59.979> it<00:02:00.189> from

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
want to feel like you're pulling it from

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.880 
want to feel like you're pulling it from
the<00:02:00.789> elbow<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:01.360> not<00:02:01.479> necessarily<00:02:02.140> from<00:02:02.560> your

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
the elbow and not necessarily from your

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.950 
the elbow and not necessarily from your
hands<00:02:03.460> because<00:02:04.299> when<00:02:04.450> you're<00:02:04.570> pulling<00:02:04.869> with

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
hands because when you're pulling with

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.840 
hands because when you're pulling with
your<00:02:05.110> hands<00:02:05.619> you're<00:02:06.130> probably<00:02:06.460> going<00:02:06.729> to<00:02:06.789> be

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
your hands you're probably going to be

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.300 
your hands you're probably going to be
pulling<00:02:07.149> a<00:02:07.420> lot<00:02:07.659> with<00:02:07.840> their<00:02:08.020> biceps<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:08.860> a

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
pulling a lot with their biceps and a

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.830 
pulling a lot with their biceps and a
little<00:02:09.490> bit<00:02:09.610> less<00:02:09.729> with<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:10.000> back<00:02:10.210> so<00:02:10.600> if<00:02:10.720> you

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
little bit less with the back so if you

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.080 
little bit less with the back so if you
kind<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.310> mentally<00:02:12.310> visualize<00:02:12.490> it<00:02:12.970> you're

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
kind of mentally visualize it you're

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.310 
kind of mentally visualize it you're
pulling<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.420> with<00:02:13.450> your<00:02:13.630> lap<00:02:13.810> muscles<00:02:14.170> with

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
pulling it with your lap muscles with

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.170 
pulling it with your lap muscles with
your<00:02:14.440> back<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:15.280> might<00:02:15.400> be<00:02:15.550> able<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.700> take<00:02:15.910> some

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
your back you might be able to take some

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.850 
your back you might be able to take some
of<00:02:16.210> that<00:02:16.300> off<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.630> biceps<00:02:17.110> really<00:02:17.650> feel<00:02:17.830> like

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
especially if the goal is hitting your

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.339 
especially if the goal is hitting your
laughs<00:02:36.069> growing<00:02:36.640> your<00:02:36.760> lats<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.239> your<00:02:37.349> hands

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
that's not to say that you should always

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.580 
that's not to say that you should always
use<00:02:42.430> straps<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.239> definitely<00:02:43.840> recommend<00:02:44.080> doing

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
use straps I definitely recommend doing

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.680 
use straps I definitely recommend doing
quite<00:02:45.069> a<00:02:45.129> bit<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.430> work<00:02:45.580> without<00:02:45.970> them<00:02:46.209> so<00:02:46.599> you

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
quite a bit of work without them so you

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.000 
quite a bit of work without them so you
could<00:02:46.840> build<00:02:47.019> up<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.379> grip<00:02:47.560> strength<00:02:47.590> so

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
could build up that grip strength so

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.250 
could build up that grip strength so
that<00:02:48.159> you<00:02:48.250> can<00:02:48.670> do<00:02:49.360> dumbbell<00:02:49.599> rows<00:02:49.959> or

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
that you can do dumbbell rows or

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.440 
that you can do dumbbell rows or
deadlifts<00:02:50.890> or<00:02:51.129> whatever<00:02:51.640> exercises<00:02:52.269> without

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
deadlifts or whatever exercises without

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.570 
deadlifts or whatever exercises without
having<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.900> use<00:02:53.050> straps<00:02:53.349> now<00:02:53.920> we<00:02:53.980> all<00:02:54.250> hear
