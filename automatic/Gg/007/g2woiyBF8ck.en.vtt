bit about the software and features so

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.160 
bit about the software and features so
in<00:00:41.760> front<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> 7-inch<00:00:42.719> display<00:00:42.750> there

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
in front you have a 7-inch display there

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.560 
in front you have a 7-inch display there
are<00:00:43.260> no<00:00:43.440> touch<00:00:43.680> buttons<00:00:44.040> or<00:00:44.550> physical<00:00:45.270> buttons

are no touch buttons or physical buttons

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.830 
are no touch buttons or physical buttons
on<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.079> front<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:47.160> patterns<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> android

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
on the front the patterns of the android

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.470 
on the front the patterns of the android
are<00:00:49.020> integrated<00:00:49.920> inside<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.030> user<00:00:51.239> interface

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
are integrated inside the user interface

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.450 
are integrated inside the user interface
only<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.140> at<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> bottom<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> screen<00:00:53.070> you

only so at the bottom of the screen you
get<00:00:53.640> these<00:00:53.789> buttons<00:00:54.980> on<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.190> side<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
get these buttons on the side you have a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.389 
get these buttons on the side you have a
power<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.170> wake<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.500> key<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> volume<00:00:59.219> rocker

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
power of wake up key and a volume rocker

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.180 
power of wake up key and a volume rocker
here<00:00:59.760> there<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> panel<00:01:00.570> which<00:01:00.750> comes<00:01:01.020> out

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
here there is a panel which comes out

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.380 
here there is a panel which comes out
although<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.460> slightly<00:01:02.609> tricky<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.239> take

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
although it is slightly tricky to take

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.420 
although it is slightly tricky to take
it<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:04.140> when<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.559> open<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.189> get

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
it out but when you open it you get

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.399 
it out but when you open it you get
access<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> sim<00:01:06.540> card<00:01:06.570> as<00:01:06.960> well<00:01:07.020> as<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
access to the sim card as well as the
