long time how does he get that good

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.560 
long time how does he get that good
sound<00:00:16.260> quality<00:00:16.470> because<00:00:17.160> he<00:00:17.400> saw<00:00:17.730> his<00:00:18.300> voice

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
sound quality because he saw his voice

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.260 
sound quality because he saw his voice
is<00:00:18.869> pretty<00:00:19.320> much<00:00:19.560> crystal<00:00:20.070> clear<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:21.150> I've

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
is pretty much crystal clear so I've

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.880 
is pretty much crystal clear so I've
sent<00:00:21.480> him<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.630> message<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.289> seen<00:00:22.529> what<00:00:22.650> kind

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
sent him a message and I seen what kind

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.910 
sent him a message and I seen what kind
of<00:00:23.039> microphone<00:00:23.730> uses<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.769> apparently<00:00:25.769> it's

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
of microphone uses and apparently it's

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.560 
of microphone uses and apparently it's
not<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> microphone<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.820> makes<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
not the microphone that makes the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.529 
not the microphone that makes the
perfect<00:00:27.840> audio<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.590> actually<00:00:29.330> something<00:00:30.330> he

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
perfect audio it's actually something he

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.139 
perfect audio it's actually something he
does<00:00:30.720> that's<00:00:30.929> called<00:00:31.430> post<00:00:32.430> processing<00:00:33.620> and

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
does that's called post processing and

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.700 
does that's called post processing and
it's<00:00:36.149> basically<00:00:36.390> when<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.780> add<00:00:37.140> certain

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
it's basically when you add certain

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.110 
it's basically when you add certain
effects<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.270> audio<00:00:39.629> when<00:00:41.000> when<00:00:42.000> you're

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
effects to the audio when when you're

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.229

better<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:10.560> things<00:01:10.740> I've<00:01:10.920> done<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.400> I've

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
better the things I've done is that I've

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.370 
better the things I've done is that I've
equalised<00:01:12.540> my<00:01:12.659> voice<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.909> my<00:01:14.909> SS<00:01:15.380> for

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
equalised my voice so that my SS for

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.899 
equalised my voice so that my SS for
example<00:01:16.830> doesn't<00:01:17.360> sound<00:01:18.360> us<00:01:18.570> sharp<00:01:19.820> I've<00:01:20.820> also

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
example doesn't sound us sharp I've also

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.520 
example doesn't sound us sharp I've also
done<00:01:23.909> some<00:01:23.970> noise<00:01:24.540> reduction<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.200> when<00:01:25.409> I'm

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
done some noise reduction so when I'm

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.960 
done some noise reduction so when I'm
sound<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.159> probably<00:01:26.340> not<00:01:26.610> hear<00:01:26.820> my

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
sound you can probably not hear my

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.859 
sound you can probably not hear my
computer<00:01:27.450> which<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> very<00:01:28.320> good<00:01:28.470> thing<00:01:29.869> you
