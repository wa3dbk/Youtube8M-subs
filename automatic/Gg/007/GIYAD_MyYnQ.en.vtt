crafting recipe and just one little

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.189 
crafting recipe and just one little
thought<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.420> thought<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> mod<00:00:51.930> critter

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
thought that I thought the mod critter

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.360 
thought that I thought the mod critter
could<00:00:52.350> improve<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:53.010> see<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
could improve on you can see that it

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.709 
could improve on you can see that it
looks<00:00:53.399> like<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.670> feather<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.210> don't<00:00:54.629> really

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
looks like a feather I don't really

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.060 
looks like a feather I don't really
think<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.140> should<00:00:55.289> look<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.620> feather<00:00:55.890> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
think it should look like a feather it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.889 
think it should look like a feather it
should<00:00:56.219> look<00:00:56.340> something<00:00:56.399> more<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.000> go<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.360> so

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
should look something more like go in so

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.510 
should look something more like go in so
that's<00:00:58.109> kind<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.590> little<00:00:58.859> little<00:00:59.250> something

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
that's kind of a little little something

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.979 
that's kind of a little little something
I<00:00:59.609> thought<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.940> there<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.510> right<00:01:00.660> here<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:00.960> have

in<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> intro<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:30.090> going<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.270> take<00:01:30.360> us<00:01:30.479> right

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
in the intro it's going to take us right

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.270 
in the intro it's going to take us right
over<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.350> very<00:01:31.530> very<00:01:31.590> nifty<00:01:31.979> mod

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
over here so it's a very very nifty mod

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.770 
over here so it's a very very nifty mod
nice<00:01:32.549> little<00:01:32.820> way<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.970> get<00:01:33.150> around<00:01:33.240> other<00:01:33.630> than

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
nice little way to get around other than

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.990 
nice little way to get around other than
using<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.259> your<00:01:35.189> traditional<00:01:35.700> your

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
using a your traditional your

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.120 
using a your traditional your
traditional<00:01:36.450> mine<00:01:36.659> cards<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.680> that's<00:01:37.890> pretty

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
traditional mine cards so that's pretty

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.920 
traditional mine cards so that's pretty
much<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.549> very<00:01:38.880> very<00:01:39.150> small<00:01:39.299> mod<00:01:39.750> but

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
much it a very very small mod but

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.289 
much it a very very small mod but
nevertheless<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.560> quite<00:01:41.490> nifty<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:42.060> get<00:01:42.210> in

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
nevertheless is quite nifty to get in

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.670 
nevertheless is quite nifty to get in
around<00:01:42.360> your<00:01:42.659> world<00:01:42.869> especially<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.560> do

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
around your world especially if you do

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.710 
around your world especially if you do
have<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.159> those<00:01:44.250> very<00:01:44.490> big<00:01:44.790> minecraft

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
have one of those very big minecraft

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.780 
have one of those very big minecraft
worlds<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.320> believe<00:01:46.890> there<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.759> a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
worlds and I do believe there is a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.999 
worlds and I do believe there is a
bukkit<00:01:48.360> plugin<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.680> isn't<00:01:49.979> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
bukkit plugin for this it's this isn't a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.560 
bukkit plugin for this it's this isn't a
bukkit<00:01:50.280> plugin<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> somewhat

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
bukkit plugin but there is a somewhat

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.030 
bukkit plugin but there is a somewhat
similar<00:01:51.899> bukkit<00:01:52.200> plugin<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.740> those<00:01:52.920> you

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
similar bukkit plugin so if those you

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.010 
similar bukkit plugin so if those you
guys<00:01:53.159> who<00:01:53.310> own<00:01:53.520> servers<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.689> should<00:01:54.869> look

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
guys who own servers you should look

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.510 
guys who own servers you should look
into<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.409> because<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:55.920> you're<00:01:56.070> interested

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
into this because if you're interested

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.920 
into this because if you're interested
there<00:01:56.700> should<00:01:56.939> be<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> bukkit<00:01:57.570> plugin

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
there should be a bukkit plugin

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.480 
there should be a bukkit plugin
somewhere<00:01:58.320> around<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.890> somewhat<00:01:59.189> similar

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
somewhere around it is somewhat similar

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.969 
somewhere around it is somewhat similar
to<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.329> yeah<00:02:00.540> very<00:02:00.810> very<00:02:00.960> cool<00:02:01.229> mod<00:02:01.439> but
