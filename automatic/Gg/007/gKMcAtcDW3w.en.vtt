all the iphone 5 rumors basically it's

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.700 
all the iphone 5 rumors basically it's
going<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.730> have<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.879> better<00:00:06.120> camera<00:00:06.560> it's<00:00:07.560> gonna

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
going to have a better camera it's gonna

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.950 
going to have a better camera it's gonna
have<00:00:07.980> just<00:00:08.970> twenty<00:00:09.240> percent<00:00:09.510> chance<00:00:09.719> we'll

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
have just twenty percent chance we'll

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.049 
have just twenty percent chance we'll
have<00:00:10.110> no<00:00:10.769> home<00:00:11.040> button<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.490> highly<00:00:11.849> doubt<00:00:12.000> that

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
have no home button I highly doubt that

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.379 
have no home button I highly doubt that
though<00:00:12.480> um<00:00:12.750> it'll<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> four-inch<00:00:14.759> screen

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
though um it'll have a four-inch screen

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.710 
though um it'll have a four-inch screen
I<00:00:16.100> probably<00:00:17.100> like<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.789> hope<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:18.570> going

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
I probably like I hope that it's going

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.150 
I probably like I hope that it's going
to<00:00:18.779> happen<00:00:18.869> it'll<00:00:19.500> have<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> better<00:00:19.920> resolution

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
to happen it'll have a better resolution

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.429 
to happen it'll have a better resolution
so<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.000> sync<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.539> retina<00:00:21.869> display<00:00:22.170> will<00:00:22.320> be

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
so in sync so retina display will be

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.950 
so in sync so retina display will be
tweaked<00:00:22.710> up<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.070> be<00:00:23.160> better<00:00:23.840> it'll<00:00:24.840> have<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
tweaked up to be better it'll have the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.009 
tweaked up to be better it'll have the
same<00:00:25.289> design<00:00:25.680> as<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.000> previous<00:00:27.000> iphone<00:00:27.720> 4

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
same design as the previous iphone 4

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.849 
same design as the previous iphone 4
iphone<00:00:28.289> 4<00:00:29.279> design<00:00:29.880> will<00:00:30.060> stay<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.390> same

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
iphone 4 design will stay the same

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.020 
iphone 4 design will stay the same
there's<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.920> forty<00:00:32.160> percent<00:00:32.430> chance<00:00:32.669> I'll<00:00:32.880> have

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
there's a forty percent chance I'll have

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.819 
there's a forty percent chance I'll have
a<00:00:33.059> new<00:00:33.270> design<00:00:33.600> there's<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> hundred<00:00:34.739> percent

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
a new design there's a hundred percent

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.709 
a new design there's a hundred percent
chance<00:00:35.250> we'll<00:00:35.460> have<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.610> white<00:00:35.880> model<00:00:36.360> that

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
chance we'll have a white model that

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.299 
chance we'll have a white model that
being<00:00:36.989> said<00:00:37.260> because<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.590> ipad<00:00:37.950> has<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.100> white

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
being said because the ipad has a white

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.930 
being said because the ipad has a white
model<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.850> physical<00:00:39.629> keyboard<00:00:39.890> 0%<00:00:40.890> 64<00:00:41.550> gigabyte

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
model a physical keyboard 0% 64 gigabyte

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.540 
model a physical keyboard 0% 64 gigabyte
models<00:00:42.300> fifty<00:00:42.600> percent<00:00:42.960> full<00:00:43.590> HD<00:00:44.040> recording

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
models fifty percent full HD recording

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.639 
models fifty percent full HD recording
so<00:00:44.700> that's<00:00:44.879> 1080p<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.570> thirty<00:00:45.960> percent<00:00:46.350> and

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
so that's 1080p is thirty percent and

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.790 
so that's 1080p is thirty percent and
low-cost<00:00:47.550> more<00:00:47.940> models<00:00:48.450> thirty<00:00:48.750> percent<00:00:49.079> also

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
low-cost more models thirty percent also

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.529 
low-cost more models thirty percent also
to<00:00:49.860> tuning<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> full<00:00:50.789> HD<00:00:50.969> video

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
to tuning with the full HD video

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.240 
to tuning with the full HD video
recording<00:00:51.930> thing<00:00:52.170> i<00:00:52.320> do<00:00:52.590> think<00:00:52.980> they're<00:00:53.129> going

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
recording thing i do think they're going

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.420 
recording thing i do think they're going
to<00:00:53.309> add<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.730> fulton<00:00:54.300> APM<00:00:55.160> support<00:00:56.160> because

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
to add on fulton APM support because

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.250 
to add on fulton APM support because
since<00:00:57.270> sony<00:00:57.539> did<00:00:57.809> say<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.109> they're

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
since sony did say that they're

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.470 
since sony did say that they're
supplying<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.800> cameras<00:00:59.250> i<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.760> assume<00:01:00.300> that

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
supplying the cameras i do assume that

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.590 
supplying the cameras i do assume that
they<00:01:00.629> would<00:01:00.809> include<00:01:01.440> them<00:01:01.680> full<00:01:02.609> HD<00:01:03.270> video

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
they would include them full HD video

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.479 
they would include them full HD video
recording<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.650> anyways<00:01:04.949> there's<00:01:05.189> going<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> be

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
recording so anyways there's going to be

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.560 
recording so anyways there's going to be
no<00:01:05.760> more<00:01:05.970> storage<00:01:06.420> which<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.170> um<00:01:08.390> we<00:01:09.390> call

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
no more storage which is like um we call

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.620 
no more storage which is like um we call
it<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.720> more<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.260> cloud-based<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.450> kind<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it a more on cloud-based so it's kind of

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.770 
it a more on cloud-based so it's kind of
a<00:01:12.720> 3d<00:01:13.110> display<00:01:13.470> ten<00:01:13.799> percent<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.820> think<00:01:15.119> 0%

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
a 3d display ten percent and I think 0%

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.480 
a 3d display ten percent and I think 0%
it<00:01:16.229> will<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> better<00:01:16.650> battery<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.310> ten

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
it will have a better battery so ten

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.999 
it will have a better battery so ten
twenty<00:01:17.790> percent<00:01:18.060> accurate<00:01:18.630> see<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.740> will<00:01:19.890> have
