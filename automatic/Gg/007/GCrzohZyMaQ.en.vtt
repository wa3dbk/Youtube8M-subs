 family your home situation is anyway 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.680
 important 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.550
 most important thing is i think i can 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.379
 myself are at home yes but I think then 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.239
 also be themselves and 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.090

 something eyelashes 20 it's number six years 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.450
 for example, search engine 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.879
 hanging kids 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.530
 yes so you can call that little bit what 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.680
 swing before the end 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.510
 what just a little bit hang 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.800
 to little puberty before you believe in 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.570
 for destinations 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.439
 yes premise wants it has been awarded to you 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.390
 yes but I have done it myself I get 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.710
 or are still done it twenty years 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.299
 is already a brüno who did that 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.869
 has 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.570
 yes finally I put it 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.259
 just my own steps being but 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.020
 to have 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.450
 you also read it to people and 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.260
 yes it is up to me what I do with it 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.790
 mean actually 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.850
 and finally I take the 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.920
 steps, and I decide but 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.840
 in the end 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.970
 You believe the year that someone is 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.060
 otherwise or something above sith or so that occurring 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.360
 with brother have to go this way 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.460
 yes i believe that whatever day 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.970
 has been mapped out for me 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.970
 we're here to 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.320
 in the end we all leave 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.280
 you football can happen anything and everything 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.399
 also moves with 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.280
 with development I have in the first f 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.440
 15 games played second year 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.080
 I think some 29s becomes 0 okay 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.819
 yes it is me a third year and yes 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.050
 it went very quickly but me 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:12.640
 I always had the confidence because I yes 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.370
 Yes I knew that it was self-confidence 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.800
 that I could bring this 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.500
 and yes now it comes out 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.130
 I know a lot of people in it too 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.790
 I believed important people and every one 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.190
 many 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.380
 so many people don't if you become now 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.000
 stared then you pay attention too 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.850
 honestly not her 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.260
 really no 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.000
 be careful with what they all do 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.250
 your such weather 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.370

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.500
 so for myself that of gaal but koeman 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.859
 also directly Joëlle 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.329
 yes it is still nice that you can be four 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:57.040

00:02:52.329 --> 00:03:00.940
 yes yes anyway so how do you do that over me 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.410

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.620
 I about changing how we looked yes 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.640
 maybe it is a separate man 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.980
 is a human 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.700
 and a very good trainer and am full 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.590
 very happy and 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.939
 that he has given more chance not to 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.129
 to be allowed to play over and under him and 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:28.700
 for the Netherlands 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.930
 well coming is sometimes max 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.900
 yes it is easier than stayed 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.450
 of course and more importantly 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.400
 just yes at the moment that less goes 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.400
 it just so not too far back from 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.340
 that you perform your duties, yes your duties 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.680
 continue to perform you have with 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.030
 Koeman also spoke or who left back 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.310
 I actually feel you prefer 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.290
 central as in the long run and yes me 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.659
 I have him I have him with koeman 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.250
 talked about my position on being 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.950
 that patience 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.180
 yes they killed and hurt the harbinger 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:05.269
 as if from the farmer 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.819
 growing group too and yes they are 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:12.889

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:15.049
 Dutch football and the European so yes 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.250
 if you go with that little bit 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.409
 compared 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.909
 in terms of position that had killed them too 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:23.840
 then I can only be proud of that 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:28.190

 center of play and after now it can 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.760
