00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.000
Ok then, this Rhodes sound...

00:00:03.426 --> 00:00:04.535
Sounds great, doesn't it?

00:00:07.631 --> 00:00:08.800
Ok, actually,

00:00:09.093 --> 00:00:10.210
how is the sound made?

00:00:10.525 --> 00:00:12.250
Camera, can you close up on this here?

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.250
Here we have Pre-amp, 

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:14.730
Modulation Effect,

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:15.710
and Power Amp.

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:18.095
these parameters determine the sound.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.145
For example,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.140
within the Pre-amp menu,

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.400
there are parameters for Hammer,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.800
which can be set to soft or hard, etc.

00:00:29.108 --> 00:00:30.500
Or under Modulation Effect,

00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:34.000
you can choose Chorus, etc.

00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:40.425
The naming is very interesting!

00:00:41.095 --> 00:00:42.940
This one, called Max 100,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.590
is a model of the MXR Phase 100.

00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:48.470
Max90 = MXR Phase 90.

00:00:50.415 --> 00:00:53.405
Small Phaser = Small Stone Phaser.

00:00:53.736 --> 00:00:55.445
A perfect match for a Rhodes!

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.690
Richard T...

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:01.740
used the Small Stone Phaser.

00:01:01.993 --> 00:01:02.690
Pre-amp, Mod FX...

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.250
Last, we have Power Amp.

00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:06.986
You can use a variety of things

00:01:07.313 --> 00:01:09.000
like compressors, and there's also

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.390
a 'Clean' setting. Or settings

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.000
that emulate the real amps

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.620
that were in the Electric Pianos.

00:01:15.511 --> 00:01:17.915
Having this many settings to play with

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:19.920
is, in itself, a very good thing.

00:01:20.588 --> 00:01:21.250
So... 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.690
the fundamental structure,

00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:25.880
Pre-amp, Modulation Effect, Power Amp,

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.005
and of course there's reverb as well.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.790
In all, there are 17 kinds of piano

00:01:31.088 --> 00:01:32.700
and electric piano sounds,

00:01:33.046 --> 00:01:36.000
but there are loads of other sounds too.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.030
In fact, there is a total of 

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:42.500
305 sounds inside.

00:01:42.826 --> 00:01:43.450
Clavinet, for example...

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.620
Organ...

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.325
Guitar...

00:02:00.093 --> 00:02:00.700
Bass...

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:06.865
Pads...

00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:09.990
Strings...

00:02:12.743 --> 00:02:13.590
Synth sounds...

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.690
Brass...

00:02:22.126 --> 00:02:22.950
Woodwinds...

00:02:28.226 --> 00:02:31.030
A bassoon. 305 sounds!

00:02:31.328 --> 00:02:34.385
305, and 17 piano/electric piano sounds.

00:02:34.648 --> 00:02:36.648
It's almighty, having so many sounds,

00:02:36.993 --> 00:02:38.993
and that is a big feature 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.790
of the CP-5.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.785
Also,

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.700
over in this section,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.130
you can put sounds together

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.410
in various ways to build a performance.

00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:50.435
For example...

00:02:50.898 --> 00:02:52.700
you can take a piano and a Rhodes...

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.365
and layer them like this, or...

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.800
a piano and a DX sound...

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:04.230
or something interesting like this...

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.900
Bass

00:03:17.275 --> 00:03:19.600
This kind of thing, good for performing.

00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:21.915
It's nice to have a rhythm section too.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.860
At least I think so.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.730
What else do we have here?

00:03:46.995 --> 00:03:49.945
Very good for actually performing!

00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:51.630
You can also connect a microphone,

00:03:51.918 --> 00:03:54.905
or USB memory to the USB port,

00:03:55.215 --> 00:03:57.270
record your own performances,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.005
or play back memory-resident audio files,

00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:03.575
and play along on the keyboard.

00:04:03.855 --> 00:04:05.100
There's an EQ also.

00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:08.965
It's easy to play, has high-quality sound,

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.300
The CP-5 truly fulfills all the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.925
requirements to be a great stage piano.

00:04:17.338 --> 00:04:19.055
The Yamaha CP-5!
