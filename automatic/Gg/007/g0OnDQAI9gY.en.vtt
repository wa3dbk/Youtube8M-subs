00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.430 
fast-paced combat it would just feel a
lot<00:02:51.329> more<00:02:51.510> fluid<00:02:51.690> when<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:51.989> was<00:02:52.109> playing<00:02:52.349> the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
lot more fluid when I was playing the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.140 
lot more fluid when I was playing the
demo<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:53.069> was<00:02:53.099> running<00:02:53.400> probably<00:02:53.760> at<00:02:53.970> around

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
demo it was running probably at around

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.140 
demo it was running probably at around
23<00:02:54.599> to<00:02:54.930> 25<00:02:55.319> frames<00:02:55.530> per<00:02:55.829> second<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.280> bet<00:02:56.910> that

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
23 to 25 frames per second I bet that

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.759 
23 to 25 frames per second I bet that
they're<00:02:57.299> gonna<00:02:57.420> get<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.750> up<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.989> 30<00:02:58.290> but<00:02:58.590> no

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
they're gonna get it up to 30 but no

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.229 
they're gonna get it up to 30 but no
more<00:02:58.980> than<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.310> by<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.549> time<00:02:59.819> of<00:02:59.970> release

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
more than that by the time of release

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.150 
more than that by the time of release
and<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.870> just<00:03:01.079> don't<00:03:01.200> think<00:03:01.319> 30<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.769> enough<00:03:02.010> for

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
and I just don't think 30 is enough for

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.770 
and I just don't think 30 is enough for
a<00:03:02.220> lot<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.519> people<00:03:02.700> I'm<00:03:02.819> sure<00:03:02.849> with<00:03:03.299> people

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
a lot of people I'm sure with people

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.180 
a lot of people I'm sure with people
