mute well off pretty much so all the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.660 
mute well off pretty much so all the
child<00:00:43.260> does<00:00:43.470> is<00:00:43.710> they<00:00:43.860> go<00:00:44.040> through<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.640> they

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
child does is they go through and they
