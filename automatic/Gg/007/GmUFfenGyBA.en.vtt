fourth string that's a good blue second
it's<00:02:25.590> not<00:02:25.650> really<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:25.950> selective<00:02:26.610> about

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
it's not really that selective about

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.870 
it's not really that selective about
what<00:02:27.000> chords<00:02:27.420> go<00:02:27.630> with<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:29.160> four<00:02:29.580> chord

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
what chords go with it the four chord

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:39.290 
what chords go with it the four chord
goes<00:02:30.030> with<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.330> too<00:02:32.569> and<00:02:37.940> then<00:02:38.940> they<00:02:39.120> can<00:02:39.269> use

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
goes with it too and then they can use

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:47.830 
goes with it too and then they can use
it<00:02:39.480> up<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:39.660> five<00:02:39.870> chord

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.900 

so<00:02:48.650> it's<00:02:48.770> a<00:02:48.830> cool<00:02:48.980> lake<00:02:49.220> blues<00:02:49.459> licks<00:02:49.700> aren't

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
so it's a cool lake blues licks aren't

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.370 
so it's a cool lake blues licks aren't
that<00:02:50.000> selective<00:02:50.510> about<00:02:50.690> what<00:02:50.840> they<00:02:50.989> go<00:02:51.110> over

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
that selective about what they go over

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.630 
that selective about what they go over
and<00:02:54.380> obviously<00:02:54.739> if<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:54.920> want<00:02:55.069> to<00:02:55.130> move<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.459> to

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
and obviously if you want to move it to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.059 
and obviously if you want to move it to
another<00:02:55.880> key<00:02:56.420> just<00:02:56.840> move<00:02:57.260> everything<00:02:57.500> up<00:02:57.709> the

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
another key just move everything up the

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.949 
another key just move everything up the
equal<00:02:58.340> number<00:02:58.370> of<00:02:58.610> frets<00:02:58.849> to<00:02:59.090> change<00:02:59.750> your

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
equal number of frets to change your

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.720 
equal number of frets to change your
making<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:01.400> there's<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.700> free<00:03:02.060> one<00:03:02.239> right<00:03:02.450> there
