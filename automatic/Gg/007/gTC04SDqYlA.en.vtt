00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.359
 it's good that you're still with us 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.670
 we are almost ready to finish the 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.490
 delicious homemade granola that we are 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.349
 inviting you to prepare at home and 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.990
 that the truth that once you try 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.610
 this variety you do not buy again 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.980
 none of those that are achieved in the 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.369
 market or in supermarkets as it does not 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.829
 they have the quality of a great wave that 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.720
 also has no additives and does not 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.759
 also has no conservator 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.950
 that is very important for the 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.410
 family we already have here all the 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.840
 combined ingredients was extremely 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.510
 simple nothing else we combine all the 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.420
 fruits all the seeds with the 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.609
 Oat flakes add 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.760
 also what were the nines the 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:49.370
 almonds the peanuts combined everything 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.859
 very well and on the other hand it was combined what 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.920
 which is the honey the vegetable oil or 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:57.230
 sunflower oil and vanilla this is 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.569
 we add it over we combine it 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.089
 very well in a bowl helping us with a 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:04.760
 spatula then we put it in a 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.100
 Tray previously greased or with 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.430
 silicone mat we are going to spread 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.650
 very 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.260
 and we're going to take it to bake a 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.560
 temperature of 180 degrees centigrade 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.270
 around 35 to 40 minutes very 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.620
 important that you put your little clock 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.420
 kitchen every 10 minutes you have to take it out 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.700
 move it perfectly well with a 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.410
 wooden spoon or with a spatula of 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.990
 silicone suitable for high 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.740
 temperatures it is important to move it very 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.410
 well so that everything is in a golden 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.110
 this similar and also that everything is left 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.090
 well crunchy and do not run the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.520
 danger that you're going to stick or you 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.259
 I will burn you on the one hand this I 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.830
 I'm going to remove this one thing already 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.830
 we have ready 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.190
 that you're going to do every 10 minutes until 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.860
 Have this one that I already have 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.350
 advanced that we already have if you 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.119
 fixed you can listen I do not know if you can 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.090
 hear the noise a little more 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.860
 crispy and this is the golden tone 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.739
 what are we looking for if you realize 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.470
 around here the coconut is perfectly 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:15.100
 golden brown and crunchy should have a 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.930
 little brown coffee that is not very dark 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.280
 this is very important that you take care of 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.140
 so that it will not happen to you once 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.959
 that you already have this, let it cool in the 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.780
 tray and once it's cold we can 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.900
 finish the last part of the granola 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.930
 is to add what the fruits are in this 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.760
 I'm going to add raisins 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.170
 you can also add if you're 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.900
 outside it also gives a very 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.020
 Special I'll add blueberries 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.240
 dehydrated 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.520
 if you have any doubt where 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.090
 get some of these fruits or 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.600
 where to get I do not know the germ of 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.730
 wheat the bran the fruits something that 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.440
 I'll make it difficult to just call in 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.630
 the phone remembers 82 66 1936 and with 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.490
 very much, I'm going to tell you in 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.050

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.450
 of ingredients and also where the 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.790
 You can buy at a better price than your 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.830
 also very important to transmit it by 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.370
 here we are going to add blueberries or 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.500
 dehydrated cranberries this gives you a 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.230
 very special touch and if you notice 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.230
 I am taking advantage of all 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.720
 ingredients I usually all 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.200

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.420

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.930
 and I always have all this 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.030
 kind of ingredients and the granola is a 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.730
 excellent way to use them

 place in airtight vials or what 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.709

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.269
 label where I put homemade granola 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.970

 where you can keep it and 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.450
 after it's finished your granola goes 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.580
 to be able to also use it for 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.310
 vanilla sugar for flour 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.390

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.270
 I'm going to fill in here 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.789
 let's add a little more in this 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.490
 because I also want you to know that 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:59.120

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.360
 the final texture of my granola right now 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.219
 I'm going to accommodate it very well over here 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.800
 I want to remove this bowl cited that we 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:10.880
 It covers a lot of space to put it 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:13.430
 here for a little bit this is my big wave 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.160

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.400
 I'm going to use this here to 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.280
 serve it with delicious natural yogurt 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.400
 which I'm going to add here 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.380
 pieces of peach in syrup and we're going to 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.330
 add a little green touch with 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.910
 a few leaves of mint or spearmint 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.320
