00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
this is a thermaltake v9 very nice case

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.660 
this is a thermaltake v9 very nice case
but<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.619> only<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.800> couple<00:00:19.920> years<00:00:20.070> old<00:00:20.369> but

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
two and a half inch drive this is

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.720 
two and a half inch drive this is
basically<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.320> notebook<00:00:25.560> hard<00:00:25.920> drive<00:00:26.130> size<00:00:26.400> I

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
basically a notebook hard drive size I

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.450 
basically a notebook hard drive size I
imagine<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.510> newest<00:00:27.810> cases<00:00:28.410> probably<00:00:29.310> do

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
imagine the newest cases probably do

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.800 
imagine the newest cases probably do
because<00:00:29.880> these<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.269> gotten<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> be<00:00:30.779> so

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
because these have gotten to be so

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.250 
because these have gotten to be so
popular<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:32.180> your<00:00:33.180> choices<00:00:33.390> are<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.140> can

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
popular but your choices are you can

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.740 
popular but your choices are you can
just<00:00:34.410> take<00:00:34.590> some<00:00:34.980> some<00:00:35.820> double-sided<00:00:36.570> velcro

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
just take some some double-sided velcro

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.560 
just take some some double-sided velcro
you<00:00:37.440> can<00:00:37.590> put<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:39.000> stick<00:00:39.450> it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
you can put it on here stick it

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.299 
you can put it on here stick it
somewhere<00:00:39.840> inside<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.590> case<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:40.800> slap<00:00:41.280> it

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
somewhere inside the case just slap it

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.610 
somewhere inside the case just slap it
on<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:41.790> attach<00:00:42.510> your<00:00:42.719> cables<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.379> that'll

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
on there attach your cables and that'll

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.080 
on there attach your cables and that'll
be<00:00:43.710> fine<00:00:43.920> there<00:00:44.129> are<00:00:44.250> no<00:00:44.370> moving<00:00:44.550> parts<00:00:44.670> in

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
be fine there are no moving parts in

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.220 
be fine there are no moving parts in
this<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.390> probably<00:00:45.629> good<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.110> where

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
this it's probably good to have it where

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.950 
this it's probably good to have it where
get<00:00:46.410> some<00:00:46.590> air<00:00:46.739> flow<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.250> other<00:00:47.399> than<00:00:47.489> that

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
get some air flow but other than that

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.479 
get some air flow but other than that
it's<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.289> not<00:00:49.469> real<00:00:49.680> vital<00:00:49.890> where<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.340> goes

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
it's it's not real vital where it goes

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.529 
it's it's not real vital where it goes

the adapter screwed in back in here so
the<00:01:51.360> last<00:01:51.509> thing<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.810> do<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:51.960> connect<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the last thing to do is connect the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.319 
the last thing to do is connect the
cables<00:01:52.860> which<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:53.880> careful<00:01:54.240> with

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
cables which have to be careful with

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.969 
cables which have to be careful with
this<00:01:54.540> well<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.079> pretty<00:01:55.320> standard<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
this well this is pretty standard the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.800 
this well this is pretty standard the
power<00:01:56.130> cable<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.820> data<00:01:57.030> cable<00:01:57.210> however<00:01:57.659> there

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
power cable the data cable however there

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.630 
power cable the data cable however there
are<00:01:57.869> two<00:01:57.930> things<00:01:57.960> consider<00:01:58.649> one<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.219> for<00:01:59.520> this

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
are two things consider one is for this

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.719 
are two things consider one is for this
drive<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.000> run<00:02:00.479> at<00:02:00.659> its<00:02:00.810> maximum<00:02:01.350> speed<00:02:01.729> you

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
drive to run at its maximum speed you

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.609 
drive to run at its maximum speed you
have<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.149> connect<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.840> cable<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
have to connect this cable on the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.760 
have to connect this cable on the
motherboard<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> six<00:02:06.719> gigabit<00:02:07.170> per<00:02:07.350> second

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
motherboard to a six gigabit per second

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.550 
motherboard to a six gigabit per second
SATA<00:02:08.099> connection<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.690> may<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:10.110> all<00:02:10.440> of

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
SATA connection you may have all of

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.700 
SATA connection you may have all of
those<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.890> may<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.190> half<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
those you may have half of the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.650 
those you may have half of the
you<00:02:11.860> may<00:02:11.980> not<00:02:12.070> have<00:02:12.250> any<00:02:12.400> of<00:02:12.580> those<00:02:12.700> but<00:02:13.090> if<00:02:13.450> you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
you may not have any of those but if you

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.030 
you may not have any of those but if you
have<00:02:13.810> them<00:02:13.960> you<00:02:14.170> want<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.500> use<00:02:14.620> one<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:14.860> those

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
have them you want to use one of those

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.190 
have them you want to use one of those
so<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.670> drive<00:02:15.880> can<00:02:16.240> run<00:02:16.690> as<00:02:16.810> fast<00:02:16.990> as

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
so that the drive can run as fast as

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.780 
so that the drive can run as fast as
possible<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:18.220> other<00:02:18.340> thing<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.580> have<00:02:18.670> to

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
possible the other thing you have to

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.340 
possible the other thing you have to
consider<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.540> they<00:02:19.630> head<00:02:19.750> out<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.870> problems

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
consider and they head out of problems

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.650 
consider and they head out of problems
with<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:20.740> with<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.130> vertex<00:02:21.580> 3<00:02:21.970> s's<00:02:22.360> people

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
with this with the vertex 3 s's people

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.770 
with this with the vertex 3 s's people
were<00:02:22.750> using<00:02:22.990> cables<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:24.640> weren't<00:02:24.940> rated<00:02:25.330> to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
were using cables that weren't rated to

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.080 
were using cables that weren't rated to
run<00:02:25.810> at<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.770> speed<00:02:27.220> let<00:02:27.550> me<00:02:27.640> zoom<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:28.060> here

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
run at that speed let me zoom in here

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.200 
run at that speed let me zoom in here
and<00:02:28.420> show<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:29.310> all<00:02:30.310> right<00:02:30.580> there<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:30.940> can<00:02:31.180> see

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
and show you all right there you can see

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.470 
and show you all right there you can see
on<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.540> cable<00:02:31.690> SATA<00:02:32.280> 6<00:02:33.280> gigabit<00:02:33.850> per<00:02:34.060> second

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
on the cable SATA 6 gigabit per second

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.720 
on the cable SATA 6 gigabit per second
so<00:02:35.110> if<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.470> cable<00:02:35.650> is<00:02:35.800> rated<00:02:36.100> for<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.430> you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
so if the cable is rated for that you

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.610 
so if the cable is rated for that you
should<00:02:36.970> be<00:02:37.120> good<00:02:37.360> for<00:02:37.420> using<00:02:37.990> it<00:02:38.110> with<00:02:38.440> this

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
should be good for using it with this

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.930 
should be good for using it with this
new<00:02:38.800> Drive<00:02:39.040> ok<00:02:40.680> it's<00:02:41.680> time<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.190> plug<00:02:42.820> the

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
new Drive ok it's time to plug the

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.830 
new Drive ok it's time to plug the
cables<00:02:43.360> in<00:02:43.950> start<00:02:44.950> up<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.280> system<00:02:45.730> let's<00:02:46.540> see

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
cables in start up the system let's see

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.600 
cables in start up the system let's see
how<00:02:46.960> long<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.260> takes<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.560> install<00:02:47.710> windows<00:02:47.950> 7

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
how long it takes to install windows 7

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.450 
how long it takes to install windows 7
and<00:02:48.760> windows<00:02:48.850> 8
