00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
favorite audio mod ever so how about

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.149 
favorite audio mod ever so how about
that<00:01:45.390> eye<00:01:45.570> scanner<00:01:46.170> well<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.530> mean<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.860> works

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
that eye scanner well I mean it works

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.789 
that eye scanner well I mean it works
sort<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.149> basically<00:01:48.930> from<00:01:49.049> what<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> understand

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
sort of basically from what I understand

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.679 
sort of basically from what I understand
and<00:01:50.040> uses<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> front<00:01:50.790> facing<00:01:51.240> camera<00:01:51.659> to

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
and uses the front facing camera to

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.319 
and uses the front facing camera to
analyze<00:01:52.290> your<00:01:52.470> eyes<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.920> greyscale<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.149> yes

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
analyze your eyes and greyscale so yes

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.359 
analyze your eyes and greyscale so yes
it<00:01:54.509> does<00:01:54.689> work<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.740> need<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.310> a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
it does work but you need to be in a

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.399 
it does work but you need to be in a
well-lit<00:01:56.850> area<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.509> hold<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.810> phone<00:01:57.990> really

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
well-lit area and hold the phone really

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.200 
well-lit area and hold the phone really
really<00:01:58.710> close<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.189> your<00:01:59.310> face<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.790> keep<00:02:00.030> it

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
really close to your face and keep it

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.149 
really close to your face and keep it
there<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:00.390> several<00:02:00.930> seconds<00:02:01.530> all<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.950> while

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
there for several seconds all the while

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.609 
there for several seconds all the while
looking<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> complete<00:02:03.540> nob<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.530> other

looking like a complete nob so in other
words<00:02:04.829> yes<00:02:05.310> it's<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.729> gimmick<00:02:05.969> now<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.329> overall

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
fifteen percent so big thumbs up - ooh

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.190 
fifteen percent so big thumbs up - ooh
me<00:02:47.840> there

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
me there

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.110 
me there
and<00:02:48.470> finally<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:48.860> rear<00:02:49.010> 13<00:02:49.489> megapixel<00:02:50.090> camera

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
and finally the rear 13 megapixel camera

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.479 
and finally the rear 13 megapixel camera
isn't<00:02:50.570> really<00:02:50.959> too<00:02:51.140> impressive<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:52.160> is

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
isn't really too impressive it is

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.210 
isn't really too impressive it is
another<00:02:52.850> sony<00:02:53.239> iMac<00:02:53.720> 214<00:02:54.380> so<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.739> performs<00:02:55.100> how

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
another sony iMac 214 so it performs how

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.430 
another sony iMac 214 so it performs how
you<00:02:55.280> probably<00:02:55.700> expect<00:02:56.269> with<00:02:56.480> exposure<00:02:57.170> being

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
you probably expect with exposure being

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.740 
you probably expect with exposure being
harder<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:57.980> lock<00:02:58.160> down<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.910> softer<00:02:59.330> focus

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
harder to lock down and a softer focus

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.509 
harder to lock down and a softer focus
than<00:02:59.930> we'd<00:03:00.080> like<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.769> it<00:03:00.890> also<00:03:01.040> has<00:03:01.310> this

weird<00:03:01.819> slight<00:03:02.239> yellow<00:03:02.569> tint<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:02.989> gives

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
weird slight yellow tint it gives

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.290 
weird slight yellow tint it gives

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.240
