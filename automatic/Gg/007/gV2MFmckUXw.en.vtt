00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
to do when this building was designed

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.960 
to do when this building was designed
was<00:04:08.379> to<00:04:08.530> create<00:04:08.680> spaces<00:04:09.220> in<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:09.549> building

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
was to create spaces in the building

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.360 
was to create spaces in the building
semi<00:04:10.750> public<00:04:10.989> and<00:04:11.349> public<00:04:11.620> spaces<00:04:11.799> where<00:04:12.190> that

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.740 
semi public and public spaces where that
could<00:04:12.549> happen<00:04:12.730> so<00:04:13.360> alcoves<00:04:13.959> in<00:04:14.110> the<00:04:14.260> corridors

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750

that it is being not only

to issues of sustainability the fact

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.529 
to issues of sustainability the fact
that<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.979> university<00:05:03.460> is<00:05:03.550> able<00:05:03.820> to<00:05:03.940> build<00:05:04.210> a
