00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
just increase the speed here little bit

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:41.420 
just increase the speed here little bit

this engine is fully equipped Gluba cab
just<00:02:34.880> pop<00:02:35.090> inside<00:02:35.420> there<00:02:35.930> we<00:02:36.050> go<00:02:36.260> there's<00:02:36.680> the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
just pop inside there we go there's the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.170 
just pop inside there we go there's the
cab<00:02:37.510> fully<00:02:38.510> drivable<00:02:39.550> if<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:40.790> wish<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.120> do<00:02:41.270> so

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
cab fully drivable if you wish to do so

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.699 
cab fully drivable if you wish to do so
in<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.390> cab<00:02:44.630> will<00:02:44.900> now<00:02:45.020> have<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.230> frame<00:02:45.500> rate

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
in the cab will now have a frame rate

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.100 
in the cab will now have a frame rate
off<00:02:45.890> 26<00:02:46.730> frames<00:02:47.209> per<00:02:47.510> second

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:03:21.840 

that's<00:02:51.680> fairly<00:02:51.980> good<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.460> an<00:02:52.640> i5<00:02:53.510> 760<00:02:54.820> computer

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.150

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.420 

so<00:03:34.640> that's<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:35.530> 1947

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
so that's the 1947
