00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
first gateway oh and hey guys when I say

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.010 
first gateway oh and hey guys when I say
a<00:01:04.049> number<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.650> at<00:01:05.159> nine<00:01:05.580> or<00:01:05.909> at<00:01:06.000> twelve<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
a number like at nine or at twelve that

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.890 
a number like at nine or at twelve that
means<00:01:07.229> your<00:01:07.710> supply<00:01:08.070> count<00:01:08.340> which<00:01:08.610> up<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
means your supply count which up on the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.600 
means your supply count which up on the
right<00:01:10.080> there<00:01:10.350> next<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.860> pylon<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
right there next to that pylon it's the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:22.160 
right there next to that pylon it's the
number<00:01:11.820> i<00:01:11.850> left

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.120 

and<00:01:23.170> then<00:01:23.290> at<00:01:23.560> 13<00:01:24.070> a<00:01:24.460> simulator<00:01:25.060> comes<00:01:25.420> down<00:01:26.130> he

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
and then at 13 a simulator comes down he

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.030 
and then at 13 a simulator comes down he
said<00:01:27.310> a<00:01:27.369> simulator<00:01:27.729> comes<00:01:28.060> down<00:01:28.500> there<00:01:29.500> you<00:01:29.619> go

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.539 

and<00:01:34.290> at<00:01:35.290> 16<00:01:35.590> we're<00:01:35.890> gonna<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.159> get<00:01:36.310> another

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
and at 16 we're gonna to get another

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.920 
and at 16 we're gonna to get another
pile<00:01:36.790> on<00:01:36.940> but<00:01:37.030> more<00:01:37.210> importantly<00:01:37.570> as<00:01:37.690> soon<00:01:37.840> as

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
pile on but more importantly as soon as

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.260 
pile on but more importantly as soon as
this<00:01:38.020> gateway<00:01:38.320> finishes<00:01:38.860> building<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:40.119> are

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
this gateway finishes building we are

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:56.450 
this gateway finishes building we are
going<00:01:40.509> to<00:01:40.600> be<00:01:40.720> getting<00:01:41.049> a<00:01:43.440> cybernetics<00:01:44.440> core

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.969 

so<00:01:57.460> we're<00:01:57.580> at<00:01:57.670> 16<00:01:58.149> now<00:01:58.649> throwing<00:01:59.649> down<00:01:59.860> our

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
so we're at 16 now throwing down our

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.550 
so we're at 16 now throwing down our
cyber<00:02:00.390> about<00:02:01.390> immediately<00:02:01.929> by<00:02:02.050> our<00:02:02.200> pile<00:02:02.380> on

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
cyber about immediately by our pile on

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.070 
cyber about immediately by our pile on
now<00:02:03.190> we're<00:02:03.340> at<00:02:03.399> 17<00:02:03.789> supply<00:02:04.030> little<00:02:04.840> late<00:02:04.960> on

now we're at 17 supply little late on

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.390 
now we're at 17 supply little late on
the<00:02:05.200> pylon<00:02:05.560> that's<00:02:05.860> okay<00:02:07.170> we'll<00:02:08.170> work<00:02:08.319> with<00:02:08.380> it

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.949

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
I think you want to send out a probe I'm

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.490 
I think you want to send out a probe I'm
not<00:02:30.300> even<00:02:30.570> going<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.780> stout<00:02:31.170> we<00:02:31.830> just<00:02:32.040> got<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.250> a

not even going to stout we just got a a

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.320 
not even going to stout we just got a a

cybernetics core comes out in a seek a

cybernetics core comes out in a seek a
proxy<00:03:10.830> pylon<00:03:10.980> up<00:03:11.430> over<00:03:11.670> here

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.990 

we're<00:03:33.560> gonna<00:03:33.650> use<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:33.980> stalker<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.580> discard

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
we're gonna use the stalker to discard

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:46.500 
we're gonna use the stalker to discard
the<00:03:35.270> ramp<00:03:35.510> here<00:03:37.570> and

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.860 

gonna<00:03:47.510> hope<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.750> our<00:03:49.240> gateways<00:03:50.240> are<00:03:50.450> in<00:03:50.660> by

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
gonna hope that our gateways are in by

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.780 
gonna hope that our gateways are in by
the<00:03:50.930> time<00:03:51.260> our<00:03:53.740> gateway<00:03:54.740> tech<00:03:55.010> finishes<00:03:55.550> it

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
the time our gateway tech finishes it

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.980 
the time our gateway tech finishes it
looks<00:03:56.030> like<00:03:56.150> I'm<00:03:56.270> gonna<00:03:56.360> be<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:56.570> little<00:03:56.750> bit

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
looks like I'm gonna be a little bit

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.390 
looks like I'm gonna be a little bit
behind<00:03:57.110> I<00:03:57.470> should<00:03:57.650> have<00:03:57.740> got<00:03:57.860> that<00:03:58.010> gateway<00:03:58.250> a

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
behind I should have got that gateway a

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:08.860 
behind I should have got that gateway a
little<00:03:58.610> earlier<00:03:59.350> that<00:04:00.350> last<00:04:00.560> gate<00:04:00.770> way<00:04:07.870> you

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
little earlier that last gate way you

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.410 
little earlier that last gate way you
are<00:04:09.050> and<00:04:09.380> time<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:10.010> start<00:04:10.250> morphing<00:04:10.880> them<00:04:11.090> into

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
are and time to start morphing them into

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.120 
are and time to start morphing them into
gateways<00:04:13.420> thrown<00:04:14.420> down<00:04:14.600> those<00:04:14.870> two<00:04:15.230> this

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
gateways thrown down those two this

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.640 
gateways thrown down those two this
one's<00:04:16.370> gonna<00:04:16.519> open<00:04:16.880> up<00:04:17.230> that<00:04:18.230> one's<00:04:18.440> almost

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
one's gonna open up that one's almost

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.280 
one's gonna open up that one's almost
done<00:04:19.010> so<00:04:19.250> not<00:04:19.430> too<00:04:19.700> far<00:04:19.910> behind<00:04:20.030> on<00:04:20.359> that<00:04:20.540> one

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.620 

and<00:04:24.830> once<00:04:25.070> they<00:04:25.250> open<00:04:25.280> up<00:04:25.670> like<00:04:25.880> that<00:04:25.940> we<00:04:26.480> can

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
and once they open up like that we can

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.430 
and once they open up like that we can
start<00:04:26.870> throwing<00:04:27.230> these<00:04:27.380> down<00:04:29.320> getting<00:04:30.320> our

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
start throwing these down getting our

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:50.170 
start throwing these down getting our
army<00:04:30.800> built<00:04:31.010> up<00:04:48.520> and<00:04:49.520> of<00:04:49.730> course<00:04:49.940> if<00:04:50.090> you're

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
army built up and of course if you're

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.610 
army built up and of course if you're
playing<00:04:50.420> a<00:04:50.570> real<00:04:50.780> player<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:51.320> not<00:04:51.410> a<00:04:51.440> computer

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
playing a real player and not a computer

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.170 
playing a real player and not a computer
you<00:04:52.040> should<00:04:52.070> have<00:04:52.280> probably<00:04:52.430> scouted<00:04:52.970> to<00:04:53.030> see

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
you should have probably scouted to see

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.480 
you should have probably scouted to see
what<00:04:53.300> they're<00:04:53.420> building<00:04:54.160> see<00:04:55.160> if<00:04:55.190> this<00:04:55.370> is

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
what they're building see if this is

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.800 
what they're building see if this is
going<00:04:55.610> to<00:04:55.670> work<00:04:55.880> but<00:04:56.180> this<00:04:56.450> is<00:04:56.600> just<00:04:56.660> a

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
going to work but this is just a

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.620 
going to work but this is just a
computer<00:04:57.940> so<00:04:58.940> it's<00:04:59.060> not<00:04:59.180> really<00:04:59.240> going<00:04:59.540> to

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
computer so it's not really going to

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.330 
computer so it's not really going to
matter<00:04:59.830> plonk<00:05:00.830> plonk<00:05:01.070> plonk<00:05:01.370> goes<00:05:01.640> my<00:05:01.820> army

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
matter plonk plonk plonk goes my army

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.490 
matter plonk plonk plonk goes my army
and<00:05:04.540> we're<00:05:05.540> moving<00:05:05.660> out

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.850 

had<00:05:11.460> force<00:05:11.850> field<00:05:12.120> by<00:05:12.360> me<00:05:12.540> but<00:05:13.500> it<00:05:13.620> looks<00:05:13.800> like

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
had force field by me but it looks like

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.840 
had force field by me but it looks like
we're<00:05:14.070> still<00:05:14.280> gonna<00:05:14.430> maybe<00:05:15.120> one<00:05:16.490> let<00:05:17.490> me<00:05:17.520> get

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
we're still gonna maybe one let me get

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:24.760 
we're still gonna maybe one let me get
some<00:05:18.060> more<00:05:18.210> guys<00:05:18.360> here<00:05:21.440> and<00:05:22.440> yeah<00:05:22.590> we<00:05:23.070> got<00:05:23.220> them

here we come up oh man it's got heart is

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:37.580 
here we come up oh man it's got heart is
already

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:44.580

bringing in the reinforcements clunk
clunk<00:05:44.770> clunk<00:05:46.920> more<00:05:47.920> units<00:05:48.340> come<00:05:48.580> in<00:05:49.200> drip

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
clunk clunk more units come in drip

00:05:50.200 --> 00:06:23.390 
clunk clunk more units come in drip
these<00:05:50.380> guys<00:05:50.590> up<00:05:50.830> together<00:05:50.980> and<00:05:53.640> let's<00:05:54.640> go

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:30.250 

you

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.160 

and<00:06:30.830> that's<00:06:31.610> how<00:06:31.700> you<00:06:31.820> run<00:06:32.120> a<00:06:32.180> pro<00:06:32.690> dose<00:06:32.870> for

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
and that's how you run a pro dose for

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.600 
and that's how you run a pro dose for
gate<00:06:34.510> I'm<00:06:35.510> pretty<00:06:35.780> smoothly<00:06:36.220> like<00:06:37.220> I<00:06:37.310> said<00:06:37.370> you

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
gate I'm pretty smoothly like I said you

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.770 
gate I'm pretty smoothly like I said you
want<00:06:37.790> to<00:06:37.820> make<00:06:37.970> sure<00:06:38.000> and<00:06:38.120> get<00:06:38.330> that<00:06:38.480> gateway

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
want to make sure and get that gateway

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.510 
want to make sure and get that gateway
that<00:06:39.410> fourth<00:06:39.710> gateway<00:06:40.040> up<00:06:40.130> as<00:06:40.250> soon<00:06:40.370> as

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
that fourth gateway up as soon as

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.490 
that fourth gateway up as soon as
possible<00:06:40.940> because<00:06:41.120> ideally<00:06:41.870> you<00:06:42.110> really<00:06:42.320> want

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
possible because ideally you really want

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.970 
possible because ideally you really want
to<00:06:42.560> have<00:06:42.680> all<00:06:42.890> your<00:06:42.920> gateways<00:06:43.370> going<00:06:43.670> at<00:06:43.790> once

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:44.980 
to have all your gateways going at once

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.970 
to have all your gateways going at once
and<00:06:46.090> yeah<00:06:47.090> be<00:06:47.930> careful<00:06:48.080> using<00:06:48.410> this<00:06:48.590> against

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:48.980 
and yeah be careful using this against

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.200 
and yeah be careful using this against
tarun<00:06:49.280> players<00:06:49.520> they're<00:06:49.820> going<00:06:49.940> to<00:06:50.000> wall<00:06:50.180> off

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
tarun players they're going to wall off

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.990 
tarun players they're going to wall off
and<00:06:50.800> make<00:06:51.800> it<00:06:51.950> very<00:06:52.190> difficult<00:06:52.400> for<00:06:52.730> you<00:06:52.940> to

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
and make it very difficult for you to

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.180 
and make it very difficult for you to
pull<00:06:53.540> this<00:06:53.660> 48<00:06:54.080> nonsense<00:06:54.560> I<00:06:54.770> know<00:06:54.830> on<00:06:55.100> the

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190 
pull this 48 nonsense I know on the

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.840 
pull this 48 nonsense I know on the
Terran<00:06:55.460> player<00:06:56.890> against<00:06:57.890> other<00:06:58.370> Protoss

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:58.850 
Terran player against other Protoss

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.480 
Terran player against other Protoss
players<00:06:59.150> who<00:06:59.660> are<00:06:59.780> going<00:07:00.050> Mickey<00:07:00.380> Robo<00:07:00.770> and

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
players who are going Mickey Robo and

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.550 
players who are going Mickey Robo and
don't<00:07:01.850> have<00:07:02.030> that<00:07:02.210> fat<00:07:02.720> tight<00:07:03.050> wall<00:07:03.230> off<00:07:03.380> with

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560 
don't have that fat tight wall off with

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.950 
don't have that fat tight wall off with
there's<00:07:03.710> a<00:07:03.860> lot<00:07:04.040> of<00:07:04.190> blocking<00:07:04.640> and<00:07:05.210> against

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
there's a lot of blocking and against
