00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.500
 Dear Kickstarter, hello! 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.500
 The iblazr team wants to say "thank you" to you heartily. 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.000
 Thanks to your support, we have successfully completed the first crowdfunding project of iblazr... 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 ... carried out mass production and completed the delivery task on time. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.500
 Every user of iblazr is an important part of our team. 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.000
 We know that with your help, our products will surely take us to the next level. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.500
 And did it 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.500
 When developing iblazr 2, we optimized the product design 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.000
 Significant improvements have also been made in electronic components. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.500
 Today, our fill light features are more versatile and easier to use. 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.000
 The latest iblazr 2 adds a new camera experience 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.500
 Now it can connect via Bluetooth and support local iOS 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500
 Android photo app. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.500
 We added a sensor panel for iblazr 2 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.000
 With its help, you can adjust the intensity of the light level 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Make your photo shoot more professional 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 At the same time, it simplifies your operation 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Just double click and your photo is ready. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.000
 We have configured a new fixed system for iblazr 2 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.500
 The exterior is a silicone coated mobile phone clip/plate clip, 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.500
 Suitable for devices from 6mm to 9.5mm wide 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.000
 We also come with a cold boot for digital cameras. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 In the new app, we also extended the functionality of iblazr 2 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Now you can set them separately while syncing multiple flashes at once 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 It is convenient for you to take brighter and more perfect photos. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 The continuous lighting mode of iblazr 2 allows you to shoot short films in the dark, capturing cute moments with outstanding results. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 We are convinced that with your help, our product features will be more perfect. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.500
 For two years, the iblazr team has been working on product improvement. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Our small team is made up of young people who are full of fighting spirit. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.500
 The passion and love for photography is the original intention of our production of this product. 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.000
 Currently, we are raising funds to start iblazr 2 mass production and need your help. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.500
 We donâ€™t need to increase the amount of investment, we are proud of it, therefore, 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.500
 We once again came to Kickstarter for a public offering. 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.000
 Welcome to join our team and provide your support for the iblazr 2 project!
