I've been playing a game called mega

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.650 
I've been playing a game called mega
Mina<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.820> game<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.240> explore<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
Mina and in this game you explore the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.170 
Mina and in this game you explore the
map<00:00:18.810> or<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.470> world<00:00:19.680> by<00:00:20.400> digging<00:00:20.820> into<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
map or the world by digging into the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.590 
map or the world by digging into the
ground<00:00:21.769> and<00:00:22.769> while<00:00:23.189> doing<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:24.029> can<00:00:24.180> see<00:00:24.390> on

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
ground and while doing so you can see on

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.570 
ground and while doing so you can see on
the<00:00:24.779> bottom<00:00:24.960> right<00:00:25.199> corner<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.130> will<00:00:26.369> lose

the bottom right corner that I will lose

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.439 
the bottom right corner that I will lose
fuel<00:00:27.000> umm<00:00:27.210> yeah<00:00:28.080> because<00:00:28.230> digging<00:00:28.740> costs<00:00:29.250> fuel

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
fuel umm yeah because digging costs fuel

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.359 
fuel umm yeah because digging costs fuel
and<00:00:30.449> my<00:00:30.929> heat<00:00:31.199> meter<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.710> will<00:00:31.890> increase<00:00:32.219> you

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
and my heat meter and will increase you

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.340 
and my heat meter and will increase you
can<00:00:32.520> see<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.969> decreases<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.110> when<00:00:34.320> I

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
can see that it decreases and when I

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.970 
can see that it decreases and when I
move<00:00:34.559> upwards<00:00:34.980> again<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.870> yeah<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.829> not

I<00:00:41.879> am<00:00:42.270> collecting<00:00:42.660> those<00:00:43.050> oars<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.879> with

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
I am collecting those oars and with

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.869 
I am collecting those oars and with
those<00:00:45.570> oars<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.559> then<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.070> go<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.730> top

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
those oars I can then and go to the top

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.110 
those oars I can then and go to the top
again<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.420> go<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.500> shop<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.280> sell<00:00:50.670> my<00:00:50.850> cargo

again and go to a shop and sell my cargo

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.189 
again and go to a shop and sell my cargo
and<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.930> all<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.379> ores<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:54.480> with<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
and so all the ores I have and with the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.160 
and so all the ores I have and with the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
money I get I can then buy a better tank

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.170

or a cooler yes so that's the principle

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.310 
or a cooler yes so that's the principle
of<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.270> game<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.660> thought<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:03.989> pretty<00:01:04.110> cool

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
of the game I thought it's pretty cool

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.440 
and let's just pick up some more ores
quickly<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.830> think<00:02:22.130> we<00:02:22.730> might<00:02:22.940> have<00:02:23.000> enough

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
quickly and I think we might have enough

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.750 
quickly and I think we might have enough
because<00:02:23.930> ours<00:02:24.290> are<00:02:24.800> worth<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.280> lot<00:02:25.460> more<00:02:25.490> than

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
because ours are worth a lot more than

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.710 
because ours are worth a lot more than
they<00:02:26.090> should<00:02:26.300> be

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
they should be

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.780 
they should be
this<00:02:27.590> will<00:02:27.770> might<00:02:27.920> be<00:02:28.100> fixed<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.460> version<00:02:28.730> two

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
this will might be fixed in version two

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.150 
this will might be fixed in version two
of<00:02:28.850> this<00:02:29.030> game<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:30.530> will<00:02:30.740> make<00:02:30.980> it

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
of this game and I will make it

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.860 
of this game and I will make it
definitely<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.090> bit<00:02:32.300> harder<00:02:33.790> let's<00:02:34.790> get<00:02:35.660> some

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
definitely a bit harder let's get some

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.800 
definitely a bit harder let's get some
more<00:02:35.990> fuel<00:02:36.230> just<00:02:36.710> to<00:02:36.860> show<00:02:37.040> off<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.250> system

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
more fuel just to show off the system

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.540 
more fuel just to show off the system
then<00:02:38.810> let's<00:02:38.990> move<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.290> this<00:02:39.410> house<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:40.070> buy<00:02:40.520> a

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
then let's move to this house and buy a

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.220 
then let's move to this house and buy a
heat<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:41.000> because<00:02:41.480> we<00:02:41.720> do<00:02:41.810> not<00:02:41.930> want<00:02:41.990> to

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
heat you because we do not want to

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.320 
heat you because we do not want to
explode<00:02:42.470> again<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.950> mean<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.610> can<00:02:43.820> see<00:02:44.000> that

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
explode again I mean you can see that

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.070 
explode again I mean you can see that
now<00:02:44.570> we<00:02:44.630> have<00:02:44.780> zero<00:02:45.260> for<00:02:45.680> heat<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:47.090> let's<00:02:47.870> also

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
now we have zero for heat and let's also

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.050 
now we have zero for heat and let's also
operate<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.620> fuel<00:02:48.800> tank<00:02:49.100> now<00:02:49.340> we<00:02:49.400> can<00:02:49.640> carry

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
operate the fuel tank now we can carry

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.480 
operate the fuel tank now we can carry
more<00:02:50.210> fuel<00:02:51.130> yeah<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.900> that's<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.350> game<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.800> in

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
more fuel yeah so that's the game and in

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.400 
more fuel yeah so that's the game and in
version<00:02:55.790> 2<00:02:55.940> there<00:02:56.750> might<00:02:56.990> be<00:02:57.020> a<00:02:57.230> lot<00:02:57.380> of

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
version 2 there might be a lot of

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.510 
version 2 there might be a lot of
changes<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:59.020> maybe<00:03:00.020> I'm<00:03:00.440> going<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:01.100> make<00:03:01.280> an

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
changes and maybe I'm going to make an

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.450 
changes and maybe I'm going to make an
explanation<00:03:01.760> for<00:03:02.240> this<00:03:02.390> if<00:03:02.630> you<00:03:02.690> want<00:03:02.960> to<00:03:03.460> but

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
explanation for this if you want to but

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.480 
explanation for this if you want to but
till<00:03:04.820> then<00:03:05.140> try<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.200> game<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.740> tell<00:03:07.190> me<00:03:07.310> what
