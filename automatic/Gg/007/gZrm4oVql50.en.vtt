00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:10.070
 those uses that we have made that 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:14.179
 nor horizon and other cases are large 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:18.730
 challenges are very interesting you move 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:23.539
 with large volumes of construction 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.630
 mixing users uses trying 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.990
 make life work without a knock on the 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.990
 other 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:41.450
 the feet are glued they have no lives 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.030
 independent boards yesterday think of 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.530
 stairs in the elevators accesses hall 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.780
 totally different 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.950
 I think it's a strong trend 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.680
 mix the same shape you avoid both 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.850
 transport need transport 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.770
 displacement 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.930
 I guess who already have bought this 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:04.820
 life project that is there and will not 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.350
 a change in the city of SÃ£o 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.460
 Paulo the net you have a car was a 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.240
 privilege 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:16.310
 Today you can leave without the car. 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.260
 is a privilege to have less impact will 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.130
 have a very vibrant architecture one 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.290
 differentiated is in the aesthetic format a 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.820
 movement in the balconies and goes 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.150
 innovative in this sense in terms of 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.070
 visuals this blend of you mixes 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.150
 commercial residential building you 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.630
 end up creating a plastic drive 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.940
 a very place building with a design 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.830
 ends up winning the milestone building of the 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.380
 design that creates a lot of 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.450
 people will see and will remember the building 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.450
 and if you lose this project is very innovative 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:55.730
 in many ways not only aesthetic but 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:00.250
 it's also how people will have space 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:05.540
 solar domestic that we will have a 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.340
 pool 15th floor is not at the top of en 36 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.150
 floors were in 15th 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.860
 thus bending over the cb and ev state 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.890
 would be at most until the marginal and until the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.160
 shock is interesting because it is not a 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.230
 Look very beautiful just look from the side 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.769

 is a region that is edit and in policies 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.989
