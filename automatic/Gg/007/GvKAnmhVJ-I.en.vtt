twist out tutorial I I think it's

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.520

something<00:03:17.819> I<00:03:18.060> could<00:03:18.239> do<00:03:18.359> because<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.169> do<00:03:19.230> two

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
something I could do because I do two

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.349 
something I could do because I do two
strand<00:03:19.769> twist<00:03:19.980> outs<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.250> lot<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:20.700> never<00:03:21.180> thought

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
strand twist outs a lot I never thought

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.690 
strand twist outs a lot I never thought
of<00:03:21.450> doing<00:03:21.750> one<00:03:22.079> because<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.859> feel<00:03:23.220> like<00:03:23.370> that's

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
of doing one because I feel like that's

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.550 
of doing one because I feel like that's
a<00:03:23.910> very<00:03:23.940> easy<00:03:24.269> style<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.750> do<00:03:24.900> whereas<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.230> braid

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
a very easy style to do whereas a braid

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.159 
a very easy style to do whereas a braid
out<00:03:25.590> or<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.280> flat<00:03:27.000> twist<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.359> have<00:03:27.540> tutorials<00:03:27.810> on

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
out or a flat twist I have tutorials on

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.890 
out or a flat twist I have tutorials on
those<00:03:28.410> because<00:03:28.970> those<00:03:29.970> required<00:03:30.510> maybe

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
those because those required maybe

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.349 
those because those required maybe
technique<00:03:31.380> maybe<00:03:31.799> different<00:03:32.549> positioning<00:03:33.209> of

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
technique maybe different positioning of

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.110 
technique maybe different positioning of
your<00:03:33.900> twists<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:34.530> don't<00:03:34.739> know<00:03:34.829> all<00:03:35.730> your<00:03:35.880> braids

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
your twists I don't know all your braids

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.409 
your twists I don't know all your braids
so<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:37.139> guess<00:03:37.440> that's<00:03:37.709> something<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.579> can<00:03:38.910> do<00:03:39.060> let

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
so I guess that's something I can do let

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.210 
so I guess that's something I can do let
me<00:03:39.480> know<00:03:39.690> if<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.109> want<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.680> only<00:03:40.950> got<00:03:41.160> a

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
me know if you want that I only got a

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.610 
me know if you want that I only got a
request<00:03:41.489> for<00:03:41.730> maybe<00:03:42.000> like<00:03:42.030> four<00:03:42.780> people<00:03:43.019> and

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
request for maybe like four people and

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.940

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.830 
videos and have seen me in twists
outside<00:03:50.130> never<00:03:50.340> never<00:03:50.910> asked<00:03:51.329> for<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.540> tutorial

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
outside never never asked for a tutorial

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.020 
outside never never asked for a tutorial
so<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:52.650> just<00:03:52.950> felt<00:03:53.160> like<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> demand<00:03:53.700> for<00:03:53.879> that

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
so I just felt like the demand for that

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.280 
so I just felt like the demand for that
wasn't<00:03:54.419> there<00:03:54.629> where<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:54.870> was<00:03:54.989> when<00:03:55.139> I<00:03:55.230> would
