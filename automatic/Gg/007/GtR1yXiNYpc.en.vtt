starting to become one of my favorites

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.190 
starting to become one of my favorites
because<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.150> think<00:02:12.209> it's<00:02:12.450> one<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.840> best

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
the base of the plant because that will

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.449 
the base of the plant because that will
encourage<00:03:00.209> new<00:03:00.599> stems<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.560> come<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.040> rebloom

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459

encourage new stems to come and rebloom
throughout<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.849> season<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:03.450> that's<00:03:03.780> another

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
great advantage to some of these newer

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.089 
great advantage to some of these newer
yarns<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.870> are<00:03:07.079> on<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.260> market<00:03:07.620> now<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.920> the

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
yarns that are on the market now is the

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.600 
yarns that are on the market now is the
fact<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.430> they<00:03:08.640> do<00:03:08.700> have<00:03:09.260> much<00:03:10.260> better

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
regular foliage

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.689

of the plant and just simply take and

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.809

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
put the plant off at the base and now

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.339 
put the plant off at the base and now
you<00:04:35.879> could<00:04:36.150> strip<00:04:36.389> a<00:04:36.509> couple<00:04:36.779> leaves<00:04:36.990> from<00:04:37.199> the
