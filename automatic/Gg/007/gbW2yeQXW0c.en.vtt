00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.740 
this this will take little bit time so
what<00:04:06.590> you<00:04:06.739> can<00:04:06.920> do<00:04:07.069> is<00:04:07.220> first<00:04:07.730> in<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.510> oil

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
what you can do is first in the oil

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.020 
what you can do is first in the oil
itself<00:04:09.260> you<00:04:09.440> can<00:04:09.620> try<00:04:09.920> this<00:04:09.980> and<00:04:10.489> keep<00:04:10.819> aside

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
itself you can try this and keep aside

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.800 
itself you can try this and keep aside
and<00:04:11.540> then<00:04:12.109> add<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.920> capsicum<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.700> after<00:04:14.569> 2

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
and then add the capsicum and after 2

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.250 
and then add the capsicum and after 2
minutes<00:04:15.200> then<00:04:15.440> you<00:04:15.620> can<00:04:15.799> add<00:04:16.010> your<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:16.820> know

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
minutes then you can add your you know

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.590 
minutes then you can add your you know
sauteed<00:04:18.260> brinjaul<00:04:19.039> so<00:04:19.519> either<00:04:19.760> way<00:04:20.180> you<00:04:20.239> can

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
sauteed brinjaul so either way you can

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.890 
sauteed brinjaul so either way you can
do<00:04:20.750> it

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
do it

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.649 
do it
I<00:04:21.080> added<00:04:21.620> together<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:22.760> was<00:04:22.970> cooking<00:04:23.360> so

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:23.659 
I added together and I was cooking so

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.390 
I added together and I was cooking so
you<00:04:23.720> can<00:04:24.020> do<00:04:24.169> that<00:04:24.380> way<00:04:24.560> so<00:04:24.800> that<00:04:24.979> it<00:04:25.190> will

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
you can do that way so that it will

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.830 
you can do that way so that it will
become<00:04:25.610> fast<00:04:26.150> and

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
become fast and

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.620 
become fast and
