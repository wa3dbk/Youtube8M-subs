cornstarch directly to this liquid it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.740 
cornstarch directly to this liquid it
would<00:01:26.970> clump<00:01:27.270> up<00:01:29.090> okay<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.299> now<00:01:30.540> I'm<00:01:30.659> gonna

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
would clump up okay and now I'm gonna

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.450 
would clump up okay and now I'm gonna
stern<00:01:31.200> we're<00:01:31.439> gonna<00:01:31.560> bring<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> liquid<00:01:32.220> back

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460

stern we're gonna bring the liquid back
up<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> boil<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.540> boil<00:01:34.200> until<00:01:34.500> it's

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
up to a boil and boil until it's

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.210 
up to a boil and boil until it's
thickened<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.909> juices<00:01:36.240> are<00:01:36.270> clear<00:01:37.220> just

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
thickened and the juices are clear just

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.810 
thickened and the juices are clear just
like<00:01:38.310> that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
like that

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.660 
like that
it's<00:01:39.360> worth<00:01:39.600> noting<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.710> apples<00:01:41.130> will

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
it's worth noting that the apples will

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.030 
it's worth noting that the apples will
not<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.119> fully<00:01:42.329> cooked<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:42.990> stage<00:01:43.290> and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
not be fully cooked at this stage and

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.490 
not be fully cooked at this stage and
will<00:01:44.250> continue<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.790> cook<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:46.110> oven<00:01:46.140> with

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
will continue to cook in the oven with

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.039 
will continue to cook in the oven with
the<00:01:46.619> crust<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.189> we'll<00:01:48.030> let<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.240> feeling<00:01:48.659> cool

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the crust so we'll let this feeling cool

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.740 
the crust so we'll let this feeling cool
while<00:01:49.470> we<00:01:49.500> work<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.100> crust<00:01:50.689> in<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
while we work on the crust in the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.840 
while we work on the crust in the
galette<00:01:52.170> episode<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:52.950> learned<00:01:53.220> how<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.549> roll
