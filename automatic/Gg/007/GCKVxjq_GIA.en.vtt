hey<00:00:01.260> everyone<00:00:01.560> I'm<00:00:02.070> doing<00:00:02.370> some<00:00:02.520> work<00:00:02.550> on<00:00:02.820> my

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hey everyone I'm doing some work on my

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.360 
hey everyone I'm doing some work on my
terabyte<00:00:03.780> getting<00:00:04.440> it<00:00:04.500> ready<00:00:04.620> for<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.950> season

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
terabyte getting it ready for the season

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.309 
terabyte getting it ready for the season
I<00:00:05.460> had<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:05.819> hydraulic<00:00:06.569> cylinder<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:07.109> was

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
I had a hydraulic cylinder that was

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.450 
I had a hydraulic cylinder that was
leaking<00:00:07.830> pretty<00:00:07.950> bad<00:00:08.250> on<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:09.179> backhoe<00:00:09.780> swing

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
leaking pretty bad on the backhoe swing

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.999 
leaking pretty bad on the backhoe swing
so<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.960> figured<00:00:12.960> I'd<00:00:13.019> do<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> little<00:00:13.860> walk<00:00:13.980> around

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
so I figured I'd do a little walk around

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.980 
so I figured I'd do a little walk around
and<00:00:14.429> talk<00:00:14.610> about<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.059> show<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.509> on<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.719> inside

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
and talk about and show it on the inside

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.439 
and talk about and show it on the inside
of<00:00:16.109> those<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.740> helps<00:00:17.010> anybody<00:00:17.220> good<00:00:17.850> if

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
of those and it helps anybody good if

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.099 
of those and it helps anybody good if
not<00:00:18.510> too<00:00:18.840> bad<00:00:19.020> you're<00:00:19.260> watching<00:00:19.529> anyway<00:00:21.109> this

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
not too bad you're watching anyway this

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.320 
not too bad you're watching anyway this
one<00:00:22.380> there's<00:00:22.890> two<00:00:22.949> cylinders<00:00:23.490> there's<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
one there's two cylinders there's the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.689 
one there's two cylinders there's the
hole<00:00:24.449> from<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.160> it<00:00:26.160> swung<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.519> other<00:00:26.580> way

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
hole from it and it swung the other way

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.980 
hole from it and it swung the other way
there's<00:00:27.029> another<00:00:27.240> cylinder<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.779> back

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
there's another cylinder on the back

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.330 
there's another cylinder on the back
side<00:00:30.019> what<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.170> see<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.560> last<00:00:31.890> cylinder

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
side what you see of that last cylinder

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.139 
side what you see of that last cylinder
still<00:00:32.550> sitting<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:32.940> there<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.920> their<00:00:35.149> sister

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
still sitting in there and their sister

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.869 
still sitting in there and their sister
together<00:00:36.300> running<00:00:36.630> off<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> same<00:00:37.079> hydraulics

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
together running off the same hydraulics

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.310 
together running off the same hydraulics
so<00:00:38.879> these<00:00:39.480> cylinders<00:00:39.719> going<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.020> pulled<00:00:40.170> out

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
so these cylinders going to pulled out

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.810 
so these cylinders going to pulled out
inside<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> bench<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.219> we'll<00:00:41.340> go<00:00:41.399> take<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> walk

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
inside the bench so we'll go take a walk

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.030 
inside the bench so we'll go take a walk
over<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> bench<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.680> talk<00:00:43.680> about<00:00:43.829> what<00:00:44.010> I

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
over to the bench and talk about what I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.729 
over to the bench and talk about what I
got<00:00:45.050> okay<00:00:46.190> it's<00:00:47.190> already<00:00:47.430> apart<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.530> it's<00:00:49.530> in

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
got okay it's already apart and it's in

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.220 
got okay it's already apart and it's in
its<00:00:49.920> segment<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.879> will<00:00:51.210> show<00:00:51.390> what<00:00:52.020> two

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
its segment so I will show what two

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
its segment so I will show what two
comes<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.890> goes<00:00:53.129> out<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.370> what<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
comes in goes out of what this is the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.970 
comes in goes out of what this is the
body<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> cylinder<00:00:55.410> as<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.710> would<00:00:55.829> take

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
body of the cylinder as you would take

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.750 
body of the cylinder as you would take
it<00:00:56.100> out<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.699> other<00:00:57.059> line<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.539> see<00:00:57.570> there

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
it out the other line that you see there

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.979 
it out the other line that you see there
one<00:00:59.760> goes<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> other<00:01:00.359> cylinder<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
one goes to the other cylinder on the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.229 
one goes to the other cylinder on the
other<00:01:01.170> side<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:02.250> connectors<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:02.879> are<00:01:03.030> on

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
other side the connectors that are on

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.549 
other side the connectors that are on
them<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.600> look<00:01:03.750> at<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.049> one<00:01:04.199> right<00:01:04.320> here

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
them if you look at this one right here

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.140 
them if you look at this one right here
you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:05.909> kind<00:01:06.119> of

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
you can see that that one just kind of

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.030 
you can see that that one just kind of
threads<00:01:06.420> into<00:01:06.600> there<00:01:06.900> there's<00:01:07.409> no<00:01:07.680> way<00:01:07.710> I've

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
threads into there there's no way I've

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.289 
threads into there there's no way I've
really<00:01:08.250> taken<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.610> out<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.060> there<00:01:09.180> without

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
really taken that out of there without

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.600 
really taken that out of there without
that<00:01:09.600> whole<00:01:09.810> line<00:01:10.049> being<00:01:10.380> able<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.650> spin<00:01:11.040> so

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
that whole line being able to spin so

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.460 
that whole line being able to spin so
you<00:01:11.670> got<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.939> look<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.150> where<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> connectors

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
you got to look for where the connectors

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.499 
you got to look for where the connectors
are<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.549> collar<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> collar

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
are to have this collar and the collar

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.030 
are to have this collar and the collar
spins<00:01:15.900> that's<00:01:16.170> where<00:01:16.500> you're<00:01:16.619> able<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.890> take

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
spins that's where you're able to take

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.280 
spins that's where you're able to take
my<00:01:17.250> part<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.330> that's<00:01:18.659> why<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> see<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> line

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
my part so that's why you see the line

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.039 
my part so that's why you see the line
removed<00:01:19.650> from<00:01:19.830> there<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.450> up<00:01:21.450> by<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.630> control

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
removed from there and up by the control

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.300 
removed from there and up by the control
box<00:01:22.259> there's<00:01:22.439> another<00:01:22.619> line<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.189> so

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
box there's another line like that so

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.030 
box there's another line like that so
the<00:01:23.400> lines<00:01:23.640> stay<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.710> whole<00:01:25.799> cylinder

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the lines stay on so the whole cylinder

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.340 
the lines stay on so the whole cylinder
came<00:01:26.280> out<00:01:26.460> how<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> cylinder<00:01:27.840> actually<00:01:28.170> gets

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
came out how the cylinder actually gets

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.960 
came out how the cylinder actually gets
removed<00:01:28.860> from<00:01:29.610> itself<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.320> end<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.619> it

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
removed from itself is on the end of it

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.140 
removed from itself is on the end of it
it's<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.090> cap<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.659> would<00:01:33.780> see<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.229> cap

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
it's a cap you would see this cap

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.120 
it's a cap you would see this cap
sticking<00:01:36.150> out<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.600> cylinder<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.799> on

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
sticking out of that cylinder and on

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.910 
sticking out of that cylinder and on
that<00:01:38.400> cap<00:01:38.700> say<00:01:39.570> well<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.810> comes<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
that cap say well it comes up but is a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.240 
that cap say well it comes up but is a
set<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.640> holes<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:42.150> there<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.840> there<00:01:43.530> they<00:01:44.009> make

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
set of holes on there on there they make

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.620 
set of holes on there on there they make
a<00:01:44.280> wrench<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.670> kind<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.000> goes<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.299> there<00:01:45.509> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
a wrench that kind of goes on there and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.260 
a wrench that kind of goes on there and
grabs<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.110> turns<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:46.619> there<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.460> 90%<00:01:48.060> of

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
grabs it and turns on there but 90% of

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.580 
grabs it and turns on there but 90% of
the<00:01:48.360> people<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.780> what<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.960> do<00:01:49.020> they<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.409> take<00:01:49.560> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the people do what I do they just take a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.910 
the people do what I do they just take a
punch<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.750> take<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> punch<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.409> start<00:01:52.619> tapping

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
punch and take the punch I start tapping

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.940 
punch and take the punch I start tapping
it<00:01:53.040> around<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.460> drawing<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.820> around<00:01:54.950> what

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
it around and drawing it around what

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.709 
it around and drawing it around what
holds<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.430> together<00:01:56.610> there's<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.299> little<00:01:57.570> hole

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
holds it together there's a little hole

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.959 
holds it together there's a little hole
that<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.229> right<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.799> they<00:01:59.430> use<00:01:59.700> a

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
that you see right there and they use a

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.520 
that you see right there and they use a
piece<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.689> rod

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
piece of rod

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.770 
piece of rod
that<00:02:02.490> rod<00:02:03.530> catches<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> groove<00:02:05.479> this<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.630> that

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
that rod catches a groove this is that

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.550 
that rod catches a groove this is that
part<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.469> getting<00:02:07.799> locked<00:02:07.979> into<00:02:09.560> falls

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
part that it's getting locked into falls

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.810 
part that it's getting locked into falls
into<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.950> hole<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:12.230> through

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
into that hole and through

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.090 
into that hole and through
through<00:02:14.820> that<00:02:14.970> hole<00:02:15.210> into<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.470> hole<00:02:16.890> and

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
through that hole into that hole and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.520 
through that hole into that hole and
then<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.910> whole<00:02:18.090> cylinder<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.690> ho<00:02:19.170> piece<00:02:19.350> is

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
then the whole cylinder it ho piece is

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.680 
then the whole cylinder it ho piece is
rotated<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.220> draws<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:21.270> piece<00:02:21.540> of

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
rotated and it draws that that piece of

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.480 
rotated and it draws that that piece of
wire<00:02:21.870> in<00:02:22.140> there<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.440> that's<00:02:22.530> what<00:02:22.770> holds<00:02:23.070> all

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
wire in there and that's what holds all

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.940 
wire in there and that's what holds all
the<00:02:24.030> hydraulics<00:02:24.780> together<00:02:25.140> once<00:02:25.710> you<00:02:25.800> get

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
the hydraulics together once you get

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.530 
the hydraulics together once you get
that<00:02:26.070> removed<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.790> whole<00:02:26.970> cylinder<00:02:27.270> guts

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
that removed the whole cylinder guts

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.450 
that removed the whole cylinder guts
will<00:02:27.720> just<00:02:27.900> come<00:02:28.080> right<00:02:28.740> out<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:29.100> there<00:02:29.280> and

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
will just come right out of there and

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.990 
will just come right out of there and
this<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.240> what's<00:02:30.390> inside<00:02:30.570> two<00:02:31.560> pieces<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.850> is

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
this is what's inside two pieces this is

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.900 
this is what's inside two pieces this is
the<00:02:33.120> piece<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.720> cylinder<00:02:34.370> slides<00:02:35.370> to

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
the piece that the cylinder slides to

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.030 
the piece that the cylinder slides to
and<00:02:36.090> fro<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:37.080> has<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.770> seal<00:02:38.430> on<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.670> outside

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
and fro it has a seal on the outside

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.830 
and fro it has a seal on the outside
this<00:02:41.040> off<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:44.400> if<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.760> see<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.090> there's<00:02:45.630> a

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
this off and if you see it there's a

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.530 
this off and if you see it there's a
like<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.200> sweep<00:02:46.620> on<00:02:47.040> each<00:02:47.430> there's<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.150> sweep<00:02:48.390> on

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
like a sweep on each there's a sweep on

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.900 
like a sweep on each there's a sweep on
that<00:02:48.690> edge<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.110> then<00:02:49.830> there's<00:02:50.040> another<00:02:50.190> seal

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
that edge and then there's another seal

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.070 
that edge and then there's another seal
on<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.690> inside<00:02:56.330> inspect<00:02:57.330> your<00:02:57.450> cylinder<00:02:57.840> so

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
on the inside inspect your cylinder so

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.720 
on the inside inspect your cylinder so
you<00:02:58.140> can<00:02:58.380> enix<00:02:58.740> or<00:02:58.860> scratches<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.400> can<00:02:59.520> kind

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
you can enix or scratches you can kind

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.370 
you can enix or scratches you can kind
of<00:02:59.790> if<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.540> can<00:03:00.810> feel<00:03:00.960> anything<00:03:00.990> with<00:03:01.350> a

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
of if you can feel anything with a

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.810 
of if you can feel anything with a
finger<00:03:01.740> you<00:03:01.980> kind<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.250> want<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.460> knock<00:03:02.640> that

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
finger you kind of want to knock that

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.950 
finger you kind of want to knock that
down<00:03:02.970> because<00:03:03.270> that's<00:03:03.390> what's<00:03:03.540> going<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.750> beat

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
down because that's what's going to beat

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.020 
down because that's what's going to beat
up<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.740> rubber<00:03:05.010> seal<00:03:05.340> on<00:03:05.370> there<00:03:05.790> going

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
up that that rubber seal on there going

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.230 
up that that rubber seal on there going
back<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.510> forth<00:03:07.490> and<00:03:08.490> this<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.850> usually<00:03:09.150> where

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
back and forth and this is usually where

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.220 
back and forth and this is usually where
you<00:03:09.300> see<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.480> damage<00:03:09.780> because<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:10.080> is

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
you see the damage because this is

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.080 
you see the damage because this is
exposed<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:11.160> if<00:03:11.280> you're<00:03:11.400> moving<00:03:11.550> gravel<00:03:12.000> or

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
exposed so if you're moving gravel or

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.550 
exposed so if you're moving gravel or
whatnot<00:03:12.390> around<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.960> that's<00:03:13.290> where<00:03:13.470> the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
whatnot around and that's where the

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.870 
whatnot around and that's where the
stuff<00:03:13.680> kind<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:13.920> comes<00:03:14.100> down<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.400> beats<00:03:14.580> up<00:03:14.730> on

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
stuff kind of comes down and beats up on

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.660 
stuff kind of comes down and beats up on
them<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.380> use<00:03:16.380> scotch<00:03:16.590> brite<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.100> some

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
them I use scotch brite and some

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.580 
them I use scotch brite and some
actually<00:03:18.210> some<00:03:18.450> chain<00:03:18.660> loop<00:03:18.870> because<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.380> was

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
actually some chain loop because it was

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.990 
actually some chain loop because it was
a<00:03:19.620> little<00:03:19.860> nick<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.280> one<00:03:20.400> spot<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:20.970> I

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
a little nick and one spot of it that I

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.610 
a little nick and one spot of it that I
could<00:03:21.180> feel<00:03:21.390> as<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.660> went<00:03:21.840> over<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.530> just

every little piece of it but you can get
any<00:03:26.940> scratches<00:03:27.900> on<00:03:28.320> there<00:03:28.500> that's<00:03:28.680> sitting

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.510 
sleeve there's an o-ring there and if
you<00:03:38.520> look<00:03:38.670> at<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:39.000> there's<00:03:39.270> a<00:03:39.480> tapered<00:03:40.520> seal

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
you look at it there's a tapered seal

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.030 
you look at it there's a tapered seal
going<00:03:41.910> each<00:03:42.150> direction<00:03:42.360> facing<00:03:42.990> out<00:03:43.140> as<00:03:43.290> the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
going each direction facing out as the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.740 
going each direction facing out as the
pressure<00:03:44.370> goes<00:03:44.580> from<00:03:44.730> one<00:03:44.910> side<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.630> other

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
pressure goes from one side to the other

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.930 
pressure goes from one side to the other
if<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.770> was<00:03:46.950> only<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.280> single<00:03:47.520> acting<00:03:47.880> cylinder

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
if it was only a single acting cylinder

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.290 
if it was only a single acting cylinder
you'd<00:03:48.360> only<00:03:48.480> see<00:03:48.690> one<00:03:48.930> seal<00:03:49.170> not<00:03:49.380> two<00:03:50.300> that

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
you'd only see one seal not two that

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.840 
you'd only see one seal not two that
goes<00:03:51.480> on<00:03:51.690> there<00:03:52.010> or<00:03:53.010> rings<00:03:53.310> on<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.520> inside<00:03:53.760> of

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
goes on there or rings on the inside of

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.040 
goes on there or rings on the inside of
it<00:03:53.940> so<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.030> doesn't<00:03:54.270> leak<00:03:54.420> underneath<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:54.900> from

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
it so it doesn't leak underneath it from

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.590 
it so it doesn't leak underneath it from
side<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.260> side<00:03:55.760> it<00:03:56.760> won't<00:03:56.880> leak<00:03:57.090> externally

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
side to side it won't leak externally

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.050 
side to side it won't leak externally
but<00:03:57.690> it'll<00:03:58.050> just<00:03:58.080> lose<00:03:58.620> power<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.910> then

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
but it'll just lose power and then

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.740 
but it'll just lose power and then
there's<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.270> large<00:04:00.480> nut<00:04:02.209> that<00:04:03.209> holds<00:04:03.270> all<00:04:03.570> that

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
there's a large nut that holds all that

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.220 
there's a large nut that holds all that
together<00:04:04.760> changing<00:04:05.760> these<00:04:05.880> outer<00:04:06.209> seals<00:04:06.630> here

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
together changing these outer seals here

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.699 
together changing these outer seals here
and<00:04:07.380> here

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
and here

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.780 
and here
they're<00:04:08.130> very<00:04:08.490> hard<00:04:09.180> brittle<00:04:10.700> shouldn't<00:04:11.700> say

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
they're very hard brittle shouldn't say

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.270 
they're very hard brittle shouldn't say
brittle<00:04:12.120> is<00:04:12.330> very<00:04:12.660> stiff<00:04:13.110> they're<00:04:13.709> not<00:04:13.890> like

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
brittle is very stiff they're not like

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.320 
brittle is very stiff they're not like
the<00:04:14.400> rubber<00:04:14.580> seals<00:04:14.820> are<00:04:15.000> more<00:04:15.150> like<00:04:15.300> a

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
the rubber seals are more like a

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.660 
the rubber seals are more like a
hardened<00:04:16.080> nylon<00:04:16.410> here's<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.250> old<00:04:17.400> ones<00:04:17.520> for

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
hardened nylon here's the old ones for

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.890 
hardened nylon here's the old ones for
example<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:19.430> try<00:04:20.430> squeezing<00:04:20.910> them<00:04:21.030> they're

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
example and try squeezing them they're

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.659 
example and try squeezing them they're
just<00:04:21.930> very<00:04:22.260> stiff<00:04:22.680> whereas<00:04:22.979> like<00:04:23.190> if<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.460> took

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
just very stiff whereas like if you took

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.730 
just very stiff whereas like if you took
a<00:04:23.850> say<00:04:24.240> here's<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.600> o-ring<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.440> o-ring<00:04:25.680> is

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
a say here's the o-ring the o-ring is

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.070 
a say here's the o-ring the o-ring is
just<00:04:25.890> like<00:04:26.010> butter<00:04:26.250> moved<00:04:26.610> on

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
just like butter moved on

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.200 
just like butter moved on
what<00:04:28.620> works<00:04:28.860> for<00:04:28.980> me<00:04:29.220> on<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.520> lot<00:04:29.880> of<00:04:29.910> things

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
what works for me on a lot of things

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.430 
what works for me on a lot of things
that<00:04:31.700> have<00:04:32.700> that<00:04:32.880> kind<00:04:32.940> of<00:04:33.300> consistency<00:04:34.080> to

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
that have that kind of consistency to

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.570 
that have that kind of consistency to
them<00:04:34.560> like<00:04:34.680> I<00:04:34.860> mean<00:04:35.070> you're<00:04:35.160> trying<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.400> pop

house in the microwave heat up with hot
water<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:50.040> get<00:04:50.820> as<00:04:50.910> hot<00:04:51.090> as<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.240> can<00:04:51.270> right

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630

water and get as hot as you can right
before<00:04:51.900> boiling<00:04:52.110> I<00:04:52.410> just<00:04:52.740> throw<00:04:52.860> all<00:04:52.950> this

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
before boiling I just throw all this

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.780 
before boiling I just throw all this
stuff<00:04:53.250> right<00:04:53.370> in<00:04:53.520> it

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
stuff right in it

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.840 
stuff right in it
it<00:04:54.330> makes<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:54.780> very<00:04:54.920> soft<00:04:55.920> and<00:04:56.220> pliable<00:04:56.430> enough

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
it makes it very soft and pliable enough

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.510 
it makes it very soft and pliable enough
to<00:04:57.420> be<00:04:57.990> able<00:04:58.230> to<00:04:58.350> conform<00:04:58.680> all<00:04:58.920> those<00:04:59.100> without

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
to be able to conform all those without

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.980 
to be able to conform all those without
because<00:05:00.090> you<00:05:00.180> don't<00:05:00.300> want<00:05:00.420> to<00:05:00.480> scratch<00:05:00.630> any<00:05:00.840> of

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
because you don't want to scratch any of

you want to scratch it in you're screwed

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.010 
you want to scratch it in you're screwed
is<00:05:03.810> it's<00:05:04.070> defeating<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.130> purpose<00:05:05.250> so<00:05:06.060> I<00:05:06.390> walk

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
is it's defeating the purpose so I walk

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.110 
is it's defeating the purpose so I walk
them<00:05:07.140> around<00:05:07.260> with<00:05:07.800> that<00:05:07.980> and<00:05:10.460> get<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.670> also<00:05:11.910> do

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
them around with that and get I also do

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.400 
them around with that and get I also do
the<00:05:12.210> metal<00:05:12.360> to<00:05:12.600> that<00:05:12.810> the<00:05:12.930> whole<00:05:13.080> piece<00:05:13.230> the

the metal to that the whole piece the
old<00:05:13.560> one<00:05:13.740> with<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:14.280> two<00:05:14.490> on<00:05:14.670> there<00:05:14.880> I<00:05:15.000> also

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
old one with it the two on there I also

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.420 
old one with it the two on there I also
keep<00:05:15.360> this<00:05:15.540> up<00:05:15.750> also<00:05:15.990> now<00:05:16.740> sometimes<00:05:17.160> it<00:05:17.280> helps

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
keep this up also now sometimes it helps

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.620 
keep this up also now sometimes it helps
to<00:05:17.610> have<00:05:17.700> like<00:05:17.850> some<00:05:18.000> kind<00:05:18.180> of<00:05:18.240> glove<00:05:18.480> or

to have like some kind of glove or
something<00:05:18.960> if<00:05:19.050> it<00:05:19.170> gets<00:05:19.590> a<00:05:19.620> little<00:05:19.680> too<00:05:19.860> hot

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
something if it gets a little too hot

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.040 
something if it gets a little too hot
for<00:05:20.190> you<00:05:20.280> that<00:05:20.400> that's<00:05:21.000> probably<00:05:21.210> 200<00:05:21.720> degrees

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
for you that that's probably 200 degrees
