understand where you're coming off of
because<00:01:51.119> you're<00:01:51.360> saying<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:52.909> obviously

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
because you're saying that obviously

that the WB limits their guys in the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.410 
that the WB limits their guys in the
ring<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.670> say<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.030> there's<00:01:57.180> no

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.660 
you can say that when you haven't seen
them<00:02:03.630> at<00:02:03.780> their<00:02:03.930> full<00:02:04.110> potential<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.920> mean

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
them at their full potential I mean

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.819 
them at their full potential I mean
that's<00:02:05.759> why<00:02:05.969> if<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.840> know<00:02:06.930> new<00:02:07.170> guy<00:02:07.350> comes<00:02:07.710> up

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
that's why if you know new guy comes up

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.169 
that's why if you know new guy comes up
and<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.069> haven't<00:02:08.369> seen<00:02:08.459> any<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.879> work<00:02:09.030> at

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
unproven because really if you think

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.960 
unproven because really if you think
about<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:15.590> only<00:02:15.620> guys<00:02:16.100> that<00:02:16.130> w/e<00:02:16.640> allows
