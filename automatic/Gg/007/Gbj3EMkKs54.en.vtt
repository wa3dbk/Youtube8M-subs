00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.210
 we had a number of visits on 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.759
 had to have about fifteen visits but 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.009
 not especially for this font the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.080
 brokers the people who are moving on 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.359
 the studs in the month preceding the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.310
 sell like every year have come on 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.230
 we did not have more or less visits 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.490
 than usual 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.289
 usual visit and she came out in 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.590
 same time as all the others so 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.359
 we have about fifteen visits in the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.920
 month that has just passed otherwise we can 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.640
 obviously this kind of trait in a 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.410
 catalog that yes but do you already know the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.090
 all potential buyers of this 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.920
 filly are not necessarily on the spot 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.940
 can imagine that it's going to be big 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.890
 Foreign investments 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.090
 so there are brokers who are 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.090
 past that they will be able to make 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.440
 reports to these people but created the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.210
 people will not come here just by 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.170
 Curiosity to see the sister of 13 on 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.500
 might have shut the door 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.870
 by the way we are in full preparation 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.730
 and we make visits every day on 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.370
 can make a visit in the afternoon 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.719
 so we were not going even if we had 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.369
 a lot of demand systematically 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.330
 say yes to everyone just for 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.390
 come see these are enough 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.750
 resembling already by the bombay 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.509
 dress 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.040
 they have exactly the same dress you 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.479
 have noticed that this ball in 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.229
 head which is very similar to 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.330
 that of 13 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.240
 a little bigger on the filly 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.369
 that out of 13 it's funny too there is a 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.960
 ball zana a posterior the posterior 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.119
 opposed to Trier by comparing it I 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.380
 would not it be to play the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.490
 carpet merchants but I think she 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.799
 is more beautiful who was very beautiful even 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.320
 age indeed she has more strength 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.000
 she has more than 2 will do the most mass 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.360
 the most strength to a very beautiful and pau 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.420
 a beautiful back hand 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.350
 a little less light that was not truce 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.850
 motivator it's not horses that 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.340
 for produce not sprouts with a lot 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.460
 of bone is more correct in its aplombs 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.800
 I find it superior in Trier 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.290
 tribute and that's the reflections I've 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.580
 could have people who came to see her 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:08.030
 and that they submit themselves comparative advantage 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.670
 price behavior yes it can be 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.530
 interesting behavior of horses 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.840
 that it already allows us to have a 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.640
 little idea of indeed his 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.760
 future behavior in training or 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.470
 other I will confess you very frankly 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.750
 I do not remember the behavior 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.580
 of truce when she was hardly line 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.110
 what I can say is that this one 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.030
 here today this is a behavior 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.100
 quite normal it's a policy 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.690
 who is in very good health and who is going 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.220
 very well who were these volunteers 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.840
 in what she does there she was 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.760
 relatively calm but it can of 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.080
 from time to time if there is something that 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.750
 annoy me show to show a little 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.310
 little character enough everything 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.010
 the shine for to hope that there was 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.170
 character racing also to later 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.490
 is it related to shooting is 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.140
 bought at 22000 euros 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.400
 that's it I guess I think the reserve 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.950
 to be a little higher than 22000 euros 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.540
 indeed yes it would not be very 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.410
 reasonable I buy it right away if 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.239
 it stops before the name obviously the 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.160
 reserve to be much higher I do not 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.020
 do not know her probably not yet 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.980
 frankly decided you know after the 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.300
 reservations have it all goes this filly has 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.920
 a certain value even if only 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.750
 residual value of mares even though 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.610
 we lose not kill me career racing at 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.950
 his own sister a filly who has 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.910
 earned two bows 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.040
 it's the first time it happens in 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.900
 sales history that is presented 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.310
 two of all sales 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.440
 I do not even know if we find 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.739
 a lot of own brother or sister 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.720
 of bow winners already half 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.370
 maybe maybe there was a 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.650
 own own brother's week it would take 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.370
 ask arcana asked the question but 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.590
 I do not believe and unfortunately we talk about a 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.880
 double winner of boats which is still 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.410
 to the training that just won 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.150
 two groups this year and who will 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.470
 favorite starting from the third mark if 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.510
 she takes the departure of a third a 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.640
 only for a single starting point ever 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.570
 a horse did not try to win three bows 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.290
 so it's still quite exceptional 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.290
 official
