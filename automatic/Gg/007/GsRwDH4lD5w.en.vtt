 certainty pleases so much that it takes away people 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.110
 which until recently it was 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.130
 tribes of other 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.920
 styles 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:25.160
 I used to be a rocker. 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:27.560
 Heavy metal was hairy and suddenly I 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.230
 I started some people who liked the 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.470
 sertanejo and it was where I learned to like 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.950

 So, what kind of places do you have? 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.520

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.290
 here we do not dance all that music 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.310
 students of dance courses in the region have 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.860
 used the balloons to put in 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.650
 practice the learning of lessons is a 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.590
 japanese way of alleviating 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.260
 stress and feel closer to the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.250
 rodeo parties and commissions as 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.250
