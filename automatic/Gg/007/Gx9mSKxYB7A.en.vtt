00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
for you the size hole that's that's

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.870 
for you the size hole that's that's
going<00:00:53.270> to<00:00:53.329> be<00:00:53.390> needed<00:00:53.690> is<00:00:54.050> at<00:00:54.380> least<00:00:54.649> a<00:00:54.980> 5/8

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
going to be needed is at least a 5/8

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.500 
going to be needed is at least a 5/8
inch<00:00:56.180> hole<00:00:56.620> but<00:00:57.620> ideally<00:00:58.130> they'll<00:00:58.969> just<00:00:59.239> drill

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
inch hole but ideally they'll just drill

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.979 
inch hole but ideally they'll just drill
the<00:00:59.690> standard<00:01:00.410> faucet<00:01:01.399> hole<00:01:01.579> size<00:01:01.910> which<00:01:02.780> is

the standard faucet hole size which is

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.039 
the standard faucet hole size which is
inch<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:03.649> 3/8<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:05.030> it'll<00:01:05.239> either<00:01:05.360> be<00:01:05.509> a<00:01:05.630> small

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
inch and 3/8 so it'll either be a small

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.679 
inch and 3/8 so it'll either be a small
hole<00:01:06.350> just<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:07.009> accommodate<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.670> shaft<00:01:07.969> or

hole just to accommodate the shaft or

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.080 
hole just to accommodate the shaft or
it'll<00:01:08.990> be<00:01:09.079> a<00:01:09.110> full-sized<00:01:09.860> faucet<00:01:10.579> hole<00:01:10.789> at

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
it'll be a full-sized faucet hole at

it'll be a full-sized faucet hole at
inch<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:11.659> 3/8<00:01:12.020> either<00:01:12.380> way<00:01:12.709> it<00:01:13.069> will<00:01:13.429> work<00:01:15.579> if

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
inch and 3/8 either way it will work if

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.849 
inch and 3/8 either way it will work if
it's<00:01:16.880> a<00:01:16.969> small<00:01:17.359> hole<00:01:17.749> you're<00:01:18.409> just<00:01:18.619> going<00:01:18.799> to

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
it's a small hole you're just going to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.050 
it's a small hole you're just going to
insert<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:19.459> g2<00:01:19.819> right<00:01:20.479> into<00:01:20.899> the<00:01:21.020> hole<00:01:22.060> that's

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
insert the g2 right into the hole that's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.889 
insert the g2 right into the hole that's
simply<00:01:23.539> and<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.469> install<00:01:25.149> from<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.299> top<00:01:26.569> is

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
simply and the install from the top is

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.559 
simply and the install from the top is
almost<00:01:27.469> done<00:01:27.829> you'll<00:01:28.490> go<00:01:28.700> underneath<00:01:29.090> and

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
almost done you'll go underneath and

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.660 
almost done you'll go underneath and
connect<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.319> bolts<00:01:30.679> as<00:01:30.889> we'll<00:01:31.130> show<00:01:31.340> you<00:01:31.369> in<00:01:31.549> a

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
connect the bolts as we'll show you in a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.120 
connect the bolts as we'll show you in a
second<00:01:32.090> if<00:01:33.969> you<00:01:34.969> have<00:01:35.179> the<00:01:35.359> larger<00:01:35.899> hole<00:01:36.139> then

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
second if you have the larger hole then

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.910 
second if you have the larger hole then
we've<00:01:37.310> included<00:01:37.759> this<00:01:38.149> ring<00:01:38.599> inside<00:01:39.499> the<00:01:39.679> kit

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
we've included this ring inside the kit

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.669 
we've included this ring inside the kit
which<00:01:40.249> would<00:01:40.429> slip<00:01:40.729> on<00:01:40.939> to<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.929> shaft<00:01:42.200> which

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
which would slip on to the shaft which

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.760 
which would slip on to the shaft which
will<00:01:42.889> cover<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.459> larger<00:01:43.969> size<00:01:44.209> hole<00:01:44.599> and<00:01:44.990> that

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
will cover the larger size hole and that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.440 
will cover the larger size hole and that
would<00:01:46.009> be<00:01:46.219> for<00:01:46.459> a<00:01:46.520> standard<00:01:47.119> faucet<00:01:47.630> hole

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
would be for a standard faucet hole

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.739 
would be for a standard faucet hole
essentially<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.630> g2<00:01:51.020> connects<00:01:51.560> very<00:01:51.950> simply

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
essentially the g2 connects very simply

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:56.949 
essentially the g2 connects very simply
from<00:01:53.749> the<00:01:53.929> bottom<00:01:55.270> well<00:01:56.270> we'll<00:01:56.450> just<00:01:56.479> cover<00:01:56.810> it

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
from the bottom well we'll just cover it

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.600 
from the bottom well we'll just cover it
like<00:01:57.139> this<00:01:57.380> first<00:01:57.679> from<00:01:58.609> the<00:01:58.759> bottom

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.900 

so<00:02:02.270> it'll<00:02:02.450> slip<00:02:02.720> into<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.140> hole<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:04.310> can't

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
so it'll slip into the hole you can't

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.060 
so it'll slip into the hole you can't
really<00:02:05.150> see<00:02:05.540> under<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.170> sink<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:06.740> I'll<00:02:06.890> just

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
really see under the sink so I'll just

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.040 
really see under the sink so I'll just
show<00:02:07.280> you<00:02:07.310> from<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.760> top<00:02:08.030> how<00:02:08.570> to<00:02:08.630> make<00:02:08.899> the

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
show you from the top how to make the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.950 
show you from the top how to make the
connection<00:02:10.270> you're<00:02:11.270> going<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.450> see<00:02:11.660> inside

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
connection you're going to see inside

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.610 
connection you're going to see inside
the<00:02:12.020> kit<00:02:13.540> you're<00:02:14.540> going<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.720> have<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:15.200> grey

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
the kit you're going to have a grey

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.890 
the kit you're going to have a grey
washer<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.400> again<00:02:16.850> we<00:02:17.030> change<00:02:17.270> parts<00:02:17.750> from

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
washer and again we change parts from

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.050 
washer and again we change parts from
time<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.290> time<00:02:18.320> so<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.490> nut<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:19.790> secures

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
time to time so the nut that secures

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.600 
time to time so the nut that secures
this<00:02:20.810> from<00:02:21.140> underneath<00:02:21.290> might<00:02:21.920> not<00:02:22.130> look<00:02:22.400> like

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
this from underneath might not look like

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.080 
this from underneath might not look like
this<00:02:22.760> gray<00:02:23.030> washer<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:25.220> might<00:02:25.520> be<00:02:25.700> something

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
this gray washer it might be something

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.130 
this gray washer it might be something

to<00:04:47.150> your<00:04:47.180> ionizer<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.919> one<00:04:49.100> on<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.400> top<00:04:49.840> is

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
to your ionizer the one on the top is

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.730 
to your ionizer the one on the top is
the<00:04:52.669> return<00:04:53.090> coming<00:04:53.630> back<00:04:53.840> from<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.229> ionizer

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
the return coming back from the ionizer

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.000 
the return coming back from the ionizer
going<00:04:55.370> in<00:04:55.669> and<00:04:55.940> here<00:04:56.870> is<00:04:57.050> where<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.500> acid

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
going in and here is where the acid

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.600 
going in and here is where the acid
water<00:04:58.160> comes<00:04:58.580> out<00:04:58.790> of<00:04:59.090> this<00:04:59.680> spigot<00:05:00.680> so<00:05:01.460> we'll

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
water comes out of this spigot so we'll

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.730 
water comes out of this spigot so we'll
just<00:05:01.760> drop<00:05:02.060> this<00:05:02.240> into<00:05:02.510> place<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:05.690> in<00:05:06.620> the

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
just drop this into place and in the

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.730 
just drop this into place and in the
last<00:05:07.010> segment<00:05:07.370> we<00:05:08.240> our<00:05:08.389> head<00:05:08.540> already<00:05:08.900> hooked

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
last segment we our head already hooked

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.240 
last segment we our head already hooked
up<00:05:09.950> our<00:05:10.130> hoses<00:05:10.729> to<00:05:10.910> the<00:05:10.940> ionizer<00:05:12.130> we're<00:05:13.130> not

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
up our hoses to the ionizer we're not

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.280 
up our hoses to the ionizer we're not
going<00:05:13.430> to<00:05:13.490> do<00:05:13.639> it<00:05:13.729> again<00:05:14.030> in<00:05:14.240> this<00:05:14.389> segment<00:05:14.660> if

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
going to do it again in this segment if

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.440 
going to do it again in this segment if
you<00:05:15.560> if<00:05:15.889> you<00:05:16.040> need<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:16.520> you<00:05:16.700> can<00:05:16.850> go<00:05:17.000> back<00:05:17.210> to

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
you if you need to you can go back to

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.360 
you if you need to you can go back to
the<00:05:17.540> last<00:05:17.780> chapter<00:05:18.080> and<00:05:18.590> see<00:05:18.800> how<00:05:18.979> we<00:05:19.040> hooked

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
the last chapter and see how we hooked

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.390 
the last chapter and see how we hooked
up<00:05:19.550> everything<00:05:20.120> underneath<00:05:20.539> the<00:05:20.870> ionizer<00:05:21.400> now

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
up everything underneath the ionizer now

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.760 
up everything underneath the ionizer now
all's<00:05:22.700> we<00:05:22.910> have<00:05:22.940> to<00:05:23.210> do<00:05:23.390> is<00:05:23.720> plug<00:05:24.169> in<00:05:24.410> the<00:05:24.440> right

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
all's we have to do is plug in the right

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.409 
all's we have to do is plug in the right
hose<00:05:25.360> to<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.479> right<00:05:26.660> hose<00:05:26.930> here<00:05:27.380> and<00:05:27.560> so<00:05:28.460> our

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
hose to the right hose here and so our

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:35.080 
hose to the right hose here and so our
shorter<00:05:30.050> hose<00:05:31.419> is<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:33.440> acid<00:05:34.100> line<00:05:34.310> which<00:05:34.910> will

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
shorter hose is the acid line which will

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.650 
shorter hose is the acid line which will
go<00:05:35.240> to<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.510> top<00:05:35.900> hose<00:05:36.350> here

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
go to the top hose here

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.880 
go to the top hose here
