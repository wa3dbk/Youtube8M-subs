00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.529
 in front of my mirror and this has a 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.500
 explanation and it's because I'm going to record the 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.779
 eye that led today is Tuesday holy 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.339
 although it does not seem like it because he said- 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.919
 although it may not look like it although it is falling 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:32.360
 the world is hot the water is 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:35.660
 one of these days that you want to be in 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.500
 house as it says then what I 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.360
 I am going according to this day and today 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.030
 I go to my boys house in a movie 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.620
 and so I'm not going like much 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.760
 my head I 'm comfortable with my feet 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.540
 protected with waterproof boots for 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.440
 rain and nothing I will teach you what 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:02.030
 I wear above I wear this shirt 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.260
 this shirt that is Sara's worth 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.530
 in fact winter 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:12.280
 and it's size m and it stays with me as you see 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:16.260
 big I'm below the bum 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.800
 and down I'm wearing some leggings 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.870
 in black 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.540
 basic and these water drops 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.360
 I do not know if you prefer JCE but they are from 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.180
 ride a horse but well I already 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.190
 also how do I have it? 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.410
 I also use it for rain because 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.020
 now they take enough for 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.940
 for the rain but its function the boots 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.100
 they are riding horses 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.290
 people wash they buy it thinking 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.060
 simply that they are wellies and 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.939
 they are more than that 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.430
 as you can see it's an 11 and pretty basic 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.210
 I wear high socks that also 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.280
 are are socks worth for this guy 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.049
 of riding boots that are expensive and 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.090
 you have high enough for the boot 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:07.100
 slide more easily and baby pink and 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.910
 it gives the touch because you do not see everything 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.180
 black is worth it and you can see that 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.890
 tap there baby pink the shirt like 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.000

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.370
 a bow as well as lace 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.470
 this geeks and I go and now I'm going to 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.060
 teach that I'm wearing a coat because 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:36.040
 So it 's good to take a coat 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:40.210
 pretty chubby vest is worth the color 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:44.280
 well the brown light clarito 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:47.560
 and also the habit because it's oversize 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.980
 specifically from my father and I love 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:55.300

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.730

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.150
