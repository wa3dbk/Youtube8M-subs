00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.600
 Hello everyone, I will do a review 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.049
 small order cancel 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.809
 she is called a mandate 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:13.849
 how is it quite different from 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.939
 all the rest is the fact that in it 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.179
 matte shades of shadow prevail 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.099
 if you love march more 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.029
 I thought that was what he was 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.369
 but until we get ahead 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.599
 let's start as usual soups 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.599
 here not to do not so much apparatuses 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.350
 bunk and second height 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.410
 I would have said 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.410
 check and quite tightly closed 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.230
 by tradition of ancestors 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.230
 well, so 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.350
 so what concerns so 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.830
 and the first thing I want to say is that we would 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.850
 I don't know why 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.920
 on us at all 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.540
 of interest 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.280
 usually oscar 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.920
 rub it is very high altitude 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.240
 u among other things because he 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.730
 apply shadows ie particles 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.620
 inevitably asv shares on the bases and thereby 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.010
 pollution 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.520
 and this is the worst that can happen to her as 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.520
 if it is dirty tennis 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.380
 and as for the price 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.740
 then not all shades here march 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.020
 and two light shades but not yet 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.890
 quite shame how brilliant 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.790
 but everyone else is true 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.790
 by the way 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.130
 I can not say that 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.930
 so what about those who are they 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.280
 range from quite colors 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.460
 about grayish 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.910
 as explained by the arch 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.610
 and here are these two dark 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.870
 and very similar 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.870
 you are apart from that 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.649
 under tolyatti and so no 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.739
 let me get you 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.819
 concerning 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.819
 project shades 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.789
 the fate of the color of the account 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.789
 the quality of their little 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.649
 but they are quite self 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.509
 imperial minus 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.509
 sudden loss of ideas 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:11.169
 r and pro through aizhk and cosmetics and also 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.169
 two months 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.979
 know i'm sitting now 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.959
 all inclusive 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.959
 and at home is not funny because 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.499
 but I was quite positive 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.499
 but for some reason I got more 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.889
 probably because I understand it 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.680
 she created the default sheet 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.799
 berths 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.559
 but because amnesty brilliance and base 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:06.879
 much more than a third 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.700
 if done with nev batog palette well 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.760
 Will suit those who need matte 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.479
 the shadows 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.189
 we notice nobody that about 99 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.969
 percent stepanenko translation matte 56 not 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:21.449
 will visit a new or clean place 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.120
 novits brushes and scene matte shadows important 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.889
 concept is very big 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.219
 so 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:29.999
 recommends falling out purely and viewers 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:32.439
 and if you want anyway who is better 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.629
 pay 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.409
 we do not understand Kyoto 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:37.460
 and formally 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.020
 knowledge day better quality 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.740
 but however I do not regret that 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.240
 This with comrades because of their 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.240
 if you go to nick 40.2 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.520
 ooo cosmonblan on snv 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.550
 attack details
