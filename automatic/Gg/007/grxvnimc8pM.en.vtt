00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.010
 pogba thiago silva is when i am 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.190
 not mistaken, only 15,000 worth around 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.530
 So turn the kiwi 13 first top 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.450
 gone either it is not a top act 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.890
 Not even a bad pack 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.260
 10,000 is worth it is terrible 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.510
 that's really terrible the rest 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.700
 Do you discover we are pure in unifying the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.040
 duplicates lee are worth nothing encounter 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.209
 verb pop bar and cavalli keep you 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.600
 Let's see the new account 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.600
 right back 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.290
 So here is a counter account 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.890
 from my brother I have mine 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.670
 colin 700,000 loaded 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.250
 And if I'm a valuable player 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.420
 pull it off then I turn it on again 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.940

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.230

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.030
 but not back 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.959
 I do not look that makes any sense 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.880
 a little bit more exciting when you are 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.860
 I do not know to the right 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:33.090
 can open a 5 4 3 2 1 0 and that 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.530
 just finished coach michael matschi 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.080
 I can still see at first glance 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.620
 is come already william ok Sami 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.670
 again 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.540
 and now comes some blue miller 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.060
 Please please 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.060

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.739
 300,000 those stupid 100 plaintext 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.880
 would be issued and drawn nothing 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.140
 you write the comments what you 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.340
 have drawn me she was interested 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.769
 he was luckier than me 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.940
 probably a lot less bad luck 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.190
 you do not actually have 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.310
 So I need to pack in this pack 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.870
 opening had you can probably mÃ¼ller 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.459
 have been displayed as the best 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.630
 this is terrible oh man 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.010
 but there will be more pack openings 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.390
 I still have so many issues 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.680
 and will take more shots to the new 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.930
 team on the shoot so there you are 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.519
 really over- supplied with at the moment 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.049
 the team this is over 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.390
 come back quite a lot of gameplay 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.490
 scott base is and so on but this one 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.919
 time you just have to pull to the text 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.320
 in my opinion and I hope so too 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:35.000
