00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
back stand-up because I did the Front's

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.100 
back stand-up because I did the Front's

pulling<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.710> was<00:03:10.800> just<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.040> nightmare<00:03:11.430> but

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880

I found if I did the back first it was

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.580 
I found if I did the back first it was
really<00:03:14.970> easy<00:03:15.300> in<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.780> front<00:03:16.020> is<00:03:16.200> really<00:03:16.440> easy

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.670 
is really similar looks like this now
the<00:05:57.180> other<00:05:57.330> one's<00:05:57.569> picked<00:05:57.839> true<00:05:58.020> to<00:05:58.139> size<00:05:58.349> but

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
the other one's picked true to size but

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.469 
the other one's picked true to size but
I<00:05:58.710> found<00:05:59.009> that<00:05:59.189> this<00:05:59.430> one<00:05:59.669> in<00:05:59.759> particular<00:05:59.879> was

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
I found that this one in particular was

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.570 
I found that this one in particular was
a<00:06:00.539> little<00:06:00.899> loose<00:06:01.050> on<00:06:01.289> the<00:06:01.409> top<00:06:01.649> but<00:06:02.189> it<00:06:02.310> didn't

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
a little loose on the top but it didn't

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.029 
a little loose on the top but it didn't
look<00:06:02.699> any<00:06:03.000> less<00:06:03.149> like<00:06:03.839> nice<00:06:04.199> on<00:06:04.439> me<00:06:04.589> or<00:06:04.710> wasn't

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
look any less like nice on me or wasn't

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:06.769 
look any less like nice on me or wasn't
uncomfortable<00:06:05.490> I<00:06:05.879> think<00:06:05.909> it's<00:06:06.180> just<00:06:06.330> cuz<00:06:06.569> the

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:06.779 
uncomfortable I think it's just cuz the

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:09.019 
uncomfortable I think it's just cuz the
lace<00:06:07.050> is<00:06:07.500> so<00:06:07.680> loose<00:06:08.310> at<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:08.580> top<00:06:08.789> it's<00:06:08.969> not

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:09.029 
lace is so loose at the top it's not

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:11.899 
lace is so loose at the top it's not
fitting<00:06:09.599> like<00:06:10.139> fitted<00:06:10.589> your<00:06:11.219> breasts<00:06:11.490> kind<00:06:11.789> of

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:11.909 
fitting like fitted your breasts kind of

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:14.480 
fitting like fitted your breasts kind of
sits<00:06:12.180> inside<00:06:12.419> up<00:06:12.960> to<00:06:13.620> the<00:06:13.740> top<00:06:13.949> of<00:06:14.099> it<00:06:14.219> and<00:06:14.399> this

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
sits inside up to the top of it and this

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.100 
sits inside up to the top of it and this
is<00:06:14.550> kind<00:06:14.909> of<00:06:15.029> looser<00:06:15.389> I<00:06:15.419> think<00:06:15.659> maybe<00:06:15.839> that's

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
is kind of looser I think maybe that's

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.230 
is kind of looser I think maybe that's
the<00:06:16.229> way<00:06:16.319> it's<00:06:16.439> supposed<00:06:16.500> to<00:06:16.770> be<00:06:16.919> or<00:06:17.759> maybe<00:06:18.029> my
