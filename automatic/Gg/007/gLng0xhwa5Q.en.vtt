00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.459
 i 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.580
 hello guys and girls in the series of 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.770
 videos to cover the boats then 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.850
 we are in another video and here I am going to 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:19.550
 teach other models in another way 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.920
 cover to cover these boats you go to 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.200
 see are very cool very cool 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.970
 apart from these boats I have also 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:31.379
 used in this case white glue sand 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:35.829
 tempera and acrylic embossing 

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:37.510
 golden paint brushes a brush for 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.719
 spread 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.250
 hot glue gun pebbles 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.910
 silver-blue gold and no laces and 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.930
 varnish 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.489
 first I wanted to coat with this in 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.910
 these cases in this case I have wanted 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.860
 coat the pot with a paint background 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.780
 I for example wanted to do several 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.480
 colors but good at the end the black 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.080
 a lot has been left with which 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.560
 I've done several with the black background 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.110
 and coated so that it sticks 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.510
 better the paint as it is plastic then 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.030
 I mixed it with the tail and there's 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.390
 no problem you see you paint the background what 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.100
 let it dry and then not 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.990
 you paint over and what you like 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.290
 you want 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.780
 another another model for example is to paint it 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.659
 and before it dries, you see what 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.670
 sprinkled with sand for example not 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.560
 a lot of sand so that it 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.049
 see what black is not just the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.420
 sand you see the black background once 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.990
 it was dry I took the brush to 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.110
 be cirh that is a brush to paint 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.659
 with templates then you have to give 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.600
 taps you see is painted in the beginning 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.720
 is tapping like that and so I've painted 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.990
 only the sand and I left the bottom 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.409
 black to be seen once it was dry 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.060
 it works that you check that it closes and 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.039
 that the sand does not exceed the edge 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.140
 so what do you want as I want 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.380
 I tell you how I keep in these boats 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.810
 is to save material from tiny 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.470
 crafts I'll in this for example 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.970
 I'm going to keep the silver pebbles 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.250
 then in the stand a support for 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.340
 separate a little golden hair a stand 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.130
 with a coffee capsule and then I have 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.100
 glued over silver pebbles 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.410
 and there that I may keep the pebbles 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.520
 plated then I tell you this each one 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.800
 he does it as they want 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.890
 each one puts the decoration he wants 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.540
 or do not put anything on it if the children 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.330
 they do it to give on the day of the 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.830
 mother then it is put according to what you like 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.500
 to the mother or according to what she likes 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.350
 them and saying that is already like always 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.210
 I say each one to your liking 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.130
 once we have put the 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.700
 little stones I have put around 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.350
 also around the closure at the level of 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.320
 closing 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.110
 I have put a black cord that I have 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.660
 stuck with 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.930
 with the hot tail but you can stick it 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.700
 also with white tail so they do 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.440
 children there is no problem them 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.500
 they can stick it with the white tail and 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.840
 Hold as I always say 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.850
 I then with the hot tail to go 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.220
 faster but there is no problem 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.230
 but if you do not want to hold us and the 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.590
 children should do it with paint with 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.769
 forgiveness with white tail 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:39.060
 what you see on the edge being careful 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:42.060
 that does not excel much but then 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.830
 to the one below I put one in the 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.810
 edge of the lid and then I put 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.640
 another on the edge of 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.920
 I cut the boat and I've covered it 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.510
 is a model the other we had 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.460
 painted when it has dried with the 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.220
 embossed paint 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.650
 well said operations 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.120
 that already as active everyone who decorates 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.980
 as I want in this post made 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.980
 spirals of different colors 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.569
 and good and in the boat and on the cover 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.699
 and now you will see 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.699
 Well, I say they are simple ideas because they are 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.229
 ideal for you to do with children and that 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.560
 the children are able to do it later 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.200
 each one already 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.060
 as I always say if you want to do more 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.010
 complicated and more complicated if you 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.490
 you want more simple do it like that I 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.190
 I give the idea 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.259
 and then on top then the varnish and 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.569
 over then I'm going to hit seven dates 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.569
 golden because I'll keep the appointments 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.220
 but well this I already tell you 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.830
 It can be a good gift for the day of 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.340
 the mother and the guardian that can 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.460
 decorate it customize it 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.010
 to paint what they want but it has 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.960
 many possibilities this for example 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.030
 I'm going to paint this box with 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.970
 tempera and with acrylic paint 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.260
 I 'm going to paint little flowers 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.129
 many little flowers around 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.070
 as if it were a garden 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:15.020
 of many colors 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.529
 and with finite brush then followed 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.869
 doing 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.620
 as if they were flowers and then with the 

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:23.520
 painting 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.520
 of relief 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.700
 in fact we 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.520
 the stems of the flowers 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.919
 20 different colors 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.930
 and well I tell you then it depends on the 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:41.879
 mom I am a more serious mom and more 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:44.490
 cheerful more classical everyone who does 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:48.449
 in their own way then with this brush they saw 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.159
 fan actually taking that paint and 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.479
 removing the surplus as it was done as 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.030
 if it were the grass and done as a 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.320
 flower garden well it is another 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.860
 model 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.719
 and on the cover 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.719
 I have made a kind of sun 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.610
 so around 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.920
 and another model 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.860
 there are many possibilities as I tell you 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.669
 children have a lot of imagination 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.669
 They can do many things 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:25.440
 and good is such a good result and I 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.420
 like sixth 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.090
 about nothing happy that the boxes that I 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.140
 had with the written writing what 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.230
 there was in here 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:37.260
 I put it on and so the seventy fifteen 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:40.140
 blue ribbons and good already this time then 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.670
 what can you do with other paintings what 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.160
 decorate and as you want it good because it is already 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.770
 are several models as I say there are several 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.530
