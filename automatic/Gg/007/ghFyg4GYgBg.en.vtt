00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.440
 this test 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.440
 does not serve to present percent a simple way 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.439
 the settlement 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:11.629
 by comparison with 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.190
 some conxa to 1 the most important competitor club that is that in the market 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.070
 that only referendum 998 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.060
 In my opinion 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.750
 a profile that is used in the wrong way as a work space for 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.149
 make corrections 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.429
 the position 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.710
 have significant deviations from the red shades losses of 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.970
 of definition and also 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.210
 in a way 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.679
 very intense bus when it comes to work 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.699
 and now if you do do repetitions of correction st foces 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.050
 these these defects multiply 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.370
 in that sense tilton is thought 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.960
 so that it serves as a space that cushions the corrections between 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.700
 captures and impressions 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.700
 seven lie a loss of the country 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.660
 for 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.200
 to be able to compare what happens with the color 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.059
 and what happens with the densities 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.299
 I have selected two photographs that I put representative the comparison what 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.500
 let's do 16 bits in both 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.330
 i a tornado pr what is it about the color we are going to take it to extremes 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.470
 russia for the extreme processes of the situation that they can admit to see 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.030
 percent more steely 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.230
 is how the defects are presented 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.000
 The first thing I will do before our comparison is to expand these two 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.750
 images to make it look 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.620
 ava 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.620
 ap a floor 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.720
 each of the screen 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.500
 investing high image are exactly the same as they have the same quake 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.880
 it is there 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.880
 is composed and subtle here near the mouth 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.229
 percent on the back the hand 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.720
 it is seen that there are lines of application of mud on the skin that 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.000
 they are very 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.420
 here for example under this grass you see that the textures by which 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.670
 crowded on the skin 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.400
 there are two days with soft are very delicate hand by comparing the 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.080
 specifically in this area of ​​the elbow and here you are light cracked 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.960
 quartered 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.999
 and lines 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.959
 percent 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.620
 once seen the two images are exactly the same what I'm going to do 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.310
 is applicable to each one one hundred percent of the situation to carry all the 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.710
 colors to the extreme and see 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.749
 how each color responds exactly at the end of the profile 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:22.219
 i once done this 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.299
 what I'm going to do is 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.719
 same spicy changing them 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.719
 to be able to make a comparison that takes mind in them 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.890
 if we compare those fine details of the mouth cousins ​​that here ap follows 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.959
 having details of course the photograph is made dust 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.399
 and these details continue to transcend that nose here however we see that 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.170
 it will lose us sciara the useful life 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.640
 that already close and close to its quarry 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.079
 if we compare this 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.279
 with what happens 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:48.579
 in the hand 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.479
 we can see that in the hand there have been some spots of color but that 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:55.409
 completely lost the definition the fine lines here do not exist is that there 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.590
 there is absolutely 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.869
 none if we look at it in the shoulder 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:02.620
 where was that one and the bank 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.489
 we see that kusa above the texture and here the texture disappeared this is 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.819
 a smooth stain seems to have disappeared to textures seems magic 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:11.829
 but it is simply 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.080
 behavior 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.979
 profile 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:16.129
 percent let's see in it 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.769
 He like other jobs we had set the fine details 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:21.760
 of the quartered and girls 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.749
 here we see that 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:26.659
 have disappeared they have simply disappeared completely 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.949
 there is no that its fine details have disappeared we no longer have 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:33.459
 just everything we had before 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.019
 that could give us detail 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.219
 as this case has disappeared 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:38.929
 that is to say 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:40.689
 as far as color is concerned 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.579
 he has a lot more tolerant 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.349
 much more tolerance 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.629
 efe tito 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.289
 and it allows us to go much further 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:50.019
 please 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.780
 percent and for which is what it does 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.959
 the magen 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.669
 when we are comparing 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:56.589
 percent 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:58.419
 a the photograph that 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.130
 have a holy cross is a portion of the katusha is quite 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.279
 dangerous, what I'm going to do is 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.279
 clarify it 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:15.189
 in the prd what is the consequence of that an especially strong application 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.379
 of a 

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:18.320
 correction my house naturally 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.810
 I'm going to make you also get water that the previous 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.520
 inside 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.650
 the space paper impression since these images so beasts 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.779
 yes 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:30.469
 I make a correction to this image 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:32.370
 how can this be 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.370
 and also side to the other 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.949
 at the time of seeing 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.239
 the apc to details that may have 1 and what may have the other 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.330
 we see that I have completely disappeared 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.830
 the fan lines 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.189
 not only that but that percent of this skin area has details 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.369
 and here what it has is a sound with a band and grays 

00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:58.610
 considerably important 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.840
 yes 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.010
 let's say in the neck 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.400
 we see that it is here there is a detail evidently burned because it has 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.550
 gone but here has requested in green exactly the same 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.129
 what happen 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:10.370
 in the 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.370
 in it change of high dose asombras candle 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:15.689
 Yes we will see 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:16.909
 for example 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:18.020
 the edge 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.240
 of the forearm we see that here it is burned 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.740
 has skin tone 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.370
 if we are going to see certain card and that reason to the dress we see that here 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.669
 there are details 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.510
 and that here by comparison there is no 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.210
 no type of workshop 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.500
 right here if we compare it with this area we see that it has lost a quantity 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.249
 detail 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:42.249
 right here it is burned and here however continental is to say 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:44.849
 percent as far as the slope is concerned 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.389
 The bed is much better 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.389
 titov that in the holy ejido and eight but also 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.009
 note that here there is a color deviation 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:56.779
 greenish siham 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:59.779
 there is a major change the colors is to say 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.529
 he has lost from here he went white 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.190
 i this happens in all hearts 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.580
 there is a very important loss 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.750
 the high lights 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.870
 yes the corrections in 1998 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.219
 they are not done delicately 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:14.860
 if these corrections we followed it twice 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.969
 twice 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:19.969
 in each picture 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.310
 we would see what 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.689
 twice in société multiplied by two his crib an aberration decoration 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.630
 well the fan has turned into a white spot and yet here 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.849
 lines continue to appear 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:36.080
 percent 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.159
 semi where you look 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:40.419
 retains a lot better details 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:43.509
 We are here in the selection area 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:45.189
 sarasola zone the palms 

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:46.509
 I already know how they are 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:48.729
 if we go to the area the hand 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:50.449
 see what happens here 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.279
 see what happens 

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:54.119
 in the garment 

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:56.800
 currently this is a wild portion 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.110
 it is not simply 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.689
 p a demonstration proof that he can get very much further 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:04.590
 profile as triton 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.830
 that with adobe 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.069
 rg of 1990 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:10.229
 the way to work with them very simple 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:13.229
 everything there is to do 

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:15.669
 in a pc with him 

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.319
 the right mouse button 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:18.629
 say crystals 

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:19.699
 and on a mac 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:23.959
 put it inside the home inside almeria in the profile folder is colored 

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:27.809
 in common profile more 

00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:30.089
 make the adjustment 

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:33.029
 what is necessary to do 

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.940
 putting up 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.279
 tito as a workspace to solve 

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:37.610
 i 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.839
 start to work 

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:40.059
 any problem 

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:41.499
 that yesterday for 

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:43.270
 can start 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.199
 There should not be any doubt in contacting the laboratory so that 

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.719
 let's explain how 

00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:48.259
 suddenly
