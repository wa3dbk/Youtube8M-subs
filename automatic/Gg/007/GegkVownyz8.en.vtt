00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:06.589 
another chicken feeder that I've

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.400 
another chicken feeder that I've
invented<00:00:08.570> so<00:00:09.570> I'll<00:00:09.630> get<00:00:09.750> these<00:00:09.900> containers<00:00:10.650> I

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
invented so I'll get these containers I

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.410 
invented so I'll get these containers I
get<00:00:13.410> these<00:00:13.559> containers<00:00:14.160> from<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.849> local

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
get these containers from a local

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.550 
get these containers from a local
restaurant<00:00:17.270> at<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.480> pub<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:20.060> they're<00:00:21.060> just

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
restaurant at a pub and they're just

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.660 
restaurant at a pub and they're just
plastic<00:00:23.000> fifteen<00:00:24.000> or<00:00:24.180> twenty<00:00:24.510> liter<00:00:25.670> will

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
plastic fifteen or twenty liter will

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.939 
plastic fifteen or twenty liter will
tote<00:00:27.119> that's<00:00:27.539> what<00:00:27.810> they<00:00:27.990> get<00:00:28.470> their<00:00:28.650> oil<00:00:28.680> and

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
tote that's what they get their oil and

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.010 
tote that's what they get their oil and
let's<00:00:31.949> give<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.099> screw<00:00:32.369> lid<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.790> top<00:00:33.020> and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
let's give a screw lid on the top and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.850 
let's give a screw lid on the top and
what<00:00:34.140> I've<00:00:34.260> done<00:00:34.530> with<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:35.840> I've<00:00:36.840> cut<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> 90

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
what I've done with it is I've cut a 90

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.069 
what I've done with it is I've cut a 90
millimeter<00:00:38.280> hole<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.420> side<00:00:40.579> also<00:00:42.050> cut<00:00:43.050> a

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
millimeter hole on the side also cut a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.470 
millimeter hole on the side also cut a
90<00:00:43.440> millimeter<00:00:43.860> hole<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.520> side<00:00:45.090> at<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
90 millimeter hole in the side at the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.150 
90 millimeter hole in the side at the
bottom<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.620> drum<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.750> then<00:00:48.920> I've<00:00:49.920> got<00:00:50.129> one

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
bottom of the drum and then I've got one

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.869 
bottom of the drum and then I've got one
of<00:00:50.340> these<00:00:50.520> which<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:52.219> flanged<00:00:53.219> 90<00:00:53.910> degree<00:00:55.879> 90

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
of these which is a flanged 90 degree 90

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.950 
of these which is a flanged 90 degree 90
millimeter<00:00:57.360> PVC<00:00:58.320> fitting<00:00:59.870> normally<00:01:01.160> normally

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
millimeter PVC fitting normally normally

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.020 
millimeter PVC fitting normally normally
this<00:01:03.960> part<00:01:04.290> comes<00:01:04.769> down<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.129> about<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
this part comes down to about here and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.420 
this part comes down to about here and
I've<00:01:06.150> cut<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.600> off

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
I've cut it off

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.730 
I've cut it off
I've<00:01:09.210> cut<00:01:09.450> about<00:01:09.659> probably<00:01:09.990> 20<00:01:10.229> millimeters

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
I've cut about probably 20 millimeters

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.580 
I've cut about probably 20 millimeters
off<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.189> it's<00:01:11.460> sort<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.390> flush<00:01:12.990> now<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
off so that it's sort of flush now the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.170 
off so that it's sort of flush now the
idea<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.750> that<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.960> will<00:01:16.290> go<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.640> hole<00:01:17.970> like

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
idea is that this will go on a hole like

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.550 
idea is that this will go on a hole like
this<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:19.970> push<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.150> right<00:01:21.330> down<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:22.409> there

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
this and push it right down in there

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.320 
this and push it right down in there
until<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.950> clicks<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:23.790> quite<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> tight

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
until it clicks in it's quite a tight

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.870 
until it clicks in it's quite a tight
fit<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.869> don't<00:01:25.680> think<00:01:25.920> I'll<00:01:26.070> need<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.460> glue<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
fit I don't think I'll need to glue it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.910 
fit I don't think I'll need to glue it
or<00:01:27.030> screw<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.930> could<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.590> wanted

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
or screw it but you could if you wanted

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.550 
or screw it but you could if you wanted
if<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.000> had<00:01:30.150> problems<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.140> hole<00:01:31.320> being

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
if you had problems with the hole being

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.390 
if you had problems with the hole being
too<00:01:31.740> big<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.820> could<00:01:33.060> place<00:01:33.390> some<00:01:33.720> screws<00:01:34.409> and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
too big you could place some screws and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.679 
too big you could place some screws and
these<00:01:35.579> screw<00:01:35.820> holes<00:01:35.850> around<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> edge<00:01:36.479> will

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
these screw holes around the edge will

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.179 
these screw holes around the edge will
run<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> bead<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.140> silicone<00:01:37.350> around<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.070> you

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
run a bead of silicone around it if you

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.100 
run a bead of silicone around it if you
wanted<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.670> don't<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:39.659> I'm<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.990> need

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
wanted I don't think I'm going to need

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.010 
wanted I don't think I'm going to need
to<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.470> pretty<00:01:40.710> tight<00:01:40.860> fit<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.280> there<00:01:41.460> so

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
to it's a pretty tight fit in there so

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.719 
to it's a pretty tight fit in there so
what<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.140> does<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.649> creates<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.189> little<00:01:44.430> area

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
what it does is it creates a little area

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.490 
what it does is it creates a little area
where<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.450> chicken<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.930> get<00:01:46.049> its<00:01:46.170> head<00:01:46.320> in

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
where the chicken can get its head in

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.420 
where the chicken can get its head in
and<00:01:46.680> pick<00:01:47.640> at<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.630> grain<00:01:49.140> which<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.860> feed<00:01:50.280> in

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
and pick at the grain which you feed in

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.690 
and pick at the grain which you feed in
through<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> top<00:01:50.939> here<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:53.430> grain

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
through the top here and the grain

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.020 
through the top here and the grain
should<00:01:54.240> only<00:01:54.479> ever<00:01:54.810> come<00:01:55.079> up<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.820> this<00:01:56.820> level

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
should only ever come up to this level

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.030 
should only ever come up to this level
so<00:01:57.719> I'm<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.409> try<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
so I'm just going to try it for the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.609 
so I'm just going to try it for the
first<00:01:59.250> time<00:01:59.689> I'm<00:02:00.750> opportun<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.259> camera<00:02:01.500> off

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
first time I'm opportun the camera off

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.319 
first time I'm opportun the camera off
now<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.100> I'll<00:02:02.159> fill<00:02:02.399> up<00:02:02.430> with<00:02:02.670> grain<00:02:03.030> and

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
now and I'll fill up with grain and

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.139 
now and I'll fill up with grain and
we'll<00:02:03.540> see<00:02:03.750> how<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.990> goes

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
we'll see how it goes

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.219 
we'll see how it goes
okay<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.210> I've<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.479> filled<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:06.930> up<00:02:07.049> with

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
okay so I've just filled this up with

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.820 
okay so I've just filled this up with
feed<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.840> using<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:09.929> pull<00:02:10.200> up<00:02:10.289> graph<00:02:10.530> my

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
feed and using this pull up graph my

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.100 
feed and using this pull up graph my
young<00:02:11.039> chicks<00:02:11.580> which<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.940> sort<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.209> a

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
young chicks which is sort of a

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.140 
young chicks which is sort of a
pelletized<00:02:14.120> or<00:02:15.120> granule<00:02:15.600> eyes<00:02:17.150> ground-up

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
pelletized or granule eyes ground-up

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.390 
pelletized or granule eyes ground-up
grain<00:02:18.590> with<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.650> few<00:02:19.830> minerals<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.280> things

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
grain with a few minerals and things

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.800 
grain with a few minerals and things
added<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:23.210> first<00:02:24.210> thing<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.420> noticed<00:02:24.690> when

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
added and first thing I noticed when

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.120 
added and first thing I noticed when
filling<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.590> was<00:02:25.710> quite<00:02:25.890> hard<00:02:26.100> to

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
filling this is it was quite hard to

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.740 
filling this is it was quite hard to
fill<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:26.760> I'm<00:02:26.880> gonna<00:02:27.000> have<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.240> set<00:02:27.480> up<00:02:27.570> some

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
fill so I'm gonna have to set up some

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.840 
fill so I'm gonna have to set up some
sort<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:28.050> funnel<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:29.280> top<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.760> allow

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
sort of a funnel on the top to allow

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.180 
sort of a funnel on the top to allow
easier<00:02:30.450> filling<00:02:30.840> or<00:02:31.020> cut<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> bigger<00:02:31.740> hole<00:02:31.980> on

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
easier filling or cut a bigger hole on

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.580 
easier filling or cut a bigger hole on
the<00:02:32.280> top<00:02:32.460> which<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.820> another<00:02:33.030> option<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:34.140> kind

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
the top which is another option I kind

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.000 
the top which is another option I kind
of<00:02:34.650> like<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.860> idea<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.310> funnel<00:02:35.550> just

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
of like the idea of a funnel just

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.170 
of like the idea of a funnel just
because<00:02:38.010> then<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.190> can<00:02:38.340> screw<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.700> lid<00:02:38.850> back<00:02:39.000> on

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
because then I can screw the lid back on

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.000 
because then I can screw the lid back on
a<00:02:39.360> lot<00:02:39.540> with<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.660> eating<00:02:39.959> mice<00:02:40.440> falling<00:02:40.890> in

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
a lot with it eating mice falling in

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.340 
a lot with it eating mice falling in
there<00:02:41.190> or<00:02:41.430> anything<00:02:42.120> like<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.420> second<00:02:43.200> thing

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
there or anything like that second thing

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.490 
there or anything like that second thing
I<00:02:43.410> noticed<00:02:43.740> was<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.300> took<00:02:45.480> probably<00:02:46.170> a

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
I noticed was that it took probably a

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.180 
I noticed was that it took probably a
good<00:02:46.709> half<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.520> this<00:02:47.700> 20<00:02:48.209> kilo<00:02:48.510> sack<00:02:49.200> which<00:02:50.010> is

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
good half of this 20 kilo sack which is

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.490 
good half of this 20 kilo sack which is
quite<00:02:50.490> a<00:02:50.520> lot<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.760> feed<00:02:51.020> it's<00:02:52.020> actually<00:02:52.350> not

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
quite a lot of feed it's actually not

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.060 
quite a lot of feed it's actually not
even<00:02:52.650> fully<00:02:53.390> filled<00:02:54.390> up<00:02:54.570> yet<00:02:54.840> there's<00:02:55.590> still<00:02:55.770> a

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
even fully filled up yet there's still a

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.430 
even fully filled up yet there's still a
bit<00:02:56.640> left<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.150> fill<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.750> was<00:02:57.930> just<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.230> little

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
bit left to fill it was just a little

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.960 
bit left to fill it was just a little
bit<00:02:58.530> hard<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.830> get<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.040> last<00:02:59.250> remaining<00:02:59.700> bit

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
bit hard to get the last remaining bit

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.270 
bit hard to get the last remaining bit
in<00:03:00.060> without<00:03:00.270> a<00:03:00.390> funnel<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:02.700> other<00:03:02.880> thing<00:03:03.150> that

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
in without a funnel the other thing that

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.820 
in without a funnel the other thing that
that<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.310> noticed<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.390> this<00:03:07.050> system

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
that I noticed is that the this system

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.680 
that I noticed is that the this system
down<00:03:07.980> here<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.340> working<00:03:08.670> beautifully

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
down here is working beautifully

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.620 
down here is working beautifully
we<00:03:10.020> can<00:03:10.170> just<00:03:10.380> see<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.650> grain<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:11.100> there<00:03:11.630> and

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
we can just see the grain in there and

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.360 
we can just see the grain in there and
it's<00:03:12.870> just<00:03:12.930> sitting<00:03:13.200> at<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.440> right<00:03:13.590> level<00:03:13.950> and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
it's just sitting at the right level and

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.509 
it's just sitting at the right level and
as<00:03:14.730> they<00:03:15.060> put<00:03:16.020> their<00:03:16.140> head<00:03:16.320> in<00:03:16.350> here<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.950> pick

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
as they put their head in here and pick

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.910 
as they put their head in here and pick
the<00:03:18.480> grain<00:03:18.660> will<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:19.049> stay<00:03:19.380> at<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.680> nice

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
the grain will just stay at that nice

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.789 
the grain will just stay at that nice
low<00:03:20.549> level<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.870> it'll<00:03:22.170> probably<00:03:22.350> need<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.680> be

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
low level so it'll probably need to be

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.680 
low level so it'll probably need to be
set<00:03:23.040> up<00:03:23.160> on<00:03:23.510> bricks<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:25.680> get<00:03:25.799> it<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.160> right

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
set up on bricks to get it to the right

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.229 
set up on bricks to get it to the right
height<00:03:27.690> for<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.140> chuck<00:03:29.130> for<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.820> chickens<00:03:30.120> to

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
height for the chuck for the chickens to

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.300 
height for the chuck for the chickens to
be<00:03:30.299> able<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.600> eat<00:03:30.769> but<00:03:31.769> all<00:03:31.890> in<00:03:32.040> all<00:03:32.100> I<00:03:32.160> think

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
be able to eat but all in all I think

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.440 
be able to eat but all in all I think
this<00:03:32.489> is<00:03:32.640> going<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.820> be<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:32.940> really<00:03:33.180> good<00:03:33.269> way<00:03:33.420> to

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
this is going to be a really good way to

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.120 
this is going to be a really good way to
feed<00:03:33.870> them<00:03:34.019> there's<00:03:34.530> going<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.709> be<00:03:34.769> no<00:03:34.920> problem

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
feed them there's going to be no problem

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.460 
feed them there's going to be no problem
with<00:03:35.400> them<00:03:35.580> scratching<00:03:36.200> they<00:03:37.200> certainly

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
with them scratching they certainly

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.440 
with them scratching they certainly
can't<00:03:37.769> poop<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.160> their<00:03:38.340> food<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:41.150> if<00:03:42.150> you

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
can't poop in their food the if you

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.130 
can't poop in their food the if you
sealed<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.560> edge<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.950> that<00:03:44.130> with<00:03:44.430> silicon<00:03:45.140> and

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
sealed the edge of that with silicon and

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.320 
sealed the edge of that with silicon and
put<00:03:46.830> a<00:03:46.860> little<00:03:47.100> shield<00:03:47.640> on<00:03:47.820> it<00:03:47.940> then<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.239> would

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
put a little shield on it then it would

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.930 
put a little shield on it then it would
even<00:03:48.630> be<00:03:48.660> good<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.170> leave<00:03:49.440> out<00:03:49.650> side<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.670> it

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
even be good to leave out side and it

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.390 
even be good to leave out side and it
probably<00:03:51.120> wouldn't<00:03:51.510> get<00:03:51.690> wet<00:03:52.280> because<00:03:53.280> all

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
probably wouldn't get wet because all

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.590 
probably wouldn't get wet because all
the<00:03:53.610> rest<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:53.910> it<00:03:54.000> sealed<00:03:55.549> so<00:03:56.549> yeah<00:03:57.390> I<00:03:57.420> think

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
the rest of it sealed so yeah I think

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.289 
the rest of it sealed so yeah I think
this<00:03:57.840> is<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:58.019> winner<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.830> think<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.790> total<00:03:59.970> cost

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
this is a winner I think the total cost

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.990 
this is a winner I think the total cost
was<00:04:00.510> about<00:04:00.600> six<00:04:00.989> dollars<00:04:01.200> for<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.880> 90<00:04:02.880> degree

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
was about six dollars for the 90 degree

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.090 
was about six dollars for the 90 degree
flange<00:04:03.510> fitting<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:05.340> drum<00:04:05.610> was<00:04:05.790> free<00:04:06.030> so

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
flange fitting the drum was free so

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.180 
flange fitting the drum was free so
really<00:04:08.100> cheap<00:04:08.310> way<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.489> make<00:04:08.760> a<00:04:08.790> really<00:04:09.299> large

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
really cheap way to make a really large

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.250 
really cheap way to make a really large
chicken<00:04:11.190> grain<00:04:11.610> feeder<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.209> hope<00:04:12.900> this<00:04:13.019> helped

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
chicken grain feeder I hope this helped

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.280 
chicken grain feeder I hope this helped
somebody<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.769> see<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.549> later

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
somebody and see you later

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.330 
somebody and see you later
so<00:04:16.290> I've<00:04:16.380> just<00:04:16.440> taken<00:04:16.739> this<00:04:17.010> into<00:04:17.190> the

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
so I've just taken this into the

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
seen this type of feeder before and as

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.220 
seen this type of feeder before and as
you<00:04:23.910> can<00:04:24.030> see

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
you can see

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.660

they<00:04:25.440> have<00:04:25.620> worked<00:04:25.830> it<00:04:25.950> out<00:04:26.040> straight<00:04:26.460> away<00:04:26.490> Oh

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
they have worked it out straight away Oh

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.430 
they have worked it out straight away Oh
bunny<00:04:26.940> just<00:04:27.240> literally<00:04:27.780> just<00:04:28.080> put<00:04:28.290> that<00:04:28.380> on

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
bunny just literally just put that on

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.630 
bunny just literally just put that on
the<00:04:28.650> floor<00:04:28.830> now<00:04:29.810> it's<00:04:30.810> up<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:31.170> the<00:04:31.410> leash<00:04:31.640> you

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
the floor now it's up to the leash you

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.870 
the floor now it's up to the leash you
can<00:04:32.730> see<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.030> feet<00:04:33.240> in<00:04:33.390> there<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:35.250> I<00:04:35.730> think

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
can see the feet in there so I think

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.650 
can see the feet in there so I think
it's<00:04:36.120> gonna<00:04:36.270> be<00:04:36.420> a<00:04:36.450> winner<00:04:38.330> now<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:39.510> I<00:04:39.600> know

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
it's gonna be a winner now that I know

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.470 
it's gonna be a winner now that I know
that<00:04:39.780> this<00:04:40.050> works<00:04:40.700> I'll<00:04:41.700> probably<00:04:41.940> get<00:04:42.180> some

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
that this works I'll probably get some

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.290 
that this works I'll probably get some
bigger<00:04:42.720> containers<00:04:43.760> that'll<00:04:44.760> take<00:04:44.940> maybe<00:04:45.150> a

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
bigger containers that'll take maybe a

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.200 
bigger containers that'll take maybe a
couple<00:04:45.540> of<00:04:45.690> feed<00:04:45.900> sacks<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:47.160> I'll<00:04:47.610> put<00:04:47.850> two<00:04:48.180> or

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
couple of feed sacks and I'll put two or

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.360 
couple of feed sacks and I'll put two or
three<00:04:48.360> of<00:04:49.310> these<00:04:50.310> on<00:04:50.940> each<00:04:51.060> side<00:04:52.010> I'm<00:04:53.010> thinking

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
three of these on each side I'm thinking

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.360 
three of these on each side I'm thinking
of<00:04:53.460> possibly<00:04:53.670> even<00:04:54.090> using<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:55.040> 200-liter<00:04:56.040> blue

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
of possibly even using a 200-liter blue

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.570 
of possibly even using a 200-liter blue
barrel<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:57.000> putting<00:04:57.690> these<00:04:58.280> you<00:04:59.280> know<00:04:59.370> maybe

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
barrel and putting these you know maybe

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.310 
barrel and putting these you know maybe
five<00:04:59.880> or<00:04:59.910> six<00:05:00.270> of<00:05:00.360> them<00:05:00.450> around<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:01.020> edge<00:05:01.140> of

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
five or six of them around the edge of

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.860 
five or six of them around the edge of
the<00:05:01.410> blue<00:05:01.590> barrel<00:05:01.860> a<00:05:02.420> plastic<00:05:03.420> barrel

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
the blue barrel a plastic barrel

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.130 
the blue barrel a plastic barrel
so<00:05:04.230> anyway<00:05:04.890> works<00:05:05.850> really<00:05:06.060> well<00:05:06.270> as<00:05:06.900> you<00:05:07.050> can

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
so anyway works really well as you can

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.430 
so anyway works really well as you can
