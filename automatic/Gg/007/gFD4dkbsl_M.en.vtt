00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 pegi 18 to some spectators 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.480
 could find the images that are going 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:18.420
 to follow violent or shocking 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:19.980
 here are warned hello everyone 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.020
 I hope you are doing well today 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.000
 I will introduce you to the swimmer 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.070
 the extreme is what is a woman in 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.249
 done who will try to really do 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.380
 incredible distances in money so 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.120
 you found that a little phew but you 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.510
 see that water currents do not 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.950
 are not really super nice with 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.059
 me 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.680
 this is a proof that I showed you 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.289
 that we can die 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.480
 and yes so that's not it's not done 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.300
 like that in five seconds actually no one 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.370
 just do not think that the waterfall 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.719
 can kill us and bash and kill me not 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.460
 badly of times so now I'm going 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.350
 try to make a perfect I'm going 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.269
 try to get down the whole structure 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.789
 which is going to be pretty impressive so 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.679
 it's gone but you'll see by 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.179
 you even that the water currents they 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.640
 are very very powerful about this kind of 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:08.340
 game in my opinion were not programmed 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.920
 for whom a little guy like me 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.930
 are waiting for this kind of challenge I think that 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.510
 you are it was simply ben I 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.460
 would say more for jet skis or for 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.250
 boats or things like that but 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.380
 in any case not for a human being who 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.910
 are throwing money like that 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.560
 you will see that it is enough 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.330
 captivating nevertheless to propose this 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.620
 kind of small challenges why do I you 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.060
 the propose what I know there is no 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.380
 badly of subscribers to me who are subscribers on 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.270
 machine too to see things 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.250
 simple things that touch a little 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.010
 little nature on geither not necessarily 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.660
 robberies not necessarily stuff 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.920
 violent but rather simple stuff I 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.210
 also know that I have mothers 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.130
 so that's after it can do them 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.800
 pleasure maybe to see that they 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.960
 can also try this kind of challenge if 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.970
 of course they want to rob a 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.040
 little bit of slopes and you'll see 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.270
 that it's not going to laugh 1 so we're going 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.890
 cross the second tier in no 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.870
 long time 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.520
 so I'm swimming with the 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.200
 swimmer of the extreme and loose by train 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.680
 to panic I tell myself it's not true if 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.500
 I magnify myself 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.100
 if I zoom in it's over for me so 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.100
 months ago that 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.660
 so here I brake a little bit I want 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.709
 not to advance abruptly 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.160
 look at how I'm trained apart 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.640
 the court back behind people 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.000
 could more I'm really bloated 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.319
 from all sides it looks like I am 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.730
 got into a washing machine so 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.370
 it's good the second the second 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.600
 waterfalls was successful so I tell you 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.720
 we wanted me to do gta I you 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.730
 will really propose everything you will see 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.110
 not necessarily 50 episodes of the same 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.010
 series but you will see all the time 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.450
 new things of which there are 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.650
 things that go a little bit more 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.750
 interesting than others well 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.620
 obviously so after doing everything on the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.790
 card sure there will be 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.380
 people who will be happy with others 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.959
 a little less but no matter I 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.100
 do the things that come to me 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.810
 the spirit so there I wanted to do 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.110
 a little swimmer of the extreme what I 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.670
 do not ever do they look at age like 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.440
 me it's a little bit an age and still 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.730
 be aware that if you want to swim 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.560
 especially with this character there we will say 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.180
 rather multiplayer brawl here you 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.970
 will you realize that the fund is not 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.560
 not very high that sometimes you go 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.570
 have foot you even walk on 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.720
 so we attack the third cap 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.269
 attention caution washing machine is 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.220
 back I'm super careful in 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.700
 did I brake a bit too without you I 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.459
 do not want me picked up my buttocks on 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.780
 the fleet yeah I brake a little 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.489
 I receive the fall I know 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.130
 that I can fall to the head forward and 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.329
 smashed it to me so watch this is it 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.560
 that I wanted to explain so that's fine 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.570
 I even get phone calls 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.980
 during that time so we can not 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.239
 to force ag times but sometimes I run 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.280
 I wanted to limit to mini triathlon 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.810
 and I will try to do a triathlon 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.090
 with subscribers too I have a small 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.799
 idea that came to me by chance 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.660
 you will also see that it will be 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.400
 funny enough what I then proposed 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.200
 I hope they will take up the challenge 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.799
 so after if you want to know how 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.150
 it happens 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.739
 join me on my social networks 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.730
 facebook twitter and i will hold you at 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.670
 running as soon as I'm doing sessions 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.280
 subscribers and after I invite you in 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.799
 place function there are fourth 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.209
 obstacles there are the rocks so there 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.859
 I worry a little to the elderly cells 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.610
 bankruptcy really hit him happily 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.970
 they 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.760
 that allah had won with his back but 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.130
 it's too funny what's so much 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.400
 of improbable things about this kind of 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.830
 game so there I swim again I tried 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.010
 to simply do a little bit 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.240
 apnea look at me this little bug in 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.760
 did I have nothing there was no 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.500
 rock did not have that kind of obstacles in 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.570
 right in the middle of the map but he 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.390
 turned out that it still put me 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.470
 standing 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.810
 so we're almost there it's at 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.880
 bridge level that I actually gain on 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.720
 was going to see 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.610
 so here I am diving a 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.580
 little so I'm still driven rather 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.810
 inspired by a camp by a very current 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.430
 very very very rebel to what I see 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.940
 but believe me it is that I fight is 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.310
 also for my survival there I fight is 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:03.060
 went swimming a little bit go swimmer 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.930
 from the extreme we only after for those who 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.250
 ask me why I play 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.450
 girl character that's the reason is 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.160
 simple is that at first I played with 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.290
 a boy what happened is that 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.450
 you get to the 110 grade I was banned at 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.830
 because of a stupid geek ie in 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.479
 does how to have money in 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.820
 unlimited so I did it once 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.770
 and it showed me romania that sam has 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.360
 banned my character and suddenly I 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.860
 am created a girl character and I 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.720
 really more appreciated to play with a 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.620
 girl who had gamek why because 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.360
 that a girl is much more 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.220
 interesting is that all the guys you 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.510
 run behind everyone is your 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.669
 car everyone is nice with 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.110
 you're a lot more fun you're a guy 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.520
 in fact it's a guy what 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.229
 and in addition with the plug can do 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.540
 many more things and especially that 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.790
 I have a female audience at 30% 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.560
 So it gives them pleasure as that that 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.300
 I propose a girl so after I am 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.800
 not taking my head yeah 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.970
 you have to play with a vaugeois boy 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.919
 that a girl I am not mine and 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.030
 like aig far from here I am very manly 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.130
 but the problem is that I loved 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.479
 also offered a little bit of everything and I 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.919
 do not take my head in person loving 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.820
 for me it's just a character 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.040
 nothing more 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.520
 that's why I find that a lot 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.360
 funniest with a girl but you 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.710
 see everything I'm going to try 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.190
 to make the threads recalibrated that makes 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.260
 succeed 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.580
 I have a lot of challenges for you and also 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.430
 the boys are you going to see who we are going 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.440
 do a lot of things nice enough 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.450
 so in any case there we managed our 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.980
 challenge so for those who would like to do 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.810
 a little dive damage that I have 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.590
 not found where I do not know if it exists 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.390
 Actually 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.820
 oh that may be a false rumor that 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.610
 answered on the web found himself in 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.120
 makes oxygen bottles and to make 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.400
 diving 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.390
 I saw that somewhere I do not know where 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.010
 a while ago 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.050
 maybe I'm wrong maybe that 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.450
 it was parish priest do not hesitate a 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.770
 really dia if it's real if it's by 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.330
 she or not because I arrived 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.550
 I would have liked to go diving 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.930
 gold underwater since the soma of course 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.880
 he can dive that capacity there 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.040
 but it's very limited that I would like 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.060
 to do well just apnea actually see 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.310
 a little coral but I think 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.200
 maybe it's solo perhaps and 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.640
 so here I do not know so there I 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.350
