00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.279
 hello youtube friends in this video 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:11.019
 tutorial I will teach you to be a channel and 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.019
 a tnt truck 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.570
 and you throw automatic arrows in 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.460
 Minecraft 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.490
 Well the first thing that has to have the 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.330
 rest a lever repeater 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:27.560
 redstone water and blocks and tnt good 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.800
 they have to make a size tower 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.800
 wanted 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.500
 and then they have to make two more arms 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.040
 or less at height 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.750
 d 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.750
 8 what is a little more 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.969
 also of the desired length 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.880
 down those two arms make another one 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.410
 and I have to go once formed then in 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.410
 the tip makes the grades more 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.180
 and they will have something like that 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:13.090
 and 4 hours ago 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.380
 well then they have to put the 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.380
 remains that the sides 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.340
 and do it more or less that you have three 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.679
 free cubes after this other side 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.979
 they put the redstone repeaters put 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.979
 8 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.600
 of those 8 the first 6 have what 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.600
 and stay until the end 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.560
 well after that they put remains to the 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.930
 final 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.760
 well down here put these blocks 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.930
 or any other they want 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.930
 they put water 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.409
 and they put a lever line now with the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.520
 tnt 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.520
 full on this from tnt 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.080
 and you have to give more the canyon 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.910
 this works like this is when everything is active 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.850
 the levers are activated all the 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.800
 principal lieutenants each in the water and 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.780
 when it explodes they will not be effects here 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.540
 and they're going to push these last three and it's going 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.930
 to explode where it falls well 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.930
 works 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.320
 and there you have the result 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.330
 well this is so when they want to throw 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.370
 again they just have to turn off the whole 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.700
 the system and start loading it back 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.700
 the tnt 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.950
 it's not necessarily that it's gold in 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:45.019
 the structure can be any 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.080
 other material that does have to have 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.390
 water because yes no 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.819
 is going to treat everything because it is not going to 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.480
 reverse the effect of the tnt 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.189
 well this canyon is built and 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.120
 Now I'm going to teach you how to make the strip 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.120
 automatic arrows 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.640
 to need an arrow dispenser 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.750
 redstone torch redstone the repeater 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.500
 of rest a lever 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.500
 and blocks 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.730
 well this can also be created from 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:24.790
 any material except then one of 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.790
 that does not burn also needs lava 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.090
 they are going to have to 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.030
 put two blocks 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.460
 down here 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:40.220
 a lever and they were going to have to put them 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.310
 Reston lamps on the sides of the 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.100
 block then network are up and there 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.260
 hook this as you will see this arises 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.590
 effect they have to press the button and 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.590
 ready 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.810
 now they have to 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.469
 that go up a bit so the arrow will 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.469
 further away 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.410
 then they do so they can do it the long 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:10.550
 who want can do it with 78 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.550
 repeaters of these shooters 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:20.959
 and place them is not like that one more and so 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.410
 now if they place it they put it 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.180
 repeaters here 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:31.100
 and putting the rest 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.100
 now they will have to 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.150
 to put what is so that the lava does not 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.479
 touch them to this and you do not see them in 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.479
 arrows 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.210
 and they're going to have to put this 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.860
 and that they will understand that if you are not 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.860
 arrows 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.230
 and put the lava on 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:12.490
 now I think everything should be fine 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:15.840
 then and you have to do oppositions 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.840
 to make a disaster 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.960
 and now I think it should work good 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:26.540
 we turn this on and as you will see the arrows 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.450
 they come out without stopping and you can fill them 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:32.840
 the dispensers with all the car that 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:35.150
 while fuller want better and we 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.560
 are finishing and will stretch all up 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.180
 that they are finished later it is going to be like this 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.970
 how is it staying now 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.979
 and well then together the arrows and 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.169
 this is like a system a mechanism of 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:50.449
 defense for your house or for what 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:52.710
 you need automatic and simple to make 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.770
 well this was it for this video 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:06:00.050
 Minecraft tutorial I wait for you in a 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.050
 next video and see you later
