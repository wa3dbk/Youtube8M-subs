hey how's it going it's Shawn Bradshaw
from<00:00:27.360> cyber<00:00:27.630> Fred<00:00:27.930> comm<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.279> lesson

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
from cyber Fred comm and in this lesson

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.519 
from cyber Fred comm and in this lesson
I'm<00:00:29.760> going<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.940> show<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.420> ultimate<00:00:30.630> rock

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
I'm going to show you the ultimate rock

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.040 
I'm going to show you the ultimate rock
scale<00:00:32.369> pattern<00:00:32.940> which<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.809> what<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:33.989> just

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
scale pattern which is what I just

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.939 
scale pattern which is what I just
played<00:00:35.239> scale<00:00:36.239> patterns<00:00:36.720> are<00:00:37.050> kind<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.440> little

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
played scale patterns are kind of little

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.100 
played scale patterns are kind of little
melodic<00:00:38.430> fragments<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.600> use<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
melodic fragments that you can use in a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.070 
melodic fragments that you can use in a
lot<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.769> different<00:00:41.040> ways<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:42.180> solos<00:00:42.720> and

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
lot of different ways in your solos and

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.710 
lot of different ways in your solos and
you<00:00:43.949> will<00:00:44.100> never<00:00:44.370> play<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.729> solo<00:00:45.089> where<00:00:45.540> you're

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
you will never play a solo where you're

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.420 
you will never play a solo where you're
doing<00:00:45.989> exactly<00:00:46.470> what<00:00:46.589> I<00:00:46.739> was<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.129> playing

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
doing exactly what I was just playing

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.759 
doing exactly what I was just playing
all<00:00:47.790> the<00:00:48.000> way<00:00:48.089> through<00:00:48.540> what's<00:00:49.199> gonna<00:00:49.320> happen

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
all the way through what's gonna happen

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.710 
all the way through what's gonna happen
is<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.070> you're<00:00:50.159> gonna<00:00:50.280> kind<00:00:51.150> of<00:00:51.180> put<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.629> in

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
is that you're gonna kind of put it in

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.369 
is that you're gonna kind of put it in
little<00:00:52.019> different<00:00:52.309> places<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.640> know

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
little different places you know

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.450 
little different places you know
intermix<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.739> different<00:00:55.949> licks<00:00:56.280> you

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
intermix it with different licks you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.369 
intermix it with different licks you
know<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.909> other<00:00:57.089> scale<00:00:57.479> patterns<00:00:58.019> and<00:00:58.320> other

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
know and other scale patterns and other

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.969 
know and other scale patterns and other
scale<00:00:58.739> fragments<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.610> things<00:00:59.790> like<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.059> so

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
scale fragments and things like that so

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.130 
scale fragments and things like that so
let's<00:01:01.979> go<00:01:02.070> ahead<00:01:02.220> and<00:01:02.460> take<00:01:02.729> a<00:01:02.760> look<00:01:03.180> at<00:01:03.479> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
let's go ahead and take a look at the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.789 
let's go ahead and take a look at the
pattern<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.860> break<00:01:05.190> it<00:01:05.369> down<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.799> all

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
pattern and break it down for you all

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:08.960 
pattern and break it down for you all
right<00:01:07.950> let<00:01:08.159> me<00:01:08.220> kind<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.640> play<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
right let me kind of just play the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:51.690 
right let me kind of just play the
pattern<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.750> slow

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.640 

now<00:01:52.700> this<00:01:52.880> whole<00:01:53.150> pattern<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:54.290> way<00:01:54.410> I'm

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
now this whole pattern the way I'm

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.680 
now this whole pattern the way I'm
playing<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.280> I'm<00:01:55.400> playing<00:01:55.550> it<00:01:55.820> out<00:01:55.940> of<00:01:56.030> a<00:01:56.180> basic

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
playing it I'm playing it out of a basic

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.920 
playing it I'm playing it out of a basic
C<00:01:57.560> minor<00:01:57.890> pentatonic<00:01:58.430> scale<00:01:59.119> here<00:01:59.510> at<00:01:59.720> the

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
C minor pentatonic scale here at the

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:09.130 
C minor pentatonic scale here at the
eighth<00:02:00.080> fret<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:07.209> you<00:02:08.209> know<00:02:08.330> there's<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.959> few

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
eighth fret and you know there's a few

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.080 
eighth fret and you know there's a few
different<00:02:09.380> fingerings<00:02:09.800> that<00:02:09.920> people<00:02:10.550> use

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
different fingerings that people use

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.350 
different fingerings that people use
commonly<00:02:11.870> for<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.380> I'm<00:02:12.830> using<00:02:13.370> my<00:02:13.670> first<00:02:14.000> and

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
commonly for that I'm using my first and

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.720 
commonly for that I'm using my first and
third<00:02:14.780> fingers<00:02:15.290> on<00:02:15.620> these<00:02:16.070> top<00:02:16.430> two<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
third fingers on these top two the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.000 
third fingers on these top two the
strings<00:02:17.209> because<00:02:17.870> that's<00:02:18.050> very<00:02:18.170> common<00:02:18.860> when

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
strings because that's very common when

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.520 
strings because that's very common when
you're<00:02:19.100> playing<00:02:19.459> kind<00:02:20.300> of<00:02:20.420> rock<00:02:20.690> blues<00:02:21.080> and

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
you're playing kind of rock blues and

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.320 
you're playing kind of rock blues and
you're<00:02:21.620> doing<00:02:21.860> some<00:02:22.040> bends<00:02:24.940> things<00:02:25.940> like<00:02:26.120> that

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
you're doing some bends things like that

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.510 
you're doing some bends things like that
it's<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.989> lot<00:02:27.140> easier<00:02:27.200> for<00:02:27.590> leverage<00:02:28.160> for

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
it's a lot easier for leverage for

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.490 
it's a lot easier for leverage for
getting<00:02:28.820> you're<00:02:29.030> keeping<00:02:29.690> your<00:02:29.810> thumb<00:02:30.020> up<00:02:30.260> and

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
getting you're keeping your thumb up and

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.590 
getting you're keeping your thumb up and
so<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:30.739> end<00:02:30.950> up<00:02:31.040> using<00:02:31.220> your<00:02:31.459> first<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.030> third

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
so you end up using your first and third

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.390 
so you end up using your first and third
fingers<00:02:32.989> here<00:02:33.290> rather<00:02:33.500> than<00:02:33.799> first<00:02:34.130> and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
fingers here rather than first and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.370 
fingers here rather than first and
fourth<00:02:34.670> fingers<00:02:35.030> but<00:02:35.450> we'll<00:02:36.230> certainly

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
fourth fingers but we'll certainly

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.949 
fourth fingers but we'll certainly
practice<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.100> scale<00:02:37.430> pattern<00:02:37.790> using<00:02:38.630> both

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
practice this scale pattern using both

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.300 
practice this scale pattern using both
fingerings<00:02:39.560> for<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.950> scale<00:02:40.480> but<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:43.010> whole

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
fingerings for that scale but the whole

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.440 
fingerings for that scale but the whole
idea<00:02:43.580> of<00:02:44.320> this<00:02:45.320> pattern<00:02:46.310> is<00:02:46.820> that<00:02:47.299> we're

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
idea of this pattern is that we're

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.280 
idea of this pattern is that we're
playing<00:02:48.370> three<00:02:49.370> notes<00:02:49.670> in<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.660> scale<00:02:50.810> going

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
playing three notes in the scale going

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.229 
playing three notes in the scale going
down<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.799> scale<00:02:52.100> so<00:02:52.280> we<00:02:52.370> go<00:02:54.820> those<00:02:55.820> first<00:02:56.060> two

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
down the scale so we go those first two

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.060 
down the scale so we go those first two
notes<00:02:56.510> I'm<00:02:56.750> playing<00:02:56.780> I'm<00:02:57.260> doing<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.650> pull<00:02:57.920> off

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
notes I'm playing I'm doing a pull off

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.010 
notes I'm playing I'm doing a pull off
between<00:02:58.489> my<00:02:58.730> third<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.180> first<00:02:59.390> fingers

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.350 

and<00:03:03.140> then<00:03:03.650> I<00:03:03.680> start<00:03:04.160> on<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:06.290> second<00:03:06.860> note<00:03:07.360> down

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
and then I start on the second note down

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.790 
and then I start on the second note down
in<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.630> scale<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.020> I'm<00:03:09.110> doing<00:03:09.440> this<00:03:09.620> whole

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
in the scale and I'm doing this whole

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.500 
in the scale and I'm doing this whole
pattern<00:03:10.100> starting<00:03:10.760> from<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:10.940> highest<00:03:11.300> note

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
pattern starting from the highest note

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.940 
pattern starting from the highest note
in<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:12.140> scale<00:03:13.240> down<00:03:14.240> three<00:03:14.660> then<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.560> second

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
in the scale down three then the second

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.930 
in the scale down three then the second
highest<00:03:17.470> down<00:03:18.470> three<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.130> then<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.670> next

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
highest down three and then the next

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.220 
highest down three and then the next
highest<00:03:21.340> down<00:03:22.340> three<00:03:22.760> notes<00:03:23.080> but<00:03:24.080> what

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
highest down three notes but what

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.650 
highest down three notes but what
happens<00:03:24.620> is<00:03:24.830> for<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.790> pull<00:03:26.750> offs<00:03:27.340> each<00:03:28.360> set<00:03:29.360> of

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
happens is for the pull offs each set of

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.140 
happens is for the pull offs each set of
two<00:03:30.460> kind<00:03:31.460> of<00:03:31.660> patterns<00:03:33.340> we<00:03:34.340> start<00:03:34.700> off<00:03:34.850> with<00:03:35.120> a

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
two kind of patterns we start off with a

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.180 
two kind of patterns we start off with a
pull<00:03:35.630> off<00:03:35.810> on<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:36.110> first<00:03:36.440> string<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:39.560> then

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
pull off on the first string and then

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.070 
pull off on the first string and then
when<00:03:40.430> we<00:03:40.550> do<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.700> next<00:03:41.000> pattern<00:03:41.540> what<00:03:41.720> happens

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
when we do the next pattern what happens

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.080 
when we do the next pattern what happens
we<00:03:42.380> play<00:03:42.710> a<00:03:42.740> note<00:03:43.040> on<00:03:43.220> these<00:03:43.370> higher<00:03:43.610> strings

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
we play a note on these higher strings

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.150 
we play a note on these higher strings
and<00:03:44.330> then<00:03:44.720> do<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.080> pull<00:03:45.320> off<00:03:45.470> on<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.800> second

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
and then do the pull off on the second

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:54.790 
and then do the pull off on the second
string<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:47.020> whole<00:03:48.020> sequence<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:53.680> then<00:03:54.680> we

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
string the whole sequence and then we

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.390 
string the whole sequence and then we
just<00:03:54.980> take<00:03:55.250> that<00:03:55.280> down<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:57.110> entire<00:03:57.440> scale<00:03:58.010> and

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
just take that down the entire scale and

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.280 
just take that down the entire scale and
there's<00:03:58.820> sometimes<00:03:59.060> when<00:03:59.540> I'm<00:03:59.690> using<00:03:59.930> my

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
there's sometimes when I'm using my

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.370 
there's sometimes when I'm using my
third<00:04:00.830> finger<00:04:01.130> on<00:04:01.760> this<00:04:02.660> note<00:04:02.900> on<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.350> third

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
third finger on this note on the third

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.780 
third finger on this note on the third
string<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:03.980> there's<00:04:04.160> sometimes<00:04:04.340> when<00:04:04.700> I'm

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
string and there's sometimes when I'm

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.150 
string and there's sometimes when I'm
using<00:04:04.940> my<00:04:05.150> second<00:04:05.600> finger<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:05.900> I<00:04:06.050> put<00:04:06.350> in<00:04:06.500> the

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
using my second finger and I put in the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.520 
using my second finger and I put in the
fingering<00:04:07.580> that<00:04:07.700> I'm<00:04:07.850> using<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:09.350> most

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
fingering that I'm using and you most

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.170 
fingering that I'm using and you most
certainly<00:04:09.680> can<00:04:10.070> experiment<00:04:10.670> around<00:04:11.030> with

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
certainly can experiment around with

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:21.210 
certainly can experiment around with
fingerings<00:04:11.630> but<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:12.380> way<00:04:12.500> I<00:04:12.530> do<00:04:12.709> it<00:04:12.890> is<00:04:13.160> I<00:04:13.400> go

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.850 

to<00:04:22.220> sequence<00:04:23.080> now<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.169> other<00:04:24.410> thing<00:04:24.650> that<00:04:24.680> I

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
to sequence now the other thing that I

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.159 
to sequence now the other thing that I
was<00:04:25.070> doing<00:04:25.430> in<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.270> very<00:04:26.540> beginning<00:04:26.960> of<00:04:27.050> the

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
was doing in the very beginning of the

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.800 
was doing in the very beginning of the
lesson<00:04:27.350> is<00:04:27.950> I<00:04:28.250> was<00:04:28.610> playing<00:04:28.880> the<00:04:29.060> exact<00:04:29.540> same

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
lesson is I was playing the exact same

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.040 
lesson is I was playing the exact same
scale<00:04:30.380> pattern<00:04:30.880> but<00:04:31.880> doing<00:04:32.660> some<00:04:32.900> different

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
scale pattern but doing some different

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.320 
scale pattern but doing some different
things<00:04:33.370> rhythmically<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.640> first<00:04:35.030> way<00:04:35.300> I

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
things rhythmically the first way I

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.600 
things rhythmically the first way I
played<00:04:35.900> it<00:04:36.110> I<00:04:36.320> was<00:04:36.830> using<00:04:37.280> what<00:04:37.460> are<00:04:37.490> called

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
played it I was using what are called

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.610 
played it I was using what are called
eighth<00:04:38.120> note<00:04:38.540> triplets<00:04:39.140> and<00:04:39.320> an<00:04:39.440> eighth<00:04:39.590> note

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
eighth note triplets and an eighth note

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.610 
eighth note triplets and an eighth note
triplet<00:04:40.280> is<00:04:40.400> where<00:04:40.610> I'm<00:04:40.730> playing<00:04:41.050> three<00:04:42.050> times

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
triplet is where I'm playing three times

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.420 
triplet is where I'm playing three times
in<00:04:43.190> every<00:04:43.669> beat<00:04:43.880> so<00:04:44.150> it'd<00:04:44.240> be<00:04:44.270> like<00:04:44.390> this<00:04:48.430> all

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
in every beat so it'd be like this all

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.700 
in every beat so it'd be like this all
right<00:04:49.810> so<00:04:50.810> here<00:04:51.320> let<00:04:51.590> me<00:04:51.620> kind<00:04:51.890> of<00:04:51.980> play<00:04:52.250> that

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
right so here let me kind of play that

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.230 
right so here let me kind of play that
scale<00:04:54.710> pattern<00:04:54.740> with<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.400> jam<00:04:55.669> track<00:04:55.910> again

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
scale pattern with the jam track again

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.060 
scale pattern with the jam track again
so<00:04:56.450> you<00:04:56.540> kind<00:04:56.750> of<00:04:56.840> hear<00:04:57.530> that<00:04:57.770> where<00:04:57.950> I'm

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
so you kind of hear that where I'm

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:17.100 
so you kind of hear that where I'm
playing<00:04:58.430> those<00:04:58.730> groups<00:04:59.120> of<00:04:59.330> three<00:05:00.310> triplets

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.499 

and<00:05:18.430> then<00:05:19.430> the<00:05:19.550> other<00:05:19.729> way<00:05:20.060> that<00:05:20.270> I<00:05:20.300> was

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
and then the other way that I was

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.839 
and then the other way that I was
playing<00:05:20.780> it<00:05:21.050> was<00:05:21.229> using<00:05:21.620> sixteenth<00:05:22.250> notes<00:05:22.580> and

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
playing it was using sixteenth notes and

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.180 
playing it was using sixteenth notes and
since<00:05:23.120> this<00:05:23.690> whole<00:05:23.900> scale<00:05:24.289> pattern<00:05:24.770> is<00:05:24.949> built

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
since this whole scale pattern is built

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.189 
since this whole scale pattern is built
around<00:05:25.340> going<00:05:25.819> down<00:05:26.090> three<00:05:26.629> notes<00:05:26.870> in<00:05:27.050> the

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
around going down three notes in the

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.230 
around going down three notes in the
scale<00:05:27.349> what<00:05:27.770> happens<00:05:28.159> is<00:05:28.400> the<00:05:28.849> whole<00:05:29.000> thing

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
scale what happens is the whole thing

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.480 
scale what happens is the whole thing
gets<00:05:29.419> displaced<00:05:29.930> a<00:05:30.289> little<00:05:30.530> bit<00:05:30.710> but<00:05:30.949> has<00:05:31.460> a

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
gets displaced a little bit but has a

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.040 
gets displaced a little bit but has a
kind<00:05:31.789> of<00:05:31.849> cool<00:05:32.090> sound<00:05:32.449> and<00:05:32.629> you<00:05:32.690> can<00:05:32.810> use

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
kind of cool sound and you can use

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.050 
kind of cool sound and you can use
either<00:05:33.530> one<00:05:33.919> so<00:05:34.520> here<00:05:34.699> it<00:05:34.759> is<00:05:34.849> for<00:05:35.030> the

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
either one so here it is for the

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:50.409 
either one so here it is for the
sixteenth<00:05:35.539> notes<00:05:48.340> and<00:05:49.340> so<00:05:49.520> for<00:05:50.120> this<00:05:50.210> whole

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
sixteenth notes and so for this whole

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.439 
sixteenth notes and so for this whole
thing<00:05:50.449> I<00:05:51.229> don't<00:05:51.740> end<00:05:52.219> up<00:05:52.340> ever<00:05:52.610> going<00:05:53.090> down<00:05:53.270> to

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
thing I don't end up ever going down to

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:54.790 
thing I don't end up ever going down to
the<00:05:53.569> sixth<00:05:53.870> string<00:05:54.020> just<00:05:54.199> because<00:05:54.409> it<00:05:54.530> ends<00:05:54.740> up

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
the sixth string just because it ends up

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.779 
the sixth string just because it ends up
being<00:05:54.979> a<00:05:55.099> little<00:05:55.340> bit<00:05:55.430> more<00:05:55.580> awkward

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
being a little bit more awkward

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.969 
being a little bit more awkward
fingering<00:05:56.479> and<00:05:56.659> you<00:05:57.169> most<00:05:57.349> certainly<00:05:57.469> could

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
fingering and you most certainly could

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.129 
fingering and you most certainly could
play<00:05:58.430> around<00:05:58.669> with<00:05:58.909> that<00:05:59.060> but<00:05:59.330> I'm<00:05:59.449> showing

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
play around with that but I'm showing

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:02.589 
play around with that but I'm showing
you<00:06:00.259> where<00:06:00.740> you<00:06:00.979> might<00:06:01.009> kind<00:06:01.669> of<00:06:01.789> practically

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
you where you might kind of practically

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:04.689 
you where you might kind of practically
play<00:06:02.870> this<00:06:03.080> in<00:06:03.349> playing<00:06:03.919> a<00:06:04.069> solo<00:06:04.280> and<00:06:04.550> that's

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
play this in playing a solo and that's

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.749 
play this in playing a solo and that's
usually<00:06:05.060> the<00:06:05.090> top<00:06:05.569> five<00:06:05.900> strings<00:06:06.319> and<00:06:06.620> so<00:06:07.159> once

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 
usually the top five strings and so once

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:11.279 
usually the top five strings and so once
I<00:06:07.879> reach<00:06:08.530> down<00:06:09.530> here<00:06:09.800> at<00:06:09.919> the<00:06:10.039> fifth<00:06:10.279> string

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
I reach down here at the fifth string

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:20.129 
I reach down here at the fifth string
all<00:06:12.289> I'm<00:06:12.529> doing<00:06:12.800> is<00:06:12.830> reversing<00:06:13.310> directions

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.420 

right<00:06:21.139> now<00:06:21.319> what<00:06:21.500> I'm<00:06:21.590> gonna<00:06:21.710> do<00:06:21.919> is<00:06:22.130> I'm<00:06:22.310> gonna

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
right now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.969 
right now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
just<00:06:23.120> take<00:06:23.419> a<00:06:23.479> little<00:06:23.750> solo<00:06:24.169> I'm<00:06:24.409> gonna<00:06:24.620> stick

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
just take a little solo I'm gonna stick

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:26.649 
just take a little solo I'm gonna stick
just<00:06:25.219> with<00:06:25.400> that<00:06:25.430> minor<00:06:25.759> pentatonic<00:06:26.180> scale

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
just with that minor pentatonic scale

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:28.930 
just with that minor pentatonic scale
keep<00:06:26.930> it<00:06:27.110> simple<00:06:27.560> but<00:06:28.430> I'm<00:06:28.520> gonna<00:06:28.699> try<00:06:28.909> to

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
keep it simple but I'm gonna try to

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.490 
keep it simple but I'm gonna try to
throw<00:06:29.419> in<00:06:29.870> that<00:06:30.650> scale<00:06:31.099> pattern<00:06:31.159> and<00:06:31.729> and<00:06:32.500> you

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
throw in that scale pattern and and you

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.830 
throw in that scale pattern and and you
know<00:06:33.940> intermix<00:06:34.940> it<00:06:35.090> with<00:06:35.240> some<00:06:35.419> other<00:06:35.569> licks

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
know intermix it with some other licks

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.300 
know intermix it with some other licks
and<00:06:36.050> things<00:06:36.259> so<00:06:36.409> you<00:06:36.500> can<00:06:36.529> kind<00:06:36.860> of<00:06:36.949> hear<00:06:37.129> how

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
and things so you can kind of hear how

00:06:37.310 --> 00:07:12.640 
and things so you can kind of hear how
it's<00:06:37.490> used<00:06:37.669> out<00:06:37.879> in<00:06:37.969> the<00:06:38.029> real<00:06:38.180> world

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:12.650 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.820 

okay<00:07:13.680> so<00:07:14.930> sometimes<00:07:15.930> it's<00:07:16.110> hard<00:07:16.259> to<00:07:16.319> have<00:07:16.770> to

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 
okay so sometimes it's hard to have to

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.909 
okay so sometimes it's hard to have to
think<00:07:17.310> about<00:07:18.020> demonstrating<00:07:19.020> and<00:07:19.560> using<00:07:19.830> that

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 
think about demonstrating and using that

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:22.100 
think about demonstrating and using that
scale<00:07:20.250> pattern<00:07:20.280> but<00:07:20.879> hopefully<00:07:21.780> that<00:07:21.960> gave

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.110 
scale pattern but hopefully that gave

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.230 
scale pattern but hopefully that gave
you<00:07:22.289> a<00:07:22.349> little<00:07:22.650> idea<00:07:22.860> of<00:07:23.159> how<00:07:23.219> you<00:07:23.370> might<00:07:23.639> kind

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
you a little idea of how you might kind

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.029 
you a little idea of how you might kind
of<00:07:24.330> use<00:07:24.509> it<00:07:24.689> you're<00:07:24.840> not<00:07:24.960> going<00:07:25.169> to<00:07:25.229> just<00:07:25.740> run

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 
of use it you're not going to just run

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:27.559 
of use it you're not going to just run
the<00:07:26.279> whole<00:07:26.460> thing<00:07:26.490> you're<00:07:27.150> just<00:07:27.180> gonna<00:07:27.360> be

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:27.569 
the whole thing you're just gonna be

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:30.559 
the whole thing you're just gonna be

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:30.569 
using little fragments so have fun with

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:40.810 
using little fragments so have fun with
your<00:07:30.719> new<00:07:30.840> scale<00:07:31.229> pattern<00:07:31.710> have<00:07:32.219> a<00:07:32.279> good<00:07:32.490> one
