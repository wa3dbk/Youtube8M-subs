00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
degrees that should be that should be

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.450 
degrees that should be that should be
just<00:05:09.199> fine<00:05:09.500> and<00:05:09.710> we'll<00:05:09.830> check<00:05:10.039> on<00:05:10.250> it<00:05:10.400> every

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
just fine and we'll check on it every

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.850 
just fine and we'll check on it every
every<00:05:11.360> half<00:05:11.510> hour<00:05:11.720> so<00:05:11.990> just<00:05:12.260> because<00:05:12.380> we<00:05:12.530> can't

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
every half hour so just because we can't

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.420 
every half hour so just because we can't
help<00:05:13.039> it
