00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.360
 let's start with fishing techniques 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.360
 we started with Martin carving that we are in the month of January 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.589
 and it's what we have more hours 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:21.150
 others of the triple assemblies that will serve us so much for the panama for the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 drought as for the cult 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.210
 let's show macaronesia as flexible as possible 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.259
 for when we see the drift 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.490
 take advantage 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.490
 the movement of the waves 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.520
 and now the ancient function that we used to do in Cordoba 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.390
 We are going to be the first premium club business link 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.470
 one round 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.950
 two laps 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.570
 and now always a little touch of your team 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.230
 by the tip of the tongue 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.230
 we squeeze 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.860
 nick fury for the desert 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.180
 and is about 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.230
 and added us 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.230
 we will take the carabiner 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.320
 we passed it 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.140
 of the 20 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.140
 one round 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.760
 another point 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.770
 we do not have 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.770
 ready 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.130
 yes de vido el indes olivo 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.130
 the cosmos 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.530
 what we have seen since this is impossible 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.540
 what is this efe 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.880
 sotelo 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.640
 shortly after 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.880
 the species 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.290
 for let's oppose 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.569
 one of the birds we will set track and bird 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.489
 with difference of this one 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.959
 ap you do not wear bibs tested I'm like a little bird to claim 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.189
 can be 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:24.369
 to calama ap ap somalia and period 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.879
 It can also be explained to us 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.649
 the motives 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:33.969
 let's proceed none on the walls very similar 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.299
 let's enjoy a little bit shorter 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.239
 and we will contribute many things the mosquito 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:54.869
 nick 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.769
 do not 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.769
 I swear by Paul Tracy 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:10.479
 Kudrin his book 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.799
 to look for 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.799
 approximately we will do it 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:26.739
 sun this case 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.739
 and for the first time another world pulls other 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.429
 your friends 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:56.429
 then we put him in conflict 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:06.059
 a little bird pass through a tunnel 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.859
 for many 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.859
 foto ap afp and you mexico 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.779
 Gasteiz 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.999
 Lukashenko government of the Riots fishery 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.270
 since in the end 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.650
 they will check 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.809
 which is the mosquito last put first 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:51.229
 here you have to go the little bird 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.210
 piersilvio for ethnic groups and octopus 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.169
 this collapsed kibaki neighborhood 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.939
 this what makes the little bird 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:01.949
 we spread a meter 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.080
 soon said that after two carabiner so that when he is in the 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.080
 background to give example 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:12.339
 and it is normal 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.120
 108 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.389
 we want you points 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.189
 unemployed 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:46.189
 for squid fishing 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.789
 tyson these points 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.879
 and Carlos Mestre 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.879
 was motivated there is a great advantage in this modality 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:07.319
 finally many times we will follow different depths and we fulfill 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:11.360
 with different currents including the mission accomplished on different days 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.509
 even with this club 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:16.699
 I know I broke it out 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.880
 not as crazy as carabiner stand up and we have to tell you 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.529
 this is a project 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.240
 well so let's go 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:36.889
 a birdie two steps inform 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:38.259
 The Lead 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.259
 and the little bird 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:45.059
 for that little bit tested 

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:48.059
 we can fish the cuttlefish 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:52.729
 and this fact is for the squid 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:55.710
 here we have a 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.210
 let's try to recognize it pirate ship 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.240
 as a point 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.610
 and how are we seeing 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:03.580
 colon 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.999
 birdie 

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:08.199
 is practically touching the top point homes 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:11.400
 where he would not overthrow hours so he explained it to himself with others 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.110
 after it is adrift a rocket is thrown at the ahmar 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:18.639
 the two clubs
