00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
it's about midday this is the UK's HAARP

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.610 
it's about midday this is the UK's HAARP
facility<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:07.560> purple<00:00:08.280> dewy<00:00:08.460> diver<00:00:09.030> risks<00:00:09.389> with

facility in purple dewy diver risks with

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:20.179 
facility in purple dewy diver risks with
whales<00:00:18.140> it's<00:00:19.140> not<00:00:19.289> really<00:00:19.439> much<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.619> say<00:00:19.980> as

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
whales it's not really much to say as

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.849 
whales it's not really much to say as
they're<00:00:20.430> just<00:00:21.350> try<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.439> give<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> good

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
they're just try and give you a good

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.710 
they're just try and give you a good
view<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:25.460> it's<00:00:26.460> much<00:00:26.609> larger<00:00:26.820> than<00:00:27.150> what's

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
view of it it's much larger than what's

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.150 
view of it it's much larger than what's
expected<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.470> know<00:00:28.500> when<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.859> see<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
expected you know when you see the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.070 
expected you know when you see the
picture<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.880> their<00:00:30.090> satellite<00:00:30.599> maps<00:00:30.810> or

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
picture of it on their satellite maps or

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.209 
picture of it on their satellite maps or
something<00:00:36.020> yeah<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.140> looks<00:00:37.290> quite<00:00:37.500> small<00:00:37.800> but

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
something yeah it looks quite small but

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.090 
something yeah it looks quite small but
it's<00:00:38.370> actually<00:00:38.640> quite<00:00:38.760> big<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> gates<00:00:39.450> are

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
it's actually quite big the gates are

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.799 
it's actually quite big the gates are
very<00:00:41.100> sealed<00:00:41.460> off<00:00:41.700> warning<00:00:42.030> signs<00:00:42.450> everywhere

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
very sealed off warning signs everywhere

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.490 
very sealed off warning signs everywhere
it's<00:00:43.140> camera<00:00:43.559> dark<00:00:44.390> lots<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.510> cameras<00:00:45.899> there's

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
it's camera dark lots of cameras there's

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.020 
it's camera dark lots of cameras there's
a<00:00:46.590> hut<00:00:46.770> there<00:00:46.950> there's<00:00:47.370> been<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> car<00:00:47.850> behind

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
a hut there there's been a car behind

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.330 
a hut there there's been a car behind
the<00:00:48.300> hut<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:49.500> know<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> couple<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.190> days

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the hut you know for a couple of days

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.740 
the hut you know for a couple of days
sort<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.760> things<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.270> almost<00:00:51.480> like

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
sort of things so it's almost like

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.569 
sort of things so it's almost like
there's<00:00:52.530> someone<00:00:52.710> living<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.219> there<00:00:53.430> or

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
there's someone living in there or

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.459 
there's someone living in there or
something<00:00:53.820> live<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.390> security<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.079> don't<00:00:55.410> know

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
something live in security I don't know

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.310 
something live in security I don't know
what<00:00:57.170> but<00:00:58.170> yeah<00:00:59.239> it's<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.329> beautiful<00:01:00.660> area<00:01:00.930> it's

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
what but yeah it's a beautiful area it's

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.270 
what but yeah it's a beautiful area it's
nicely<00:01:01.739> tucked<00:01:01.920> away<00:01:02.160> if<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.670> drove<00:01:02.879> past<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
nicely tucked away if you drove past it

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.679 
nicely tucked away if you drove past it
driving<00:01:05.280> east<00:01:05.580> then<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.450> wouldn't

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
driving east then you just wouldn't

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.530 
driving east then you just wouldn't
notice<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.200> when<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.710> drive<00:01:07.950> west<00:01:08.880> along<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
notice it when you drive west along the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.750 
notice it when you drive west along the
road<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:11.040> see<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.280> through<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.580> gate

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
road you can see it through the gate

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.550 
road you can see it through the gate
just<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.479> probably<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:13.049> treat<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.320> more

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
just but you probably just treat it more

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.310 
just but you probably just treat it more
like<00:01:13.619> iron<00:01:14.070> gates<00:01:14.369> than<00:01:14.960> an<00:01:15.960> array<00:01:16.200> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
like iron gates than an array of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.960 
like iron gates than an array of
antennas<00:01:18.229> you<00:01:19.229> know<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.740> um<00:01:20.009> yeah<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:20.909> an

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
antennas you know it's um yeah it's an

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.490 
antennas you know it's um yeah it's an
interesting<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.750> nicely<00:01:22.049> tucked<00:01:22.229> all

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
interesting one it's nicely tucked all

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.969 
interesting one it's nicely tucked all
the<00:01:22.619> way

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the way

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.789 
the way
definitely<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.689> know<00:01:24.810> you'd<00:01:24.990> really<00:01:25.470> need<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
definitely you know you'd really need to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.770 
definitely you know you'd really need to
know<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.040> know<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.630> imagine

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
know to know it's there you can imagine

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.840 
know to know it's there you can imagine
people<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.350> local<00:01:28.500> area<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.280> do<00:01:29.549> not

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
people in the local area if they do not

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.370 
people in the local area if they do not
come<00:01:30.060> down<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.450> road<00:01:30.689> they<00:01:30.900> don't<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
come down this road they don't have a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.999 
come down this road they don't have a
clue<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.950> know<00:01:33.229> but<00:01:34.229> maybe<00:01:34.350> people<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:34.829> know

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
clue you know but maybe people do know

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.530 
clue you know but maybe people do know
in<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> area<00:01:37.880> but<00:01:38.880> if<00:01:38.970> they<00:01:39.090> do<00:01:39.270> they<00:01:39.509> should

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
in the area but if they do they should

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.380 
in the area but if they do they should
be<00:01:39.810> researching<00:01:40.470> harp<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.549> harp<00:01:41.579> facilities

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
be researching harp and harp facilities

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.819 
be researching harp and harp facilities
around<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.810> world<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.290> what<00:01:43.409> they<00:01:43.439> really

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
around the world and what they really

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.069 
around the world and what they really
are<00:01:43.860> when<00:01:44.520> people<00:01:44.820> say<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.570> only<00:01:45.720> putting

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
are when people say this is only putting

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.749 
are when people say this is only putting
out<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> small<00:01:46.560> amount<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.950> power<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.549> things

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
out a small amount of power and things

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.240 
out a small amount of power and things
like<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.450> negligible<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.040> same

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
like that it's negligible it's the same

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.399 
like that it's negligible it's the same
as<00:01:50.399> your<00:01:50.549> tumble<00:01:50.880> dryer<00:01:50.939> which<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.840> rubbish<00:01:52.259> of

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
as your tumble dryer which is rubbish of

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.810 
as your tumble dryer which is rubbish of
course<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.950> know<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.310> see<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.579> Power

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
course you know you can see the Power

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.030 
course you know you can see the Power
Packs<00:01:54.090> there<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.570> stuff<00:01:54.810> but<00:01:55.530> at<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.799> end<00:01:55.829> of

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
Packs there and stuff but at the end of

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.170 
Packs there and stuff but at the end of
the<00:01:56.100> day<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.579> when<00:01:56.759> something<00:01:57.119> is

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
the day it's like when something is

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.840 
the day it's like when something is
putting<00:01:57.420> out<00:01:57.540> power<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.020> affecting<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
putting out power it's affecting the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.120 
putting out power it's affecting the
atmosphere<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.560> it's<00:02:01.560> not<00:02:01.680> supposed<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.009> be

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
atmosphere so it's not supposed to be

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.510 
atmosphere so it's not supposed to be
there

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
there

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.910

that's modifying now atmosphere there's
no<00:02:05.040> different<00:02:05.399> when<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.640> citizen<00:02:06.149> gigawatt

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
no different when is citizen gigawatt

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.749 
no different when is citizen gigawatt
one<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:06.930> Gakona<00:02:07.259> or<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.160> megawatt<00:02:08.729> one<00:02:09.060> here

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
one in Gakona or a megawatt one here

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.670 
one in Gakona or a megawatt one here
whatever<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.090> power<00:02:10.239> output<00:02:10.750> is<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.319> dimer

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
whatever the power output is the dimer

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.289 
whatever the power output is the dimer
it's<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.730> same<00:02:12.939> process<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.599> same<00:02:13.840> principle

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.190 

so<00:02:19.299> there<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.540> go<00:02:19.720> anyway

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
so there you go anyway

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.380 
so there you go anyway
there's<00:02:20.439> your<00:02:20.680> your<00:02:21.459> view<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.790> heart<00:02:22.030> in

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
there's your your view of heart in

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.080 
there's your your view of heart in
Whalen<00:02:22.780> say<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:24.250> don't<00:02:24.579> forget<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.879> sheep

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
Whalen say and don't forget the sheep

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:33.570 
Whalen say and don't forget the sheep
that's<00:02:25.360> right

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:03:50.309 

you

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.580 

talking<00:03:51.099> to<00:03:51.250> Lorraine<00:03:51.580> about<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:53.290> she<00:03:53.470> was

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
talking to Lorraine about and she was

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.069 
talking to Lorraine about and she was
saying<00:03:53.830> about<00:03:53.920> if<00:03:54.189> you<00:03:54.280> look<00:03:54.400> at<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.610> trees

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
saying about if you look at the trees

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.750 
saying about if you look at the trees
basically<00:03:56.079> on<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.290> right<00:03:56.470> here<00:03:56.829> you<00:03:57.579> can<00:03:57.730> see

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
basically on the right here you can see

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.729 
basically on the right here you can see
that<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.360> trees<00:03:58.510> are<00:03:58.659> quite<00:03:59.140> healthy<00:03:59.349> and

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
that the trees are quite healthy and

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.649 
that the trees are quite healthy and
they're<00:04:00.340> at<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.519> very<00:04:00.610> edge<00:04:00.939> of<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.209> antenna

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
they're at the very edge of the antenna

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.770 
they're at the very edge of the antenna
array<00:04:02.019> okay<00:04:02.439> over<00:04:03.189> there<00:04:03.220> is<00:04:03.970> another<00:04:04.269> set<00:04:04.569> of

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
array okay over there is another set of

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.660 
array okay over there is another set of
trees<00:04:05.049> and<00:04:05.349> they<00:04:05.709> look<00:04:05.890> quite<00:04:06.010> healthy<00:04:06.459> and

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
trees and they look quite healthy and

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.430 
trees and they look quite healthy and
they're<00:04:06.790> on<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.060> edge<00:04:07.209> of<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.690> antenna<00:04:08.019> away

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
they're on the edge of the antenna away

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.649 
they're on the edge of the antenna away
but<00:04:09.400> if<00:04:09.489> we<00:04:09.640> go<00:04:09.819> and<00:04:09.909> look<00:04:10.030> at<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.269> trees<00:04:10.480> that

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
but if we go and look at the trees that

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:12.089 
but if we go and look at the trees that
are<00:04:10.780> in<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:10.959> center<00:04:11.379> of<00:04:11.409> the<00:04:11.680> antenna<00:04:12.010> array

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
are in the center of the antenna array

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.190 
are in the center of the antenna array
right<00:04:12.730> so<00:04:13.000> you<00:04:13.090> can<00:04:13.209> see<00:04:13.420> that's<00:04:13.840> in<00:04:14.079> the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
right so you can see that's in the

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.869 
right so you can see that's in the
center<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:14.769> there's<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.340> stream<00:04:15.640> here

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
center and there's a stream here

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.039 
center and there's a stream here
hopefully<00:04:16.389> you're<00:04:16.539> going<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.720> be<00:04:16.810> able<00:04:16.870> to

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
hopefully you're going to be able to

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.349 
hopefully you're going to be able to
hear<00:04:17.199> it<00:04:17.229> doesn't<00:04:17.590> go<00:04:17.680> closer<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:19.030> now<00:04:19.150> let's

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
hear it doesn't go closer so now let's

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.390 
hear it doesn't go closer so now let's
take<00:04:19.539> a<00:04:19.600> look<00:04:19.900> obviously<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:20.680> can<00:04:20.829> see<00:04:21.039> look

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
take a look obviously you can see look

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.580 
take a look obviously you can see look
and<00:04:21.820> we<00:04:22.240> will<00:04:22.389> Midsummer's<00:04:22.870> day<00:04:22.900> as<00:04:23.199> well<00:04:23.380> you

and we will Midsummer's day as well you
know<00:04:23.710> I<00:04:23.740> mean<00:04:23.979> you<00:04:24.460> can<00:04:24.610> see<00:04:24.760> there's<00:04:24.970> bear

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
know I mean you can see there's bear

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.870 
know I mean you can see there's bear
leaves<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:26.590> see<00:04:26.770> it's<00:04:26.889> brown<00:04:27.130> give<00:04:27.760> you<00:04:27.850> a

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
leaves you see it's brown give you a

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:37.900 
leaves you see it's brown give you a
close-up<00:04:28.150> here<00:04:29.370> looks<00:04:30.370> brown<00:04:30.699> scorched

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.150 

you<00:04:38.480> know<00:04:38.630> stuffs<00:04:38.990> growing<00:04:39.410> but<00:04:39.950> there's<00:04:40.100> a

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
you know stuffs growing but there's a

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.050 
you know stuffs growing but there's a
freshwater<00:04:40.430> stream<00:04:41.000> they're<00:04:41.270> going<00:04:41.780> past<00:04:42.020> it

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
freshwater stream they're going past it

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.270 
freshwater stream they're going past it
so<00:04:44.260> this<00:04:45.260> one's<00:04:45.500> not<00:04:45.650> looking<00:04:45.920> too<00:04:46.100> happy

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280

so this one's not looking too happy
either<00:04:47.530> maybe<00:04:48.530> it's<00:04:48.680> a<00:04:48.770> late<00:04:48.920> bloomer<00:04:49.070> range

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
either maybe it's a late bloomer range

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.530 
either maybe it's a late bloomer range
but<00:04:51.950> yeah<00:04:52.160> you<00:04:52.730> know<00:04:52.850> most<00:04:53.060> of<00:04:53.180> it<00:04:53.270> looks<00:04:53.450> the

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
but yeah you know most of it looks the

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.420 
but yeah you know most of it looks the
right<00:04:53.690> sort<00:04:53.990> of<00:04:54.050> thing<00:04:54.230> but<00:04:54.500> that's<00:04:55.130> month

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
right sort of thing but that's month

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.900 
right sort of thing but that's month
whatever<00:04:56.360> that's<00:04:57.310> connected<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.340> anything<00:04:58.640> or

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
whatever that's connected to anything or

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.020 
whatever that's connected to anything or
not<00:04:59.060> don't<00:04:59.630> know<00:04:59.810> there's<00:05:00.140> also<00:05:00.290> worth<00:05:00.590> noting

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
not don't know there's also worth noting

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.820 
not don't know there's also worth noting
on<00:05:02.030> the<00:05:02.690> other<00:05:02.840> side<00:05:03.080> you<00:05:03.260> can<00:05:03.320> see<00:05:03.560> it<00:05:03.650> better

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
on the other side you can see it better

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.320 
on the other side you can see it better
that<00:05:04.040> kind<00:05:04.250> off<00:05:04.460> there<00:05:04.670> are<00:05:04.790> weeds<00:05:04.970> growing

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
that kind off there are weeds growing

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.870 
that kind off there are weeds growing
home<00:05:05.720> it's<00:05:06.500> all<00:05:06.620> here<00:05:06.890> and<00:05:07.070> there<00:05:07.250> but<00:05:07.580> in<00:05:07.730> this

whole patches of just like brown dirt

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.100 
whole patches of just like brown dirt
don't<00:05:09.740> know<00:05:09.860> if<00:05:09.980> it's<00:05:10.220> weed<00:05:10.400> killer<00:05:10.670> sprayed

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
don't know if it's weed killer sprayed
