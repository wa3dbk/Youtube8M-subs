 streaks because the guy is that he is also 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.310
 that seems like a joke because it stays 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.959
 nothing to a couple of points to remove the 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.850
 three streaks full so many 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.800

 So, look, the first thing he did is 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.540
 launch a bombardment that is going to charge 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.270

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.390
 I differ one that is playing in never a 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.849
 draft 2 there is 94 in hand and taking advantage 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.440
 a strategic point in one of the 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.239
 side of the map of this one where in 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.430
 certain way is controlling the two 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.319
 remains of the map and also in certain 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.810
 way exposed to being shot 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.790
 from all directions you can see how 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.760
 the waves of enemies are coming 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.170
 behind another is controlling them 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.689
 really very well and putting the 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.060
 boots for this run of 10 casualties 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.489

 we will find here because we are going to 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.709
 find 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.319
 from rajoy who is playing in advanced 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.930

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.030
 go down and now look, look, I'm going to 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.890
 put the counter at the end of the 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.130
 game so you can see the killing 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.410
 that this man has mounted 32 to 1 mother 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.699
 you've been happy with the clip that 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.860

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.900
 very long are more than two minutes of 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.210
 departure and in a way was very 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.490
 empty so yes we do not ever 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.560

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.330
 well but I had to hit him some 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.260
 cut the clip because there were many 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.630
 empty spaces 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.030
 even exaggerated to get to put 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.919
 the fast camera but believe me here not 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.889

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.050

 the truth is that it catches all 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.910
 enemies always at the worst moment 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.680

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.470
 wait for the other to go up 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.780
 stairs and take advantage to do this 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.820
 movement so smart the truth is 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.590
