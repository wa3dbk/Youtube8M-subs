it's<00:02:02.630> just<00:02:02.810> like<00:02:02.930> an<00:02:03.050> animal<00:02:03.410> you<00:02:03.530> get<00:02:03.680> too

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
it's just like an animal you get too

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.410 
it's just like an animal you get too
close<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.490> doesn't<00:02:04.850> know<00:02:04.970> you<00:02:05.030> could<00:02:05.300> get

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
close it doesn't know you could get

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.050 
close it doesn't know you could get
skittish<00:02:06.050> and<00:02:06.290> it<00:02:06.380> clams<00:02:06.710> up<00:02:07.070> or<00:02:07.460> it<00:02:07.550> changes

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
skittish and it clams up or it changes

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.520 
skittish and it clams up or it changes
whatever<00:02:08.240> the<00:02:08.479> hell<00:02:08.660> is<00:02:08.780> doing<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:09.289> know<00:02:09.410> it

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
whatever the hell is doing you know it

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.470 
whatever the hell is doing you know it
stops<00:02:09.800> picking<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.399> snows<00:02:10.700> in<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.060> case<00:02:11.240> of<00:02:11.270> a

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
stops picking it snows in the case of a

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.199 
stops picking it snows in the case of a
human<00:02:11.900> or<00:02:12.020> we're<00:02:12.709> scratching<00:02:13.130> its<00:02:13.520> ass<00:02:13.730> is

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
human or we're scratching its ass is

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.610 
human or we're scratching its ass is
like<00:02:14.360> if<00:02:14.570> someone's<00:02:14.959> getting<00:02:15.200> close<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.440> me

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
like if someone's getting close to me

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.130 
like if someone's getting close to me
and<00:02:16.250> especially<00:02:16.880> when<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.330> comes<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.660> having<00:02:17.900> a

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
and especially when it comes to having a

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.490 
and especially when it comes to having a
camera<00:02:18.620> pointed<00:02:18.650> in<00:02:19.160> their<00:02:19.310> face<00:02:19.570> so<00:02:20.570> you<00:02:21.350> know

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
camera pointed in their face so you know

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.949 
camera pointed in their face so you know
where<00:02:21.680> most<00:02:21.890> people<00:02:22.250> have<00:02:22.430> like<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.670> 24<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:23.330> 70<00:02:23.810> I

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
where most people have like a 24 to 70 I

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.680 
where most people have like a 24 to 70 I
believe<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.800> taking<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.790> candid<00:02:26.360> shots

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
believe that taking the candid shots

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.540 
believe that taking the candid shots
which<00:02:27.020> are<00:02:27.170> really<00:02:27.320> fascinating<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.370> like

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
which are really fascinating and I like

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.580 
which are really fascinating and I like
getting<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:28.970> lot<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.180> good<00:02:29.330> shots<00:02:29.840> instead<00:02:30.380> of

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
getting a lot of good shots instead of

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.530 
getting a lot of good shots instead of
like<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:31.310> know<00:02:31.370> getting<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.760> thousand<00:02:32.270> shots

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
like you know getting a thousand shots

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.210 
like you know getting a thousand shots
and<00:02:32.780> hoping<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.110> praying<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.650> like<00:02:33.800> one<00:02:34.100> or

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
and hoping the praying that like one or

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.370 
and hoping the praying that like one or
two<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.550> them<00:02:34.700> are<00:02:34.760> really<00:02:34.880> good<00:02:35.350> instead<00:02:36.350> of

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
two of them are really good instead of

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:44.050 
two of them are really good instead of
like<00:02:36.560> having<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.970> 24-70<00:02:38.470> on<00:02:39.470> my<00:02:40.250> camera<00:02:43.060> what

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
like having a 24-70 on my camera what

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.410 
like having a 24-70 on my camera what
I'll<00:02:44.300> actually<00:02:44.600> have<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.870> 70<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.380> 200<00:02:48.950> and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
I'll actually have is the 70 to 200 and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.479 
I'll actually have is the 70 to 200 and
that<00:02:50.420> lets<00:02:50.690> me<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.930> reach<00:02:51.470> out<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:52.040> catch<00:02:52.160> them

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
that lets me I reach out and catch them

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.320 
that lets me I reach out and catch them
you<00:02:53.390> know<00:02:53.480> treat<00:02:53.750> humans<00:02:54.850> kind<00:02:55.850> of<00:02:55.940> like<00:02:56.030> fish

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
you know treat humans kind of like fish

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.270 
you know treat humans kind of like fish
or<00:02:56.600> like<00:02:56.750> animals<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:57.380> can<00:02:57.530> either<00:02:57.860> get<00:02:58.220> up

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
or like animals you can either get up

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.850 
or like animals you can either get up
close<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.870> 24-70<00:02:59.870> or<00:03:00.110> some<00:03:00.350> prime<00:03:00.590> lens

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
close to the 24-70 or some prime lens

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.150 
close to the 24-70 or some prime lens
and<00:03:01.549> you<00:03:01.700> could<00:03:01.880> stab<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.620> which<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:04.010> know

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
and you could stab it which you know

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.250 
and you could stab it which you know
usually<00:03:04.580> 99<00:03:05.150> times<00:03:05.390> out<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.570> 100<00:03:05.780> you're<00:03:06.140> not

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
usually 99 times out of 100 you're not

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.080 
usually 99 times out of 100 you're not
going<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.500> get<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:06.799> or<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:07.250> can<00:03:07.430> stand<00:03:07.790> back

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
going to get it or you can stand back

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.840 
going to get it or you can stand back
they<00:03:08.930> can't<00:03:09.230> see<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:10.040> I'll<00:03:10.370> sit<00:03:10.670> there

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850

with a 70 to 200 and I'll reel them in

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.509 
with a 70 to 200 and I'll reel them in
and<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.959> have<00:03:15.110> no<00:03:15.260> idea<00:03:15.560> what's<00:03:15.769> going<00:03:16.070> on<00:03:16.160> and

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
and I have no idea what's going on and

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.880 
and I have no idea what's going on and
i'll<00:03:16.580> get<00:03:16.820> ten<00:03:17.239> times<00:03:17.540> as<00:03:17.750> many<00:03:17.930> good<00:03:18.170> shots<00:03:18.470> as

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
i'll get ten times as many good shots as

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.960 
i'll get ten times as many good shots as
you<00:03:19.130> will<00:03:19.370> with<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.760> prime<00:03:20.000> lens<00:03:20.890> or<00:03:21.890> 24<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.519> 70

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
you will with the prime lens or 24 to 70

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.940 
you will with the prime lens or 24 to 70
now<00:03:23.180> i'm<00:03:23.299> all<00:03:23.450> about<00:03:23.570> using<00:03:23.870> primes<00:03:24.410> when<00:03:24.860> it

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
now i'm all about using primes when it

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.789 
now i'm all about using primes when it
comes<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.280> getting<00:03:25.489> good<00:03:25.670> shots<00:03:26.140> i<00:03:27.140> actually

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
comes to getting good shots i actually

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.160 
comes to getting good shots i actually
like<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.130> use<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.340> nice<00:03:28.670> a<00:03:28.700> zoom<00:03:29.060> lens

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
like to use a nice a zoom lens

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.390 
like to use a nice a zoom lens
especially<00:03:30.170> for<00:03:30.380> candid<00:03:30.799> shots<00:03:31.070> when<00:03:31.310> it

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
especially for candid shots when it

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.270 
especially for candid shots when it
comes<00:03:31.579> to<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:31.790> group<00:03:32.000> of<00:03:32.120> people<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.860> logic

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
comes to a group of people and the logic

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.880 
comes to a group of people and the logic
and<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.489> reason<00:03:34.910> for<00:03:34.940> that<00:03:35.180> is<00:03:35.450> obvious<00:03:35.959> and<00:03:36.140> i

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
and the reason for that is obvious and i

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.929 
and the reason for that is obvious and i
hope<00:03:37.519> that<00:03:37.579> you<00:03:37.820> understand<00:03:38.390> that<00:03:38.540> maybe<00:03:39.049> cuz

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:39.939 
hope that you understand that maybe cuz

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.920 
hope that you understand that maybe cuz
