is<00:00:11.190> cut<00:00:11.460> out<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.639> circle<00:00:12.360> out<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.900> white<00:00:13.080> paper

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
is cut out a circle out of white paper

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.160 
is cut out a circle out of white paper
insert<00:00:14.370> some<00:00:14.549> paper<00:00:14.870> insert<00:00:15.870> some<00:00:16.020> paper

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
insert some paper insert some paper

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.630 
insert some paper insert some paper
works<00:00:16.410> that's<00:00:16.680> it's<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.070> little<00:00:17.250> bit<00:00:17.369> thicker

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
works that's it's a little bit thicker

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.750 
works that's it's a little bit thicker
and<00:00:18.109> the<00:00:19.109> pattern<00:00:19.500> will<00:00:19.650> be<00:00:19.800> on<00:00:19.980> columns<00:00:20.310> ABC's

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
and the pattern will be on columns ABC's

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.540 
and the pattern will be on columns ABC's
calm<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.600> can<00:00:21.920> so<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:22.980> can<00:00:23.160> find<00:00:23.400> that

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
calm so you can so you can find that

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.779 
calm so you can so you can find that
there<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.720> what<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.019> need<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.789> you

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
there and so what you need to do is you

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.429 
there and so what you need to do is you
need<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.029> find<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.779> box

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
need to find a box

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.130 
need to find a box
any<00:00:28.980> old<00:00:29.160> box<00:00:29.429> really<00:00:29.849> good<00:00:30.119> smaller<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
any old box really good smaller the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.749 
any old box really good smaller the
better<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:31.890> easier<00:00:32.130> for<00:00:32.160> yours<00:00:32.520> how<00:00:32.700> to

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
better so it's easier for yours how to

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.760 
better so it's easier for yours how to
manipulate<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:34.079> able<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.260> pick<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.559> up

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
manipulate it to be able to pick it up

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.790 
manipulate it to be able to pick it up
and<00:00:34.920> roll<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.190> around<00:00:36.050> so<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.230> size<00:00:37.469> box

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and roll it around so this size box

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.400 
and roll it around so this size box
works<00:00:38.309> really<00:00:38.579> well<00:00:38.879> old<00:00:39.239> soda<00:00:39.540> boxes<00:00:40.140> things

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
works really well old soda boxes things

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.830 
works really well old soda boxes things
like<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.800> those<00:00:41.010> work<00:00:41.219> really<00:00:41.430> well<00:00:41.840> and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
like that those work really well and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.380 
like that those work really well and
then<00:00:43.410> cut<00:00:43.710> out<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.860> pattern<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.640> if<00:00:45.210> you've

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
then cut out the pattern and if you've

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.600 
then cut out the pattern and if you've
got<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.600> child<00:00:45.930> that's<00:00:46.200> old<00:00:46.440> enough<00:00:46.610> probably

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
got a child that's old enough probably

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.660 
got a child that's old enough probably
about<00:00:48.200> three<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:49.469> really<00:00:49.800> four<00:00:50.129> years<00:00:50.399> old

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
about three but really four years old

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.299 
about three but really four years old
they<00:00:51.270> could<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:52.199> could<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.800> could<00:00:52.980> draw<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
they could it could you could draw the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.799 
they could it could you could draw the
circle<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.180> them<00:00:54.360> cut<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.690> out

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
circle and have them cut it out

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.630 
circle and have them cut it out
themselves<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.890> that'll<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.250> really<00:00:56.370> great

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
themselves so that'll be really great

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.729 
themselves so that'll be really great
then<00:00:56.969> put<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.300> inside<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> box<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.109> little<00:00:58.469> tip

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
then put it inside the box a little tip

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.979 
then put it inside the box a little tip
inside<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> box<00:00:59.730> put<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.329> little<00:01:00.539> rolled-up

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
inside the box put a little rolled-up

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.869 
inside the box put a little rolled-up
piece<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.440> tape<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.920> bottom<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.460> then

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
piece of tape on the bottom and then

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.329 
piece of tape on the bottom and then
stick<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.570> earth<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.989> top<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.159> what

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
stick the earth on top of it so what

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.280 
stick the earth on top of it so what
you'll<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.700> doing

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
you'll be doing

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.359 
you'll be doing
it'll<00:01:07.290> be<00:01:07.409> feet<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:07.890> they'll<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.159> thinking

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
it'll be feet so they'll be thinking

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.800 
it'll be feet so they'll be thinking
with<00:01:09.350> white<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.770> green<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.580> blue<00:01:11.850> paint<00:01:12.119> so

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
with white and green and blue paint so

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.920 
with white and green and blue paint so
white<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.650> represent<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> clouds<00:01:14.689> green<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
white to represent the clouds green to

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.130 
white to represent the clouds green to
represent<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.680> trees<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.990> plants<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
represent the trees and plants and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.840 
represent the trees and plants and
things<00:01:19.290> like<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.890> then<00:01:20.040> blues<00:01:20.610> who

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
things like that and then blues who

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.899 
things like that and then blues who
represented<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> ocean<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.049> course<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:23.280> so

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
represented the ocean of course and so

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.980 
represented the ocean of course and so

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
ping-pong balls may work but they may be

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.480 
ping-pong balls may work but they may be
too<00:01:29.850> light<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.240> get<00:01:30.390> stuff<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> paint

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
too light and get stuff in the paint

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.330 
too light and get stuff in the paint
marbles<00:01:32.490> were<00:01:32.790> great<00:01:33.240> because<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.650> marble

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340
