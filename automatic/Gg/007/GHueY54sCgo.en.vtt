 strong but generalized moments in 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.700
 much if not that in the whole area 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.250
 metropolitan and in much of the state 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.030
 the radar image we can notice the 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.070
 precipitation in general 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.630

 state there are some municipalities that have not 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.010
 reported rain but in the zones 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.750
 mountainous areas in rural areas of course 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.640
 have seen even one or two fall 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.160
 initial drops and gas to the south of the 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.840
 state where rain has fallen with greater 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.000
 amount accumulated in city 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.500
 victory or tell me later I'll have 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.990
 images of what happened there in the 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.780
 Capital of Tamaulipas with the strong 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.920
 showers now we mark 22 to 23 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.380
 degrees barely reaching 25 26 wind in 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.079
 calm clear the little temperature 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.110
 varies due to the presence of the sky 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:19.689
 cloudy and the low cloudiness that continues 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.460
 this very night in the city ​​all this 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.920
 obeys the remnants of what was 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.560
 dolly dominating in the atmospheric pattern 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.020
 in much of the interior the northeast 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.729
 of the country also the east and the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.619
 West of the republic where 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.289
 these remnants interact with the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.259
 bands from this the norbert hurricane that is 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.899
 category 1 presents winds of 150 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.850
 kilometers per hour near the 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.299
 category 2 on the saffir simpson scale 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.860
 and it's already very close to the south of the low 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.840
 california a few hundred of 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.549
 kilometers, of course, there is swell 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.450
 high there are very strong rainfall 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.069
 in peace and the capes there is notice of 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.080
 tropical storm in the southern part of the 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.780
 Peninsula but the system will not touch 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.399
 land is going to keep to the west and it's going to 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.110
 lose strength will go into waters more 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.000
 cold and there are no favorable conditions 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.099
 so that the intensification of 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.899
 tropical storm this Friday and Saturday 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.120
 and then already tropical depression on Sunday 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.099
 Monday and Tuesday we hope that your 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.069
 remnants arrive in california where 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.799
 the rain is urgent because of the drought 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.590
 the foresters here at home still 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.329
 humidity and rainfall activity but already 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.549
 from more to less and on Friday even 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.620
 we can see some sun and then air 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.909
 dry will begin to gain ground in the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.769
 region now yes we will see it in the 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.109
 north of Tamaulipas and north again 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.329
 lion the possibility of russia is reduced 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:39.909
 some showers in mountainous areas 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.829
 I would start next week with time 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.169
 more stable here in monterrey tomorrow 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.629

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.280
 tomorrow still a maximum of 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.439
 30 degrees some sun may appear that 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.389
 is a little bit more and the squall can 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.919
 be present accompanied by activity 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.139
 electric that has not been missing and some 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:04.359
 wind also raced in hours of 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:08.169
 late on Saturday the sky partially 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:11.019
 maximum cloudy and 33 already noticed the 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:13.239
 sun with a greater number of hours or 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.829
 instants helping the temperature 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.169
 ascend or say on Sunday and the 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.900
 Monday days with maximum sunny skies 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:22.359
 of 33 and the advance good part of the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.760
 next week he paints like this with a lot of sun and 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.909
 again with plain heat but with 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.560
 in shape is still summer believe it or not 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.989
