00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.830
 and of course I could not 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.430
 just not to discuss this probably 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.940
 sensational topic now is about new 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.790
 iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.250
 surely many have already watched 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.220
 the presentation of the new iphone of course already 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.400
 many had time to buy all sorts of stars and 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.950
 for example in instagram just a bunch of these 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.870
 photos with these new iPhones here and 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.900
 of course I could not discuss with you 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.000
 this topic at least a little bit here and a little bit 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.309
 you talk about it yourself 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.980
 say my opinion if of course you and 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.250
 but it is interesting in general, first when I 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.260
 just saw the new iphone itself 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.990
 I did not watch the presentation, I just just 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.909
 then went to the official apple website 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.420
 to see how it all looks 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.030
 first i have an iphone in design 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.530
 I absolutely did not like me 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.050
 it seemed that 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.960
 but somehow looks ugly like 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.900
 a smaller version of the ipad in general 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.300
 that on the iphone this is somehow unlike 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.930
 general one word did not like 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.390
 design 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.120
 but then when I looked no longer 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.360
 just photos namely video review 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.250
 one of the famous bloggers his name is 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.380
 in my opinion Alexander Zhuravlev 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.850
 he shows a lot of reviews on 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.610
 various phones 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.480
 that's when he did a review there 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.080
 us a new iphone is just 6 and 6 plus 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.880
 but just 6 it is not the design 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.040
 Actually when I already liked 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.690
 looked at and video than me he 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.940
 liked because firstly 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.840
 indeed he is very thin beautiful 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.560
 made and also he has this 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.200
 Glass is such a streamlined shape 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.450
 really looks beautiful and 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.950
 so I absolutely disagree with 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.870
 those who claim that the model 6 iphone 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.300
 ok it's ugly and how can it be 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.980
 ugly if very here is glass 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.410
 straight so everything is well done it is very 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.629
 thin i'm sure that despite his 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.859
 the dimensions it lies quite comfortably in 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.580
 hand and if you talk about me for example 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.190
 me of course 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.030
 more like just 6 iphone because 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.040
 that iphone 6 plus has a diagonal of 5 5 for 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.950
 for me personally for example it is too much for me 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.090
 a lot for the phone that is it already 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.920
 get some phone dash tablet 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.230
 it certainly will be convenient for those 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.510
 people who can be many 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.120
 travels there read a lot of things 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.090
 looks from the phone but just in quality 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.430
 phone, I would choose just 6 because 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.920
 that the 47 diagonal is quite normal for 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.740
 I already had a phone from lg with such 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.290
 diagonal in principle is quite convenient if 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:21.630
 talk about for example colors then 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.820
 Well, for example, I would most likely if 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.570
 talk about flowers then surely me 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.640
 most like the shade space gray 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.950
 in Russian analogues gray space 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.790
 called explain why because 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.650
 it is this model a black screen and a 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.170
 in front it looks very beautiful 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.510
 because for example gold and in 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.930
 silver color screen as you see it 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.630
 white and visible here these are the edges of the screens 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.340
 when it is off the frame with this 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.230
 Well, I honestly say it is not very 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.989
 I like it better when the screen 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.940
 just black especially off 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.890
 able it looks very cool 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.370
 because it seems like to and 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.590
 solid screen that's why here's 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:10.260
 I don't like shade anymore by the way if 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:13.920
 talk about prices then the price for 16 gigabytes 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.630
 memory is quite loyal and that is no 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.380
 not overpriced but on the official website 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.200
 apple can see this price here 30 31 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.300
 thousand 990 rubles for 16 gigabytes 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.600
 In principle, this is normal, that is also 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.460
 and 5s then at the beginning of sales therefore I consider 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.350
 what you should not overpay as 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.030
 some overpay there to buy 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.280
 some incomprehensible stores to 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.430
 quickly redeem in my opinion it's all nonsense 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.250
 Why overpay if its real 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.790
 the price is such that if I am going to 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.380
 I'll change my phone now I'll show you 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.390
 I have of course now on this one 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.300
 the moment is my phone number 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.180
 iphone 5 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:58.129
 with so here it looks the way I him 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.530
 updated to 8 to 8 ios version 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:05.979
 here so often everything looks happened 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:08.870
 some changes for example here and 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.419
 so what can I say worked 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.180
 by the way everything is perfect perfect i heard that 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.900
 what if we just say normal 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.080
 fives updated to 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.479
 updated to 8 ae100 some misunderstandings 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.729
 it somehow does not work well for me 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.099
 works perfect like everything worked in 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.039
 All in all, I can say well for 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:34.340
 myself that I like I said a hundred 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.830
 percent will not change your iphone 5s 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.370
 on 6 because me absolutely 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.759
 arranges 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.009
 iphone 5s i don't have some sort of hype 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:47.090
 yes i liked iphone 6 i don't 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:48.169
 I'll hide but what's the point of changing let's say 5s 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.150
 if inside 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.940
 this is the same that is, they are there even 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:56.300
 Especially not the camera did not improve anything 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:06:00.139
 I understand let's say if you have 4 iphone or 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.830
 just 5 then I think it makes sense to change 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.069
 our 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.800
 the six he is but if you have an iphone 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:10.490
 5s, that makes no difference because you 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.620
 just upgrade to 8 hp and is still the 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.050
 the same thing absolutely that is it also 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.169
 will work smoothly everything is perfect but in 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.659
 next year when it comes out already 6 with 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:23.509
 or maybe they will release immediately 7 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:26.240
 iphone is still unknown then in such 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:28.909
 case, I will change my phone but 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.650
 bye here this year i will walk 5s i 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:33.349
 I think that it could quite 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.659
 ok write what you think about 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:40.279
 This I repeat what I renewed 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:43.129
 and water in 8 arrest already even 802 in my 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:46.460
 and everything works perfectly for me 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:49.190
 inside it is exactly the same as the new ones 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.370
 6 iphone differences only of course 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.560
 in the amount of well maybe some 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.900
 new features although i'm not sure about this 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.449
 Of course the design but here I am yet to change 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.360
 I will not go with it to me he is very 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:03.430
 like and then 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.930
 when it comes out in a year is already new 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.210
 then of course the model is already a hundred 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.830
 percent will change why I still do not want 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.569
 now not because really to 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.090
 he just got used to my even somehow 

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:14.740
 sorry to part with them I do not even know 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.960
 how to explain this name is rarely 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.759
 but to this phone really 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.919
 I got used to it very convenient to hold it 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:24.159
 hands here is my hand 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:27.879
 bigger size but i don't know 

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:30.520
 of course it can be convenient yes but in 

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:32.740
 Basically there is a tablet why a phone 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.539
 huge in general do not know write your 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.550
