like<00:02:02.259> maybe<00:02:02.619> a<00:02:02.770> slide<00:02:03.009> because<00:02:03.579> if<00:02:04.119> you<00:02:04.329> have

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
like maybe a slide because if you have

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.679 
like maybe a slide because if you have
creatures<00:02:05.759> you're<00:02:06.759> gonna<00:02:06.909> want<00:02:07.209> to<00:02:07.299> get<00:02:07.450> some
