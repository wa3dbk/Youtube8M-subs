00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
pulled what I'd like to call a bit of a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.979 
pulled what I'd like to call a bit of a
Rambo<00:00:39.719> move<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:41.120> make<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.360> plant<00:00:42.690> that

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
Rambo move to make the plant that

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.250 
Rambo move to make the plant that
resulted<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.070> victory<00:00:47.809> and<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.899> wish<00:00:49.050> there

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
was a better way to deal with death I

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.869 
was a better way to deal with death I
think<00:00:52.649> theater<00:00:53.039> loading<00:00:53.399> games<00:00:53.640> like

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
think theater loading games like

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.900 
think theater loading games like
sabotage<00:00:54.449> where<00:00:54.750> there's<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.989> respawn<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.649> way

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
sabotage where there's a respawn the way

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.569 
sabotage where there's a respawn the way
but<00:00:56.910> anyway<00:00:59.930> so<00:01:01.010> what's<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.190> happen

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
but anyway so what's going to happen

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.160 
but anyway so what's going to happen
here<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:03.120> we're<00:01:03.300> going<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> plant<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> bomb

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.650 

here<00:01:10.670> in<00:01:10.790> just<00:01:11.000> a<00:01:11.120> second<00:01:11.570> on<00:01:12.530> them<00:01:13.220> after<00:01:14.120> they

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
here in just a second on them after they

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.140 
here in just a second on them after they
defuse<00:01:15.110> it<00:01:15.290> they<00:01:15.980> managed<00:01:16.370> to<00:01:16.580> get<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:16.970> bomb

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.200 

so<00:01:23.750> we<00:01:23.870> have<00:01:24.050> a<00:01:24.280> we<00:01:25.280> have<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.460> slightly<00:01:25.910> more
