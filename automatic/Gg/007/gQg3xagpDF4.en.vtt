 The pieris is a shrub of medium or small size, originating in Asia, and in particular from China and Japan 

00:00:21.403 --> 00:00:28.403
 It is planted in the garden, in a partially shaded area, where it can enjoy the sun only during the warmest hours of the day 

00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:06.976
 needs specific soil for acidophilic plants, lightened with a small amount of sand or pumice stone 

00:01:38.294 --> 00:01:46.290
 The plants that have just begun to stay need, during the summer, quite regular waterings, always waiting for the soil to be dry between one watering and another 

00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:51.430
 Watering is not necessary during the winter 

00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:59.750
 The plants dwelling in the open ground for a long time need sporadic watering, only in case of a prolonged drought 

00:02:00.113 --> 00:02:07.110
 We periodically supply a specific fertilizer for acidophilic plants, the best way to administer it is to spread 

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:11.120
 at the end of winter, a slow-release granular fertilizer at the foot of the plant 

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:22.130
 The foliage is dark green, shiny and slightly leathery, the spring buds are red, pink or orange 

00:02:22.422 --> 00:02:29.420
 the flowers are gathered in thin arched spikes, composed of numerous bell-shaped flowers, white or pink 

00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:38.680
 To avoid losing flowers and young shoots, pruning takes place when the flowers are withering
