00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
provisional cast on you want to continue

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.570 
provisional cast on you want to continue
doing<00:02:46.050> this<00:02:46.170> until<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.590> have<00:02:46.890> as<00:02:47.220> many

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
stitches on the needle as the pattern

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.559 
stitches on the needle as the pattern
calls<00:02:50.489> for

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.520 

one<00:02:57.560> hint<00:02:57.980> is<00:02:58.390> when<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.510> do<00:02:59.719> this<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.170> put<00:03:00.409> the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
one hint is when you do this you put the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.270 
one hint is when you do this you put the
needle<00:03:00.829> in

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
needle in

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.649 
needle in
try<00:03:01.489> not<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.700> split<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.120> yarn<00:03:02.209> when<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.540> do

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
try not to split the yarn when you do

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.149 
try not to split the yarn when you do
this<00:03:02.810> it'll<00:03:02.989> make<00:03:03.140> it<00:03:03.260> easier<00:03:03.590> when<00:03:03.739> you<00:03:03.890> pull

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
this it'll make it easier when you pull

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.929 
this it'll make it easier when you pull
the<00:03:04.370> cast<00:03:04.640> on<00:03:04.909> out<00:03:05.319> wrap<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.590> needle<00:03:06.909> put<00:03:07.909> a

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
the cast on out wrap the needle put a

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:11.289 
the cast on out wrap the needle put a
lot<00:03:08.269> of<00:03:08.420> pressure<00:03:08.719> on<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.140> working<00:03:09.530> yarn<00:03:10.299> that

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
lot of pressure on the working yarn that

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:17.140 
lot of pressure on the working yarn that
will<00:03:11.480> make<00:03:11.629> it<00:03:11.750> easier<00:03:12.109> to<00:03:12.230> pull<00:03:12.439> through<00:03:16.150> you

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
will make it easier to pull through you

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.360 
will make it easier to pull through you
continue<00:03:17.599> this<00:03:17.750> all<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.049> way<00:03:18.230> across<00:03:18.560> and

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.890 

that's<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.579> provisional<00:03:23.000> cast<00:03:23.239> on<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.689> we

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
that's the provisional cast on and we

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.990 
that's the provisional cast on and we
will<00:03:24.049> move<00:03:24.230> on<00:03:24.439> to<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.620> toe<00:03:24.889> in<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.819> next

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
will move on to the toe in the next

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.209 
will move on to the toe in the next
