00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.620
 Construction Jane Fonda must today 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.420
 it's about how to get a pilot 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.949
 can carry hetzer continuously that is 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.900
 that you still have it on your head 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.520
 even if you already have a helicopter 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.720
 do not leave anything normally 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.670
 works i show you the whole 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.769
 because I think that's just right 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.510
 Cool looks as well 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.699
 Most people in the online must be from gta 5 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.710
 not how the thing works and you 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.719
 his clothes can be his entire part 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.160
 to tailor to the headset so that 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.410
 the whole thing a really good impression 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.850
 waking up with other players before me 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.190
 with the video beginning synonymous still short 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.899
 ask many people from the gta community 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.950
 also from the German community 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.629
 already made a video for 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.090

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.010

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.570
 wanted to bring with me anyway 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.190
 also have a video to the patch 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.809
 an informational video simply writes 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.670
 I'll talk to you in the comments 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.379
 read your opinion and be that 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.670
 if necessary in the next few days 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.129
 and now it starts with the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.989
 you need today's video for the trick 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.909
 so first to the helicopter so would 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.409
 I recommend to an airfield too 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.299
 drive or at mayweather or 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.430
 call similar then had the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.590
 select button and go into yours 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.439
 inventory and then choose any one 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.030
 glasses out of which does not matter at all 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.740
 after that , once pressed the mountain button 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.500
 so again in the main menu since and 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.659
 expresses triangle or y depending on the console 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.520
 to board the helicopter 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.130
 Afterwards he often puts his eyes on the lake 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.810
 button to change the camera and 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.640
 then you are once in the first person 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.049
 Perspective comes the camera once 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.299
 inside you see your character and 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.400
 wait until he has put on the headset 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.890
 after that you just have to wear your glasses 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.290
 change or put down your glasses what he 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.540
 of both options power does not matter 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.399
 and then it's just like that 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.259
 headset is stored on your head 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.140
 it expressed once again the button away 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.210
 then press the start button and go in 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.950
 the character selection and the same if the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.750
 character choice are you see 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.100
 already in the character selection has 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.290
 your character is already a headset 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.939
 he simply chooses the character now 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.009
 from he landed in a new online 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.689
 lobby and that remains set now 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.030
 first on your head what for me how 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.800
 said that looks really cool 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.330
 pilots are now busy until now 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.530
 she changed something on your head 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.780
 that means for example so far 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.060
 draws a new mask or the like to 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.500

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.120
 load in any case thumb up there 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.190
 that motivates you naturally 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.840
