characters that and Christians for whom
that<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.570> not<00:00:18.690> an<00:00:18.779> issue<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.109> there<00:00:19.350> we<00:00:19.529> do

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
that is not an issue so there we do

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.470 
that is not an issue so there we do
pretty<00:00:19.800> well<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.850> one<00:00:21.000> issue<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.449> think

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
pretty well the one issue and I think

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.910 
pretty well the one issue and I think
you<00:00:21.689> guys<00:00:21.810> will<00:00:21.930> recognize<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.769> he

in comic strips are forced to sort of to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.929 
in comic strips are forced to sort of to

diminishes the quality of the art itself

here nor Watterson would absolutely hate

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.340 
here nor Watterson would absolutely hate
web<00:00:41.610> comics<00:00:42.000> he<00:00:42.360> would<00:00:42.480> hate<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.690> idea<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.140> I

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
web comics he would hate the idea that I

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.880 
web comics he would hate the idea that I
think<00:00:43.520> that<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.079> comic<00:00:46.410> itself<00:00:46.739> does

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
think that that the comic itself does

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.069 
think that that the comic itself does
not<00:00:46.920> generate<00:00:47.340> income<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:48.210> all<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.719> it's

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
not generate income it's all the it's

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.049 
not generate income it's all the it's
all<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.379> secondary<00:00:50.280> products<00:00:50.670> around<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
all the secondary products around the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.529 
all the secondary products around the
comic<00:00:51.360> strip<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:52.100> reduce<00:00:53.100> income<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.910> there

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
comic strip that reduce income so there

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.119 
comic strip that reduce income so there
I<00:00:54.570> think<00:00:54.809> webcomics<00:00:55.530> would<00:00:55.649> fail<00:00:55.890> miserably

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
I think webcomics would fail miserably

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.729 
I think webcomics would fail miserably
at<00:00:56.520> his<00:00:56.670> wine<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> frankly<00:00:57.960> speaking<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
at his wine and frankly speaking I the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.430 
at his wine and frankly speaking I the
sad<00:00:58.949> truth<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.430> he<00:00:59.670> would<00:00:59.850> not<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.210> if<00:01:01.199> web

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
sad truth that is he would not be if web

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.170 
sad truth that is he would not be if web
comics<00:01:01.770> were<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> default<00:01:02.460> business<00:01:02.850> model

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
comics were the default business model

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.490 
comics were the default business model
he<00:01:03.329> would<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:03.660> be<00:01:03.690> working<00:01:03.960> he<00:01:04.260> would<00:01:04.379> not

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
he would not be working he would not

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.800 
he would not be working he would not
want<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.939> would<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.180> genius<00:01:06.450> lost

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
want to do it it would be a genius lost

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.179 
want to do it it would be a genius lost
to<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.200> American<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> international

to the American in the international

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.770 
to the American in the international
landscape<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.260> in<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.409> regard<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.860> fails

cartoonist<00:01:12.780> he<00:01:13.619> also<00:01:13.740> expressed<00:01:14.070> I'm<00:01:14.310> trying

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
cartoonist he also expressed I'm trying

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.700 
cartoonist he also expressed I'm trying
to<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:14.700> what<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.240> photo<00:01:15.710> this

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
to do what I can with that photo this

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.670 
to do what I can with that photo this
one<00:01:16.890> goes<00:01:17.009> too<00:01:17.220> far<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.430> think<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:19.229> another

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
one goes too far I think so another

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.020 
one goes too far I think so another
concern<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.100> he<00:01:20.130> had<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.490> cartoonists

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
concern that he had is that cartoonists

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.429 
concern that he had is that cartoonists
who<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.240> their<00:01:21.390> assistants<00:01:21.840> draw<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.140> strip

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
who have their assistants draw the strip

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.719 
who have their assistants draw the strip
or<00:01:22.590> writing<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.860> stripper<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.189> little<00:01:23.460> too<00:01:23.580> much

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
or writing a stripper a little too much

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.149 
or writing a stripper a little too much
candidate<00:01:24.270> who<00:01:24.659> take<00:01:24.840> away<00:01:25.110> who<00:01:25.710> put<00:01:25.979> too<00:01:26.070> much

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
candidate who take away who put too much

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.469
