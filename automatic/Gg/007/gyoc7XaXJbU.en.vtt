redstone<00:00:03.959> logic<00:00:04.589> gates<00:00:04.770> be<00:00:04.950> precise<00:00:05.250> because

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
redstone logic gates be precise because

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.400 
redstone logic gates be precise because
redstone<00:00:06.299> is<00:00:06.450> pretty<00:00:06.690> hard<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:07.080> remember

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
redstone is pretty hard to remember

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.720 
redstone is pretty hard to remember
especially<00:00:07.950> on<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.099> console<00:00:08.460> because<00:00:08.610> you

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
especially on the console because you

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.400 
especially on the console because you
can't<00:00:08.910> just<00:00:09.030> pull<00:00:09.120> up<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.210> wiki<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.780> even

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
can't just pull up the wiki and even

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.720 
can't just pull up the wiki and even
though<00:00:10.500> even<00:00:10.769> if<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.010> do<00:00:11.130> pop<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.460> wiki<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
though even if you do pop the wiki the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.580 
though even if you do pop the wiki the
wikis<00:00:12.000> really<00:00:12.360> confusing<00:00:12.809> my<00:00:12.900> opinion<00:00:13.230> so<00:00:13.380> go

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
wikis really confusing my opinion so go

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.930 
wikis really confusing my opinion so go
to<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.740> video<00:00:13.980> tutorial<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.460> maybe<00:00:14.610> help<00:00:14.759> you

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
to a video tutorial to maybe help you

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.790 
to a video tutorial to maybe help you
guys<00:00:15.089> out<00:00:15.269> redstone<00:00:15.780> if<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.350> want<00:00:16.470> more<00:00:16.619> rest

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
guys out redstone if you want more rest

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.080 
guys out redstone if you want more rest
those<00:00:16.949> tutorials<00:00:17.279> let<00:00:17.460> me<00:00:17.580> know<00:00:17.699> but<00:00:17.910> let's

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
those tutorials let me know but let's

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.060 
those tutorials let me know but let's
just<00:00:18.270> jump<00:00:18.510> right<00:00:18.600> into<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:18.990> one<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.830> first

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
just jump right into this one so first

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.830 
just jump right into this one so first
of<00:00:20.189> all<00:00:20.250> logic<00:00:20.880> gates<00:00:21.090> are<00:00:21.300> basically<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> way

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
of all logic gates are basically a way

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.960 
of all logic gates are basically a way
to<00:00:21.900> do<00:00:22.289> things<00:00:22.560> with<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:23.220> know<00:00:23.250> redstone

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
to do things with you know redstone

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.429 
to do things with you know redstone
signals<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.570> allow<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.109> some<00:00:25.320> more

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
signals that allow you to do some more

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.439 
signals that allow you to do some more
complex<00:00:25.800> things<00:00:26.039> than<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:27.150> switch

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
complex things than just that switch

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.150 
complex things than just that switch
opens<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.019> door<00:00:28.230> or<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.560> switch<00:00:28.859> shuts

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
opens that door or that switch shuts

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.030 
opens that door or that switch shuts
that<00:00:29.340> door<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:30.240> can<00:00:30.449> do<00:00:30.660> stuff<00:00:30.900> such<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:31.590> lets

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
that door you can do stuff such as lets

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.709 
that door you can do stuff such as lets
you<00:00:32.550> know<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.790> not<00:00:32.969> gate<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.300> instance<00:00:33.600> so

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
you know the not gate for instance so

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.479 
you know the not gate for instance so
this<00:00:33.840> means<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.170> inverts<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> signal<00:00:35.309> so

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
this means that inverts the signal so

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.340 
this means that inverts the signal so
when<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.700> put<00:00:35.880> something<00:00:36.270> into<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.450> block<00:00:36.719> also

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
when you put something into a block also

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.930 
when you put something into a block also
these<00:00:37.590> signs<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:37.980> need<00:00:38.160> if<00:00:38.280> there<00:00:38.489> might<00:00:38.670> put

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
these signs are need if there might put

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.280 
these signs are need if there might put
the<00:00:39.000> signs<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.360> many<00:00:39.510> ways<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.960> gate<00:00:40.140> works

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the signs on many ways that gate works

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.720 
the signs on many ways that gate works
just<00:00:40.590> about<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.860> site<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.219> well<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:41.610> about

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
just about the site as well just about

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.520 
just about the site as well just about
the<00:00:41.879> sign<00:00:42.090> oh<00:00:42.270> yes<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:42.899> when<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.290> put<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the sign oh yes so when you put a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.290 
the sign oh yes so when you put a
redstone<00:00:43.950> charge<00:00:44.370> into<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> block<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.210> then

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
redstone charge into a block and then

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.459 
redstone charge into a block and then
you<00:00:45.390> put<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> torch<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> other<00:00:46.170> side<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
you put a torch on the other side of the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.959 
you put a torch on the other side of the
block<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:47.010> will<00:00:47.190> invert<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> signal<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.910> is

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
block it will invert the signal this is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.160 
block it will invert the signal this is
one<00:00:48.210> I've<00:00:48.300> known<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> while<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.809> use<00:00:49.020> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
one I've known for a while I use it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.900 
one I've known for a while I use it
quite<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.379> lot<00:00:49.440> my<00:00:49.620> Let's<00:00:49.800> Plays<00:00:50.039> again<00:00:50.700> if<00:00:50.820> you

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
quite a lot my Let's Plays again if you

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.060 
quite a lot my Let's Plays again if you
notice<00:00:51.090> those<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:52.260> basically<00:00:52.590> what<00:00:52.770> I'll<00:00:52.890> do

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
notice those and basically what I'll do

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.880 
notice those and basically what I'll do
is<00:00:53.660> I'll<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.899> invert<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> signal<00:00:55.440> which<00:00:55.680> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
is I'll just invert the signal which is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.380 
is I'll just invert the signal which is
handy<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.579> want<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.940> opposite<00:00:57.360> of

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
handy if you want the opposite of

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.180 
handy if you want the opposite of
something<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.780> happen<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.350> uh<00:00:58.379> prints<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.100> so

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
something to happen so uh prints and so

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.979 
something to happen so uh prints and so
on<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.399> piston<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.850> go<00:00:59.969> down<00:01:00.329> when<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> turn<00:01:00.960> on

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
on that piston to go down when I turn on

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.080 
on that piston to go down when I turn on
the<00:01:01.199> switch<00:01:01.410> rather<00:01:01.739> than<00:01:01.920> up<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.940> about

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the switch rather than up this is about

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.219 
the switch rather than up this is about
example<00:01:03.420> because<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.629> switch<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.989> usually

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
example because the switch is usually

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.299 
example because the switch is usually
thing<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:04.559> for<00:01:04.650> instance<00:01:04.769> with<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> pressure

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
thing but for instance with a pressure

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.730 
thing but for instance with a pressure
plate<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.330> let's<00:01:06.780> say<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> want<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.530> when<00:01:07.710> I

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
plate so let's say I want it when I

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.200 
plate so let's say I want it when I
stand<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.010> pressure<00:01:08.189> plate<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.430> want<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.640> block<00:01:09.030> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
stand a pressure plate I want a block to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.760 
stand a pressure plate I want a block to
be<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.540> know<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> retract<00:01:10.140> or<00:01:10.350> turn<00:01:10.530> off<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
be you know a retract or turn off the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.200 
be you know a retract or turn off the
Reg<00:01:10.920> no<00:01:11.010> signal<00:01:11.430> that's<00:01:11.850> where<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.090> off

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
Reg no signal that's where the off

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.580 
Reg no signal that's where the off
signal<00:01:12.510> comes<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.810> handy<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.200> we'll<00:01:13.320> pull<00:01:13.500> that

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
signal comes in handy so we'll pull that

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.649 
signal comes in handy so we'll pull that
block<00:01:13.799> down<00:01:14.070> rather<00:01:14.520> than<00:01:14.670> pushing<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.600> off

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
block down rather than pushing it off

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.719 
block down rather than pushing it off
and<00:01:15.930> then<00:01:16.380> that's<00:01:16.590> where<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.460> know<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
and then that's where the you know the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.980 
and then that's where the you know the
null<00:01:17.909> cake<00:01:18.090> comes<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.420> handy<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.840> just

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
null cake comes in handy it's just

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.840 
null cake comes in handy it's just
inverting<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.500> signal<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.759> pretty

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
inverting a signal it's it's it's pretty

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.850 
inverting a signal it's it's it's pretty
handy<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.299> my<00:01:21.390> opinion<00:01:21.689> either<00:01:21.840> one<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.710> hey

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
handy in my opinion either one like hey

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.440 
handy in my opinion either one like hey
you<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.040> work<00:01:23.400> around<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.909> there's<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.210> lot

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
you can work around it there's a lot

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.910 
you can work around it there's a lot
easier<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.900> use<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.350> my<00:01:25.470> opinion<00:01:25.650> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
easier just to use it in my opinion and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.770 
easier just to use it in my opinion and
it's<00:01:26.250> also<00:01:26.400> combined<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> other<00:01:27.180> gates<00:01:27.479> so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
it's also combined of the other gates so

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.210 
it's also combined of the other gates so
that's<00:01:27.990> where<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.409> comes<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.680> handy<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
that's where it comes in handy so the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.160 
that's where it comes in handy so the
next<00:01:29.369> gate<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.600> gate<00:01:30.840> also<00:01:31.049> I'm<00:01:31.110> gonna

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
next gate is a and gate also I'm gonna

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.069 
next gate is a and gate also I'm gonna
quickly<00:01:31.380> go<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.590> sleep<00:01:31.890> what<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.250> works<00:01:33.079> yeah

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
quickly go to sleep what this works yeah

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.359 
quickly go to sleep what this works yeah

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
piss about the redstone circuits

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.710 
piss about the redstone circuits
yourself<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.549> well<00:01:44.759> yeah<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.180> gate<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.689> a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
yourself and well yeah the and gate is a

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.510 
yourself and well yeah the and gate is a
gate<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.560> means<00:01:46.770> if<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> two<00:01:47.310> redstone

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
gate that means if the two redstone

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.550 
gate that means if the two redstone
inputs<00:01:48.000> are<00:01:48.149> both<00:01:48.270> turned<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.689> then<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.439> will

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
inputs are both turned on then it will

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.230 
inputs are both turned on then it will
power<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.040> third<00:01:50.280> redstone<00:01:50.700> ed<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:50.970> all<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
power the third redstone ed but all the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.539 
power the third redstone ed but all the
Redstone<00:01:51.750> outputs<00:01:52.320> sorry<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.250> if<00:01:53.369> one<00:01:53.520> of

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
Redstone outputs sorry so if one of

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.010 
Redstone outputs sorry so if one of
them's<00:01:53.729> turned<00:01:53.970> off<00:01:54.149> then<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.420> won't<00:01:54.509> power<00:01:54.780> if

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
them's turned off then it won't power if

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.209 
them's turned off then it won't power if
both<00:01:55.229> them<00:01:55.409> are<00:01:55.470> turned<00:01:55.619> off<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.890> won't<00:01:56.040> power

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
both them are turned off it won't power

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.380 
both them are turned off it won't power
if<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.729> them's<00:01:56.850> turned<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.299> won't

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
if one of them's turned on it won't

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.850 
if one of them's turned on it won't
power<00:01:57.600> they<00:01:57.960> both<00:01:58.170> have<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.439> be<00:01:58.530> turned<00:01:58.710> on

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
power they both have to be turned on

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.889 
power they both have to be turned on
that's<00:01:59.009> how<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.610> gate<00:01:59.790> works<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:00.689> handy

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
that's how and gate works and it's handy

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.660 
that's how and gate works and it's handy
if<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.200> want<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.280> how<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.490> works

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
if you want to have this is how it works

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.280 
if you want to have this is how it works
by<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.820> way<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.000> use<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.390> redstone<00:02:03.780> torch<00:02:03.899> on

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
by the way you use a redstone torch on

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.539 
by the way you use a redstone torch on
top<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> block<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> bread<00:02:05.130> stone<00:02:05.310> trail

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
top the block with a bread stone trail

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.459 
top the block with a bread stone trail
in<00:02:05.700> between<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.000> two<00:02:06.119> torches<00:02:06.509> there<00:02:07.290> never

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
in between the two torches there never

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.260 
in between the two torches there never
it's<00:02:07.590> don't<00:02:07.770> torch<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.640> side<00:02:08.819> off<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
it's don't torch on the side off the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.559 
it's don't torch on the side off the
redstone<00:02:09.750> trail<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.170> block<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:11.569> that's

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
redstone trail on the block and that's

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.550 
redstone trail on the block and that's
how<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.840> works

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
how it works

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.290 
how it works
and<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.340> quite<00:02:14.550> handy<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.880> my<00:02:15.000> opinion

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
and it's it's quite handy in my opinion

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.390 
and it's it's quite handy in my opinion
so<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.840> one<00:02:16.230> use<00:02:16.410> fit<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:17.040> saw<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.280> my

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
so this is a one use fit you saw in my

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.070 
so this is a one use fit you saw in my
coop<00:02:17.640> trap<00:02:17.849> video<00:02:18.090> if<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.330> watch<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.840> if<00:02:18.959> you

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
coop trap video if you watch that if you

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.210 
coop trap video if you watch that if you
didn't<00:02:19.349> then<00:02:19.470> are<00:02:19.620> linked<00:02:19.830> at<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:19.980> end<00:02:20.069> the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
have this switch turned on at which

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.110 
have this switch turned on at which
point<00:02:26.280> if<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.520> stand<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.790> pressure<00:02:26.910> player

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
point if you stand the pressure player

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.479 
point if you stand the pressure player
will<00:02:27.300> open<00:02:27.599> and<00:02:27.750> it's<00:02:28.650> it's<00:02:28.920> handy<00:02:29.160> for<00:02:29.190> having

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
will open and it's it's handy for having

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.430 
will open and it's it's handy for having
traps<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.180> turn<00:02:30.360> on<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.630> off<00:02:30.750> even<00:02:31.349> if

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
traps so you can turn on and off even if

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.870 
traps so you can turn on and off even if
they're<00:02:31.590> red<00:02:31.709> stone<00:02:31.950> based<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.489> that's

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
they're red stone based and that's

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.900 
they're red stone based and that's
that's<00:02:33.360> how<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.569> like<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.810> use<00:02:33.989> anyway<00:02:34.849> well<00:02:35.849> you

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
that's how I like to use anyway well you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.550 
that's how I like to use anyway well you
can<00:02:36.030> mess<00:02:36.150> around<00:02:36.269> people<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.260> know<00:02:37.349> make

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
can mess around people and you know make

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.960 
can mess around people and you know make
your<00:02:37.709> brush<00:02:37.860> baits<00:02:38.040> not<00:02:38.130> work<00:02:38.370> indoors<00:02:38.670> for

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
your brush baits not work indoors for

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.150 
your brush baits not work indoors for
them<00:02:39.120> by<00:02:39.930> using<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.290> switch<00:02:40.530> on/off<00:02:40.860> when<00:02:41.040> you

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
them by using the switch on/off when you

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.430 
them by using the switch on/off when you
want<00:02:41.340> its<00:02:41.519> let's<00:02:42.120> go<00:02:42.269> offer<00:02:42.540> practicalities

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
want its let's go offer practicalities

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.570 
want its let's go offer practicalities
for<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.739> especially<00:02:43.830> if<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.250> want<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.430> you

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
for it especially if you want to you

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.800 
for it especially if you want to you
know<00:02:44.700> mess<00:02:45.030> around<00:02:45.150> your<00:02:45.450> friends<00:02:45.600> or

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
know mess around your friends or

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.300 
know mess around your friends or
whatever<00:02:45.959> oh<00:02:46.260> yeah<00:02:46.680> that's<00:02:46.860> how<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.040> works

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
whatever oh yeah that's how that works

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.449 
whatever oh yeah that's how that works
the<00:02:47.580> next<00:02:47.819> is<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.120> NAND<00:02:48.390> gate<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:49.340> this<00:02:50.340> is

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
the next is the NAND gate and this is

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.340 
the next is the NAND gate and this is
just<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.970> gate<00:02:51.209> combined<00:02:51.660> with<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.989> an

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
just a and gate combined with a an

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.780 
just a and gate combined with a an
inverted<00:02:52.860> signal<00:02:53.040> except<00:02:53.459> here<00:02:53.640> it's

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
inverted signal except here it's

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.860 
inverted signal except here it's
slightly<00:02:54.060> used<00:02:54.239> differently<00:02:54.540> because<00:02:54.690> there

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
slightly used differently because there

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.210 
slightly used differently because there
previously<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.319> did<00:02:55.440> have<00:02:55.620> an<00:02:55.680> inverse<00:02:55.890> signal

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
previously it did have an inverse signal

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.680 
previously it did have an inverse signal
and<00:02:56.489> they<00:02:56.610> say<00:02:56.760> it's<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:56.880> exact<00:02:57.209> opposite<00:02:57.540> of

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
and they say it's the exact opposite of

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.839 
and they say it's the exact opposite of
a<00:02:57.780> NAND<00:02:57.959> gate<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:58.440> if<00:02:58.560> both<00:02:59.400> of<00:02:59.430> them<00:02:59.640> are

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
a NAND gate so if both of them are

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.059 
a NAND gate so if both of them are
turned<00:03:00.209> on<00:03:00.360> then<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.230> won't<00:03:01.349> be<00:03:01.500> powered<00:03:01.860> and

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
turned on then it won't be powered and

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.589 
turned on then it won't be powered and
if<00:03:02.220> neither<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:02.640> them<00:03:02.849> have<00:03:02.970> turned<00:03:03.120> on<00:03:03.330> or<00:03:03.510> if

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
if neither of them have turned on or if

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.330 
if neither of them have turned on or if
one<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.780> them's<00:03:04.019> turned<00:03:04.260> on<00:03:04.440> then<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.250> will

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
one of them's turned on then it will

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.789 
one of them's turned on then it will
stay<00:03:05.519> powered<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:06.140> it's<00:03:07.140> basically<00:03:07.440> just<00:03:07.560> a

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
stay powered so it's basically just a

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.979 
stay powered so it's basically just a
NAND<00:03:08.010> gate<00:03:08.099> with<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> not<00:03:09.030> gate<00:03:09.209> attached<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.870> it

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
NAND gate with a not gate attached to it

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.020 
NAND gate with a not gate attached to it
except<00:03:10.680> it's<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.069> slightly<00:03:11.430> easier<00:03:11.519> way<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.790> do

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
except it's a slightly easier way to do

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.660 
except it's a slightly easier way to do
it<00:03:12.150> in<00:03:12.239> my<00:03:12.360> opinion<00:03:12.569> but<00:03:12.959> that's<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.680> Oh<00:03:14.010> truck

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
it in my opinion but that's I Oh truck

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.100 
it in my opinion but that's I Oh truck
men<00:03:14.849> just<00:03:15.090> remembering<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.510> not<00:03:15.720> gate<00:03:15.900> and

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
men just remembering the not gate and

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.569 
men just remembering the not gate and
then<00:03:16.200> tying<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:16.980> NAND<00:03:17.190> gate<00:03:17.280> that's

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
then tying that to a NAND gate that's

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.880 
then tying that to a NAND gate that's
just<00:03:18.030> my<00:03:18.180> personal<00:03:18.570> opinion<00:03:18.630> though<00:03:18.989> so<00:03:19.620> next

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
just my personal opinion though so next

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.099 
just my personal opinion though so next
is<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.100> or<00:03:20.310> gate<00:03:20.579> or<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:21.030> o.r<00:03:21.299> gate<00:03:21.570> I<00:03:21.750> just

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
is the or gate or the o.r gate I just

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.479 
is the or gate or the o.r gate I just
call<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.440> or<00:03:22.560> gate<00:03:22.739> and<00:03:22.859> oh<00:03:23.220> basically

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
call it the or gate and oh basically

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.740 
call it the or gate and oh basically
this<00:03:23.609> means<00:03:23.790> if<00:03:24.030> either<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.299> them<00:03:24.420> are<00:03:24.570> turned

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
this means if either of them are turned

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.110 
this means if either of them are turned
on<00:03:24.900> then<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.320> will<00:03:25.530> power<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.400> Redstone<00:03:26.730> Trail

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
on then it will power the Redstone Trail

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.000 
on then it will power the Redstone Trail
so<00:03:27.329> if<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.690> turned<00:03:27.870> on<00:03:28.019> that<00:03:28.200> house<00:03:28.410> if

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
so if this is turned on that house if

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.349 
so if this is turned on that house if
this<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.310> turned<00:03:29.430> on<00:03:29.609> that<00:03:29.730> house<00:03:29.940> if<00:03:30.239> they

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
this is turned on that house if they

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.789 
this is turned on that house if they
both<00:03:30.510> turn<00:03:30.750> on<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.079> powers<00:03:31.470> but<00:03:31.620> if<00:03:31.709> me

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
both turn on that powers but if me

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.680 
both turn on that powers but if me
briefly<00:03:32.010> maternal<00:03:32.489> Matt<00:03:32.670> doesn't<00:03:33.000> power<00:03:33.269> and

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
briefly maternal Matt doesn't power and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.360 
briefly maternal Matt doesn't power and
yeah<00:03:34.319> it's<00:03:34.410> just<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.620> way<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.829> making<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.190> so

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
yeah it's just a way of making it so

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.160 
yeah it's just a way of making it so
either<00:03:35.549> input<00:03:35.760> will<00:03:36.030> power<00:03:36.269> something<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:37.079> you

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
either input will power something so you

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.360 
either input will power something so you
can<00:03:37.260> have<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.560> switch<00:03:37.769> it's<00:03:37.920> something<00:03:38.250> that

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
can have to switch it's something that

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.190 
can have to switch it's something that
will<00:03:38.459> both<00:03:38.640> work<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.660> problem<00:03:39.870> of<00:03:39.930> this<00:03:40.049> is

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
will both work the problem of this is

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.720 
will both work the problem of this is
though<00:03:40.380> if<00:03:40.590> two<00:03:40.920> switches<00:03:41.160> or<00:03:41.340> something<00:03:41.579> both

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
though if two switches or something both

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.550 
though if two switches or something both
work<00:03:42.000> then<00:03:42.600> you<00:03:42.720> have<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:42.930> turn<00:03:43.079> them<00:03:43.230> both<00:03:43.350> off

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
work then you have to turn them both off

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.900 
work then you have to turn them both off
if<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:43.769> want<00:03:43.920> its<00:03:44.010> turn<00:03:44.190> off<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:44.549> if<00:03:44.639> I<00:03:44.700> go<00:03:44.850> to

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
if you want its turn off so if I go to

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.180 
if you want its turn off so if I go to
this<00:03:45.090> one<00:03:45.329> then<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.569> turn<00:03:45.750> this<00:03:45.959> one<00:03:46.170> on<00:03:46.200> then

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
this one then I turn this one on then

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.470 
this one then I turn this one on then
you<00:03:47.280> have<00:03:47.310> turned<00:03:47.609> them<00:03:47.700> both<00:03:47.819> off<00:03:48.030> which<00:03:48.269> is

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
you have turned them both off which is

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.729 
you have turned them both off which is
something<00:03:48.810> where<00:03:49.049> you<00:03:49.139> need<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.440> external

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
something where you need the external

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.220 
something where you need the external
gape<00:03:50.010> I'll<00:03:50.190> show<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.579> in<00:03:50.639> a<00:03:50.670> minute<00:03:50.790> so

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
gape I'll show you that in a minute so

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.170 
gape I'll show you that in a minute so
next<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.560> nor<00:03:52.769> gate<00:03:52.799> which<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:53.880> exact

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
next is the nor gate which is the exact

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.910 
next is the nor gate which is the exact
opposite<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.780> or<00:03:54.930> gate<00:03:55.170> so<00:03:55.440> if<00:03:55.560> both<00:03:55.769> of

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
opposite of the or gate so if both of

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.370 
opposite of the or gate so if both of
them<00:03:56.100> are<00:03:56.220> turned<00:03:56.400> on<00:03:56.579> then<00:03:57.450> no<00:03:57.959> if<00:03:58.079> neither<00:03:58.290> of

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
them are turned on then no if neither of

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.750 
them are turned on then no if neither of
them<00:03:58.500> are<00:03:58.560> turned<00:03:58.799> on<00:03:58.980> then<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.400> will<00:03:59.519> stay

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
them are turned on then it will stay

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.690 
them are turned on then it will stay
powered<00:03:59.940> way<00:04:00.150> actually<00:04:00.329> so<00:04:01.040> if<00:04:02.040> yeah<00:04:02.400> neither

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
powered way actually so if yeah neither

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.819 
powered way actually so if yeah neither
of<00:04:02.850> them<00:04:03.000> are<00:04:03.120> turned<00:04:03.389> on<00:04:03.600> then<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.590> block

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
of them are turned on then the block

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.949 
of them are turned on then the block
will<00:04:05.040> power<00:04:05.220> but<00:04:05.519> one<00:04:06.239> of<00:04:06.329> them's<00:04:06.480> turned<00:04:06.750> on

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
will power but one of them's turned on

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.390 
will power but one of them's turned on
and<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.440> won't<00:04:07.560> power<00:04:07.859> both<00:04:08.130> of<00:04:08.220> them<00:04:08.310> are

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
and it won't power both of them are

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.250 
and it won't power both of them are
turned<00:04:08.549> on<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:08.819> won't<00:04:08.970> power<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.389> that's<00:04:10.109> how

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
turned on it won't power and that's how

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.699 
turned on it won't power and that's how
it<00:04:10.350> works

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
it works

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.140 
it works
sorry<00:04:11.220> I've<00:04:11.280> got<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.400> computes<00:04:11.760> no<00:04:11.850> one<00:04:12.000> I

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
sorry I've got the computes no one I

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.000 
sorry I've got the computes no one I
would<00:04:12.299> recommend<00:04:12.420> again<00:04:12.900> just<00:04:13.109> using<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.590> or

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
would recommend again just using a or

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.500 
would recommend again just using a or
gate<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.459> then<00:04:14.609> using<00:04:14.850> a<00:04:14.910> not<00:04:15.060> gate<00:04:15.209> attached

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
gate and then using a not gate attached

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.300 
gate and then using a not gate attached
to<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:15.750> just<00:04:16.500> it<00:04:16.650> just<00:04:16.799> means<00:04:17.070> you're<00:04:17.190> for

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
to it just it just means you're for

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.979 
to it just it just means you're for
remember<00:04:17.609> less<00:04:17.760> gates<00:04:18.030> but<00:04:18.389> if<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.780> prefer

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
remember less gates but if you prefer

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.539 
remember less gates but if you prefer
remembering<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.680> nor<00:04:19.829> gate<00:04:19.859> then<00:04:20.250> it's<00:04:20.400> a

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
remembering the nor gate then it's a

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.180 
remembering the nor gate then it's a
redstone<00:04:20.880> block<00:04:21.239> on<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.599> side<00:04:21.840> if<00:04:22.019> a<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:23.070> know

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
redstone block on the side if a you know

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.690 
redstone block on the side if a you know
on<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.400> side<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.820> or<00:04:24.270> gate

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
on the side of the or gate

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.700 
on the side of the or gate
and<00:04:25.480> then<00:04:25.660> followed<00:04:25.900> by<00:04:25.930> trail<00:04:26.320> if<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.560> want

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
and then followed by trail if you want

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.130 
and then followed by trail if you want
to<00:04:26.770> trail<00:04:26.950> obviously<00:04:27.340> and<00:04:28.240> next<00:04:28.570> we<00:04:28.690> have<00:04:28.870> the

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
to trail obviously and next we have the

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.510 
to trail obviously and next we have the
most<00:04:29.290> complicated<00:04:29.590> gait<00:04:29.830> this<00:04:30.010> is<00:04:30.160> one<00:04:30.370> that

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
most complicated gait this is one that

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.950 
most complicated gait this is one that
you're<00:04:30.610> gonna<00:04:30.730> need<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.180> if<00:04:31.390> you<00:04:31.570> want<00:04:31.750> to<00:04:31.810> you

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
you're gonna need to if you want to you

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.420 
you're gonna need to if you want to you
know<00:04:32.080> actually<00:04:32.260> accurately<00:04:32.980> remember<00:04:33.130> you

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
know actually accurately remember you

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.800 
know actually accurately remember you
probably<00:04:33.550> nor<00:04:33.850> freeze<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.240> video<00:04:34.300> or<00:04:34.630> just

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
probably nor freeze the video or just

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.120 
probably nor freeze the video or just
copy<00:04:35.170> this<00:04:35.320> into<00:04:35.530> your<00:04:35.590> world<00:04:35.770> or<00:04:35.890> weather<00:04:36.010> or

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
copy this into your world or weather or

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.040 
copy this into your world or weather or
you<00:04:36.730> could<00:04:37.030> just<00:04:37.180> download<00:04:37.300> mine<00:04:37.780> as<00:04:37.930> I

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
you could just download mine as I

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.700 
you could just download mine as I
offered<00:04:38.380> so<00:04:38.620> um<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.970> xor<00:04:40.570> gate<00:04:40.600> or<00:04:40.900> all<00:04:41.410> gate

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
offered so um the xor gate or all gate

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.890 
offered so um the xor gate or all gate
as<00:04:41.860> i<00:04:41.950> call<00:04:42.130> it<00:04:42.160> it's<00:04:43.060> basically<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.540> way<00:04:43.750> of

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
as i call it it's basically a way of

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.990 
as i call it it's basically a way of
making<00:04:44.050> it<00:04:44.290> so<00:04:44.590> two<00:04:44.650> inputs<00:04:45.280> will<00:04:45.640> work<00:04:45.820> on

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
making it so two inputs will work on

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.970 
making it so two inputs will work on
something<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:46.630> if<00:04:46.900> they<00:04:47.080> it's<00:04:47.710> basically

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
something and if they it's basically

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.890 
something and if they it's basically
like<00:04:48.160> a<00:04:48.220> way<00:04:48.460> to<00:04:48.490> make<00:04:48.850> two<00:04:49.300> ways<00:04:49.450> to<00:04:49.600> open<00:04:49.810> the

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
like a way to make two ways to open the

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.540 
like a way to make two ways to open the
door<00:04:50.080> like<00:04:50.260> an<00:04:50.380> inside<00:04:50.740> switcher<00:04:51.160> adorn<00:04:51.430> it

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
door like an inside switcher adorn it

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.060 
door like an inside switcher adorn it
outside<00:04:51.880> switch<00:04:52.150> and<00:04:52.420> as<00:04:53.200> you<00:04:53.350> can<00:04:53.440> see<00:04:53.500> it<00:04:53.860> in

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
outside switch and as you can see it in

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.830 
outside switch and as you can see it in
this<00:04:54.220> way<00:04:54.460> if<00:04:54.730> they're<00:04:54.970> both<00:04:55.120> turned<00:04:55.420> on<00:04:55.570> then

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
this way if they're both turned on then

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.080 
this way if they're both turned on then
it<00:04:55.960> won't<00:04:56.110> be<00:04:56.260> powered<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:56.830> if<00:04:57.340> they're<00:04:57.820> both

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
it won't be powered and if they're both

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.610 
it won't be powered and if they're both
different<00:04:58.270> or<00:04:58.720> as<00:04:59.050> I'm<00:04:59.230> saying<00:04:59.410> if<00:04:59.500> they're

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
different or as I'm saying if they're

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.110 
different or as I'm saying if they're
both<00:04:59.710> different<00:04:59.950> then<00:05:00.550> it'll<00:05:00.730> power<00:05:00.880> if

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
both different then it'll power if

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.550 
both different then it'll power if
they're<00:05:01.480> both<00:05:01.600> the<00:05:01.750> same<00:05:01.780> it<00:05:02.110> won't<00:05:02.200> power<00:05:02.410> so

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
they're both the same it won't power so

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.020 
they're both the same it won't power so
if<00:05:02.620> they're<00:05:02.740> both<00:05:02.860> turned<00:05:03.070> off<00:05:03.220> it<00:05:03.490> it<00:05:03.940> won't

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
if they're both turned off it it won't

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.550 
if they're both turned off it it won't
power<00:05:04.360> they're<00:05:04.750> both<00:05:04.870> turned<00:05:05.140> on<00:05:05.290> it<00:05:05.410> won't

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
power they're both turned on it won't

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.930 
power they're both turned on it won't
power<00:05:05.770> but<00:05:06.010> if<00:05:06.100> one<00:05:06.250> of<00:05:06.280> them's<00:05:06.490> turned<00:05:06.760> off

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
power but if one of them's turned off

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.700 
power but if one of them's turned off
and<00:05:07.180> one<00:05:07.360> of<00:05:07.420> them's<00:05:07.570> turned<00:05:07.810> on<00:05:07.990> then<00:05:08.500> it<00:05:08.620> will

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
and one of them's turned on then it will

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.950 
and one of them's turned on then it will
power<00:05:08.860> I<00:05:09.340> have<00:05:10.060> no<00:05:10.180> problem<00:05:10.510> using<00:05:10.630> it<00:05:10.840> this

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
power I have no problem using it this

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.750 
power I have no problem using it this
way<00:05:11.200> for<00:05:11.260> some<00:05:11.530> reason<00:05:11.560> I<00:05:11.860> much<00:05:12.130> prefer<00:05:12.520> the

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
way for some reason I much prefer the

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.840 
way for some reason I much prefer the
the<00:05:13.420> N<00:05:13.600> xor<00:05:13.960> gate<00:05:13.990> or<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.350> X<00:05:14.590> nor<00:05:14.830> gate<00:05:15.040> because

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
the N xor gate or the X nor gate because

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.430 
the N xor gate or the X nor gate because
it<00:05:15.880> works<00:05:16.150> the<00:05:16.390> opposite<00:05:16.810> way<00:05:16.870> so<00:05:17.020> if<00:05:17.290> they're

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
it works the opposite way so if they're

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.780 
it works the opposite way so if they're
both<00:05:17.620> powered<00:05:18.010> then<00:05:18.220> it<00:05:18.340> will<00:05:18.430> power<00:05:18.580> if

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
both powered then it will power if

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:19.980 
both powered then it will power if
they're<00:05:18.970> both<00:05:19.120> turned<00:05:19.390> off<00:05:19.540> then<00:05:19.810> it<00:05:19.900> will

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
they're both turned off then it will

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.170 
they're both turned off then it will
turn<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.200> off<00:05:20.640> this<00:05:21.640> is<00:05:21.820> my<00:05:21.970> personal

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
turn it off this is my personal

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.970 
turn it off this is my personal
preference<00:05:22.720> and<00:05:22.930> just<00:05:23.320> in<00:05:23.410> case<00:05:23.500> you<00:05:23.650> want<00:05:23.830> to

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
preference and just in case you want to

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.770 
preference and just in case you want to
copy<00:05:24.370> these<00:05:24.580> in<00:05:24.760> you<00:05:24.880> Minecraft<00:05:25.270> world<00:05:25.420> the

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
copy these in you Minecraft world the

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.840 
copy these in you Minecraft world the
pause<00:05:25.930> video<00:05:26.230> right<00:05:26.470> here<00:05:26.680> and<00:05:26.860> this<00:05:27.490> is<00:05:27.550> how

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
pause video right here and this is how

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.820 
pause video right here and this is how
both<00:05:28.060> of<00:05:28.090> them<00:05:28.270> works<00:05:28.510> so<00:05:28.840> just<00:05:29.140> you<00:05:29.470> know<00:05:29.500> copy

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
both of them works so just you know copy

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.530 
both of them works so just you know copy
this<00:05:29.980> and<00:05:30.100> you<00:05:30.190> old<00:05:30.340> over<00:05:30.580> and<00:05:30.820> oh<00:05:31.270> yeah<00:05:31.420> this

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
this and you old over and oh yeah this

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.510 
this and you old over and oh yeah this
is<00:05:31.600> it<00:05:31.720> you<00:05:31.930> being<00:05:32.140> used<00:05:32.320> in<00:05:32.440> practicality<00:05:33.070> so

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
is it you being used in practicality so

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.920 
is it you being used in practicality so
let's<00:05:33.700> say<00:05:33.850> I<00:05:33.880> have<00:05:34.060> a<00:05:34.090> house<00:05:34.300> with<00:05:34.510> two<00:05:34.570> doors

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
let's say I have a house with two doors

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.770 
let's say I have a house with two doors
a<00:05:35.380> back<00:05:35.740> door<00:05:35.920> a<00:05:35.980> front<00:05:36.280> door<00:05:36.430> and<00:05:37.030> I<00:05:37.300> want<00:05:37.600> them

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
a back door a front door and I want them

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.210 
a back door a front door and I want them
both<00:05:37.930> to<00:05:38.080> open<00:05:38.320> at<00:05:38.380> the<00:05:38.440> same<00:05:38.650> time<00:05:38.890> but<00:05:39.100> be

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
both to open at the same time but be

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.760 
both to open at the same time but be
opening<00:05:39.520> ball<00:05:39.640> from<00:05:39.790> both<00:05:40.030> sites<00:05:40.630> so<00:05:40.990> with

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
opening ball from both sites so with

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.560 
opening ball from both sites so with
this<00:05:41.920> example<00:05:42.250> I<00:05:42.460> can<00:05:42.700> open<00:05:42.940> this<00:05:43.030> switch<00:05:43.300> and

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
this example I can open this switch and

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.820 
this example I can open this switch and
go<00:05:43.780> through<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.080> house<00:05:44.200> it<00:05:44.470> will<00:05:44.530> open<00:05:44.650> the

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
go through the house it will open the

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.590 
go through the house it will open the
back<00:05:44.980> door<00:05:45.160> as<00:05:45.250> well<00:05:45.460> and<00:05:45.670> then<00:05:46.300> go<00:05:46.420> to<00:05:46.480> the

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
back door as well and then go to the

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.270 
back door as well and then go to the
backyard<00:05:46.750> and<00:05:47.110> do<00:05:47.320> my<00:05:47.470> gardening<00:05:47.740> I<00:05:48.100> guess

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
backyard and do my gardening I guess

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.650 
backyard and do my gardening I guess
let's<00:05:48.490> say<00:05:48.640> this<00:05:48.730> is<00:05:48.790> my<00:05:48.910> back<00:05:49.180> garden<00:05:49.570> and

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
let's say this is my back garden and

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.540 
let's say this is my back garden and
then<00:05:50.140> we<00:05:50.260> can<00:05:50.440> shut<00:05:50.800> the<00:05:50.890> doors<00:05:51.100> from<00:05:51.280> out<00:05:51.370> here

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
then we can shut the doors from out here

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.530 
then we can shut the doors from out here
while<00:05:51.730> we're<00:05:51.850> out<00:05:51.940> here<00:05:52.090> because<00:05:52.270> we<00:05:52.390> don't

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
while we're out here because we don't

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.640 
while we're out here because we don't
want<00:05:52.660> creepers<00:05:53.050> walking<00:05:53.350> in<00:05:53.410> while<00:05:53.560> we're

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
want creepers walking in while we're

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.230 
want creepers walking in while we're
gone<00:05:53.770> or<00:05:53.830> something<00:05:54.250> and<00:05:54.460> then<00:05:54.940> we<00:05:55.030> want<00:05:55.180> to

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
gone or something and then we want to

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.550 
gone or something and then we want to
come<00:05:55.360> back<00:05:55.480> in<00:05:55.540> we<00:05:55.810> can<00:05:55.930> open<00:05:56.050> the<00:05:56.260> switch<00:05:56.440> from

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
come back in we can open the switch from

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.920 
come back in we can open the switch from
here<00:05:56.800> and<00:05:56.980> come<00:05:57.280> back<00:05:57.370> in<00:05:57.550> that<00:05:57.700> way<00:05:57.820> or<00:05:58.780> we

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
here and come back in that way or we

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.050 
here and come back in that way or we
could<00:05:59.140> leave<00:05:59.470> it<00:05:59.590> shop<00:05:59.800> for<00:05:59.980> instance<00:06:00.280> and<00:06:00.490> go

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
could leave it shop for instance and go

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.490 
could leave it shop for instance and go
right<00:06:01.240> back<00:06:01.420> around<00:06:01.570> the<00:06:01.810> front<00:06:02.080> door<00:06:02.260> and

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
right back around the front door and

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.250 
right back around the front door and
open<00:06:03.490> it<00:06:03.580> from<00:06:03.640> there<00:06:03.850> as<00:06:03.970> well<00:06:04.150> so<00:06:04.330> that's<00:06:04.810> one

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
open it from there as well so that's one

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.870 
open it from there as well so that's one
such<00:06:05.470> a<00:06:05.500> big<00:06:05.650> benefit<00:06:06.040> and<00:06:06.250> if<00:06:06.400> some<00:06:06.610> reason<00:06:06.820> it

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
such a big benefit and if some reason it

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.280 
such a big benefit and if some reason it
glitched<00:06:07.060> out<00:06:07.240> when<00:06:07.420> you<00:06:07.480> do<00:06:07.600> like<00:06:07.810> that<00:06:07.840> but

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
glitched out when you do like that but

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.190 
glitched out when you do like that but
you<00:06:08.740> get<00:06:08.860> what<00:06:08.980> I'm<00:06:09.040> saying<00:06:09.130> so<00:06:09.520> up<00:06:09.960> it's<00:06:10.960> it's

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
you get what I'm saying so up it's it's

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.420 
you get what I'm saying so up it's it's
pretty<00:06:11.410> handy<00:06:11.560> when<00:06:11.830> you<00:06:11.890> do<00:06:12.010> it<00:06:12.100> like<00:06:12.190> this

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
pretty handy when you do it like this

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.450 
pretty handy when you do it like this
and<00:06:13.380> it<00:06:14.380> has<00:06:14.500> quite<00:06:14.710> a<00:06:14.770> lot<00:06:14.890> of<00:06:14.920> utility<00:06:15.160> in<00:06:15.400> my

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
and it has quite a lot of utility in my

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.030 
and it has quite a lot of utility in my
opinion<00:06:16.450> but<00:06:16.630> that's<00:06:16.750> just<00:06:17.350> my<00:06:17.560> opinion<00:06:17.590> so

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
opinion but that's just my opinion so

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.710 
opinion but that's just my opinion so
these<00:06:18.190> are<00:06:18.340> all<00:06:18.460> of<00:06:18.580> the<00:06:18.730> redstone<00:06:19.390> gates

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
these are all of the redstone gates

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.540 
these are all of the redstone gates
there<00:06:20.320> are<00:06:20.440> seven<00:06:20.830> of<00:06:20.920> them<00:06:21.100> but<00:06:21.310> you<00:06:21.340> only

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
there are seven of them but you only

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.310 
there are seven of them but you only
have<00:06:21.670> to<00:06:21.760> remember<00:06:21.880> three<00:06:22.240> of<00:06:22.270> them<00:06:22.510> and<00:06:23.200> then

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
have to remember three of them and then

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.470 
have to remember three of them and then
the<00:06:23.500> not<00:06:24.010> gate<00:06:24.220> in<00:06:24.490> my<00:06:24.790> opinion<00:06:25.150> but<00:06:25.330> if<00:06:25.390> you

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
the not gate in my opinion but if you

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.240 
the not gate in my opinion but if you
wanna<00:06:25.630> remember<00:06:25.780> seven<00:06:26.290> then<00:06:26.470> I'll<00:06:27.010> just

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
wanna remember seven then I'll just

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.010 
wanna remember seven then I'll just
really<00:06:27.400> scroll<00:06:27.640> through<00:06:27.820> them<00:06:27.940> one<00:06:28.120> more<00:06:28.240> time

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
really scroll through them one more time

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.260 
really scroll through them one more time
this<00:06:29.350> is<00:06:29.530> the<00:06:29.710> not<00:06:29.920> gate<00:06:30.100> this<00:06:30.490> is<00:06:30.730> the<00:06:31.030> and

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
this is the not gate this is the and

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.260 
this is the not gate this is the and
gate<00:06:31.570> this<00:06:31.960> is<00:06:32.230> the<00:06:32.530> NAND<00:06:33.040> gate<00:06:33.460> this<00:06:34.030> is<00:06:34.090> the

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
gate this is the NAND gate this is the

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.500 
gate this is the NAND gate this is the
or<00:06:34.540> gate<00:06:34.870> this<00:06:35.380> is<00:06:35.440> the<00:06:35.650> nor<00:06:36.370> gate<00:06:36.400> this<00:06:37.150> is<00:06:37.360> the

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.510 
or gate this is the nor gate this is the

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.690 
or gate this is the nor gate this is the
xor<00:06:38.080> gate<00:06:38.110> or

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
xor gate or

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.450 
xor gate or
all<00:06:38.790> gay<00:06:39.030> and<00:06:39.330> this<00:06:39.570> is<00:06:39.720> the<00:06:39.900> the<00:06:40.710> NX<00:06:41.040> or<00:06:41.220> gate

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
all gay and this is the the NX or gate

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.160 
all gay and this is the the NX or gate
or<00:06:41.490> Texan<00:06:42.090> or<00:06:42.210> gate<00:06:42.390> Isis<00:06:42.690> I<00:06:42.810> don't<00:06:42.990> know<00:06:43.050> why

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.170 
or Texan or gate Isis I don't know why

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.660 
or Texan or gate Isis I don't know why
keep<00:06:43.350> getting<00:06:43.530> those<00:06:43.590> less<00:06:43.770> mixed<00:06:44.070> up<00:06:44.160> B<00:06:44.550> yeah

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670 
keep getting those less mixed up B yeah

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.340 
keep getting those less mixed up B yeah
hopefully<00:06:45.150> they're<00:06:45.330> this<00:06:45.480> spread<00:06:45.780> stone<00:06:46.020> gate

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
hopefully they're this spread stone gate

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.200 
hopefully they're this spread stone gate
tutorial<00:06:46.800> helped<00:06:47.010> you<00:06:47.160> out<00:06:47.190> I<00:06:47.340> know<00:06:47.580> it's<00:06:47.940> a

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
tutorial helped you out I know it's a

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.490 
tutorial helped you out I know it's a
little<00:06:48.360> complicated<00:06:48.540> but<00:06:49.020> it's<00:06:49.170> a<00:06:49.200> lot<00:06:49.380> more

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
little complicated but it's a lot more

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.820 
little complicated but it's a lot more
complicated<00:06:49.740> to<00:06:49.980> read<00:06:50.070> in<00:06:50.160> the<00:06:50.250> wiki<00:06:50.460> trust<00:06:50.760> me

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
complicated to read in the wiki trust me

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.140 
complicated to read in the wiki trust me
and<00:06:52.830> so<00:06:53.010> hopefully<00:06:53.400> this<00:06:53.580> helped<00:06:53.820> someone

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
and so hopefully this helped someone

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.060 
and so hopefully this helped someone
that<00:06:54.300> with<00:06:54.420> your<00:06:54.630> resident<00:06:55.170> activities<00:06:55.260> if<00:06:55.800> it

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
that with your resident activities if it

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.290 
that with your resident activities if it
doesn't<00:06:56.370> and<00:06:56.460> you<00:06:56.550> want<00:06:56.730> something<00:06:56.970> more<00:06:57.210> in

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
doesn't and you want something more in

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.520 
doesn't and you want something more in
depth<00:06:57.480> you<00:06:57.570> want<00:06:57.780> some<00:06:57.990> like<00:06:58.170> actual

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
depth you want some like actual

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.380 
depth you want some like actual
practical<00:06:58.890> examples<00:06:59.370> let<00:06:59.970> me<00:07:00.060> know<00:07:00.180> and<00:07:00.240> I<00:07:00.360> can

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.390 
practical examples let me know and I can

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.510 
practical examples let me know and I can
start<00:07:00.750> doing<00:07:00.900> that<00:07:01.170> if<00:07:01.650> you<00:07:01.830> want<00:07:01.980> to<00:07:02.190> support

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
start doing that if you want to support

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.730 
start doing that if you want to support
that<00:07:02.730> then<00:07:02.910> like<00:07:03.090> the<00:07:03.270> video<00:07:03.380> maybe<00:07:04.380> share<00:07:04.710> it

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
that then like the video maybe share it

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.380 
that then like the video maybe share it
let<00:07:04.980> people<00:07:05.400> know<00:07:05.430> or<00:07:05.730> something<00:07:06.090> along<00:07:06.210> those

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.390 
let people know or something along those

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.360 
let people know or something along those
lines<00:07:06.510> because<00:07:07.140> yeah<00:07:07.590> that's<00:07:07.770> how<00:07:07.920> I<00:07:07.950> base<00:07:08.190> my

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
lines because yeah that's how I base my

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.490 
lines because yeah that's how I base my
video<00:07:08.550> making<00:07:08.790> decisions<00:07:09.240> so<00:07:09.960> yeah<00:07:10.110> just<00:07:10.350> er

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
video making decisions so yeah just er

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.680 
video making decisions so yeah just er
