on<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:49.020> very<00:00:49.200> first<00:00:49.260> time<00:00:49.800> I'm<00:00:50.730> not<00:00:50.940> exactly

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
on that very first time I'm not exactly

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.990 
on that very first time I'm not exactly
sure<00:00:51.300> how<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.570> works<00:00:51.809> but<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:53.250> do<00:00:53.610> enough

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
sure how it works but it can do enough

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.569 
sure how it works but it can do enough
damage<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.989> middle<00:00:55.230> thing<00:00:55.430> where<00:00:56.430> you

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
damage to that middle thing where you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.450 
damage to that middle thing where you
fail<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.559> shoot<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.399> you

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
fail you have to shoot it you so you

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.210 
fail you have to shoot it you so you
have<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.820> shoot<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.329> enough<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:03.830> knock<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.010> off

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
and then after you do that it starts to

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.030 
and then after you do that it starts to
fly<00:01:09.510> around<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> same<00:01:10.710> thing<00:01:10.920> as

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040

found that just for like exactly where I
got<00:01:17.340> my<00:01:17.549> checkpoint<00:01:18.090> going<00:01:19.020> around<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.799> other

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
got my checkpoint going around the other

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.700 
got my checkpoint going around the other
direction<00:01:20.400> was<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.570> best<00:01:21.780> way<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:21.990> go<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.590> to
