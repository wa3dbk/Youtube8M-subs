 Hello everyone and welcome to the first course 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.740
 of digital photography in video 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.929
 I found out that my car 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.780
 photographic more account keys to think of 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:52.059
 and I found out that there are a lot of 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.300
 functions than in other photographic areas 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.329
 not used and in this situation 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.829
 must use by force and never have it 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.039
 discovered otherwise if I had not been 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.149
 in the field to photograph this genre 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.840
 thanks fulvio because he gave me the 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:10.030
 possibility of being able to point out also 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.939
 to the other friends of the group who 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.680
 technology gives us a series of tools 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.289
 that we have the possibility or not of 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.610
 being able to use these tools though 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.610
 they come to our aid 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.250
 hello and welcome to the second exit in 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.230
 exteriors of our photography course 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.140
 we are in a beautiful oasis that the oasis 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.200
 di of racconigi the oasis of the storks e 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.090
 of the ducks this is a center that 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.030
 thank you very much for the opportunity 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.620
 who gave us this today to be here 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.620
 and now let's go for some shots 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.190
 chapter 6 photographing people this 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.710
 I think it's one of the most beautiful chapters 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.020
 because more immediate but also for some 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.240
 wait more difficult because you succeed in 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.880
 transfer to others who watch the 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.070
 our image the character of 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.950
 people photographed and the expression i 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.980
 doubts of the people photographed are not 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.350
 something so simple 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.650
 let's try to see what rules 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.650
 address this topic 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.910
