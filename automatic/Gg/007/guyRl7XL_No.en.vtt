00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.030
 and 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.200
 and 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:28.140
 hello friends today we are going to make a dessert 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:30.599
 ice cream let's make a cheese biscuit 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.360
 with cream cheese you will see that it does not come out 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.129
 for it is very simple we are going to 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.309
 need very few ingredients that 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.309
 are 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.960
 some eggs 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.960
 cream cheese I put philadelphia 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.960
 sugar 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.940
 and whipped cream to mount and also that 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:57.360
 I forgot a little glass of rauch apart 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.360
 let's start 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.960
 we separate the yolk from the egg whites 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.789
 and with the clear ones we will keep them because 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.789
 we can do other things 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.750
 let's see the sugar 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.150
 and let's beat it very well beaten this 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.470
 mixture of sugar with yolks 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.470
 it has to be white 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.820
 because he has taken these wells and the and this 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.550
 beige color that has been white 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.200
 we will add philadelphia cheese yo 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.420
 I put him in the city of faithful but you can 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.420
 put any creamy cheese 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.200
 and we will continue to beat 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.620
 Once integrated, we will add the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.620
 error socket 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:27.719
 and now we will beat by hand now this 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:29.700
 mix we will reserve it and we will ride 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.249
 then the cream that we have had 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.189
 5 minutes or days in the freezer not 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:38.930
 it has to be mounted at all but 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.930
 have to take consistency 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.510
 it has to have this consistency not 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.690
 assembled is the cream we 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.530
 nata we call but in many countries 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.239
 he calls cream milk cream 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.950
 Milk to ride has to have like 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.680
 I always tell you 35% fat 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.920
 we will pass the cream or the milk cream 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.680
 Note that it is not mounted to the point of 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.760
 snow is not quite how it would be a 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.610
 cream for cakes and cream 20 grams 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.510
 or cream of milk to the mixture that 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.060
 we had reserved envelops and not 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.880
 is doing it a lot 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.500
 you see 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:35.650
 and finally 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.650
 we'll put it in a few glasses 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.420
 for each of this and give the freezer 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.700
 and we have done it now we have 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.379
 to freeze, we 're going to pass a 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.930
 freezer good friends we've had it 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:02.540
 two or three hours in the freezer and already 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.970
 we have here our biscuit you 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.530
 we will put a mint leaf to give it 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.980
 colour 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.470
 and now we'll leave it for a little while 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.069
 room temperature so that we stay 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.069
 more creamy 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.260
 as always 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.970
 I hoped that when you do not 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.970
 come out as good as this one 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.400
