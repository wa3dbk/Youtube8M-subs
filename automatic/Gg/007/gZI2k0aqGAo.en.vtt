know I have sensitive skin but I said

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.770 
know I have sensitive skin but I said
well<00:01:52.430> maybe<00:01:52.670> it's<00:01:53.030> because<00:01:53.530> I<00:01:55.299> wasn't<00:01:56.299> using<00:01:56.570> a

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
well maybe it's because I wasn't using a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.510 
well maybe it's because I wasn't using a
moisturizer<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.530> I<00:01:57.590> didn't<00:01:57.799> have<00:01:57.920> her<00:01:58.040> extra

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.730 
moisturizer and I didn't have her extra
extra<00:01:59.450> extra<00:01:59.979> wait<00:02:01.329> what<00:02:02.329> was<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.479> maybe<00:02:03.439> it

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
extra extra wait what was that maybe it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.639 
extra extra wait what was that maybe it
was<00:02:03.860> because<00:02:03.979> I<00:02:04.189> did<00:02:04.430> not<00:02:04.460> have<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.850> extra<00:02:05.750> layer

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
was because I did not have a extra layer

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.819
