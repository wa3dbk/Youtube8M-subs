00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.610 

and<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:40.880> suspect<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.510> cast<00:02:41.750> iron<00:02:41.960> skillet<00:02:42.500> is

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
and I suspect the cast iron skillet is

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.500 
and I suspect the cast iron skillet is
probably<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.100> best<00:02:43.250> school<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.760> can<00:02:43.910> use<00:02:44.240> on

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
probably the best school you can use on

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.920 
probably the best school you can use on
a<00:02:44.540> rocket<00:02:44.959> stove

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.709 

because<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:50.980> who<00:02:51.430> have<00:02:51.670> watched<00:02:51.939> a<00:02:52.239> lot<00:02:52.269> of<00:02:52.450> my

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:52.719

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.539 
because you who have watched a lot of my
videos<00:02:53.079> no<00:02:53.409> I<00:02:53.439> don't<00:02:53.799> use<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> cast-iron

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:55.860 
videos no I don't use a cast-iron
skillet<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.120> might<00:02:55.269> have<00:02:55.390> flipped<00:02:55.599> with<00:02:55.719> it

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
skillet I might have flipped with it

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.500 
skillet I might have flipped with it
once<00:02:56.079> or<00:02:56.230> twice<00:02:56.409> in<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:56.890> year<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.209> is<00:02:58.239> going
