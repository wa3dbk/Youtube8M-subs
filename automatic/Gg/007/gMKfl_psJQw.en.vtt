a lot of people were guessing it was a

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.399 
a lot of people were guessing it was a

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
of a desk it was probably more a

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.260 
of a desk it was probably more a
prototype<00:01:19.470> or<00:01:19.970> something<00:01:20.970> else<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.240> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
prototype or something else like that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.300

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
thought bitterly might be a prototype so

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.730 
thought bitterly might be a prototype so
it<00:02:06.600> might<00:02:06.719> be<00:02:06.750> smaller<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.290> don't<00:02:07.530> know<00:02:07.619> why
