going to feed air to all of the tanks

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.810 
going to feed air to all of the tanks
and<00:00:50.969> tubs<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.860> you<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.039> see<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.430> piece

and tubs in here you can see this piece

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.260 
and tubs in here you can see this piece
of<00:00:54.090> PVC<00:00:54.539> over<00:00:55.110> here<00:00:55.530> that's<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> start<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
of PVC over here that's the start of it

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.240 
of PVC over here that's the start of it
and<00:00:58.670> if<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.000> sneak<00:01:00.690> around<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.559> peek<00:01:02.010> up

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
and if you sneak around and peek up

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.679 
and if you sneak around and peek up
there<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.910> corner<00:01:05.060> there's<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> air<00:01:06.420> pump

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
there in the corner there's the air pump

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.420 
there in the corner there's the air pump
there<00:01:07.290> we<00:01:07.409> go<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> went<00:01:07.860> around<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> other

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
there we go I went around to the other

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.039 
there we go I went around to the other
side<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.850> furnace<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.689> see<00:01:09.960> it

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
side of the furnace and you can see it

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.670 
side of the furnace and you can see it
better<00:01:10.260> now<00:01:10.520> it's<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.210> shelf<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.500> put

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
better now it's up on a shelf and I put

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.950 
better now it's up on a shelf and I put
it<00:01:13.770> up<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> shelf<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.450> high

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
it up on the shelf so that it's up high

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.010 
it up on the shelf so that it's up high
and<00:01:16.350> that's<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.509> air<00:01:18.630> pump<00:01:18.840> were

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
and that's because if the air pump were

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.560 
and that's because if the air pump were
to<00:01:19.170> ever<00:01:19.259> stop<00:01:19.650> working<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.430> stop<00:01:21.240> feeding

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
to ever stop working and stop feeding

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.550 
to ever stop working and stop feeding
air<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.500> tubs<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:24.060> could<00:01:24.450> back<00:01:24.780> siphon<00:01:25.350> and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
air to the tubs it could back siphon and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.060 
air to the tubs it could back siphon and
then<00:01:26.600> water<00:01:27.600> would<00:01:27.930> siphon<00:01:28.320> from<00:01:28.560> all<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
then water would siphon from all the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.940 
then water would siphon from all the
aquariums<00:01:29.640> into<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:31.079> tubing<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.770> then

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
aquariums into the tubing and then

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.560 
aquariums into the tubing and then
eventually<00:01:32.189> into<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.729> pump<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.420> would

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
eventually into the pump and it would

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.440 
eventually into the pump and it would
drain<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.049> tanks<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.909> flood<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.119> floor

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
drain all the tanks and flood the floor

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.109 
drain all the tanks and flood the floor
and<00:01:36.840> ruin<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> air<00:01:37.530> pump<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.790> would<00:01:38.939> just

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and ruin the air pump so that would just

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.569 
and ruin the air pump so that would just
be<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> big<00:01:39.479> disaster<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:41.009> way<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.460> you

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
be a big disaster and one way that you

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.940 
be a big disaster and one way that you
can<00:01:41.729> avoid<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.390> by<00:01:42.540> putting<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.590> high

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
can avoid that is by putting it up high

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.380 
can avoid that is by putting it up high
higher<00:01:44.729> than<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.829> highest<00:01:46.829> aquarium<00:01:47.790> gem<00:01:48.119> Coe

is<00:01:48.780> where<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.020> got<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.350> from<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.829> they<00:01:49.979> supplied

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
is where I got it from and they supplied

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.609 
is where I got it from and they supplied
that<00:01:50.939> piece<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.390> flexible<00:01:51.899> tubing<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.530> then

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
that piece of flexible tubing and then

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.920 
that piece of flexible tubing and then
the<00:01:52.770> adapter<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.220> connect<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.060> PVC<00:01:54.600> and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
the adapter to connect it to the PVC and

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.380 
the adapter to connect it to the PVC and
they<00:01:55.380> even<00:01:55.649> asked<00:01:55.860> me<00:01:55.979> what<00:01:56.159> size<00:01:56.369> PVC<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.210> I

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
they even asked me what size PVC that I

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.959 
they even asked me what size PVC that I
was<00:01:57.540> planning<00:01:57.869> I'm<00:01:57.960> using<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:59.159> they<00:01:59.340> could<00:01:59.549> you

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
was planning I'm using so they could you

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.459 
was planning I'm using so they could you
meet<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.240> right<00:02:00.360> connector<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.140> see

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
meet the right connector you can see

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.770 
meet the right connector you can see
that<00:02:01.740> flexible<00:02:02.670> piece<00:02:02.939> comes<00:02:03.299> down<00:02:03.479> from<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
that flexible piece comes down from the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.139 
that flexible piece comes down from the
air<00:02:03.869> pump<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.259> then<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.280> splits<00:02:05.610> off<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.969> two

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
air pump and then it splits off in two

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.499 
air pump and then it splits off in two
directions<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.049> first<00:02:07.770> direction<00:02:08.039> goes<00:02:08.520> that

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
directions the first direction goes that

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.050 
directions the first direction goes that
way<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.050> goes<00:02:10.170> around<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.590> pillar

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
way and it goes around that pillar

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.120 
way and it goes around that pillar
it's<00:02:12.239> going<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.720> feed<00:02:13.110> air<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.890> brine

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
it's going to feed air to the brine

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.280 
it's going to feed air to the brine
shrimp<00:02:14.160> hatchery<00:02:15.230> station<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:17.209> possibly<00:02:18.290> 40

gallon<00:02:19.650> tank<00:02:19.890> that's<00:02:20.040> going<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.250> be<00:02:20.370> under<00:02:20.640> it

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
gallon tank that's going to be under it

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.720 
gallon tank that's going to be under it
and<00:02:22.050> then<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.500> other<00:02:22.620> one<00:02:22.950> goes<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.430> way<00:02:23.700> and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
and then the other one goes this way and

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.070 
and then the other one goes this way and
it<00:02:24.150> goes<00:02:24.300> up<00:02:24.480> high<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:26.450> then<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.569> goes<00:02:27.780> all

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
it goes up high and then it goes all

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.220 
it goes up high and then it goes all
along<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:29.810> entire<00:02:30.810> length<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.470> wall<00:02:31.980> and

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
along this entire length of wall and

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.470 
along this entire length of wall and
then<00:02:34.230> there<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.099> an<00:02:35.340> elbow<00:02:35.670> there<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.330> goes

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
then there is an elbow there and it goes

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.509 
then there is an elbow there and it goes
along<00:02:36.780> this<00:02:37.170> length<00:02:37.470> also<00:02:37.769> when<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.190> ends

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
along this length also when it ends

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.430 
along this length also when it ends
right<00:02:38.670> there<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.269> on<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.569> end<00:02:39.750> over<00:02:40.110> here<00:02:40.140> I

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
right there and on the end over here I

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.000 
right there and on the end over here I
have<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:41.250> valve<00:02:42.180> with<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.599> coiled<00:02:43.110> up<00:02:43.290> piece<00:02:43.830> of

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
have a valve with a coiled up piece of

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.120 
have a valve with a coiled up piece of
airline<00:02:44.160> tubing<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.739> bleed<00:02:46.950> off

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
airline tubing and this is the bleed off

since<00:02:48.030> I'm<00:02:48.600> probably<00:02:49.019> not<00:02:49.260> going<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.470> be

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
since I'm probably not going to be

running<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.010> air<00:02:50.130> pump<00:02:50.400> at<00:02:50.700> full<00:02:51.239> capacity

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
running the air pump at full capacity

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.640 
running the air pump at full capacity
which<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.610> think<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.970> minimum<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.630> 15<00:02:55.230> outlets

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
which is I think a minimum of 15 outlets

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.070 
which is I think a minimum of 15 outlets
it's<00:02:55.830> gonna<00:02:55.950> be<00:02:56.130> close<00:02:56.580> with<00:02:57.030> everything<00:02:57.599> set

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
it's gonna be close with everything set

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.740 
it's gonna be close with everything set
up<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.319> running<00:02:58.709> but<00:02:58.920> not<00:02:59.099> quite<00:02:59.400> 15<00:02:59.880> so<00:03:00.720> I

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
up and running but not quite 15 so I

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.410 
up and running but not quite 15 so I
have<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.959> bleed<00:03:01.230> off<00:03:01.380> valve<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.420> alleviate

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
have a bleed off valve just to alleviate

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.559 
have a bleed off valve just to alleviate
some<00:03:03.930> pressure<00:03:04.200> on<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:05.099> air<00:03:05.220> pump<00:03:05.489> what<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.120> did

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
some pressure on the air pump what I did

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.530 
some pressure on the air pump what I did
is<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:07.260> coiled<00:03:07.799> up<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.160> attached<00:03:08.940> some<00:03:09.209> airline

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
is I coiled up I attached some airline

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.309 
is I coiled up I attached some airline
tubing<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.230> coiled<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.099> up<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.870> I'm<00:03:12.870> told

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
tubing and coiled it up and I'm told

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.559 
tubing and coiled it up and I'm told
that<00:03:13.500> helps<00:03:13.980> reduce<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.700> noise<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.450> the

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
gonna be on the floor on the bottom

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.610 
gonna be on the floor on the bottom
there's<00:03:54.030> also<00:03:54.239> another<00:03:54.600> one<00:03:54.780> over<00:03:55.019> here<00:03:55.049> where

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
there's also another one over here where

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.610 
there's also another one over here where
the<00:03:55.829> brine<00:03:56.100> shrimp<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.549> tree<00:03:56.819> is<00:03:56.940> gonna<00:03:57.150> be<00:03:57.620> I

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
the brine shrimp a tree is gonna be I

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.370 
the brine shrimp a tree is gonna be I
put<00:03:59.100> one<00:03:59.250> here<00:03:59.549> because<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.299> was<00:04:00.600> going<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:01.139> just

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
put one here because I was going to just

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.699 
put one here because I was going to just
start<00:04:02.540> possibly<00:04:03.540> using<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:03.959> for<00:04:04.200> this<00:04:04.350> forty

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
start possibly using it for this forty

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.860 
start possibly using it for this forty
gallon<00:04:04.980> tank<00:04:05.220> that's<00:04:05.519> right<00:04:05.700> here<00:04:07.730> but<00:04:08.870> it

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
gallon tank that's right here but it

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.440 
gallon tank that's right here but it
doesn't<00:04:10.049> work<00:04:10.680> very<00:04:10.709> well<00:04:11.100> if<00:04:11.609> you<00:04:11.940> only<00:04:12.120> have

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
doesn't work very well if you only have

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.190 
doesn't work very well if you only have
one<00:04:13.410> outlet<00:04:14.100> plugged<00:04:14.549> into<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:15.239> it's<00:04:15.690> just<00:04:15.930> too

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
one outlet plugged into it it's just too

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.719 
one outlet plugged into it it's just too
much<00:04:16.350> pressure<00:04:16.650> on<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.979> pump<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:17.459> I'm<00:04:17.609> not

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
much pressure on the pump so I'm not

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.830 
much pressure on the pump so I'm not
using<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.269> until<00:04:19.109> I<00:04:19.139> have<00:04:19.470> everything<00:04:20.190> set<00:04:20.580> up

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
using it until I have everything set up

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.260 
using it until I have everything set up
and<00:04:20.930> in<00:04:21.230> place<00:04:21.560> I'm<00:04:22.430> really<00:04:22.730> excited<00:04:23.030> about

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
and in place I'm really excited about

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.690 
and in place I'm really excited about
this<00:04:23.660> setup<00:04:23.990> because<00:04:24.350> I<00:04:24.620> think<00:04:25.010> it's<00:04:25.310> gonna<00:04:25.460> be

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
this setup because I think it's gonna be

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.940 
this setup because I think it's gonna be
way<00:04:26.000> more<00:04:26.270> energy<00:04:26.810> efficient<00:04:27.410> plus<00:04:27.770> it's

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
way more energy efficient plus it's

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.650 
way more energy efficient plus it's
gonna<00:04:28.070> be<00:04:28.250> easier<00:04:28.700> instead<00:04:29.180> of<00:04:29.300> messing<00:04:29.480> with

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
gonna be easier instead of messing with

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.470 
gonna be easier instead of messing with
all<00:04:29.960> these<00:04:30.639> separate<00:04:31.639> air<00:04:31.790> pumps<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.300> don't

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
all these separate air pumps I don't

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.370 
all these separate air pumps I don't
know<00:04:32.570> about<00:04:32.690> you<00:04:32.840> guys<00:04:32.960> but<00:04:33.139> I<00:04:33.200> have<00:04:33.260> a

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
know about you guys but I have a

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.680 
know about you guys but I have a
collection<00:04:33.710> of<00:04:34.010> small<00:04:34.550> air<00:04:34.940> pumps<00:04:35.389> that<00:04:35.570> I

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
collection of small air pumps that I

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.629 
collection of small air pumps that I
have<00:04:35.810> collected<00:04:36.380> throughout<00:04:36.919> the<00:04:37.040> years<00:04:37.310> and

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
have collected throughout the years and

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.820 
have collected throughout the years and
some<00:04:38.330> of<00:04:38.360> them<00:04:38.540> are<00:04:38.690> really<00:04:38.990> rattling<00:04:39.680> and

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
some of them are really rattling and

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.740 
some of them are really rattling and
noisy<00:04:40.280> and<00:04:40.520> others<00:04:40.790> are<00:04:41.030> really<00:04:41.300> weak<00:04:41.510> and

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
noisy and others are really weak and

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.050 
noisy and others are really weak and
don't<00:04:41.930> work<00:04:42.110> very<00:04:42.139> well<00:04:42.470> so<00:04:42.980> when<00:04:43.790> I'm<00:04:43.910> looking

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
don't work very well so when I'm looking

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.120 
don't work very well so when I'm looking
for<00:04:44.419> an<00:04:44.480> air<00:04:44.600> pump<00:04:44.810> for<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.350> tank<00:04:45.620> that<00:04:45.740> I've<00:04:45.889> set

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
for an air pump for a tank that I've set

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.460 
for an air pump for a tank that I've set
up<00:04:46.160> I<00:04:46.550> have<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:47.600> kind<00:04:47.810> of<00:04:47.870> dig<00:04:48.050> through<00:04:48.290> the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
up I have to kind of dig through the

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.280 
up I have to kind of dig through the
pile<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:49.130> try<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:49.760> find<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:50.300> least<00:04:50.510> crappy

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
pile and try to find the least crappy

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.670 
pile and try to find the least crappy
one<00:04:51.500> so<00:04:52.100> I<00:04:52.550> am<00:04:53.300> NOT<00:04:53.540> gonna<00:04:53.630> miss<00:04:53.930> doing<00:04:54.229> that<00:04:54.380> at

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
one so I am NOT gonna miss doing that at

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.080 
one so I am NOT gonna miss doing that at
all<00:04:54.800> it's<00:04:55.070> gonna<00:04:55.190> be<00:04:55.370> really<00:04:55.490> nice<00:04:55.669> having

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
all it's gonna be really nice having

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.790 
all it's gonna be really nice having
this<00:04:56.210> big<00:04:56.419> one<00:04:56.630> set<00:04:56.840> up<00:04:56.960> and<00:04:57.139> just<00:04:57.350> not<00:04:57.530> having

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
this big one set up and just not having

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.190 
this big one set up and just not having
to<00:04:58.160> worry<00:04:58.520> about<00:04:58.610> it<00:04:58.940> I<00:04:59.120> plugged<00:04:59.570> it<00:04:59.720> in<00:04:59.870> so<00:05:00.169> you

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
to worry about it I plugged it in so you

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.140 
to worry about it I plugged it in so you
can<00:05:00.500> see<00:05:00.979> what<00:05:01.190> it<00:05:01.310> sounds<00:05:01.760> like<00:05:01.790> up<00:05:02.120> close

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
can see what it sounds like up close

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.879 
can see what it sounds like up close
when<00:05:02.960> it's<00:05:03.080> running<00:05:03.560> you<00:05:05.380> can<00:05:06.380> probably<00:05:06.650> also

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
when it's running you can probably also

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.909 
when it's running you can probably also
hear<00:05:07.220> the<00:05:07.340> background<00:05:07.729> noise<00:05:07.910> of<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.210> furnace

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
hear the background noise of the furnace

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.570 
hear the background noise of the furnace
so<00:05:09.919> try<00:05:10.130> to<00:05:10.190> ignore<00:05:10.490> that<00:05:10.700> but<00:05:11.200> as<00:05:12.220> you<00:05:13.220> can<00:05:13.370> see

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
so try to ignore that but as you can see

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.840 
so try to ignore that but as you can see
it's<00:05:13.880> virtually<00:05:14.630> silent<00:05:15.290> and<00:05:16.250> then<00:05:16.550> all<00:05:16.700> these

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
it's virtually silent and then all these

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.760 
it's virtually silent and then all these
air<00:05:17.150> outlets<00:05:17.570> are<00:05:17.750> making<00:05:18.139> noise<00:05:18.320> right<00:05:18.620> now<00:05:18.650> I

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
air outlets are making noise right now I

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.260 
air outlets are making noise right now I
can<00:05:18.979> hear<00:05:19.130> a<00:05:19.160> lot<00:05:19.370> of<00:05:19.490> whooshing<00:05:19.639> noise<00:05:19.970> from

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
can hear a lot of whooshing noise from

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.090 
can hear a lot of whooshing noise from
each<00:05:20.570> one<00:05:20.780> of<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.100> lever<00:05:22.100> outlets<00:05:22.700> and<00:05:24.100> that's

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
each one of the lever outlets and that's

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.529 
each one of the lever outlets and that's
because<00:05:25.430> they're<00:05:25.610> all<00:05:25.760> turned<00:05:26.060> on<00:05:26.270> right<00:05:26.479> now

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
because they're all turned on right now

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.930 
because they're all turned on right now
and<00:05:26.930> they're<00:05:27.320> not<00:05:27.400> actually<00:05:28.400> plugged<00:05:28.640> in<00:05:28.789> and

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
and they're not actually plugged in and

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.240 
and they're not actually plugged in and
so<00:05:29.090> air<00:05:29.750> is<00:05:30.110> just<00:05:30.289> as<00:05:30.500> beeping<00:05:30.860> out<00:05:31.010> of<00:05:31.160> those

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
so air is just as beeping out of those

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.700 
so air is just as beeping out of those
but<00:05:31.760> once<00:05:32.000> they're<00:05:32.240> plugged<00:05:33.020> into<00:05:33.229> airline

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
but once they're plugged into airline

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.430 
but once they're plugged into airline
tubing<00:05:33.979> and<00:05:34.580> set<00:05:35.510> up<00:05:35.630> in<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.870> tanks<00:05:36.200> you<00:05:36.229> won't

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
tubing and set up in the tanks you won't

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.200 
tubing and set up in the tanks you won't
hear<00:05:36.620> that<00:05:36.680> whooshing<00:05:37.010> noise<00:05:37.340> anymore<00:05:37.640> all

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
hear that whooshing noise anymore all

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.640 
hear that whooshing noise anymore all
right<00:05:38.270> guys<00:05:38.539> thank<00:05:38.870> you<00:05:38.960> so<00:05:39.020> much<00:05:39.289> for<00:05:39.500> tuning
