00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.520
 What do you mean, beauty then in the video today? 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.680
 I will do for you to run riot 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.920
 stf bones 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.710
 The model I have is the 54mm 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.070
 83-b 83-c b for those who do not know it's equivalent 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.210
 to 53 who knows what 103-a is 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.310
 wheel hardness 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.920
 if you want to know more about it 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.080
 hardness size and on wheels 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.189
 I joined the channel that I have a video 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.759
 explaining wheel choose for you 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.690
 well hot then stf for those who do not know 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.780
 means that it is in shape and is 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.160
 mode is within this 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.460
 stf model has in five models but I 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.730
 talk about 4 because the fifth is the most 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.910
 recent and here that has no place 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.850
 I'll show you here. 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.640
 and if these are the models that have to do 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.250
 one from 2003 and see four have to see five 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.250
 but here they never talk about 25 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.220
 mine is the sale that differentiates one 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.290
 of the other is the contact area of â€‹â€‹the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.150
 with soil and width and here maybe 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.939
 talking to whoever else this route is 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.920
 used in step sizes 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.049
 so at the time I bought this wheel 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.380
 not knowing the difference so I caught the 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.380
 any one 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.390
 the main difference from her to another 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.610
 basically basically see one is to see 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.369
 three only that there was one is wider and 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.100
 her contact with the ground also to see 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.990
 two is to see four more closely with 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.180
 contact area with sole 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.140
 little bit wider than you can see 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.240
 here and 492 wider competes with 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.049
 table with the larger soil is basically 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.140
 that 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.810
 the most common is to see three wheels 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.920
 that you are used by professionals 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.159
 So it's easier, it's easier to 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.159
 meet 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.390
 now let's talk about the wheel this is that 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.270
 wheel meet her as if very 4 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.900
 millimeters south 83 b which equals 5 and 3 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.440
 to 1 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.740
 now it's been eight months since I've been 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.420
 using the opel wheel she has 51 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.459
 mm 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.830
 You can not see that it's too much expense. 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.650
 cool 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.990
 it is also not as not square 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.780
 is in the square shape it gets 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.020
 of cone but that all the wheels solved 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.450
 inverted the wheel side is 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.550
 that hole where he places the bearing it 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.370
 between very easy goes easy neither those 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.510
 works that you have to climb on top of it 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.880
 practically to enter if 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.070
 can not do it or do it alone 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.690
 press as such to take 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:05.440
 it is also a light wheel despite it 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.209
 feels or is 103 to 83 b 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:13.900
 She is very soft so when you go 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:16.840
 give it should be because of this area of 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.019
 contact with the soil wants greater 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.360
 her drawing comes out very easy but 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.989
 this is no problem 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.250
 all the works will leave it does not arise 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.560
 that easy 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.200
 are here and to clean 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.140
 do not have too much difficulty 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.670
 this is basically a wheel to wheel is 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.190
 that review 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:44.040
 if you are interested I will 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:46.299
 let the site buy things like this 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.140
 even was there that this wheel view 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.570
 even then you just need the 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.410
 google safe house purple and just remember 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.299
 this link in the latent description everything has 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.380
 everything related to the left 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.790
 so I would like to review what you 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.650
 write channel 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.930
 We're favorites Share the video with 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.960
 Your friends then came that way. 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:18.320
 any doubt can comment 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.320
 and he said and until the next video
