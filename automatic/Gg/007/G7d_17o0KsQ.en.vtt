early<00:01:06.420> adopter<00:01:07.170> there<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.220> few<00:01:08.430> problems

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
early adopter there are a few problems

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.000 
early adopter there are a few problems
though<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.600> specifically<00:01:10.229> Apple<00:01:10.560> problem<00:01:10.890> is

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
though the specifically Apple problem is

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.710 
though the specifically Apple problem is
that<00:01:11.159> with<00:01:11.280> only<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:11.850> port<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.420> need<00:01:12.600> to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that with only one port you need to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.570 
that with only one port you need to
choose<00:01:12.990> between<00:01:13.229> powering<00:01:13.950> your<00:01:13.979> computer

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
choose between powering your computer

and<00:01:14.729> connecting<00:01:15.360> things<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.049> Apple

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
and connecting things to it Apple

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.490 
and connecting things to it Apple
solution<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> $79<00:01:18.330> dongle<00:01:19.020> which<00:01:19.170> gives<00:01:19.380> you

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
solution is a $79 dongle which gives you

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.920 
solution is a $79 dongle which gives you
charging<00:01:20.040> connectivity<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.909> either<00:01:21.240> VGA<00:01:21.810> or

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
charging connectivity and either VGA or

charging connectivity and either VGA or
HDMI<00:01:22.080> video<00:01:22.890> out<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.060> dongle<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
HDMI video out but it's a dongle the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.990 
HDMI video out but it's a dongle the
other<00:01:25.530> problem<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.100> we're<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.549> very

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
other problem is that we're just very

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.120 
other problem is that we're just very
early<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> transition<00:01:28.439> from<00:01:28.619> all<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.040> our
