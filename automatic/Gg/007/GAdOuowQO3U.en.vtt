good<00:01:02.079> conclusion<00:01:02.649> and<00:01:02.800> I<00:01:02.950> loved<00:01:03.250> it<00:01:03.370> was<00:01:03.520> a

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
good conclusion and I loved it was a

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.490 
good conclusion and I loved it was a
very<00:01:03.850> heart<00:01:04.239> touching<00:01:04.660> episode<00:01:05.170> and

very heart touching episode and

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.050 
very heart touching episode and
technically<00:01:05.890> this<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:06.280> not<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.640> final

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
technically this is not the final

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.190 
technically this is not the final
episode<00:01:07.479> of<00:01:07.660> the<00:01:07.810> series

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
episode of the series

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.260 
episode of the series
next<00:01:08.860> week<00:01:09.009> I'm<00:01:09.160> guessing<00:01:09.550> is<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.700> final

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
next week I'm guessing is the final

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.600 
next week I'm guessing is the final
episode<00:01:10.390> but<00:01:11.200> either<00:01:11.440> way<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:11.740> guess<00:01:12.250> you<00:01:12.399> could

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
episode but either way I guess you could

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.639 
episode but either way I guess you could
kind<00:01:12.880> of<00:01:12.940> consider<00:01:13.300> this<00:01:13.539> the<00:01:13.720> final<00:01:14.140> episode

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
kind of consider this the final episode

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.270 
kind of consider this the final episode
of<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.310> series<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:16.050> for<00:01:17.050> the<00:01:17.080> most<00:01:17.259> part<00:01:17.440> that

watching<00:01:24.670> this<00:01:24.789> series<00:01:25.030> and<00:01:25.360> for<00:01:26.289> the<00:01:26.350> most

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
watching this series and for the most

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.109 
watching this series and for the most

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
part it really keeps a nice good

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.270

atmosphere<00:01:28.570> about<00:01:29.380> it<00:01:29.619> like<00:01:29.740> this<00:01:29.950> episode

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
atmosphere about it like this episode

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.550 
atmosphere about it like this episode
what<00:01:30.880> really<00:01:31.060> makes<00:01:31.360> it<00:01:31.509> enjoyable<00:01:31.720> I<00:01:32.289> think

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
what really makes it enjoyable I think

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.280 
what really makes it enjoyable I think
is<00:01:32.710> because<00:01:33.580> of<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.270> way<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.630> animation

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
is because of the way the animation

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.539 
is because of the way the animation
budget<00:01:35.619> was<00:01:35.740> used<00:01:35.979> in<00:01:36.130> certain<00:01:36.400> scenes

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
budget was used in certain scenes

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.370 
budget was used in certain scenes
specifically<00:01:37.270> with<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.540> Latifah<00:01:37.990> scene<00:01:38.200> when

getting<00:01:58.540> very<00:01:58.659> sad<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.619> overall<00:01:59.979> moment<00:02:00.460> of

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
getting very sad the overall moment of

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.160 
getting very sad the overall moment of
that<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.790> way<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.030> atmosphere<00:02:01.210> was<00:02:01.750> built<00:02:01.960> up

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
that the way the atmosphere was built up

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.870 
that the way the atmosphere was built up
I<00:02:02.350> felt<00:02:02.680> like<00:02:02.860> kill<00:02:03.100> Annie<00:02:03.280> did<00:02:03.549> a<00:02:03.579> damn<00:02:03.850> good

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
I felt like kill Annie did a damn good

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.969 
I felt like kill Annie did a damn good
job<00:02:04.090> even<00:02:04.659> though<00:02:04.810> I<00:02:04.840> like<00:02:05.229> I<00:02:05.350> said<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:05.590> knew

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
job even though I like I said I knew

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.980 
job even though I like I said I knew
probably<00:02:06.340> something<00:02:06.820> would<00:02:06.909> work<00:02:07.119> out<00:02:07.360> the

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
probably something would work out the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.539 
probably something would work out the
way<00:02:08.140> it<00:02:08.259> was<00:02:08.380> dying<00:02:08.649> which<00:02:08.920> is<00:02:09.130> pretty<00:02:09.310> damn

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
of different reasons besides just the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.840
