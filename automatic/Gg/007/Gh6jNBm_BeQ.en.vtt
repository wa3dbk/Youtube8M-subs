00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.360
 yes i think it was very quiet 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.549
 in the everyone and 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.679
 i think everyone can see each other who can see me and hence it 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.989
 just a drama as in that just after the shame is about it 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.259
 excesses freeze 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.949
 how difficult is the game with when your limp starts what to convert during the 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.300
 contest 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.380
 yes difficult difficult I think playing football maybe difficult but we do 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.669
 very much that concerns the two previous ones 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.189
 lucio easy to give away actually 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.880
 the latter very happy that I have actually seen everyone on to say so 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.180
 as if dwindled bite 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.140
 we have done it all together and we have to do the ordinary together 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.780
 someone thought coffee but it's hard though 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.070
 he should actually be there 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.680
 that is a matter of the carine institution 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.109
 well i guess i'm out with you having such contests 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.250
 added and contain serious 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.560
 we have been warned before the game by the trainer and 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.030
 by everyone actually and we all knew a little later that it was the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.680
 wrong one 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.080
 the time that excelsior would blow on top and still have it 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.860
 just can't win and we didn't do it is just a shame 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.120
 last week the first half was also an oss laptop that seems anp something of a 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.080
 to become a pattern 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.190
 waterland from almere 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.640
 Finally, last week was already having a first recovery 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.090
 Furthermore, you can see that we are actually happy with it 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.020
 the animals and 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.990
 why not just throw it up or make another goal 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.490
 and we didn't 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.650
 There is a needless talk session early in the season 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.650
 after the incident, everyone just looks in the mirror themselves and 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.950
 yes what he did well and what he did wrong 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.560
 The most important thing is that some things can start calling out now, but you have to put it in 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.230
 go wrong stand right and if you get against the chance 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.300
 a 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.300
 if you do not play well that you two appear as a normal one 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.790
 then you still have to win and if you still have years when there is still giveaway then there 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.810
 is just very bad 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.320
 I also asked where your teammate Karim El Ahmadi is in position 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.229
 that also easily noticed from the sides 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.340
 partly because of that 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.340
 he could not yet say that someone is going to win a duel more 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.999
 it is it is 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:15.209
 something you should radiate and we didn't do that 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.239
 He also looked I can guarantee that everyone who was standing on the field today 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.129
 we wanted to win only yes well that didn't burn out those of those on us 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.859
 the audience and the perpetrator were also helped to lay down in the competition and 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.419
 there I have to be there what I am there we have to prevent ourselves with two you just have to 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:32.609
 win the challenge tour she could still get it yes it is possible 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.049
 not it is just very bad 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.200
 and there is in the russian incident with tim the cler 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.200
 mario been leg is furious about the plans of it 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:44.639
 according to the minister, for the rest of the two weeks ruling is in discussion with 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.799
 was not served by criticism and of which we now train 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.179
 also only what we know is given but 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:55.299
 that so many have achieved about ultimately becoming alive than must 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.179
 you go play the cup against gent that will now say they will soon play 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.539
 way to beat the disappointment of the rinsing foot so far 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:04.229
 or nothing interests 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:07.269
 this doesn't feel that way and i find that easy to enter this competition 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.869
 Use one to then again 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:13.779
 going full on Thursday that just can't happen and that's what it is 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:15.099
 around the dressing room 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.159
 And that will probably go well again in the choice of years 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.119
 yeah maybe a good idea states thursday to put that down 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:26.929
 that we the contractors of this competition yes well they did not put in I think we 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:29.249
 is unacceptable if you 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.729
 if you say you need freeze to motivate more for another 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.509
 match and show malicious jacobs 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:38.689
 good that life but not at all and from today just lost to deserved 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:40.439
 just played very weakly 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.099
 nl are now moving on to the next match and 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.769
 of course it will go differently you will understand the anger of your audience 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.859
 wanted to get a story from July and later from a number of people from the management 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.979
 it is kucka's profit with 15 percent decrease years well 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:56.869
 that was clear 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:04:01.269
 that to the remains were angry and good to keep up I think I saw the shower 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.619
 group to fall you will thank the role 

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:08.259
 in good and bad times then you just have to do that and then it will be 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:09.649
 shame on the jaws 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.459
 and I thought they would be angry then understand that
