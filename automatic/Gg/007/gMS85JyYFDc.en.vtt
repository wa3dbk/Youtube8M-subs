00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
of well one of the videos that I started

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.050 
of well one of the videos that I started
out<00:00:23.939> using<00:00:25.099> went<00:00:26.099> through<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> whole<00:00:26.609> bunch<00:00:26.849> of

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
out using went through a whole bunch of

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.139 
out using went through a whole bunch of
process<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.210> disassembling<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.019> trucks<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
process of disassembling the trucks and

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.959 
process of disassembling the trucks and
you<00:00:33.170> know<00:00:34.170> soldering<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.950> some<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.760> truck

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
you know soldering to some of the truck

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.860 
you know soldering to some of the truck
linings<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.950> on<00:00:37.950> these<00:00:38.100> newer<00:00:38.399> ones<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:39.450> just

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
linings and on these newer ones it just

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.459 
linings and on these newer ones it just
it's<00:00:40.370> it's<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.520> lot<00:00:41.760> more<00:00:42.420> difficult<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.200> I'm

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
it's it's a lot more difficult so I'm

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.510 
it's it's a lot more difficult so I'm
just<00:00:43.559> going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.739> walk<00:00:43.950> through<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:45.120> easy<00:00:45.450> way

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
just going to walk through the easy way

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.900 
just going to walk through the easy way
to<00:00:47.520> kind<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.120> do<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:50.460> I'm<00:00:50.579> not<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
to kind of do this and I'm not going to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.459 
to kind of do this and I'm not going to
do<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.090> step<00:00:51.300> by<00:00:51.329> step<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.899> will<00:00:52.079> point<00:00:52.320> out

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
do it step by step but I will point out

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.180 
do it step by step but I will point out
the<00:00:53.190> finer<00:00:53.460> details<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:54.149> what<00:00:54.600> happens

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.049

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
obviously you do need to remove the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.219 
obviously you do need to remove the
motor<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:01.789> after<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.879> remove<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.300> motor

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.500 

you're<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> want<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.590> remove<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.979> clips

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.730 
you're going to want to remove the clips
we're<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.689> want<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> solder<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> orange

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
we're going to want to solder the orange

we're going to want to solder the orange
wire<00:01:12.409> short<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.189> clip<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.610> make

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
wire short here to this clip and make

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.980 
wire short here to this clip and make
sure<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.939> take<00:01:15.060> them<00:01:15.240> off<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.659> do<00:01:15.810> that

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.679 
and soldered on the clips and watch out
when<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.460> take<00:02:02.610> these<00:02:02.729> clips<00:02:03.180> out<00:02:03.360> there's<00:02:03.630> a

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
when you take these clips out there's a

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.360 
when you take these clips out there's a
little<00:02:03.840> fine<00:02:04.229> spring<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.009> pop

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
little fine spring and we pop

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.240 
little fine spring and we pop
off<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.730> will<00:02:05.910> pop<00:02:06.240> up<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.570> it's<00:02:06.950> damn<00:02:07.950> near

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
off it will pop up and it's damn near

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.820 
off it will pop up and it's damn near
impossible<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.820> find<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.590> just<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.680> careful

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
impossible to find so just be careful

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.160 
impossible to find so just be careful
that<00:02:11.190> when<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.400> pop<00:02:11.580> those<00:02:11.760> off<00:02:12.020> next<00:02:13.020> thing

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
that when you pop those off next thing

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.260 
that when you pop those off next thing
you<00:02:13.260> do<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:13.440> going<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.740> take<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.490> red<00:02:14.670> wire<00:02:14.940> and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
you do is going to take the red wire and

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.180 
you do is going to take the red wire and
combine<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.570> with<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:16.110> secondary<00:02:16.590> red<00:02:16.860> wire<00:02:17.450> and

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
combine it with a secondary red wire and

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.720 
combine it with a secondary red wire and
solder<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.780> front<00:02:22.020> truck<00:02:22.550> metal<00:02:23.550> tab

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
solder that to the front truck metal tab

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.300 
solder that to the front truck metal tab
one<00:02:24.420> thing<00:02:24.570> about<00:02:24.630> all<00:02:24.930> these<00:02:25.110> tabs<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:26.190> you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
one thing about all these tabs is you

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.710 
one thing about all these tabs is you
going<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.550> take<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> little<00:02:26.910> flat<00:02:27.240> screwdriver

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
going to take a little flat screwdriver

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.390 
going to take a little flat screwdriver
and<00:02:28.290> scrape<00:02:28.800> them<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:31.410> rough<00:02:31.680> up<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.890> service

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
and scrape them to rough up that service

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.890 
and scrape them to rough up that service
to<00:02:32.520> make<00:02:32.610> sure<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.790> get<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.940> good<00:02:32.970> soldiering

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
to make sure you get a good soldiering

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.770 
to make sure you get a good soldiering
contact<00:02:34.320> because<00:02:34.790> these<00:02:35.790> powder<00:02:36.390> coated

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
contact because these powder coated

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.940 
contact because these powder coated
parts<00:02:37.140> or<00:02:37.640> anodized<00:02:38.640> parts<00:02:39.120> have<00:02:39.870> an<00:02:40.230> oil<00:02:40.740> to

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
parts or anodized parts have an oil to

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.290 
parts or anodized parts have an oil to
them<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.160> does<00:02:41.310> not<00:02:41.460> allow<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.790> soul<00:02:42.090> trying

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
them that does not allow the soul trying

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.690 
them that does not allow the soul trying
to<00:02:42.420> stick<00:02:42.840> very<00:02:43.080> well<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.890> just<00:02:44.100> scrape<00:02:44.460> it<00:02:44.610> up

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
to stick very well so just scrape it up

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.360 
to stick very well so just scrape it up
rough<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.270> up<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.630> then<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.740> can<00:02:46.890> solder<00:02:47.070> both

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
rough it up and then you can solder both

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.720 
rough it up and then you can solder both
what's<00:02:48.210> nice<00:02:48.420> about<00:02:48.710> these<00:02:51.560> decoders<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:53.220> they

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
what's nice about these decoders is they

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.820 
what's nice about these decoders is they
come<00:02:53.940> with<00:02:54.090> enough<00:02:54.330> red<00:02:54.570> wire<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.380> do<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.680> all

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
come with enough red wire to do it all

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.280 
come with enough red wire to do it all
so<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:56.580> just<00:02:56.880> cut<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.420> length<00:02:57.450> here<00:02:58.110> and

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
so you just cut it to length here and

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.160 
so you just cut it to length here and
this<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.730> chip<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.060> going<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.240> sit<00:03:00.540> kind<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:00.990> on

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
this the chip is going to sit kind of on

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.050 
this the chip is going to sit kind of on
the<00:03:01.200> back<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.830> motor<00:03:02.040> here<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.640> you

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
the back of the motor here this you

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.720 
the back of the motor here this you
can't<00:03:03.330> have<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.570> sitting<00:03:04.380> on<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:05.700> the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
can't have it sitting on the the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.020 
can't have it sitting on the the
flywheel<00:03:06.720> obviously<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.340> really<00:03:08.520> the

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
flywheel obviously so this is really the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.479 
flywheel obviously so this is really the
best<00:03:09.959> place<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.320> put<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.680> put<00:03:11.130> make<00:03:11.370> sure

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
best place to put it and put make sure

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.530 
best place to put it and put make sure
you<00:03:11.670> put<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:11.910> Conte<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:14.640> contact<00:03:15.090> tab<00:03:15.330> is

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
you put the Conte the the contact tab is

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.320 
you put the Conte the the contact tab is
pointing<00:03:15.900> up<00:03:16.580> from<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.700> chip<00:03:17.940> even<00:03:18.239> though

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
pointing up from the chip even though

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.729 
pointing up from the chip even though
they<00:03:18.450> are<00:03:18.570> coated<00:03:18.959> they<00:03:19.080> will<00:03:19.230> poke<00:03:19.440> through

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
they are coated they will poke through

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.820 
they are coated they will poke through
and<00:03:20.209> make<00:03:21.209> undesired<00:03:22.050> contact<00:03:22.590> with<00:03:22.709> the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
and make undesired contact with the

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.229 
and make undesired contact with the
metal<00:03:22.980> motor<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.520> shorted<00:03:23.820> out<00:03:23.940> so<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.209> don't

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
metal motor and shorted out so you don't

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.800 
metal motor and shorted out so you don't
want<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:25.190> so<00:03:26.190> cut<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.030> red<00:03:27.209> wire<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.600> link

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
want that so cut that red wire to link

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.890 
want that so cut that red wire to link
and<00:03:28.020> take<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.260> other<00:03:28.290> part<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.780> solder<00:03:30.780> the

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
and take the other part and solder the

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.960 
and take the other part and solder the
two<00:03:31.050> together<00:03:31.350> on<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:31.920> tab<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.400> then<00:03:32.640> the

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
two together on that tab and then the

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.699 
two together on that tab and then the
other<00:03:33.000> end<00:03:33.330> of<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.450> obviously<00:03:33.780> just<00:03:34.560> goes

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
other end of it obviously just goes

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.110 
other end of it obviously just goes
right<00:03:34.950> back<00:03:35.130> around<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.550> this<00:03:35.640> truck<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:35.910> it's

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
right back around to this truck and it's

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.479 
right back around to this truck and it's
a<00:03:36.180> perfect<00:03:36.540> amount<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.780> wire<00:03:36.959> there<00:03:37.400> then<00:03:38.400> you

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
a perfect amount of wire there then you

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.550 
a perfect amount of wire there then you

have<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.570> harness<00:04:07.530> they're<00:04:07.709> available<00:04:07.980> to

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
have the harness they're available to

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.100 
have the harness they're available to
that<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:09.030> can<00:04:09.150> go<00:04:09.269> right<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.630> it<00:04:09.660> so<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:09.900> just

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
that you can go right to it so I just

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.390 
that you can go right to it so I just
curl<00:04:10.290> up<00:04:10.350> it<00:04:10.590> doesn't<00:04:10.680> hurt<00:04:10.920> anything<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:11.280> be

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
curl up it doesn't hurt anything to be

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.250 
curl up it doesn't hurt anything to be
there<00:04:11.580> another<00:04:12.330> thing<00:04:12.510> that<00:04:12.540> I<00:04:12.690> do<00:04:12.810> is<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:12.959> put<00:04:13.080> a

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
there another thing that I do is I put a

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.430 
there another thing that I do is I put a
piece<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.500> electrical<00:04:13.920> tape<00:04:14.070> underneath<00:04:14.660> the

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
piece of electrical tape underneath the

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.320 
piece of electrical tape underneath the
copper<00:04:16.860> contact<00:04:17.340> of<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.489> motor<00:04:17.760> just<00:04:18.209> to

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
copper contact of the motor just to

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.210 
copper contact of the motor just to
protect<00:04:18.660> anything<00:04:19.380> touching<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.830> top<00:04:19.980> of<00:04:20.160> the

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
protect anything touching the top of the

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.550 
protect anything touching the top of the
motor<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.489> shorting<00:04:20.910> out<00:04:21.200> and<00:04:22.200> then<00:04:22.410> what<00:04:22.530> I

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
motor and shorting out and then what I

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.220 
motor and shorting out and then what I
do<00:04:22.650> is<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:23.400> noticed<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.270> when<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.540> that<00:04:24.870> is<00:04:24.960> so

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
do is I noticed that when you that is so

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.260 
do is I noticed that when you that is so
tight<00:04:25.500> up<00:04:25.740> here<00:04:25.830> when<00:04:26.610> you<00:04:26.670> put<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.880> shell<00:04:27.090> on

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
tight up here when you put the shell on

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.720 
tight up here when you put the shell on
it<00:04:27.480> can<00:04:27.870> push<00:04:28.200> this<00:04:28.410> down<00:04:28.650> you<00:04:29.340> can<00:04:29.460> see<00:04:29.490> I<00:04:29.640> have

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
it can push this down you can see I have

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.120 
it can push this down you can see I have
a<00:04:29.880> little<00:04:30.060> runner<00:04:30.330> on<00:04:30.540> my<00:04:30.720> on<00:04:31.620> my<00:04:31.680> flywheel

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
a little runner on my on my flywheel

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.690 
a little runner on my on my flywheel
there<00:04:32.520> from<00:04:32.790> where<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.060> was<00:04:33.090> making<00:04:33.510> contact

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
there from where it was making contact

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.190 
there from where it was making contact
because<00:04:35.700> of<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:36.030> when<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.450> shell<00:04:36.660> gets

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
because of the when the shell gets

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.750 
because of the when the shell gets
compressed<00:04:37.470> on<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.980> it<00:04:38.310> was<00:04:38.460> pushing<00:04:38.610> that

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
compressed on it it was pushing that

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.740 
compressed on it it was pushing that
down<00:04:38.820> so<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.090> just<00:04:39.240> put<00:04:39.300> a<00:04:39.420> little<00:04:39.450> piece<00:04:39.690> of

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
down so I just put a little piece of

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.780 
down so I just put a little piece of
electrical<00:04:40.110> tape<00:04:40.230> to<00:04:40.590> kind<00:04:41.250> of<00:04:41.280> keep<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.640> back

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
electrical tape to kind of keep the back

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.530 
electrical tape to kind of keep the back
end<00:04:42.030> pulled<00:04:42.270> up<00:04:43.730> the<00:04:44.730> other<00:04:44.850> thing<00:04:45.090> is<00:04:45.120> make

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
end pulled up the other thing is make

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.060 
end pulled up the other thing is make
sure<00:04:45.570> on<00:04:45.990> your<00:04:46.140> gray<00:04:46.320> wire<00:04:46.560> you<00:04:46.800> don't<00:04:46.950> have

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
sure on your gray wire you don't have

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.680 
sure on your gray wire you don't have
too<00:04:47.220> much<00:04:47.250> slack<00:04:47.670> that<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.120> gets<00:04:48.240> pushed<00:04:48.540> into

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
too much slack that it gets pushed into

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.300 
too much slack that it gets pushed into
either<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:48.990> flywheel<00:04:49.440> with<00:04:49.650> actual<00:04:50.100> motor

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
either the flywheel with actual motor

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.430 
either the flywheel with actual motor
housing<00:04:50.600> other<00:04:51.600> than<00:04:51.810> that<00:04:52.220> it's<00:04:53.220> it's<00:04:53.970> snug

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
housing other than that it's it's snug

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.580 
housing other than that it's it's snug
it's<00:04:55.440> very<00:04:56.250> tight<00:04:56.550> clean<00:04:57.060> easy<00:04:57.720> to<00:04:57.930> do<00:04:58.080> you

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
it's very tight clean easy to do you

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.020 
it's very tight clean easy to do you
don't<00:04:58.830> need<00:04:59.010> to<00:04:59.130> take<00:04:59.310> disassemble<00:04:59.940> the

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
don't need to take disassemble the

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.890 
don't need to take disassemble the
trucks<00:05:00.300> do<00:05:00.990> not<00:05:01.170> need<00:05:01.320> to<00:05:01.410> do<00:05:01.530> that<00:05:02.900> there's

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
trucks do not need to do that there's

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.870 
trucks do not need to do that there's
just<00:05:04.410> a<00:05:04.620> lot<00:05:04.890> of<00:05:05.070> work<00:05:05.220> and<00:05:05.430> you<00:05:05.550> can<00:05:05.730> actually

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
just a lot of work and you can actually

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.320 
just a lot of work and you can actually
damage<00:05:06.890> one<00:05:07.890> that<00:05:08.040> I<00:05:08.070> did<00:05:08.310> following<00:05:08.820> that

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
damage one that I did following that

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.650 
damage one that I did following that
particular<00:05:09.750> video<00:05:09.870> i<00:05:09.990> actually<00:05:10.380> did<00:05:10.530> damage

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
particular video i actually did damage

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.690 
particular video i actually did damage
the<00:05:12.660> worm<00:05:12.840> gear<00:05:13.200> itself<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:14.130> it's<00:05:14.430> a<00:05:14.520> little

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
the worm gear itself and it's a little

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.070 
the worm gear itself and it's a little
bit<00:05:14.790> noisier<00:05:15.090> than<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.300> needs<00:05:15.480> to<00:05:15.570> be<00:05:15.630> and<00:05:15.780> I

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
bit noisier than it needs to be and I

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.060 
bit noisier than it needs to be and I
didn't<00:05:16.320> need<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.500> do<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:16.650> so<00:05:18.470> so<00:05:19.470> that<00:05:19.830> that's

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
didn't need to do that so so that that's

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.680 
didn't need to do that so so that that's
