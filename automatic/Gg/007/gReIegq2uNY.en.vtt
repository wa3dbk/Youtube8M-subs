what's<00:00:00.359> it<00:00:00.480> goes<00:00:00.599> to<00:00:00.750> a<00:00:00.810> fee<00:00:00.930> 15<00:00:01.350> squad<00:00:01.650> builder

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
what's it goes to a fee 15 squad builder

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.070 
what's it goes to a fee 15 squad builder
and<00:00:02.040> today<00:00:02.280> we<00:00:02.340> know<00:00:02.639> cheap<00:00:02.879> BPL<00:00:03.449> side<00:00:03.750> I<00:00:03.780> think

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
and today we know cheap BPL side I think

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.570 
and today we know cheap BPL side I think
there's<00:00:04.200> only<00:00:04.290> one<00:00:04.410> rare<00:00:04.890> player<00:00:05.160> in<00:00:05.370> this

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
there's only one rare player in this

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.740 
there's only one rare player in this
squad<00:00:05.970> so<00:00:06.150> it's<00:00:06.270> not<00:00:06.330> going<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.540> be<00:00:06.629> too

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
squad so it's not going to be too

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.600 
squad so it's not going to be too
expensive<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.440> actual<00:00:07.740> price<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.340> squad

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
expensive the actual price of the squad

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.280 
expensive the actual price of the squad
builder<00:00:08.880> will<00:00:09.090> be<00:00:09.210> in<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.389> title<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.080> use

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
builder will be in the title and I use

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.259 
builder will be in the title and I use
their<00:00:10.590> foot<00:00:10.860> ways<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.219> check<00:00:11.670> all<00:00:11.820> my<00:00:11.849> prices

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
their foot ways to check all my prices

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.850 
their foot ways to check all my prices
because<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.540> think<00:00:12.690> they<00:00:13.110> are<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.380> only<00:00:13.650> one

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
because I think they are the only one

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.499 
because I think they are the only one
who<00:00:14.040> have<00:00:14.370> actually<00:00:14.519> got<00:00:14.759> prices<00:00:15.150> at<00:00:15.299> the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
who have actually got prices at the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.300 
who have actually got prices at the
moment<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.560> first<00:00:16.740> player<00:00:16.890> in<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.130> team

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
moment so the first player in this team

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.460 
moment so the first player in this team
is<00:00:17.520> julian<00:00:17.940> Speroni<00:00:18.300> from<00:00:18.570> Crystal<00:00:19.140> Palace

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
is julian Speroni from Crystal Palace

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.230 
is julian Speroni from Crystal Palace
and<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.920> did<00:00:20.250> actually<00:00:20.369> played<00:00:20.699> warm<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
and I did actually played warm in the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.029 
and I did actually played warm in the
first<00:00:21.420> game<00:00:21.660> didn't<00:00:22.320> save<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.500> thing<00:00:22.800> he

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
first game didn't save a thing he

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.800 
first game didn't save a thing he
probably<00:00:23.430> had<00:00:23.609> five<00:00:23.820> or<00:00:23.939> six<00:00:24.119> shots<00:00:24.180> against

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
probably had five or six shots against

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.410 
probably had five or six shots against
him<00:00:24.960> didn't<00:00:25.500> save<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> single<00:00:25.769> one<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:27.029> think

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
him didn't save a single one so I think

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.849 
him didn't save a single one so I think
one<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.599> these<00:00:27.720> games<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.109> didn't<00:00:28.349> exactly<00:00:28.529> do

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
one of these games we didn't exactly do

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.950 
one of these games we didn't exactly do
too<00:00:29.039> well<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:29.490> when<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.820> did<00:00:29.910> put<00:00:30.150> Speroni<00:00:30.480> he

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
too well but when I did put Speroni he

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.139 
too well but when I did put Speroni he
did<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> lot<00:00:31.320> better<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.859> job<00:00:32.160> next<00:00:32.759> up<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.030> the

somebody<00:01:36.390> else<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> first<00:01:37.170> game<00:01:37.439> i<00:01:37.619> think

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
somebody else in the first game i think

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.429 
somebody else in the first game i think
it<00:01:37.979> was<00:01:38.130> stunned<00:01:38.729> Butley<00:01:39.030> from<00:01:39.360> tata<00:01:40.170> motspur

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
but I think Ken's on z's a lot more a

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.780 
but I think Ken's on z's a lot more a
strong<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.159> course<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.640> better

for<00:02:25.239> chemistry<00:02:25.769> reasons<00:02:26.769> because<00:02:27.129> this<00:02:27.340> guy's

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
for chemistry reasons because this guy's

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.070

more<00:02:29.110> than<00:02:29.379> 75<00:02:29.830> paise<00:02:30.069> probably<00:02:30.819> got<00:02:30.910> near<00:02:31.090> 80

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
more than 75 paise probably got near 80

rare<00:02:36.849> next<00:02:37.540> door<00:02:37.660> being<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.870> team<00:02:38.019> we<00:02:38.110> do<00:02:38.200> have

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
rare next door being the team we do have

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.180 
rare next door being the team we do have
seemed<00:02:38.590> young<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:38.950> didn't<00:02:39.130> actually

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
seemed young and I didn't actually

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.070 
seemed young and I didn't actually
realize<00:02:39.730> he's<00:02:39.910> only<00:02:40.030> got<00:02:40.209> two<00:02:40.569> star<00:02:40.840> skill

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
realize he's only got two star skill

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.350 
realize he's only got two star skill
moves<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:41.440> not<00:02:42.190> exactly<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.819> best<00:02:42.849> he's

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
moves so not exactly the best he's

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.680 
moves so not exactly the best he's
probably<00:02:43.810> gonna<00:02:44.260> be<00:02:44.470> better<00:02:44.650> as<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:46.120> bit<00:02:46.510> more

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
probably gonna be better as a bit more

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.690 
probably gonna be better as a bit more
defensive<00:02:47.230> than<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.410> count<00:02:47.709> because<00:02:47.980> two<00:02:48.459> star

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
defensive than a count because two star
