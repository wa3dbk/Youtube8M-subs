00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.899
 it is enough that someone you are responsible partner region 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:05.810
 rhône-alpes within pricewaterhousecoopers a union 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.760
 this is not the first time you do 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.699
 here are the interviews for eligible students in East and Grenoble 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.519
 why did you agree to be a member of the jury? 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.980
 just listen because we employ a lot of female students 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.269
 grenoble 1-1 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.189
 we finally employ we hire every year 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.830
 4 5% 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.220
 students 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.060
 at the regional level and at the national level several dozens and as 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.270
 wants I'm responsible for the rhône-alpes region for the said within 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.149
 press in what we can see that and that besides I have ties 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.870
 affective agronomist it seemed to me quite natural so 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.870
 every year when I can I participate to this day 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.040
 some preparers wonder whether the aims of the examiners and 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.630
 destabilize candidates 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.670
 what do you have to answer them certainly not I think it's a 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.130
 very bad method 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.350
 the idea is rather to put at ease and to allow 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.870
 federal assess the birth rate and a candidate outside any stress 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.050
 the candidate who shows up is already stressed enough I think 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.230
 the idea is that do not fail to add 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.280
 you have to look for a particular profile of students 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.440
 listen 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.890
 dad specially designed for this sample has a well made head 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.900
 and percent 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.990
 people who him 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.120
 who they are 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.510
 natural reindeer 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.350
 who is not trying to pretend that they are not 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.759
 and percent and and that overall make a good impression it's hard to 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.710
 held to more specific criteria 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.710
 do you have anything to reindeer shot especially on the level 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.790
 this year's candidates 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.150
 listen to him and judge the chance to participate this year in the party 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.729
 civil 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.260
 the mission 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.120
 the for the gateway contest 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.760
 and so it gave me the opportunity for the first time to have candidates 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.880
 who have paths perhaps a little more original than what comes out of 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.210
 preparatory traces I found that very positive 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.040
 I found candidates who had interesting courses 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.210
 and an endearing personality 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.710
 it also allowed me to some extent to block some 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.100
 prejudices so I find these candidates of excellent quality
