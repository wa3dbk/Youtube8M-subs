00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
to the guards and when you're doing that

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.709 
to the guards and when you're doing that
you<00:00:31.560> throw<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.250> stun<00:00:32.700> grenade<00:00:32.820> way<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
you throw a stun grenade way up in the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.660 
you throw a stun grenade way up in the
air<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.320> then<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.649> shoot<00:00:34.860> him<00:00:35.100> again<00:00:35.250> and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
air and then you shoot him again and

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.010 
air and then you shoot him again and
then<00:00:35.760> when<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.300> lands

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
then when it lands

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.680 
then when it lands
he'll<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:37.460> barely<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.820> done<00:00:39.059> recovering

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
he'll just barely be done recovering

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.869 
he'll just barely be done recovering
from<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.079> bullet<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.980> he'll<00:00:41.489> get<00:00:41.610> stunned

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
from the bullet and he'll get stunned

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.060 
from the bullet and he'll get stunned
again<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.110> keep<00:00:43.440> doing<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.770> over

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
again and you just keep doing that over

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.819 
again and you just keep doing that over
and<00:00:44.250> over<00:00:44.399> again<00:00:45.079> but<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.230> really<00:00:46.440> hard<00:00:46.739> to

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
and over again but it's really hard to

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.549 
and over again but it's really hard to
get<00:00:46.950> him<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.309> stun<00:00:47.730> lock<00:00:47.969> or<00:00:48.719> whatever

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
get him in that stun lock or whatever

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.299 
get him in that stun lock or whatever
because<00:00:51.289> after<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.410> first<00:00:52.680> grenade<00:00:53.039> you

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
because after that first grenade you

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.650 
because after that first grenade you
have<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.640> able<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.820> aim<00:00:54.000> at<00:00:54.210> his<00:00:54.390> head

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
have to be able to aim at his head

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.779 
have to be able to aim at his head
fairly<00:00:55.530> well<00:00:55.710> while<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.280> screen<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.760> just

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
fairly well while the screen is just

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.930 
fairly well while the screen is just
pure<00:00:57.360> white<00:00:57.710> it's<00:00:58.710> very<00:00:59.039> hard<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.730> and

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
pure white it's very hard to do and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.330 
pure white it's very hard to do and
right<00:01:00.660> here<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.320> said<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.890> first<00:01:02.070> time<00:01:02.280> we

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
right here like I said the first time we

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.109 
right here like I said the first time we
fought<00:01:02.730> him<00:01:04.010> you<00:01:05.010> can<00:01:05.189> get<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> free<00:01:05.610> shot<00:01:05.909> on

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
fought him you can get a free shot on

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.450 
fought him you can get a free shot on
him<00:01:06.409> during<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.530> reloading<00:01:08.010> cutscene

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
him during that reloading cutscene

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.190 
him during that reloading cutscene
because<00:01:08.700> he<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.299> skip<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:10.020> he'll

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
because he can just skip it but he'll

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.600 
because he can just skip it but he'll
still<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.650> reloading

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.499 

but<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:14.880> Ocelot<00:01:15.799> really<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.509> shoot

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
but for Ocelot really it's just shoot

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.749 
but for Ocelot really it's just shoot
him<00:01:18.659> throw<00:01:19.530> grenades<00:01:19.890> everywhere<00:01:20.040> grenades

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
him throw grenades everywhere grenades

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:31.940 
him throw grenades everywhere grenades
again<00:01:21.000> him<00:01:21.119> very<00:01:21.330> easily

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:48.380 

oh<00:01:43.820> god<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.360> pain<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.710> annoying<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.340> do<00:01:48.270> in

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390

a boss rush I don't know it's just the

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.809 
a boss rush I don't know it's just the
first<00:01:52.079> half<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.770> stamina<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.640> take

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
first half of this stamina I can take

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.050 
first half of this stamina I can take
out<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.240> quick<00:01:54.539> by<00:01:54.719> doing<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.819> it's<00:01:56.819> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
out so quick by doing this it's the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.139 
out so quick by doing this it's the
little<00:01:57.380> reload<00:01:58.380> trick<00:01:58.860> because<00:01:59.670> when<00:02:00.030> you

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
little reload trick because when you

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.070 
little reload trick because when you
unequip<00:02:00.929> and<00:02:01.079> re-equip<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:02.569> it<00:02:03.569> completely

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
unequip and re-equip it it completely

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.039 
unequip and re-equip it it completely
fills<00:02:04.560> up<00:02:04.799> your<00:02:04.890> ammo<00:02:05.250> again<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:06.509> also<00:02:06.840> doing

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
fills up your ammo again but also doing

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.729 
fills up your ammo again but also doing
this<00:02:07.200> means<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.560> don't<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.920> wait<00:02:08.630> to

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
this means you don't have to wait to

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.940 
this means you don't have to wait to
cock<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.979> gun<00:02:11.009> or<00:02:11.549> the<00:02:11.819> shotgun<00:02:12.299> again<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.860> it

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
cock the gun or the shotgun again so it

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.430 
cock the gun or the shotgun again so it
goes<00:02:14.099> by<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.610> lot<00:02:14.640> quicker<00:02:15.120> plus<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.230> pain

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
goes by a lot quicker plus the pain

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.390 
goes by a lot quicker plus the pain
doesn't<00:02:16.620> really<00:02:16.860> have<00:02:17.099> that<00:02:17.130> many

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
doesn't really have that many

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.210 
doesn't really have that many
invincibility<00:02:18.030> frames<00:02:18.709> it's<00:02:19.709> really<00:02:19.950> this

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
invincibility frames it's really this

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.559 
invincibility frames it's really this
trick<00:02:20.730> here<00:02:20.880> is<00:02:20.940> really<00:02:21.120> helpful<00:02:21.390> with

shotgun<00:02:21.959> but<00:02:22.079> for<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.920> second<00:02:23.400> phase<00:02:23.579> of<00:02:23.819> the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
shotgun but for the second phase of the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.370

pains<00:02:24.150> fight<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.540> don't<00:02:24.690> know<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:24.989> just<00:02:25.019> takes

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
pains fight I don't know it just takes
