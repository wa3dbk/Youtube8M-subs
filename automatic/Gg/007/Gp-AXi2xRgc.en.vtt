00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello all together in the fall often the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.890
 ask what you do when the turtle 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.120
 one digs why they are 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.889
 ever a bird 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.870
 if it is bad that she does not eat 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.599
 and so on that's a normal one 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.550
 Reaction to falling temperatures 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.199
 decreasing daily and decreasing 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.300
 number of hours of sunshine per day 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.340
 that's the way it should be, but it is 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.930
 colder than natural 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.029
 habitat and that's why we have to go with it 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.189
 a few tricks, so to speak 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.510
 do not help so the winter stiff 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.669
 is initiated too early 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.890
 In the background you can see I have 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.690
 for my young a spring and of 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.380
 I have my adult animals back there 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.380
 a greenhouse 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.710
 here in exchange as I reach through 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.270
 the greenhouse effect similar 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.880
 temperatures as in the natural 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.980
 habitat so please i was allowed 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.200
 next to each other the possibility itself 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.629
 to bring to local temperature 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.280
 as it were, the workplaces how to do so 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.090
 beautiful says about the metabolism in transition 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.670
 to keep 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.740
 for the nighttime temperature reduction 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.270
 but it should not sink too much 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.420
 That's why I have a heater here 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:18.110
 Shape it with a thermostat so that 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.530
 beautiful corners can not benefit 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.450
 but these are too far in the early autumn 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.490
 or in late summer says the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.240
 turtles still free of the plant 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.320
 leave as you like 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.420
 but when I realize that I am the 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.369
 Turtles outside state cool 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.780
 So do not go back then 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.000
 I close the greenhouse or 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.369
 small the provisional released 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.020
 So you always give him the opportunity 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.830
 in time you have peace on the 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.830
 bring temperature 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.030
 Of course, this also applies to one 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.330
 it's almost exactly the same in the beginning 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.649
 I have exactly that here in the spring 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.459
 same as a greenhouse only one 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.390
 number smaller 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:01.539
 that means I have a heat lamp here 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:10.310
 to bring to local temperature 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:13.599
 i have a fan heater and i have 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.599
 a curious one 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.170
 to come back the initial question what you 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.750
 after that, if the customer is a boat 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.730
 he made sure that the turtles 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.130
 at night freezes or greenhouse visits 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.570
 and shut us up for the night 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.280
 Turtles can get through there 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.960
 the greenhouse effect and the heat lamp 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.580
 warm up and the area or 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.650
 greenhouse itself not left 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.960
 but of course it can be that the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.960
 turtles despite the heat constantly 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.640
 Therefore it is important that you bury 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.380
 in late summer, best in july / august 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.560
 the turtles once sanitary 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.420
 Checking through this is one of the 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.730
 Parasitologist examination the standard 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.560
 is always part of every year but also 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.860
 so general health conditions like 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.630
 the weight history and the tank ob 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.280
 she fought back to become rich and 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.260
 so similar to the nose is the free 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.330
 eyes clear and so on when the 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.100
 turtle is healthy then she is allowed 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.630
 also like to hide it though 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.460
 warm and nice weather is then 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.260
 It is completely normal if you but that 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.880
 have feeling is ill put the same 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.390
 you should have said points 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.440
 maybe again to the vet 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.209
 summarized is the reaction will 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.250
 sign reasons to bury a 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.150
 normal ingredient in the fall and 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.709
 is one of them 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.410
 The turtle needs it or not 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.090
 ironing and the heat lamp force it 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.040
 is just like that every shield is good 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.070
 different and everyone starts to others 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.410
 time for it to be the most beautiful 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:38.090
 but you are welcome to do so 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.090
 not in the fridge or elsewhere 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.560
 you can not warm her from 20 degrees 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.540
 greenhouse or in the five degree cold 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.220
 fridge and she because she needs 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.780
 these people by the slow 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.070
 sinking temperature please also here 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.770
 if it is our earth 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.069
 buried takes so only in october 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.680
 november for that 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.969
 that was it because it was 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.439
 you are welcome to ask these questions 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:05.239
 put under it or on mine 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:09.340
