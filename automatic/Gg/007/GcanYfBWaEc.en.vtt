00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.030
 Hello 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.050
 two 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.660
 along with the launch of tennis for 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.239
 wii sports club also came the mode 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.760
 bowling one of the most game modes 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.720
 entertained and played by users 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.150
 from the ancestor win 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.520
 now it makes its comeback in the form of 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.300
 downloadable game sharing many 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.180
 features with tennis 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.100
 to start wii sports bowling 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.040
 club benefit from the use of 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.620
 improved wiimote plus and wii controls 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.690
 motionplus that despite being required of 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.760
 mandatory form make the 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.550
 throwing the ball is much more 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.259
 realistic and allow us to include more in 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.170
 his trajectory when launching it 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.170
 against bowling 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.810
 anyway with classical control 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.580
 that we already know from the original version 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.979
 a control mode has been added to 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.259
 beginners where we do not have to 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.689
 keep subject the button go to the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.180
 moment before the launch but 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.490
 the be button serves only to move 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.670
 to our min and we launch with the gesture 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.799
 of the control otherwise the controls do not 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.140
 they have changed except as mentioned 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.509
 before, in which it is now easier to provide 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.220
 trajectory to launch thanks to 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.350
 wiimote plus 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.080
 in terms of game modes are included 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.240
 local online matches through 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.360
 of the intent network or training 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.220
 in local and multiplayer mode you can 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.890
 play with just one participant 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.439
 as with a maximum of four in all three 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.619
 same modes that we already know the mode 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.909
 normal mode with obstacles and mode 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.009
 of the time the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.369
 the novelty lies to our surprise 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.379
 in training mode a thought mode 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.810
 for a single player in which more than 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.930
 practice our releases we 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.849
 offers three additional game modes 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.310
 the first one is the ace of the semi 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.440
 full in which we throw the ball by the 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.540
 track trying to collect some 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.980
 score multipliers that 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.680
 will increase the bolus counter 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.530
 knocked down at the end of the track the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.910
 next is ball with trick where you 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.280
 we are presented with several tests of 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.930
 variable difficulty where bowling 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.569
 they are placed in very different ways 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.349
 colorful and they challenge us to knock them down 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.780
 with a single roll last challenge to 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.349
 three balls is similar to the mode of 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.150
 times when using three runs 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:54.840
 we must knock down a drawing made with 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.150
 bowling as many of them as possible 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.069
 as in tennis bowling 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.170
 they also contribute our scores to 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.300
 the global list of clubs to do it 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.360
 be part of the best in the world in 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.640
 the total count the line items 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.860
 they are very scarce and just connect with 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.680
 players except in certain strips 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.629
 specific days and days a very 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.610
 criticizable since it was one of the 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.440
 main attractions of wii sports 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.300
 club 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.340
 as regards the audiovisual aspect of 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.340
 sports the tracks have improved in 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.540
 regarding decoration and population of my 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.660
 Looking more full of characters from 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.850
 background activity music is scarce and 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.820
 similar to the original title although 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.980
 it is appreciated that it be included in terms of 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.600
 replayability all depends on whether the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.240
 user has rented the sport for a 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.270
 24 - hour period or acquired 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.820
 permanent way as it influences if it is going to 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.100
 play enough to the title or if it will be a 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.680
 sporadic activity for parties 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.060
 the good ones from wii sports club offer 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.280
 a number of improvements over the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.230
 original and still so fun 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.910
 as always although you have to take turns 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.360
 to play being an option 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.070
 multiplayer more appropriate than tennis 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.600
 even so it is advisable to weigh if the 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.120
 game will be amortized with the purchase 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:15.180
 permanent or if it is preferable to use it 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.180
 sporadically with the 24- hour pass
