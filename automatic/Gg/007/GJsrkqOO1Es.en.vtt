you've<00:00:45.480> had<00:00:45.510> outside<00:00:46.760> um<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:48.410> have<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> few<00:00:49.860> I

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.299 
you've had outside um I have a few I

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
think probably one of the standouts was

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.400 
think probably one of the standouts was
in<00:00:53.309> 2006<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:56.880> summit<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.239> Everest<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:58.320> were

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
in 2006 on the summit of Everest we were

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.340

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.249 
trying to ski the mountain and there was
just<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.680> moment<00:01:02.120> everybody<00:01:03.120> had<00:01:03.239> left<00:01:03.270> I'd

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259
