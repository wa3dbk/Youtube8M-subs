00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
one-on-one but occasionally we get

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.220 
one-on-one but occasionally we get
questions<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.449> require<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> larger<00:00:25.050> audience

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
questions that require a larger audience

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.170 
questions that require a larger audience
in<00:00:25.590> other<00:00:25.680> words<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.340> several<00:00:26.760> people<00:00:26.789> are

in other words that several people are

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.150 
in other words that several people are
asking<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> same<00:00:27.720> question<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.380> for<00:00:29.070> those

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
asking the same question and for those

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.780 
asking the same question and for those
we<00:00:29.490> do<00:00:29.699> select<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.420> do<00:00:31.260> these<00:00:31.439> video<00:00:31.890> Q&amp;A<00:00:32.460> if

we do select to do these video Q&amp;A if
you<00:00:32.940> will<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.690> today's<00:00:34.110> question<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.770> coming

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
you will so today's question is coming

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.350 
you will so today's question is coming
to<00:00:35.940> us<00:00:35.969> from<00:00:36.170> Gavin<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:38.070> Bozeman<00:00:38.640> Montana<00:00:38.670> and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
to us from Gavin in Bozeman Montana and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.200 
to us from Gavin in Bozeman Montana and
his<00:00:39.510> question<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.399> what's<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.579> big<00:00:41.790> deal<00:00:41.969> with

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
his question is what's the big deal with

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.299 
his question is what's the big deal with
the<00:00:42.570> importance<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.290> shutter<00:00:43.530> speeds<00:00:43.980> when

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the importance of shutter speeds when

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.389 
the importance of shutter speeds when
working<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:44.730> flash<00:00:44.850> outdoors<00:00:46.250> Gavin<00:00:47.250> it's

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
working with flash outdoors Gavin it's

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.799 
working with flash outdoors Gavin it's
real<00:00:47.610> simple<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.120> we've<00:00:48.239> talked<00:00:48.480> about<00:00:48.570> this

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
real simple and we've talked about this

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.209 
real simple and we've talked about this
a<00:00:48.870> little<00:00:49.110> bit<00:00:49.350> we've<00:00:49.559> touched<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.160> some

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
a little bit we've touched on it in some

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.279 
a little bit we've touched on it in some
of<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.670> blog<00:00:50.910> posts<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.390> you'll<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:52.199> it

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
of the blog posts and you'll see it

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.790 
of the blog posts and you'll see it
coming<00:00:52.649> up<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.850> new<00:00:54.079> webinar<00:00:55.079> that

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
coming up in a in a new webinar that

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.430 
coming up in a in a new webinar that
I'll<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:56.070> recording<00:00:56.399> shortly<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.090> New<00:00:57.180> York

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
I'll be recording shortly in New York

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.880 
I'll be recording shortly in New York
and<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:59.070> Joe<00:00:59.280> Joe<00:00:59.960> recently<00:01:00.960> did<00:01:01.109> as<00:01:01.260> well<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and a Joe Joe recently did as well and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.460 
and a Joe Joe recently did as well and
so<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.160> think<00:01:02.520> you'll<00:01:02.640> find<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.149> we<00:01:03.470> regularly

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
so I think you'll find that we regularly

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.050 
so I think you'll find that we regularly
will<00:01:04.619> talk<00:01:04.830> about<00:01:05.010> some<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.400> these<00:01:05.460> topics<00:01:05.700> and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
will talk about some of these topics and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.050 
will talk about some of these topics and
techniques<00:01:07.189> shutter<00:01:08.189> speed<00:01:08.580> it's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
techniques shutter speed it's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.550 
techniques shutter speed it's
interesting<00:01:09.390> how<00:01:09.600> shutter<00:01:10.080> speed<00:01:10.350> and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
interesting how shutter speed and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.649 
interesting how shutter speed and
aperture<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.070> work<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.240> live<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
aperture is work and that we live in a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.330 
aperture is work and that we live in a
world<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.020> photography<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:14.070> call

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
world of photography that we call

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.880 
world of photography that we call
reciprocal<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.720> reciprocal<00:01:15.990> nature<00:01:16.619> so

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
reciprocal it's a reciprocal nature so

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.999 
reciprocal it's a reciprocal nature so
if<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.759> know<00:01:17.880> 500<00:01:18.420> 5<00:01:18.659> 6<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> same<00:01:19.560> exposure

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
if you know 500 5 6 is the same exposure

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.570 
if you know 500 5 6 is the same exposure
as<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.250> sixtieth<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.759> f-16<00:01:22.070> unless<00:01:23.070> you

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
as a sixtieth at f-16 unless you

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.609 
as a sixtieth at f-16 unless you
introduce<00:01:23.970> flash<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.630> ambient<00:01:25.020> situation

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
introduce flash in the ambient situation

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.770 
introduce flash in the ambient situation
and<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.250> those<00:01:26.460> two<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:27.090> were<00:01:27.240> married

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
and so those two that were married

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.620 
and so those two that were married
together<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:28.829> shutter<00:01:29.130> speed<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.700> aperture

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
together with shutter speed and aperture

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.649 
together with shutter speed and aperture
in<00:01:31.079> an<00:01:31.229> ambient<00:01:31.590> situation<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.329> bond

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
in an ambient situation that that bond

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.330 
in an ambient situation that that bond
is<00:01:33.930> kind<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.200> broken<00:01:34.500> now<00:01:34.799> when<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.070> introduce

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
is kind of broken now when you introduce

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.340 
is kind of broken now when you introduce
flash<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.000> ambience<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> difference<00:01:37.140> is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
flash and ambience and the difference is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.399 
flash and ambience and the difference is
the<00:01:38.250> flash<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:39.060> completely<00:01:39.750> controlled<00:01:40.079> on

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the flash is completely controlled on

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.350 
the flash is completely controlled on
your<00:01:40.560> primary<00:01:40.950> subject<00:01:41.369> by<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.549> aperture<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
your primary subject by the aperture and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.620 
your primary subject by the aperture and
the<00:01:42.439> shutter<00:01:43.439> speed<00:01:44.009> takes<00:01:44.579> care<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:44.970> your

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the shutter speed takes care of your

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.530 
the shutter speed takes care of your
background<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:47.549> just<00:01:47.759> background<00:01:47.970> but

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
background and not just background but

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.630 
background and not just background but
ambience<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.380> also<00:01:49.590> includes<00:01:50.250> shadow

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
ambience and that also includes shadow

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.440 
ambience and that also includes shadow
detail<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:52.140> what<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.439> means<00:01:52.740> basically

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
detail so what that means basically

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.749 
detail so what that means basically
Gavin<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.600> real<00:01:54.840> simply<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.640> need<00:01:56.640> to

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
Gavin is real simply this you need to

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.370 
Gavin is real simply this you need to
figure<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.180> think<00:01:57.329> there's<00:01:57.630> one<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.110> three

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
figure out I think there's one of three

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.679 
figure out I think there's one of three
different<00:01:58.740> exposures<00:01:59.430> basically<00:02:00.060> for<00:02:00.570> your

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
different exposures basically for your

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.330 
different exposures basically for your
backgrounds<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.770> learned<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.100> from<00:02:02.250> my

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
backgrounds and I learned this from my

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.490 
backgrounds and I learned this from my
good<00:02:02.549> friend<00:02:02.610> Doug<00:02:03.030> box<00:02:03.329> basically<00:02:04.320> your

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
good friend Doug box basically your

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.410 
good friend Doug box basically your
background<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.280> look<00:02:05.490> as<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:06.030> truly<00:02:06.390> looks

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
background can look as it truly looks

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.900 
background can look as it truly looks
when<00:02:07.049> you're<00:02:07.140> outside<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.369> look<00:02:08.550> brighter

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
when you're outside it can look brighter

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.940 
when you're outside it can look brighter
than<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.300> truly<00:02:09.629> looks<00:02:09.660> or<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.770> look

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
than it truly looks or it can look

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.339 
than it truly looks or it can look
darker<00:02:11.370> than<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.550> truly<00:02:11.970> looks<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.870> figure

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
darker than it truly looks so you figure

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.850 
darker than it truly looks so you figure
that<00:02:13.500> out

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that out

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.260 
that out
so<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.010> can<00:02:14.220> take<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> meter<00:02:14.670> reading<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:15.090> can

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
so you can take a meter reading you can

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.850 
so you can take a meter reading you can
shoot<00:02:15.420> examples<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.320> shoot<00:02:16.530> test

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
shoot examples you can shoot test

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.410 
shoot examples you can shoot test
pictures<00:02:17.220> until<00:02:17.460> you<00:02:17.910> get<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.150> background

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
pictures until you get the background

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.840 
pictures until you get the background
the<00:02:18.810> way<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.020> want<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.620> let's<00:02:20.250> say<00:02:20.520> your

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
the way you want it and let's say your

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.410 
the way you want it and let's say your
exposure<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.450> 125<00:02:22.230> at<00:02:22.440> f-16<00:02:23.040> then<00:02:23.820> if<00:02:24.150> that's

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
exposure is 125 at f-16 then if that's

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.700 
exposure is 125 at f-16 then if that's
the<00:02:24.570> way<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.720> want<00:02:24.900> your<00:02:25.020> background<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.530> look

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
the way you want your background to look

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.070 
the way you want your background to look
the<00:02:26.130> answer<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.430> very<00:02:26.490> simple<00:02:26.810> bring<00:02:27.810> up<00:02:27.930> your

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
the answer is very simple bring up your

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.290 
the answer is very simple bring up your
flash<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.710> read<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.010> same<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.460> you're<00:02:30.120> gonna

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
flash to read the same and you're gonna

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.330 
flash to read the same and you're gonna
have<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.570> background<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.500> flash<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:32.130> match

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
have a background and a flash that match

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.270 
have a background and a flash that match
now<00:02:33.240> if<00:02:33.570> that<00:02:33.930> puts<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.440> little<00:02:34.770> more<00:02:34.920> light<00:02:35.130> on

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
now if that puts a little more light on

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.920 
now if that puts a little more light on
your<00:02:35.400> subjects<00:02:35.880> face<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.300> might<00:02:36.450> back<00:02:36.720> off

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
your subjects face you might back off

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.050 
your subjects face you might back off
the<00:02:37.470> flash<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.710> little<00:02:38.100> bit<00:02:38.250> but<00:02:38.850> it's<00:02:38.970> a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
the flash a little bit but it's a

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.940 
the flash a little bit but it's a
personal<00:02:39.540> thing<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.930> it's<00:02:40.020> personal<00:02:40.500> testing

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
personal thing and it's personal testing

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.100 
personal thing and it's personal testing

of understanding and reading those

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.340 
of understanding and reading those
percentage<00:02:53.520> numbers<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.540> aren't<00:02:54.900> built<00:02:55.080> in

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
percentage numbers that aren't built in

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.830 
percentage numbers that aren't built in
to<00:02:55.560> all<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.950> sekonic<00:02:56.400> light<00:02:56.580> meters<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.510> if

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
to all the sekonic light meters so if

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.390 
to all the sekonic light meters so if
you'll<00:02:58.110> stay<00:02:58.320> tuned<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.770> promise<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.280> we're

at YouTube so thank you for the question
and<00:03:16.790> again<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:18.000> think<00:03:18.090> this<00:03:18.330> is<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.540> great

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
and again I think this is a great

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.390 
and again I think this is a great
question<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.440> it's<00:03:19.860> something<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:20.190> lot<00:03:20.310> of

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
question and it's something a lot of

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.310 
question and it's something a lot of
people<00:03:20.640> just<00:03:20.820> don't<00:03:20.970> understand<00:03:21.480> but<00:03:21.690> once

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
people just don't understand but once

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.020 
people just don't understand but once
you<00:03:22.500> introduce<00:03:22.680> flash<00:03:23.160> in<00:03:23.489> an<00:03:23.640> ambient

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
you introduce flash in an ambient

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.350 
you introduce flash in an ambient
situation<00:03:24.860> you've<00:03:25.860> got<00:03:25.890> two<00:03:26.370> basic<00:03:26.820> exposures

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
situation you've got two basic exposures

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.090 
situation you've got two basic exposures
that<00:03:27.510> you're<00:03:27.630> taking<00:03:27.900> at<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.080> same<00:03:28.260> time<00:03:28.530> but

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
that you're taking at the same time but

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.140 
that you're taking at the same time but
we're<00:03:29.220> gonna<00:03:29.310> talk<00:03:29.549> in<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.820> future<00:03:29.940> about

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
we're gonna talk in the future about
