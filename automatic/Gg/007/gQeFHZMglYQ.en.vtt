the only redeeming quality of that 46

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.940 
the only redeeming quality of that 46
engine<00:04:02.720> was<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:02.990> sound<00:04:03.260> of<00:04:03.410> it<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:03.740> I<00:04:03.770> thought

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
engine was the sound of it and I thought

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.210 
engine was the sound of it and I thought
it<00:04:04.130> sounded<00:04:04.280> good<00:04:04.670> this<00:04:05.630> sounds<00:04:06.530> much<00:04:06.890> better

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
it sounded good this sounds much better

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.550 
it sounded good this sounds much better
I<00:04:07.700> mean<00:04:07.820> it's<00:04:07.940> got<00:04:08.120> an<00:04:08.240> extra<00:04:08.600> 100<00:04:08.900> horsepower

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
I mean it's got an extra 100 horsepower

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.100 
I mean it's got an extra 100 horsepower
meal<00:04:10.250> then<00:04:10.490> there<00:04:11.330> aren't<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:11.690> whole<00:04:11.840> lot<00:04:11.900> of

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
meal then there aren't a whole lot of

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.500 
meal then there aren't a whole lot of
problem<00:04:12.590> 100<00:04:13.130> extra<00:04:13.370> horsepower<00:04:13.700> won't<00:04:14.180> fix

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
problem 100 extra horsepower won't fix

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.060 
problem 100 extra horsepower won't fix
and<00:04:14.750> this<00:04:14.840> car<00:04:15.050> wasn't<00:04:15.290> broken<00:04:15.590> in<00:04:15.800> the<00:04:15.860> first

and this car wasn't broken in the first

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.720 
and this car wasn't broken in the first
place<00:04:16.220> so<00:04:16.489> they<00:04:17.239> took

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
place so they took

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.880 
place so they took
in<00:04:19.090> my<00:04:19.330> opinion<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:20.020> best<00:04:20.200> of<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:20.650> three

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
in my opinion the best of the three

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.570 
in my opinion the best of the three
muscle<00:04:21.220> cars<00:04:21.460> and<00:04:22.090> made<00:04:22.240> even<00:04:22.510> better
