pretty much just like a perfect grade
and<00:01:17.180> actually<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.240> think<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.530> get

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
and actually I think in here you get

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.420 
and actually I think in here you get
yeah<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.299> set<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.420> poseable<00:01:24.990> hands

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
yeah you get a set of poseable hands

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.980 
yeah you get a set of poseable hands
actually<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:27.180> one<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.450> these<00:01:27.570> packs<00:01:27.840> you

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
actually in like one of these packs you

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.539 
actually in like one of these packs you
would<00:01:28.110> get<00:01:28.229> two<00:01:28.439> poseable<00:01:28.920> hands<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.430> then

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
would get two poseable hands and then

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.649 
would get two poseable hands and then
two<00:01:29.759> closed<00:01:30.119> fists<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:32.329> that<00:01:33.329> would<00:01:33.479> be<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
two closed fists and that would be the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.710 
two closed fists and that would be the
same<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:33.869> each<00:01:34.110> pack<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:36.299> actually<00:01:36.479> get

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
same for each pack so you actually get

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
same for each pack so you actually get
four<00:01:37.020> hands<00:01:37.290> with<00:01:37.500> each<00:01:37.530> set<00:01:38.900> so<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.930> know<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.530> lot

four hands with each set so I know a lot

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.899 
four hands with each set so I know a lot
of<00:01:40.890> people<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.220> been<00:01:41.340> asking<00:01:41.520> me<00:01:41.790> about
