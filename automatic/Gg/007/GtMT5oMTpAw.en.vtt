trying to lay in the same nest so what
we're<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.360> select<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.630> couple<00:01:33.810> of

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
we're going to do is select a couple of

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.450 
we're going to do is select a couple of
these<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.409> try<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> encourage<00:01:35.250> them<00:01:35.369> we're

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
these and try to encourage them we're

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.429 
these and try to encourage them we're
going<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> set<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.119> second<00:01:36.570> nest<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.110> see<00:01:37.290> if

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
going to set up a second nest and see if

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.350 
going to set up a second nest and see if
maybe<00:01:37.619> another<00:01:38.220> duck<00:01:38.549> wants<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.970> go<00:01:39.090> broody

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
maybe another duck wants to go broody

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.020 
maybe another duck wants to go broody
but<00:01:40.200> first<00:01:40.560> let's<00:01:40.950> take<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.280> look<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.700> see<00:01:41.909> if

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
but first let's take a look and see if

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.960 
but first let's take a look and see if
we<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.329> tell<00:01:42.509> these<00:01:42.780> are<00:01:42.960> even<00:01:43.579> fertilized<00:01:44.579> at

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
we can tell these are even fertilized at

00:01:44.970 --> 00:02:21.480 
we can tell these are even fertilized at
all

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:03:02.150 

you

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.980 

almost<00:03:03.160> all<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.430> these<00:03:03.730> eggs<00:03:04.120> ended<00:03:04.600> up<00:03:04.690> being

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
almost all of these eggs ended up being

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.620 
almost all of these eggs ended up being
less<00:03:05.230> than<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.770> week<00:03:06.040> old<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.940> because<00:03:07.390> of<00:03:07.420> that

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
less than a week old and because of that

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.720 
less than a week old and because of that
the<00:03:07.900> candling<00:03:08.440> didn't<00:03:08.709> really<00:03:08.920> reveal<00:03:09.459> much

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
the candling didn't really reveal much

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.460 
the candling didn't really reveal much
so<00:03:10.120> we'll<00:03:10.330> come<00:03:10.600> back<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:11.080> look<00:03:11.200> at<00:03:11.319> these

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
so we'll come back and look at these

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.680 
so we'll come back and look at these
later<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:12.010> just<00:03:12.190> be<00:03:12.370> satisfied<00:03:12.670> knowing<00:03:13.330> that

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
later and just be satisfied knowing that

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.199 
later and just be satisfied knowing that
mama<00:03:13.990> duck<00:03:14.290> says<00:03:14.680> it's<00:03:15.250> time<00:03:15.520> to<00:03:15.670> sit<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:16.000> eggs

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
mama duck says it's time to sit the eggs

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.600 
mama duck says it's time to sit the eggs
so<00:03:16.780> we<00:03:16.870> have<00:03:17.020> our<00:03:17.200> duck<00:03:17.470> all<00:03:17.709> bundled<00:03:17.980> back<00:03:18.310> up

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
so we have our duck all bundled back up

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.780 
so we have our duck all bundled back up
we<00:03:19.150> took<00:03:19.330> her<00:03:19.450> down<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.930> closer<00:03:20.320> to<00:03:20.680> 18<00:03:21.400> eggs

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
we took her down to closer to 18 eggs

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.880 
we took her down to closer to 18 eggs

that's about right for her size she's
not<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.280> very<00:03:24.610> large<00:03:25.000> duck<00:03:25.600> and<00:03:25.870> she<00:03:26.020> needs<00:03:26.170> to

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
not a very large duck and she needs to

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.650 
not a very large duck and she needs to
make<00:03:26.500> sure<00:03:26.530> that<00:03:26.950> she<00:03:27.160> can<00:03:27.370> properly<00:03:28.060> manage
