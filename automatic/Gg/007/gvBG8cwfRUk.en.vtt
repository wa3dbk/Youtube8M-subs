 and good hello to all 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.339
 today we find ourselves for a small 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.460
 match in a long time of the french 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.050
 league community so the first 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.870
 week has passed from the known french 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.360
 tilly I will put in the description the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.770
 link to go Czech so my team on 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.740

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.300
 not or what obama I lost my match 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.850
 like chirac I am a little bit deg 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.380
 concludes gerard lost on a rigger a 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.359
 trick for the end the match is a little 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.250
 rotten by the hac on both sides she 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.650
 was super weird and a lot of trouble 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.300
 i have lifecell were particular 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.350
 employees but then why did I take 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.610
 am here because it was a match already 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.309
 left not in him I did not take a 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.850
 match in less and a u 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.050
 it was rather style and especially that I 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.410
 you post to our on cartridge 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.680
 soon and here I go especially not 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.320
 post a match and make a b 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.820
 w the judge could have finally post when 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.870
 I say yes it went to the goal 6 g in 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.750
 does because good people ask a lot 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.640
 but vw ruchon killing post m and in 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.989
 replays the sprites have modified late 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.680
 it's the spirit of the 5g the man of the coup 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.630
 it's a bit tied 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.299
 so I took I preferred to post you 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.220
 this match which was so a no match have 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.350
 had six g and that was with the sprites 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.369
 rather stylish the match in the match and 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.170
 not too bad that the match is enough 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.689
 interesting especially on the end where there is 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.979
 there is a small a small placement finally 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:27.479
 see you go see and so here we go 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.579
 so start the match so maja 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.880
 begins with trioxide and val how 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.979
 knew that this body hovers so direct it 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.900
 will start placing pda with this body 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.009
 plane naja spidla directly sent 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.470
 connect more to their frustrated income 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.650
 very good ok it's an oath a lot of 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.540
 heart in 5j it was my favorite 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.130
 so suddenly there he sends cider trio he 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.830
 is taken to focus value term plastie 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:55.830
 directly on Cyprus where he is called 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.780
 ex riders here then suddenly they 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.460
 send arcana he sends will signal these 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.290
 magicians like to place pdr with his 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.800
 abrasive sign the grass blick what will 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.390
 so blow extremely low 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.130
 lassina breasts then var of match that he 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.130
 with extreme speed which people but to 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.530
 6-5 for vale the pdr came aside 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.030
 my spicy hunt sees his trioxide ray 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.860
 directly worth seeing Czech has 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.680
 trioxide which is so I started 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.209
 to flinch either there tomorrow java u-turn is going 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.620
 send toxic raw to finish your tail 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.050
 of fish certainly to be ikano who 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.080
 as stable with enormous power 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.730
 of colleagues shot 'arcana is taking a 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.990
 critical shot what's not cool when 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.240
 even for valve but hey it's the game he 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.010
 sends this flight body without seeing it more 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.470
 made of fog income crisis starts to 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.420
 calm down so you have to do really 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.970
 watch out for this pokÃ©mon she mind 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.160
 on a finer as soon as he gets there 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.709
 is really really horrible this project 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.890
 against marjah it starts to be at +2 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.480
 the valve really needs to be careful 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.040
 guys start typing squash yesterday 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.700
 it's not at all the best of ideas 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.780
 to do there it is necessary to take care of 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.489
 make clear the ridiculous it is 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.590
 try to kill him but this is really 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:17.690
 hot clap 580% it's pretty huge 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.690
 protect focus blast he restores his life 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.640
 so it sends the price oxides that 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.500
 come includes the protect take 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.870
 the option quietly makes it bow 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.040
 pulse it's flinch so that's the 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.870
 purses is pretty cool for valdes 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.750
 have a little notice like that notice 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.060
 pulse focus blast that you try west 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.820
 it is 5 5 rebounds thigh is good 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.830
 placed on the toxic rock match and the 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.720
 maja speak decides to switch in fact 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.390
 just not getting killed by 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.530
 a few shots that's what you 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.210
 rule over is still a pokemon 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.860
 which is extremely downstream 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.690
 so they really have to put them 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.750
 at the right time it will look like them score 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.790
 they start placing rickauer again for 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.650
 to be able to place himself afterwards he sends 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.270
 required toxic takes any 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.500
 attack at 2 cm 2 cm this weekend in 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.420
 heart data with dry skin he has 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.020
 limited total africa where it's sunny 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.910
 warm you Gregory arrives and takes 1 of 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.940
 everything about the double switch game shot they 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.780
 send their ges and there we handed over clis 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:22.230
 who is starting to get drunk and laval no longer 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.330
 nothing to inflict damage on harnik 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.780
 luce he nevertheless tries to try to 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.720
 crit 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.120
 so we'll really go round 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.600
 so that's actually a place for 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.790
 drop drop capability xp but good 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.000
 it's going to serve very nothing and 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.880
 casually even though he registered 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.350
 it's going absolutely nothing changed rennie 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.720
 son is really going really well 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.080
 banks and so the bubble how I 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.560
 called him stood at +6 in defense 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.200
 peace there is more of my xp game show that 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.490
 puts a lot of damage he tries to 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.600
 kill 34% 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:04.650
 he sends arcanes a flair blix and rnic 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:09.570
 the us shoot at 6% want it from this stuff 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:12.090
 is just colossal it's huge despite 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.460
 that 55% with hot genk of coatloc'h 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.009
 it's still huge but despite 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.229
 all unique let place 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:24.990
 this weekend will try to get to 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:27.659
 his turn so it's going you do not know me but 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.949
 reducing the wins since tsai 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:32.309
 shock hits the physical 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:34.309
 so this weekend has not totally 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:36.569
 all the advantage against against this potter 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:37.889
 his stalls on the physical so he 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.110
 just enough that it's up to 1000 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:43.409
 men + 4 for two games kaos yes 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.059
 like quietly it's just it's 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.399
 just colossal the power of this brothel 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:50.249
 when we have nothing and it's a shame because 

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:51.719
 that valve really had a pretty team 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:54.270
 correct to fight have never anything 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:58.499
 write it really really because it has game 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.809
 we'll say and alas it's over 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:04.499
 swipe little riddick sweatshirt us that was 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:06.419
 nice flat score sai chocques goes 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:08.189
 kill a quiet annecy score 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.899
 hover as a defense form this 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:13.949
 carbon to do nothing strictly 

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:16.289
 1 to make fun so that's a little shock at 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.029
 hk where normally I think this walk 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.159
 away good I critize you aulas and 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:21.289
 the cancellation of the born and finally here 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:23.879
 are listened to 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.199
 I hope that in week two there 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:25.979
 will have some more interesting matches 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.740
 what knew in this first 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:29.909
 week ago there were a lot of matches that they 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.669
 either it was sweeps tonight it was 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:34.740
 matches rotten by the axis so that's 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:36.059
 pretty weird and the matches that were 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.399
 really more interesting in itself have not 

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:41.639
 and eric horde to the rich registered 

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:43.919
 either it was dpp matches I think 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.180
 dpw did not hurt you interesting but 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.979
 the sprites was really ugly that 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.229
 you said it would not be nice to see 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:51.509
 and next time I will take the 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.069
 match directly on vestine triplet this 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:53.939
 it will be better so that's bah 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:55.559
 I hope it's still appreciated 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:57.389
 this little game him the little trick of bobl 

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:58.379
 it was always fun we say ah 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:01.169
 next for a next match of 

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:03.409
 french beauty is sure this portuguese has 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:03.409
 job
