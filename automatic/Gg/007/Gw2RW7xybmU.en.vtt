of<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.579> think<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.969> piece<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.420> wing<00:01:51.600> fell

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
of the I think a piece of the wing fell

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.310 
of the I think a piece of the wing fell
off<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> very<00:01:52.979> big<00:01:53.280> piece<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.420> kept

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
off in it very big piece and it kept

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.800 
off in it very big piece and it kept
getting<00:01:55.649> bigger<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.189> then<00:01:56.399> their<00:01:57.210> plane<00:01:57.570> went

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
getting bigger and then their plane went

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.770 
getting bigger and then their plane went
faster<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.909> started<00:01:59.909> to<00:01:59.969> go<00:02:00.060> out<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.719> gave

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
faster and started to go out and I gave

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.260 
faster and started to go out and I gave
a<00:02:00.990> sigh<00:02:01.319> of<00:02:01.350> relief<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:02.520> then<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.850> came<00:02:03.030> up

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
a sigh of relief but then it came up

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.469 
a sigh of relief but then it came up
again<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.990> then<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.219> went<00:02:05.340> faster<00:02:05.939> again<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
again and then it went faster again and

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.999 
again and then it went faster again and
then<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.780> died<00:02:07.020> out<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.590> have<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.859> do<00:02:07.979> a

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
then it died out you have to do a

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.100 
then it died out you have to do a
wonderful<00:02:08.250> job<00:02:08.520> he<00:02:08.940> actually<00:02:09.509> speeded<00:02:09.869> up<00:02:09.960> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
wonderful job he actually speeded up the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.860 
wonderful job he actually speeded up the
plane<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.590> put<00:02:10.740> out<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.039> fire<00:02:11.069> itself<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
plane and put out the fire itself and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.360 
plane and put out the fire itself and
when<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> piece<00:02:13.350> of<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.530> wing<00:02:13.770> went<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.190> fella

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
when a piece of the wing went the fella

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.250 
when a piece of the wing went the fella
next<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.700> me<00:02:14.880> just<00:02:14.910> said<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.630> his<00:02:15.750> hands<00:02:16.080> up<00:02:16.230> to

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
next to me just said to his hands up to

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.680 
next to me just said to his hands up to
that<00:02:16.590> sit<00:02:16.830> we're<00:02:17.010> through<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.490> now<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.910> thought

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
that sit we're through and now I thought

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.320 
that sit we're through and now I thought
we<00:02:18.870> were<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.110> really<00:02:19.560> did<00:02:19.800> but<00:02:20.160> then<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.090> fire

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
we were I really did but then the fire

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.600 
we were I really did but then the fire
went<00:02:21.480> out<00:02:21.630> completely<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.590> just<00:02:23.190> before<00:02:23.340> we

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
went out completely and just before we

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.450 
went out completely and just before we
got<00:02:23.820> here<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.180> Travis<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.900> flame<00:02:25.860> started<00:02:26.280> up

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
got here to Travis the flame started up

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.430 
got here to Travis the flame started up
again<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:27.030> was<00:02:27.150> smoke<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.900> thought<00:02:28.050> sure<00:02:28.320> it

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
again it was smoke and I thought sure it

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.080 
again it was smoke and I thought sure it
was<00:02:28.590> going<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.890> start<00:02:29.070> all<00:02:29.250> over<00:02:29.280> again<00:02:29.640> and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
was going to start all over again and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.540 
was going to start all over again and
I'm<00:02:30.810> first<00:02:31.020> by<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.260> time<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.710> given<00:02:32.040> up<00:02:32.160> really

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
I'm first by this time I given up really

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.860 
I'm first by this time I given up really
hope<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.470> pilot<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.510> captain<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.750> the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
hope but the pilot the captain of the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.870 
hope but the pilot the captain of the
plane<00:02:37.110> he<00:02:37.410> started<00:02:37.890> speeding<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.490> up<00:02:38.580> again

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
plane he started speeding it up again

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.670 
plane he started speeding it up again
and<00:02:39.000> put<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.210> out<00:02:39.360> for<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.750> second<00:02:40.110> time<00:02:40.290> did<00:02:40.650> a

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
and put it out for the second time did a

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.400 
and put it out for the second time did a
very<00:02:40.950> wonderful<00:02:41.160> job<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.850> thought<00:02:42.420> but<00:02:43.200> we

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
very wonderful job I thought but we

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.460 
very wonderful job I thought but we
wouldn't<00:02:43.590> be<00:02:43.770> if<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:43.980> wasn't<00:02:44.130> for<00:02:44.340> him<00:02:45.470> why

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
wouldn't be if it wasn't for him why

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.590 
wouldn't be if it wasn't for him why
were<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.800> taking<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.220> pictures<00:02:47.580> well<00:02:48.270> one

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
were you taking the pictures well one

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.390 
were you taking the pictures well one
thought<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.110> had<00:02:49.320> at<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.620> time<00:02:49.920> right<00:02:50.190> at

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
thought that I had at this time right at

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.010 
thought that I had at this time right at
the<00:02:50.760> time<00:02:50.910> she<00:02:51.150> was<00:02:51.270> taking<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.660> pictures

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
the time she was taking the pictures

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.930 
the time she was taking the pictures
that<00:02:52.170> at<00:02:52.320> least<00:02:52.530> if<00:02:52.770> we<00:02:53.250> didn't<00:02:53.520> make<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.670> maybe

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
that at least if we didn't make it maybe

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.090 
that at least if we didn't make it maybe
someone<00:02:54.360> could<00:02:54.510> find<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.410> pitchers<00:02:56.070> in

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
someone could find it the pitchers in

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.970 
someone could find it the pitchers in
whatever<00:02:56.550> wreckage<00:02:57.030> oh<00:02:57.210> there<00:02:57.930> was<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.410> be

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
whatever wreckage oh there was and be

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.510 
whatever wreckage oh there was and be
able<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.250> tell<00:02:59.460> exactly<00:02:59.490> what<00:03:00.270> did<00:03:00.420> happen<00:03:00.480> and

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
able to tell exactly what did happen and

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.760 
able to tell exactly what did happen and
this<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:02.700> why<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:02.940> felt<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.720> was<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:04.200> good

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
this is why I felt that it was a good

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.590 
this is why I felt that it was a good
idea<00:03:04.800> for<00:03:05.250> her<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.430> take<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.880> movies<00:03:06.240> at<00:03:06.450> this

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
idea for her to take the movies at this

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.540 
idea for her to take the movies at this
time

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
time

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.339 
time
so<00:03:09.550> that<00:03:09.730> if<00:03:09.910> you<00:03:10.569> know<00:03:10.690> if<00:03:10.780> something<00:03:11.140> had

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
so that if you know if something had

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.470 
so that if you know if something had
happened<00:03:11.379> why<00:03:11.920> they<00:03:12.190> at<00:03:12.340> least<00:03:12.550> could<00:03:12.790> find

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
happened why they at least could find

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.119 
happened why they at least could find
the<00:03:13.930> film<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.410> see<00:03:14.769> what<00:03:14.950> had<00:03:15.099> actually

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129
