00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.360
 good morning friends the day of the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.119
 joselo's kitchen on youtube we are going to 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.590
 teach how we do our 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.180
 way the green sauce 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.430
 that we can serve and we will serve 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.800
 for any type of pasta be 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.310
 macaroni canute 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.040
 in spaghetti noodles 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:42.500
 or any other type of pasta 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.220
 for this we need fresh spinach 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.880
 or cut or in this case in the cuttings 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.160
 and frozen which gives me 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.770
 facilitate for the shredding process 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.810
 the fresh cheese I have here cheese 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.300
 Sterling villages 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.350
 I have 2 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.720
 cream of cream 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.550
 to cook 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.250
 a little dried basil if it 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.000
 we had 3 beans in black pepper 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.220
 milk and salt 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.940
 I say if we have it if we had it 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.390
 to be fresh better but me in my case 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.820
 I do not buy spinach usually and I 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.090
 is left to preserve it we are going to do the 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.030
 garlic sauce onion pepper 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.619
 we will add the spinach and the mash 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.560
 we have been the first to chop a 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:37.800
 relatively medium onion 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.390
 under 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.280
 to crush on and as it would put together 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.370
 with the look here we have the onion 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.380
 medium cut in squares and the 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.490
 three cloves of garlic 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.680
 peeled against charges 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.540
 all this we are going to put to brown before 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.770
 to add the spinach cut in 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.840
 squares 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.869
 basil powder or basil 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.869
 cool 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.130
 and the shredding we have together with the cheese and 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.390
 the milk now that it has started to 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.390
 poach the onion 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.799
 when it's getting white 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.920
 the onion 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.810
 and we add 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.270
 if the stop offers, I'll repeat again 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.940
 best 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.860
 to daily consumption since with clear 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.819
 which comes fifth 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.959
 but that is crushed 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.959
 I do not think that these hot springs 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.940
 mercadona if these are the color 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.109
 so 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.700
 How time can have 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.460
 as we do the potters 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.600
 special for pasta 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.950
 that's why it's called 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.970
 you have green green spaghetti 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.819
 you can do something 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.630
 green sauce 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:15.280
 it's the mercadona bag 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.280
 and this is from the city 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.340
 and I have the spinach 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.040
 cooking together with the onion and 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.010
 garlic previously I had dorado 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.480
 I'm going to add powdered basil powder 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.480
 not in dry leaves 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.319
 basil on dried leaves that are offered 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.230
 the same 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.710
 we serve it a little bit, we cook it a 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.450
 little black pepper here 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.750
 because these have to be converted into 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.730
 cream cream with milk and cream 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.730
 nothing but before you have to cut them 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.190
 people loose 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.080
 here we have then 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:17.990
 and spinach 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.990
 in the onion and garlic are already fried 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.980
 2 tubs of cheese cheese moment type 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.810
 fresh in this case is from burgos of 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:31.530
 areas a little cream of cream 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.310
 increasing as I go cooking 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.040
 what and this 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.110
 I'm going to mix 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.110
 I add a little salt 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.830
 to taste because afterwards we will try it 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.830
 new 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.030
 and black pepper 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:58.420
 we explain milk 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.930
 and with the help of cheese the cream of 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:05.470
 cream then we will get a cream one 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.380
 green sauce with which we will cover in 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.950
 this opportunity 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.480
 same car 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.480
 at the time of strict graphic 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.000
 here our green sauce for our 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.850
 coasts 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.180
 I'm going to take advantage of the fact that I'm with the 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:56.590
 more roles camera 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.590
 but knowing about vacation 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.150
 Well, we 're going to put this in the pot 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.969
 to cook milk 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:11.810
 we have more water 2 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:14.000
 you can increase a little cream of cream 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.350
 finish the green sauce 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.350
 we add olive present 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.640
 everyday 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.920
 4 starting the same people 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.920
 something a little more 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:56.399
 200 million 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.710
 broken brand 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.710
 It is accompanied by three
