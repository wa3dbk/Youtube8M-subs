00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.370
 hello and welcome to the chain a top 13 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.160
 today as the first video I will show you how do you make 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.029
 to warm up 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:10.799
 so for that 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:12.139
 you need 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.849
 cannes 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.179
 preferably two themes of the same fortune to jacques duquesne is 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.179
 different so 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.089
 you need 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.880
 of the strong 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.060
 for capillarity to foment alcohol 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.060
 of the coast of course 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:35.180
 a pair of scissors that will allow you 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.340
 the couple is obvious that a can that you are going to need 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.340
 to make Russian 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.080
 luxury rhymes that allows me - 2 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.830
 on the amount of alcohol that I do not eat hot it's not necessarily 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.870
 mandatory 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.870
 and a lighter of course for him 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.720
 once you have taken 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.720
 patriquin that you have cup and cut the two more cans 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.730
 we found 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.620
 complex 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.900
 a canning inculcate bring up to the standards 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.870
 when asked how she touches 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.610
 and our kms ass 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.130
 as you see who worse is a little bit 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.130
 in fact if this server the most like that it happens 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.820
 on the back a cone shape 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.860
 a sound that fit well in the water 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.610
 so I will take your cotton 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.590
 it's put in the bottom of the can 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.100
 without much packing 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.510
 it must be a little airy anyway 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.280
 xi has returned to color that will have a hard time mounting one like that 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.420
 understand 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.980
 your can 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.770
 which is of course 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.700
 if you put it 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.120
 you have to push it like that so 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.340
 all along 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.950
 the member supported 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.950
 you will find that soul with m 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.250
 he's doubly brothers while you see 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.430
 publicis always counts only one place on the podium so 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.940
 I perceived more than 6 3% after half a centimeter 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.779
 frank lesh with a fight 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:13.779
 and he has a big hole also with a fall but I'm a little character 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.989
 q what projects heavy damage caused 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.519
 so once the mind is over you have before you go 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.299
 find you with suspended sentence 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.109
 longer never again day 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.109
 so I show you how works 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:31.779
 I understand from school 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.889
 how much will they be in France it's like that 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.099
 Foucque ten centimeters at school 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.919
 so she is too much above 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.179
 the entrance more closely 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.179
 subway of my alcohol 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.489
 10 centiliters to transform more holy balsam sua general in the 30 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.489
 or 40 centilitres it depends 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.039
 are they dead 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.439
 to check on piece 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.919
 3 hours of calls 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.089
 during this little cup is what will heat the glue for the 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.969
 firm that equates the world 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:38.969
 so you're going to put a little bit of seaweed also two years 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.519
 more informations 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.519
 right after the right to smoke 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.469
 constantine 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:53.469
 we turn on 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:57.369
 and you will come and put your show on it 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:03.039
 I wanted to rot 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.439
 well no it happened in the balloon in the alcohol will go up 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.789
 the cup 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.800
 pearls the cotton inside we get out through the holes that was made 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.770
 on the world 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.770
 the study conducted in the fall of 2011 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.039
 it would be nice to start 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.370
 I show you 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.389
 let's take as an example 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.389
 we find m6 is warm 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:53.259
 so the 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.259
 then friday then 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.969
 I made a small road 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.810
 a kind of small 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.569
 how to say 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.599
 good notes during the week 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:07.599
 something to put on top 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.460
 a little France so lambres-the-douai flames but hey they are still 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.460
 present 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:24.349
 but it's 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.210
 asked for example 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.210
 I think you have to warm up 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.520
 it 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.120
