00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.400
 ae 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.799
 the fish in this period of Lent 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.920
 almost always present at the tables of 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.680
 families and to make this dish is not 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.210
 very difficult the fish can be made of 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.640
 many ways 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.060
 today we will learn how to make the 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.599
 fish meal to the delight and to form 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.790
 this dish is necessary the white sauce the 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.220
 mashed potatoes and bananas 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.449
 at first to make the white sauce is 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:45.110
 needed the onion margarine the garlic and 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:48.079
 milk wheat salt and sour cream 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.770
 first heat the margarine to the 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.829
 onion then the garlic the milk the wheat 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.800
 and they all wait a little bit to be 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.800
 always shifted in from one side to the other 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.649
 then just add the sour cream 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.830
 but beware this sour cream can not 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.259
 boil just that to complete the 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.350
 dish is also needed the banana 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.150
 it is sufficient to split four bananas in half and 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.790
 military in hot oil 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.340
 now let's go to the main one that is the fish 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.939
 in this dish the fish chosen was the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.939
 the pargo the seasoning is just lemon and salt 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:29.030
 I taste and then just the fillet of Parana 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.549
 fish with thread flour always in the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.390
 following sequence passes the 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.729
 the egg and then the egg is beaten 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.740
 just fry the fish fingers in the oil 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.840
 warm text that is well achieved 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.060

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.890
 other fish of preference and whatever is 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.799
 very feasible to make the dish can do not 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.270
