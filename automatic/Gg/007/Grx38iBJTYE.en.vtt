00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
on top picks own card I pick the ACE put

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.280 
on top picks own card I pick the ACE put
it<00:00:33.769> second<00:00:36.220> put<00:00:37.220> it<00:00:37.309> on<00:00:37.430> top<00:00:37.610> of<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:37.820> deck

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
it second put it on top of the deck

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.170 
it second put it on top of the deck
alright<00:00:39.290> you<00:00:39.470> can<00:00:39.500> do<00:00:39.739> it<00:00:39.860> you<00:00:40.670> could<00:00:40.790> do<00:00:40.909> my

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
alright you can do it you could do my

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.710 
alright you can do it you could do my
way<00:00:41.420> which<00:00:41.659> I<00:00:41.750> used<00:00:42.050> to<00:00:42.170> use<00:00:43.210> but<00:00:44.210> I<00:00:44.239> found<00:00:44.570> that

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
way which I used to use but I found that

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.740 
way which I used to use but I found that
it<00:00:44.870> makes<00:00:45.620> it<00:00:45.800> look<00:00:45.920> a<00:00:45.949> bit<00:00:46.040> obvious<00:00:46.629> when<00:00:47.629> you

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
it makes it look a bit obvious when you

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.689 
it makes it look a bit obvious when you
go<00:00:48.079> to<00:00:48.140> do<00:00:48.409> it<00:00:48.559> but<00:00:49.519> you<00:00:49.670> basically<00:00:51.040> take<00:00:52.040> if

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
go to do it but you basically take if

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.260 
go to do it but you basically take if
you<00:00:52.820> want<00:00:52.939> to<00:00:53.210> you<00:00:53.689> slunt<00:00:54.080> cards<00:00:54.619> so<00:00:55.309> that

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.590 

just<00:00:59.809> like<00:01:00.020> that

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.680 

so<00:01:03.170> that<00:01:03.350> it's<00:01:03.470> easier<00:01:03.740> to<00:01:03.770> grip<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:05.239> cards

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
so that it's easier to grip the cards

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.399 
so that it's easier to grip the cards
from<00:01:06.380> here<00:01:06.820> now

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.350 

I<00:01:10.499> used<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:11.729> grip<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.240> card<00:01:13.490> from<00:01:14.490> there

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.480 

take<00:01:17.900> it<00:01:18.110> slide<00:01:18.770> it<00:01:18.980> down<00:01:19.160> and<00:01:19.460> slide<00:01:20.060> it<00:01:20.390> off<00:01:20.540> a

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
take it slide it down and slide it off a

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.360 
take it slide it down and slide it off a
car<00:01:22.490> do<00:01:22.760> it<00:01:22.880> if<00:01:22.970> you<00:01:23.060> want<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.330> do<00:01:24.130> blardy<00:01:25.130> blar

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
car do it if you want to do blardy blar

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.950 
car do it if you want to do blardy blar
is<00:01:25.550> removed<00:01:25.940> here<00:01:26.270> very<00:01:26.570> nice<00:01:29.650> now

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.649 

you've<00:01:33.560> got<00:01:33.830> lots<00:01:34.580> of<00:01:34.790> ways<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.180> do<00:01:35.299> it<00:01:35.330> you<00:01:35.420> can

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
you've got lots of ways to do it you can

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.030 
you've got lots of ways to do it you can
do<00:01:35.810> my<00:01:36.020> way<00:01:36.260> which<00:01:36.799> is<00:01:38.200> this<00:01:39.200> is<00:01:39.560> how<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:39.770> want

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
do my way which is this is how you want

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.969 
do my way which is this is how you want
to<00:01:40.070> hold<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.400> cards<00:01:41.050> four<00:01:42.050> fingers<00:01:42.470> thumb<00:01:42.800> up

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
to hold the cards four fingers thumb up

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.990 
to hold the cards four fingers thumb up
there<00:01:44.290> if<00:01:45.290> you<00:01:45.409> find<00:01:45.619> that<00:01:45.830> easier<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.520> it

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
there if you find that easier and it

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.120 
there if you find that easier and it
doesn't<00:01:47.270> look<00:01:47.390> too<00:01:47.509> obvious<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.979> can

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
doesn't look too obvious to you you can

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.660 
doesn't look too obvious to you you can
use<00:01:49.280> it<00:01:49.460> but<00:01:50.649> since<00:01:51.649> after<00:01:52.369> a<00:01:52.430> little<00:01:52.550> while

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
use it but since after a little while

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.870 
use it but since after a little while

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.620 

with<00:02:32.810> more<00:02:33.170> speed<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.800> will<00:02:33.950> look<00:02:34.160> better<00:02:35.060> with

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
more speed and I just forgot something

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.990 
more speed and I just forgot something
