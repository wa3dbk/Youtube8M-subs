doesn't<00:03:27.269> work<00:03:27.360> for<00:03:27.480> them<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:27.840> then<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.410> put

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
doesn't work for them and then you put

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.310 
doesn't work for them and then you put
in<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.739> map<00:03:28.890> name<00:03:29.130> in<00:03:29.489> this<00:03:30.209> case<00:03:30.420> in<00:03:30.989> case<00:03:31.140> you

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
in a map name in this case in case you

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.820 
in a map name in this case in case you
forget<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:32.640> just<00:03:32.910> cancel<00:03:33.570> go<00:03:34.230> back<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.500> here

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
forget you just cancel go back to here

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.680 
forget you just cancel go back to here
and<00:03:35.100> then<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.370> can<00:03:35.519> even<00:03:35.730> run<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:35.910> console<00:03:36.510> here

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
and then you can even run a console here

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.940 
and then you can even run a console here
which<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:36.959> probably<00:03:37.260> easier<00:03:37.920> dev<00:03:38.580> map<00:03:38.820> it<00:03:39.030> and

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
which is probably easier dev map it and

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.670 
which is probably easier dev map it and
