00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 and hello to all friends with you again me and I 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.720
 promised today in today's video 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.960
 which I was right here tonight 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.830
 a couple of hours ago i promised i would do 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.880
 armor that will give a man 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.190
 any supersu 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.980
 superpowers will do strong 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.199
 cool and in general if going to 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.359
 full set of this armor and I did what 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.310
 promised 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.710
 Here I created an armor which if you 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.070
 put it all together which you will 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.040
 to give 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.360
 a whole bunch of buff that is, one of these 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.700
 subjects are generally at all 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.180
 meaningless but as soon as these four 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.070
 Subject I have pants and boots 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.590
 bib and helmet all come together 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.230
 on one person they give him a very 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.149
 great strength up fact to 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.070
 show you this power will demonstrate and 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.010
 Now I will call a bunch of zombies. I do nâ€™t know 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.260
 and knowing the sword to me is so hard style 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.789
 here on hard them now I will carry out all in 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.790
 15000 time set must not be set 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:05.010
 somehow no no but like that 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.950
 You see , I have the first night 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.909
 vision 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.610
 oh come on now long from 08 and 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.420
 defend the call the boss caused a whole 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.469
 a bunch of zombies 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.439
 and now let's go with them with all 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:20.810
 I can fight them for a long time 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.240
 as much as they want they can too 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.069
 struggling to be as much as you want him 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.619
 will not be firstly because this armor 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:31.219
 you secondly because I have given 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.530
 protection from and generally i'm very cool in this 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:35.509
 armor che there is considered a day boost and 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.060
 speed in case you have very little 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.590
 health then you can quickly run away or 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.289
 can you just like that 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.740
 maneuver around them and they are nothing 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.049
 not even 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.090
 do not have time to make them understand just 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:52.030
 die one after another and all I am here 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.039
 Of course it is not to collect 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.020
 fought zombies but in order to 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.479
 just do it because i like 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.829
 perform these different tasks here and you 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.130
 can you suggest me an idea for 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.110
 the following mechanism in the comments well 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.060
 let me take this first to start 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.530
 than watching the next one means that 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.480
 us here for team scoreboard couples 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.440
 torn out so have to get together 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.600
 scoreboard pairs is a dog al1 that is 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.549
 This is the name of the score bard add it with 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.639
 the damen type that is just the most common 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.220
 scoreboard and here we have curly 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:31.430
 as always I have everything 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.889
 interesting as you know you can clarify 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.109
 that is, when you add to release 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.739
 works can be further clarified which 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.510
 specific 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.420
 the player that is usually possible to sharpen 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.760
 assume that in radius 2 for example yes or 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.290
 some other way 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.209
 But in the case of the correspondent bards here you can 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.030
 all right at all clarify that just 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.220
 pipets can even go so far as if 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.410
 you have little health there you pipets 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.780
 comes here it means that we are here 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.450
 inventory it means here we will clarify 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.060
 the slot here we have specified additional 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.919
 tags ie display the name and so 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.300
 then we have with us he is only one 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:12.950
 this display name 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.770
 and all here with you legendary metal 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.060
 filmed that is to say the legendary helmet if with 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.980
 English lead i'm just not sure 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.710
 how will she be ok will she be 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.780
 work on it in Russian you if 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.260
 I would write here and here all the same 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.700
 only the vault and the inscription change here 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.090
 principle you can make this legendary 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.740
 scolded iron whatever but i took 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.570
 it renamed it diamond possible 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.130
 Refine ID to diamond only 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.120
 fit i mean it's all already on your 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.060
 discretion and if we have see yes 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.880
 we are added one by one to the flour and 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.850
 immediately cleared in some here from 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.770
 of these command sides here in this 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.110
 that is, she first commanded 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.140
 then the second third fourth adds 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.240
 here and if they had time to add everything if 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.460
 all the clothes are on us they all add 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.040
 what happens here is this team 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.870
 briskly japan action and then here from 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.340
 commands god clearing that is exactly 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.110
 here is a chain tyn tyn goes and 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.590
 these four command gods give us 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.209
 It is these effects that I hope 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.310
