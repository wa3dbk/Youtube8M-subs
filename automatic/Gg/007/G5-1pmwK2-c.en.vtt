00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
truly what happened the quarterback in

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.900 
truly what happened the quarterback in
the<00:04:22.440> center<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.979> ball<00:04:23.160> popped<00:04:23.460> up<00:04:23.729> and

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
the center of the ball popped up and

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.760 
the center of the ball popped up and
Katie<00:04:24.150> was<00:04:24.330> coming<00:04:24.720> through<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.139> he<00:04:25.560> just

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
Katie was coming through and he just

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.960 
Katie was coming through and he just
caught<00:04:25.979> it<00:04:26.130> in<00:04:26.190> midair<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.610> ran<00:04:26.789> it<00:04:26.910> right

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
caught it in midair and ran it right

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.820 
caught it in midair and ran it right
fast<00:04:27.419> everybody<00:04:27.930> for<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.169> touchdown

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
fast everybody for it touchdown

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.520 
fast everybody for it touchdown
we<00:04:29.490> had<00:04:29.729> a<00:04:29.760> stun<00:04:30.180> on<00:04:30.389> and<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:32.400> center<00:04:32.850> was

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
we had a stun on and the center was

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.730 
we had a stun on and the center was
slower<00:04:34.530> than<00:04:34.680> I<00:04:35.010> was<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.810> as<00:04:36.810> he<00:04:37.110> was<00:04:37.440> trying

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
slower than I was and as he was trying

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.529 
slower than I was and as he was trying
to<00:04:37.919> listen<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.639> the<00:04:39.210> quarterbacks<00:04:40.099> cadence<00:04:41.099> I

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
to listen to the quarterbacks cadence I

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.879 
to listen to the quarterbacks cadence I
think<00:04:42.539> the<00:04:42.660> quarterback<00:04:43.200> was<00:04:43.410> trying<00:04:43.740> to

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
think the quarterback was trying to

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.890 
think the quarterback was trying to
change<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.460> play<00:04:44.700> well<00:04:45.030> anyway<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.599> center

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
change the play well anyway the center

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.830 
change the play well anyway the center
snapped<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.500> ball<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:47.479> the<00:04:48.479> quarterback

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
snapped the ball and the quarterback

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.469 
snapped the ball and the quarterback
kind<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.590> fumbled<00:04:50.039> it<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.400> instead<00:04:51.210> of<00:04:51.270> going

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
kind of fumbled it and instead of going

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.379 
kind of fumbled it and instead of going
in<00:04:51.750> there<00:04:51.900> just<00:04:52.289> kind<00:04:52.470> of<00:04:52.560> fell<00:04:52.889> over<00:04:53.340> and<00:04:53.610> as

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
in there just kind of fell over and as

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.550 
in there just kind of fell over and as
it<00:04:54.630> was<00:04:54.780> falling<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:55.710> looked<00:04:56.400> over<00:04:56.580> and<00:04:56.880> thought

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
it was falling I looked over and thought

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.700

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
hands and of course I knew what to do

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.100 
hands and of course I knew what to do
