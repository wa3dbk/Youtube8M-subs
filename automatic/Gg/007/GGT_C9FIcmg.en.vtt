00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.210
 while I'm using a cane 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.060
 so points to 90 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.269
 I am only a fine enough 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.049
 with a small capacity reel 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.779
 in europe these helpers are proud of 26 hundredths 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.079
 we will fish so live a little bit the same technique fishing a shock match 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.699
 that is to say, without break between the body of the low-end, so without 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.839
 scenario 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.980
 for this the bank of editing techniques not montreuil after 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.980
 for now yes I do not believe it 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.529
 so we listened to all the times 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.220
 I think 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.030
 so here you see I cut all the parts I keep a place and a 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.030
 particular contribution made subsequently why 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.870
 the apts I dissect on the side it's going to be to open it 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.900
 easily 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.420
 one hundred and thirty minutes 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.420
 we find exactly 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.620
 that moment you take me a medium like that you pull slowly 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.000
 and killer the shell that will lift 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 and you looked at all the actors of the toad 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.520
 so that makes you a hard tray of soup 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.520
 with all the party so she likes doing work 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.890
 so for that I use a delicatessen 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.060
 with a little cat 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.060
 so of course you think 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.020
 the acupuncturist I told you we'd have a dough we'll try to pass 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.510
 dough 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.510
 to be able to do the most natural possible 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.670
 3 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.040
 so there now passed between tramain 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.660
 so you see we have the troops so exceeds the current cut just now 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.660
 we will use them to pass the cube 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:36.019
 here you see what you see a little what it will give 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.339
 and now we will choose between soul without 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.569
 depending on the size of our work 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.569
 there is still crab who knew how to play fast 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:45.949
 we will issue 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.949
 a hook of 300 novaled actually 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.619
 that we will go through the blood 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.909
 day by six other girls so the canucks to follow in case shoot 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.290
 in a dish taking three parts in a which will fly for the time our 

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:09.289
 control 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.609
 it is necessary to dissect 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.609
 here now and not secure 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:23.649
 after 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.909
 word 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.479
 for me she
