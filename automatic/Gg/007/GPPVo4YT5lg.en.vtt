it most likely I don't know I want to do

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:52.790 
it most likely I don't know I want to do
something<00:02:52.200> different

another<00:02:53.730> house<00:02:53.970> would<00:02:54.180> be<00:02:54.269> kind<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.480> boring<00:02:54.920> we

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920

just did a church here nothing too big
it's<00:02:59.640> gonna<00:02:59.700> be<00:02:59.819> something<00:03:00.090> small<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.810> probably

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
it's gonna be something small I probably

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.840 
it's gonna be something small I probably
would<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:01.980> look<00:03:02.280> up<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:04.670> picture<00:03:05.670> off<00:03:05.819> the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
would just look up a picture off the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.640 
would just look up a picture off the
internet<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.630> just<00:03:06.660> use<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.590> for

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
internet and just use that for

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.259 
internet and just use that for
inspiration<00:03:08.489> but<00:03:08.519> if<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.850> know<00:03:08.970> if<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.180> know

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
inspiration but if you know if you know

someone else's video that maybe has a

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.860 
someone else's video that maybe has a
really<00:03:12.150> good<00:03:12.300> design<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.720> will<00:03:13.380> look<00:03:14.160> at<00:03:14.400> it

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
really good design I will look at it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.240 
really good design I will look at it
maybe<00:03:15.870> try<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.290> do<00:03:16.380> something<00:03:16.800> some<00:03:16.980> sort<00:03:17.010> of

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
maybe try and do something some sort of

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.720 
maybe try and do something some sort of
a<00:03:18.170> near<00:03:19.170> replica<00:03:19.709> from<00:03:19.890> memory<00:03:20.340> or<00:03:20.489> something

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
a near replica from memory or something

that<00:03:37.890> was<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.160> little<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:39.360> was<00:03:39.510> based<00:03:39.750> off<00:03:40.110> of<00:03:40.140> a

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
that was a little it was based off of a

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.729 
that was a little it was based off of a
picture<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:42.739> I<00:03:44.720> didn't<00:03:45.720> do<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.049> exactly<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.620> had

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
the picture had it anyway I just sort of

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.340 
the picture had it anyway I just sort of
did<00:03:49.200> my<00:03:49.350> own<00:03:49.470> thing<00:03:49.500> with<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:51.390> that<00:03:51.810> the

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
did my own thing with that and that the

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.190 
did my own thing with that and that the
Scarlet<00:03:53.720> tower<00:03:54.720> from<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.620> couple<00:03:56.100> episodes<00:03:56.280> ago

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
Scarlet tower from a couple episodes ago

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.509 
Scarlet tower from a couple episodes ago
again<00:03:58.200> same<00:03:58.530> sort<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.799> thing<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.190> just<00:03:59.370> sort<00:03:59.489> of

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
again same sort of thing I just sort of

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.690 
again same sort of thing I just sort of
did<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.820> from<00:03:59.970> memory<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.980> had<00:04:01.980> an<00:04:02.100> idea<00:04:02.430> what

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
did it from memory and had an idea what

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.729 
did it from memory and had an idea what
I<00:04:02.730> wanted<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.239> look<00:04:03.359> like<00:04:03.630> sort<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.109> you<00:04:04.709> know

I wanted to look like sort of you know
this<00:04:05.070> that's<00:04:05.489> what<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.760> point<00:04:06.000> of<00:04:06.120> these

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
this that's what the point of these

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.060 
this that's what the point of these
videos<00:04:06.540> are<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.019> why<00:04:07.170> people<00:04:07.530> think<00:04:07.680> videos

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
videos are and why people think videos

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.039 
videos are and why people think videos
like<00:04:08.280> this<00:04:08.519> kind<00:04:09.329> of<00:04:09.420> inspire<00:04:09.750> other<00:04:09.989> people

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
like this kind of inspire other people

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.430 
like this kind of inspire other people
to<00:04:10.380> make<00:04:10.859> stuff<00:04:11.370> on<00:04:11.549> their<00:04:11.670> own<00:04:12.320> because<00:04:13.320> you

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
to make stuff on their own because you

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.509 
to make stuff on their own because you
may<00:04:13.560> look<00:04:13.799> at<00:04:13.920> this<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.070> go<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.340> know<00:04:14.430> what

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
may look at this and go you know what

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.219 
may look at this and go you know what
this<00:04:15.030> might<00:04:15.239> actually<00:04:15.420> look<00:04:15.780> good<00:04:15.989> with

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
but I mean if I ever did I could always

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.730 
but I mean if I ever did I could always
just<00:06:58.949> generate<00:06:59.340> another<00:06:59.550> with<00:06:59.759> another

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740 
just generate another with another

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.379 
just generate another with another
another<00:07:01.740> large<00:07:02.070> landmass<00:07:02.460> and<00:07:02.639> just<00:07:03.000> kind<00:07:03.360> of

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:03.389 
another large landmass and just kind of

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.900 
another large landmass and just kind of
add<00:07:03.570> it<00:07:03.720> on<00:07:03.870> so<00:07:04.590> it<00:07:04.620> all<00:07:04.800> being<00:07:05.039> one<00:07:05.340> thing<00:07:05.610> I

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:05.910 
add it on so it all being one thing I

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.450 
add it on so it all being one thing I
had<00:07:06.630> a<00:07:06.660> little<00:07:06.930> build<00:07:07.139> some<00:07:07.710> little<00:07:07.889> windows

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 
had a little build some little windows

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.520 
had a little build some little windows
here<00:07:08.729> with<00:07:10.220> as<00:07:11.220> you<00:07:11.340> can<00:07:11.460> see<00:07:11.580> here<00:07:11.729> the<00:07:11.910> stairs

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:12.530 
here with as you can see here the stairs

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.499 
here with as you can see here the stairs
that's<00:07:13.530> sort<00:07:13.740> of<00:07:13.770> an<00:07:13.889> optional<00:07:14.370> thing<00:07:14.639> just

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:15.509

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:17.060 
that's sort of an optional thing just
maybe<00:07:15.900> because<00:07:16.229> the<00:07:16.320> walls<00:07:16.530> were<00:07:16.740> looking<00:07:17.009> a

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.070 
maybe because the walls were looking a

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.210 
maybe because the walls were looking a
little<00:07:17.280> boring<00:07:17.610> at<00:07:17.910> some<00:07:18.120> parts<00:07:18.509> so<00:07:19.470> I<00:07:19.500> added

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 
little boring at some parts so I added

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.400 
little boring at some parts so I added
and<00:07:20.370> here's<00:07:20.789> like<00:07:21.000> sort<00:07:21.240> of<00:07:21.300> the<00:07:21.389> last<00:07:22.699> tour<00:07:23.699> I

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 
didn't actually show this in the

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.279 
didn't actually show this in the
building<00:07:26.880> of<00:07:27.030> it<00:07:27.120> but<00:07:27.330> you<00:07:27.750> can<00:07:27.870> add<00:07:27.990> some<00:07:28.259> of

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:28.289 
building of it but you can add some of

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:31.219 
building of it but you can add some of
those<00:07:28.440> things<00:07:28.860> I've<00:07:29.160> had<00:07:29.370> those<00:07:30.229> cobblestone

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:31.229 
those things I've had those cobblestone

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:33.320 
those things I've had those cobblestone
fences<00:07:31.770> on<00:07:31.919> the<00:07:32.009> corners<00:07:32.490> that's<00:07:32.669> an<00:07:32.849> optional

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:33.330 
fences on the corners that's an optional

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.879 
fences on the corners that's an optional
thing<00:07:33.509> you<00:07:33.630> don't<00:07:33.750> need<00:07:33.990> to<00:07:34.139> do<00:07:34.259> that<00:07:34.470> but<00:07:34.860> uh

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:34.889 
thing you don't need to do that but uh

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:37.610 
thing you don't need to do that but uh
you<00:07:35.789> could<00:07:35.910> do<00:07:36.000> that<00:07:36.120> anywhere<00:07:36.449> in<00:07:36.509> here<00:07:36.840> those

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 
you could do that anywhere in here those

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.800 
you could do that anywhere in here those
uh<00:07:38.060> to<00:07:39.060> give<00:07:39.180> it<00:07:39.300> a<00:07:39.389> little<00:07:39.479> bit<00:07:39.660> of<00:07:39.720> a

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:39.810 
uh to give it a little bit of a

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:40.999 
uh to give it a little bit of a
different<00:07:40.110> look<00:07:40.139> even<00:07:40.500> in<00:07:40.560> the<00:07:40.650> front<00:07:40.860> you

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:41.009 
different look even in the front you

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:42.379 
different look even in the front you
could<00:07:41.220> have<00:07:41.310> done<00:07:41.460> it<00:07:41.580> I<00:07:41.729> didn't<00:07:41.970> do<00:07:42.060> it<00:07:42.180> there

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:42.389 
could have done it I didn't do it there

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:44.390 
could have done it I didn't do it there
I<00:07:42.630> guess<00:07:42.960> I<00:07:43.080> could<00:07:43.229> have<00:07:43.349> done<00:07:43.440> it<00:07:43.500> there<00:07:43.710> but<00:07:44.310> I

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 
I guess I could have done it there but I

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.909 
I guess I could have done it there but I
guess<00:07:44.520> it's<00:07:44.699> it<00:07:44.880> really<00:07:44.930> I<00:07:45.930> guess<00:07:46.710> I'll<00:07:46.830> see

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919
