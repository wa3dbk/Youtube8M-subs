and I say is cruise control which is
just<00:01:44.030> a<00:01:44.119> matter<00:01:44.240> of<00:01:44.390> clicking<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.500> switch

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
just a matter of clicking the switch

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.740 
just a matter of clicking the switch
down<00:01:45.920> here<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.219> it<00:01:46.280> tells<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:46.670> appear<00:01:47.119> unlike

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
still in front of me and that's very

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.479 
still in front of me and that's very
good<00:02:13.819> very<00:02:14.150> sensible<00:02:14.980> seating<00:02:15.980> position<00:02:16.340> I

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
good very sensible seating position I

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.020 
good very sensible seating position I
would<00:02:16.790> dare<00:02:17.299> say<00:02:17.630> that<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:18.890> disabled<00:02:19.760> driver

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
would dare say that a disabled driver

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.089 
would dare say that a disabled driver
would<00:02:20.299> find<00:02:20.540> this<00:02:20.750> car<00:02:21.079> very<00:02:21.319> comfortable<00:02:21.920> I

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
would find this car very comfortable I

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.949 
would find this car very comfortable I
would<00:02:22.610> also<00:02:22.760> say<00:02:23.030> people<00:02:23.360> with<00:02:23.450> back<00:02:23.660> problems

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
would also say people with back problems

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.490 
would also say people with back problems
or<00:02:24.410> leg<00:02:24.829> problems<00:02:25.400> would<00:02:25.579> find<00:02:25.849> this<00:02:26.000> very

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
or leg problems would find this very

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.470 
or leg problems would find this very
comfortable<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.590> sit<00:02:27.769> in

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
comfortable to sit in

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.759 
comfortable to sit in
mainly<00:02:29.480> because<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.690> its<00:02:29.900> seat<00:02:30.140> position<00:02:30.590> I

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
mainly because of its seat position I

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.160 
mainly because of its seat position I
have<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.610> say<00:02:31.790> as<00:02:31.940> well<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.450> for<00:02:32.720> range

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
have to say as well that the for range

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.199 
have to say as well that the for range
would<00:02:33.530> be<00:02:33.590> very<00:02:33.890> similar<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:34.670> galaxy<00:02:35.150> and

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
would be very similar so the galaxy and

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.089 
would be very similar so the galaxy and
the<00:02:35.360> s<00:02:35.480> fact<00:02:35.780> would<00:02:36.019> have<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.349> same<00:02:36.380> kind<00:02:36.920> of

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
the s fact would have that same kind of

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.430 
the s fact would have that same kind of
high<00:02:37.519> up<00:02:37.730> seating<00:02:38.060> position<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:38.989> works<00:02:39.230> very

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
high up seating position that works very

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.930 
high up seating position that works very
well

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
well

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.180 
well
ok<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.000> self<00:02:41.450> Park<00:02:41.810> is<00:02:42.079> a<00:02:42.620> little<00:02:42.829> feature<00:02:42.980> this

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
ok so self Park is a little feature this

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.640 
ok so self Park is a little feature this
car<00:02:43.459> automatically<00:02:44.269> does<00:02:44.629> when<00:02:45.290> I<00:02:45.319> gonna<00:02:45.470> do

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
car automatically does when I gonna do

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.199 
car automatically does when I gonna do
is<00:02:45.769> try<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:45.980> find<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.370> space<00:02:46.579> here<00:02:46.880> really

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
is try and find the space here really

00:02:47.209 --> 00:03:02.280 
is try and find the space here really
quick<00:02:47.859> it's<00:02:48.859> found<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.190> spot

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.840 

now<00:03:03.290> I'm<00:03:03.440> reversing<00:03:03.770> backwards<00:03:04.370> into<00:03:04.610> space

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
now I'm reversing backwards into space

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.990 
now I'm reversing backwards into space
tarik<00:03:05.210> goes<00:03:06.430> toe<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.460> toe<00:03:07.730> thank<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.600> oh<00:03:08.980> yeah
