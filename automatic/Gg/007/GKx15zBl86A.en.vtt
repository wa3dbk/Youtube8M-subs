00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
diet gotcha the idea is very simple they

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.770 
diet gotcha the idea is very simple they
believe<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:32.910> diet<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.390> if<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.600> take

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
believe in this diet that if you take

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.290 
believe in this diet that if you take
HCG<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.620> will<00:00:34.770> mobilize<00:00:35.250> your<00:00:35.280> fat<00:00:35.700> stores<00:00:36.000> so

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
HCG you will mobilize your fat stores so

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.150 
HCG you will mobilize your fat stores so
you<00:00:36.360> decrease<00:00:36.719> your<00:00:36.750> fat<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.380> nourish<00:00:38.040> your

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
you decrease your fat and nourish your

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.799 
you decrease your fat and nourish your
body<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.579> way<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:38.850> also<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.329> calorie

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
body that way but also you calorie

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.990 
body that way but also you calorie
restrict<00:00:40.230> yourself<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.590> 500<00:00:41.520> calories<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> day

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
restrict yourself to 500 calories a day

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.600 
restrict yourself to 500 calories a day
so<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:42.899> an<00:00:42.989> extremely<00:00:43.559> calorie<00:00:44.129> restrictive

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
so it's an extremely calorie restrictive

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
we have an example it comes in several

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.660 
we have an example it comes in several
forms<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.899> H<00:00:52.140> run<00:00:52.620> EG<00:00:53.070> right<00:00:53.430> yeah

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
forms this H run EG right yeah

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.790 
forms this H run EG right yeah
absolutely<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:55.140> year<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.530> something

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
absolutely so so this year is something

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.260 
absolutely so so this year is something
and<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> these<00:00:56.610> are<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> droplets

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
and this is the these are the droplets

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.970 
and this is the these are the droplets
so<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.809> like<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> little<00:00:58.050> dropper<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.800> don't
