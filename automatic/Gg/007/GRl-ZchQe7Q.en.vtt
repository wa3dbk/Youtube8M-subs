00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.629 
we react after the girl you know it's
not<00:02:26.720> easy<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:27.109> consider<00:02:27.500> girl<00:02:27.680> away<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.100> to

not easy to consider girl away and to

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:32.080 
not easy to consider girl away and to
