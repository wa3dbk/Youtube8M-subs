significance of how essential it is to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.710 
significance of how essential it is to
have<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> light<00:01:11.670> set<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.060> wheels<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.600> how

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
performance in a wheel set but it's not

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.240 
performance in a wheel set but it's not
the<00:01:53.070> only<00:01:53.240> key<00:01:54.260> so<00:01:55.260> there<00:01:55.800> has<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.130> a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the only key so there has to be a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.570 
the only key so there has to be a
balance<00:01:56.490> between<00:01:56.909> light<00:01:57.659> weight<00:01:57.960> and

of<00:02:39.780> weight<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:39.900> performed<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.830> mean<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.130> just<00:02:41.160> knew

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
of weight I performed I mean I just knew

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.490 
of weight I performed I mean I just knew
but<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.790> hate<00:02:41.970> perform<00:02:42.330> yeah<00:02:42.510> yeah<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.080> can<00:02:43.200> get

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
but I hate perform yeah yeah you can get

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.729 
but I hate perform yeah yeah you can get
new<00:02:43.890> wheels<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.489> are<00:02:44.519> not<00:02:44.790> necessarily

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
new wheels that are not necessarily

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.380 
new wheels that are not necessarily
high-end<00:02:47.900> yes<00:02:48.900> that's<00:02:49.140> true<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:50.489> weight<00:02:51.060> of

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
high-end yes that's true the weight of

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.229 
high-end yes that's true the weight of
the<00:02:51.510> wheels<00:02:51.780> actually<00:02:52.290> counts<00:02:52.769> double<00:02:53.239> the

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
the wheels actually counts double the

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.910 
the wheels actually counts double the
weight<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.630> everything<00:02:55.350> love<00:02:55.530> will<00:02:55.680> almost

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
weight of everything love will almost

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.819 
weight of everything love will almost
double<00:02:56.480> if<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.660> start<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.410> look<00:02:58.560> at<00:02:58.709> the

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
double if you start to look at the

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.289 
double if you start to look at the
energy<00:02:59.130> equations<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.350> rotating<00:03:01.350> mass<00:03:02.299> is

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
energy equations the rotating mass is

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.819 
energy equations the rotating mass is
counted<00:03:03.840> twice<00:03:04.170> in<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> energy<00:03:05.010> equations<00:03:06.829> so

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
counted twice in the energy equations so

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.310 
counted twice in the energy equations so
and<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.310> means<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:09.180> weight<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.079> wheels

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
and that means the weight of the wheels

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.569 
and that means the weight of the wheels
is<00:03:10.820> incredibly<00:03:11.820> important<00:03:13.310> most<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.489> the

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
is incredibly important most of the

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.000 
is incredibly important most of the
weight<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:14.940> wheels<00:03:15.180> is<00:03:15.510> out<00:03:16.320> of<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.769> rim

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
weight of the wheels is out of the rim

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.110 
weight of the wheels is out of the rim
and<00:03:17.630> that's<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.900> part<00:03:19.079> that's<00:03:19.200> rotating<00:03:20.120> the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
and that's the part that's rotating the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.750 
and that's the part that's rotating the
fastest<00:03:21.810> and

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
fastest and

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.809 
fastest and
has<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.689> most<00:03:23.930> inertia<00:03:24.290> but<00:03:25.159> we<00:03:25.370> were<00:03:25.430> talking

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
has the most inertia but we were talking

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.670 
has the most inertia but we were talking
earlier<00:03:25.939> I<00:03:26.360> guess<00:03:26.750> we've<00:03:26.930> been<00:03:27.230> talking<00:03:27.560> here

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
earlier I guess we've been talking here

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.080 
earlier I guess we've been talking here
for<00:03:27.829> a<00:03:27.860> while<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.310> we<00:03:28.579> were<00:03:28.670> talking<00:03:28.819> earlier

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
for a while and we were talking earlier

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.300 
for a while and we were talking earlier
how<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:29.810> you<00:03:30.230> know<00:03:30.260> when<00:03:30.560> we<00:03:30.739> used<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:31.099> race<00:03:31.280> a

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
how and you know when we used to race a

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.300 
how and you know when we used to race a
lot<00:03:31.610> you<00:03:32.299> had<00:03:32.480> your<00:03:32.780> pair<00:03:33.110> of<00:03:33.260> racing<00:03:34.069> wheels

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
lot you had your pair of racing wheels

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.759 
lot you had your pair of racing wheels
and<00:03:34.640> you<00:03:34.909> have<00:03:35.090> your<00:03:35.269> training<00:03:35.689> wheels<00:03:35.810> and

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
and you have your training wheels and

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.500 
and you have your training wheels and
when<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.069> put<00:03:37.280> on<00:03:37.400> those<00:03:37.610> racing<00:03:38.090> wheels<00:03:38.299> i

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
when you put on those racing wheels i

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.509 
when you put on those racing wheels i
mean<00:03:38.659> i<00:03:38.780> remember<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:39.440> felt<00:03:39.769> like<00:03:40.129> you<00:03:40.370> know

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
mean i remember you felt like you know

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.330 
mean i remember you felt like you know
34<00:03:41.450> miles<00:03:41.659> an<00:03:41.810> hour<00:03:41.900> faster<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:42.829> were<00:03:43.010> and

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
34 miles an hour faster and you were and

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.210 
34 miles an hour faster and you were and
you<00:03:43.370> were<00:03:43.670> anywhere<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.870> you<00:03:45.019> were<00:03:45.200> but<00:03:45.769> the

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
you were anywhere and you were but the

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.729 
you were anywhere and you were but the
reason<00:03:46.400> we<00:03:46.700> did<00:03:46.909> that<00:03:46.940> is<00:03:47.360> because<00:03:47.690> they<00:03:48.680> were

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
reason we did that is because they were

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.740 
reason we did that is because they were
so<00:03:49.069> delicate<00:03:49.340> you<00:03:49.819> couldn't<00:03:50.180> train<00:03:50.450> on<00:03:50.599> him

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
so delicate you couldn't train on him

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.710 
so delicate you couldn't train on him
all<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.049> time<00:03:51.079> um<00:03:51.950> he<00:03:52.670> had<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.970> protect<00:03:53.420> them

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
all the time um he had to protect them

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.680 
all the time um he had to protect them
and<00:03:53.900> only<00:03:54.230> use<00:03:54.590> them<00:03:54.890> for<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.549> race<00:03:55.730> because

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
and only use them for the race because

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.800 
and only use them for the race because
they<00:03:57.319> didn't<00:03:57.680> last<00:03:57.859> that<00:03:58.040> long<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:59.390> they<00:03:59.750> were

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
they didn't last that long and they were

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.229 
they didn't last that long and they were
delicate<00:04:00.409> and<00:04:00.620> you<00:04:01.190> could<00:04:01.370> easily<00:04:01.549> damaged

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
delicate and you could easily damaged

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.420 
delicate and you could easily damaged
him<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:02.599> they<00:04:02.959> were<00:04:03.019> very<00:04:03.109> expensive<00:04:03.739> right

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
him and they were very expensive right

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.809 
him and they were very expensive right
and<00:04:04.700> so<00:04:05.329> we<00:04:05.870> keep<00:04:06.349> them<00:04:06.620> protected<00:04:06.859> just<00:04:07.549> for

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
and so we keep them protected just for

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.460 
and so we keep them protected just for
the<00:04:07.909> race<00:04:08.060> but<00:04:08.569> man<00:04:08.870> did<00:04:09.079> they<00:04:09.139> make<00:04:09.440> a

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
the race but man did they make a

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.199 
the race but man did they make a
difference<00:04:09.950> oh<00:04:10.069> you'd<00:04:10.310> put<00:04:10.549> him<00:04:10.670> on<00:04:10.790> just<00:04:11.060> for

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
difference oh you'd put him on just for

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.960 
difference oh you'd put him on just for
that<00:04:11.359> race<00:04:11.599> he<00:04:11.840> got<00:04:12.200> to<00:04:12.290> warm<00:04:12.980> up<00:04:13.159> and<00:04:13.430> it<00:04:13.700> you

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
that race he got to warm up and it you

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.970 
that race he got to warm up and it you
felt<00:04:14.329> so<00:04:14.870> definitely<00:04:15.230> i'd<00:04:15.349> first<00:04:15.620> like<00:04:15.769> you

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
felt so definitely i'd first like you

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.140 
felt so definitely i'd first like you
were<00:04:16.070> saying<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.370> felt<00:04:16.669> a<00:04:16.789> little<00:04:16.910> weird

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
were saying you felt a little weird

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.330 
were saying you felt a little weird
because<00:04:17.479> they<00:04:17.780> were<00:04:17.959> so<00:04:18.229> light<00:04:18.620> so<00:04:18.680> you<00:04:19.100> for<00:04:19.280> a

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
because they were so light so you for a

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.879 
because they were so light so you for a
little<00:04:19.519> swim<00:04:20.299> occurs<00:04:20.750> yeah<00:04:20.959> yeah<00:04:21.260> you<00:04:21.590> felt<00:04:21.769> a

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
little swim occurs yeah yeah you felt a

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.620 
little swim occurs yeah yeah you felt a
little<00:04:22.010> squirrely<00:04:22.370> because<00:04:22.910> they<00:04:23.210> don't<00:04:23.510> have

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
little squirrely because they don't have

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.110 
little squirrely because they don't have
the<00:04:24.169> inertia<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.250> that<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:28.120> gyroscopic

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
the inertia and that the gyroscopic

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.320 
the inertia and that the gyroscopic
effect<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:30.020> keep<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:31.030> bike<00:04:32.440> slowed<00:04:33.440> down<00:04:33.740> and

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
effect to keep that bike slowed down and

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.450 
effect to keep that bike slowed down and
you<00:04:35.330> could<00:04:36.020> turn<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.740> handlebars<00:04:37.070> very

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
you could turn the handlebars very

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.820 
you could turn the handlebars very
quickly<00:04:37.789> because<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.840> gyroscopic<00:04:39.680> effect

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
quickly because the gyroscopic effect

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.310 
quickly because the gyroscopic effect
was<00:04:40.280> very<00:04:40.849> reduced<00:04:41.270> because<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.900> weight<00:04:42.080> was

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
was very reduced because the weight was

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.879 
was very reduced because the weight was
very<00:04:42.740> reduced<00:04:43.130> and<00:04:43.780> they<00:04:44.780> felt<00:04:45.080> funny<00:04:45.680> at

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
very reduced and they felt funny at

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.800 
very reduced and they felt funny at
first<00:04:45.919> you<00:04:46.310> had<00:04:46.430> to<00:04:46.520> get<00:04:46.669> used<00:04:46.940> to<00:04:47.180> handling<00:04:47.690> a

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
first you had to get used to handling a

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.750 
first you had to get used to handling a
bike<00:04:48.070> with<00:04:49.070> such<00:04:49.370> low

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
bike with such low

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.820 
bike with such low
gyroscopic<00:04:52.760> effect<00:04:52.940> in<00:04:53.330> the<00:04:53.450> wheels<00:04:53.660> but<00:04:54.110> it

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
gyroscopic effect in the wheels but it

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.860 
gyroscopic effect in the wheels but it
it<00:04:55.580> would<00:04:55.760> always<00:04:56.000> come<00:04:56.180> back<00:04:56.330> very<00:04:56.600> quickly

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
it would always come back very quickly

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.440 
it would always come back very quickly
after<00:04:57.560> you<00:04:57.830> warmed<00:04:58.070> up<00:04:58.280> oh<00:04:58.550> yeah<00:04:59.000> you<00:04:59.330> were

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
after you warmed up oh yeah you were

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.330 
after you warmed up oh yeah you were
ready<00:04:59.690> together<00:04:59.960> we're<00:05:00.380> ready<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.650> go<00:05:00.920> and<00:05:01.070> boy

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
ready together we're ready to go and boy

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.570 
ready together we're ready to go and boy
they<00:05:01.700> felt<00:05:02.000> good<00:05:02.210> so<00:05:02.870> but<00:05:03.500> I<00:05:03.680> mean<00:05:04.160> I<00:05:04.190> really

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
they felt good so but I mean I really

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.950 
they felt good so but I mean I really
want<00:05:04.790> to<00:05:04.880> make<00:05:05.180> sure<00:05:05.210> that<00:05:05.390> everybody<00:05:05.780> gets

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
want to make sure that everybody gets

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.770 
want to make sure that everybody gets
the<00:05:06.350> importance<00:05:06.860> of<00:05:07.070> lightness<00:05:07.760> as<00:05:08.030> well<00:05:08.600> as

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
the importance of lightness as well as

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.930 
the importance of lightness as well as
durability<00:05:09.250> because<00:05:10.250> if<00:05:10.460> you're<00:05:10.640> going<00:05:10.880> to

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
durability because if you're going to

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.240 
durability because if you're going to
spend<00:05:11.180> a<00:05:11.360> bunch<00:05:11.720> of<00:05:11.870> money<00:05:11.930> on<00:05:12.170> anything<00:05:12.830> on

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
spend a bunch of money on anything on

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.570 
spend a bunch of money on anything on
your<00:05:13.370> bike<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:14.390> really<00:05:15.350> really<00:05:15.680> think<00:05:15.890> that<00:05:16.550> you

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
your bike I really really think that you

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.970 
your bike I really really think that you
should<00:05:16.940> not<00:05:17.570> overlook<00:05:17.930> getting<00:05:18.590> a<00:05:18.680> really

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
should not overlook getting a really

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.070 
should not overlook getting a really
good<00:05:19.130> set<00:05:19.490> of<00:05:19.520> wheels<00:05:19.790> and<00:05:20.030> it's<00:05:20.360> not<00:05:20.600> just

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
good set of wheels and it's not just

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.750 
good set of wheels and it's not just
lightness<00:05:21.740> there<00:05:21.950> has<00:05:22.130> to<00:05:22.370> be<00:05:22.400> a<00:05:22.520> balance

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
lightness there has to be a balance

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.730 
lightness there has to be a balance
between<00:05:23.350> lightness<00:05:24.350> and<00:05:24.560> stiffness<00:05:25.460> and<00:05:26.740> you

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
between lightness and stiffness and you

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.590 
between lightness and stiffness and you
know<00:05:27.830> this<00:05:28.040> is<00:05:28.070> this<00:05:28.610> is<00:05:28.820> a<00:05:28.850> something<00:05:29.420> that

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
know this is this is a something that

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.930 
know this is this is a something that
every<00:05:30.290> wheel<00:05:30.650> company<00:05:31.010> is<00:05:31.310> going<00:05:31.520> through

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
every wheel company is going through

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.640 
every wheel company is going through
they<00:05:32.180> have<00:05:32.330> to<00:05:32.480> make<00:05:32.660> these<00:05:32.840> these<00:05:33.170> decisions

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
they have to make these these decisions

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.920 
they have to make these these decisions
one<00:05:34.160> against<00:05:34.610> the<00:05:34.670> other<00:05:34.790> you<00:05:35.510> can<00:05:35.690> make<00:05:35.900> a

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
one against the other you can make a

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.140 
one against the other you can make a
wheel<00:05:36.230> too<00:05:36.800> light<00:05:37.070> to<00:05:37.100> the<00:05:37.460> point<00:05:37.730> where<00:05:37.940> it's

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
wheel too light to the point where it's

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.300 
wheel too light to the point where it's
not<00:05:38.450> durable<00:05:38.900> enough<00:05:39.110> it's<00:05:39.590> not<00:05:39.800> stiff<00:05:40.190> enough

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
not durable enough it's not stiff enough

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.100 
not durable enough it's not stiff enough
and<00:05:40.790> you're<00:05:40.940> soaking<00:05:41.420> up<00:05:41.510> so<00:05:41.780> much<00:05:41.930> energy

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
and you're soaking up so much energy

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.070 
and you're soaking up so much energy
trying<00:05:42.800> to<00:05:43.070> make<00:05:43.250> it<00:05:43.400> go<00:05:43.640> that<00:05:44.419> even<00:05:44.960> though

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
trying to make it go that even though

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.960 
trying to make it go that even though
it's<00:05:45.260> real<00:05:45.590> light<00:05:45.830> and<00:05:46.130> on<00:05:46.340> paper<00:05:46.610> it<00:05:46.940> looks

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
it's real light and on paper it looks

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.510 
it's real light and on paper it looks
really<00:05:47.330> good<00:05:47.630> it's<00:05:48.380> not<00:05:48.680> a<00:05:48.740> high-performance

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
really good it's not a high-performance

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.659 
really good it's not a high-performance
wheel<00:05:49.760> or<00:05:50.510> you<00:05:51.080> can<00:05:51.260> make<00:05:51.440> it<00:05:51.620> too<00:05:52.010> heavy<00:05:52.340> in

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
wheel or you can make it too heavy in

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.180 
wheel or you can make it too heavy in
order<00:05:53.300> to<00:05:53.330> make<00:05:53.600> it<00:05:53.780> stiff<00:05:54.020> enough<00:05:54.230> and<00:05:54.650> again

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
order to make it stiff enough and again

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.920 
order to make it stiff enough and again
it's<00:05:55.370> not<00:05:55.640> a<00:05:55.669> high-performance<00:05:56.450> wheel<00:05:56.660> so

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
it's not a high-performance wheel so

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.530

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
wheel companies fighting that balance

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.640 
wheel companies fighting that balance
it's<00:06:01.970> like<00:06:02.120> walking<00:06:02.330> on<00:06:02.540> the<00:06:02.660> razor's<00:06:03.080> edge<00:06:03.260> it
