00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.690
 hello to everyone I am the 362 I bring 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.760
 this is not video and this time I have commented on 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.380
 gta 5 online this time you will be 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.450
 watching some games in the background 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.490
 death races by teams a 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.990
 little of everything that was playing then 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.339
 with yourselves with my 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.140
 subscribers I have an account already 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.759
 you know dedicated exclusively to 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.980
 you on playstation3 which is where I 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.890
 game to gta 5 online that is called plays 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.169
 with elÃ­as 360 is an account to which 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.179
 added to anyone on a regular basis but 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.679
 when I want to play with you notice 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.599
 by twitter I tell you I'm going to play some 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.699
 how many games will I be an hour 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.199
 playing so you can add all the 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.879
 that you want to that account yes that is 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.829
 true that when I disconnected I erase 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.059
 all because then good so that the 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.280
 next time you want to play with 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.179
 you have the whole list 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.280
 available to add me I think that 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.320
 it's quite normal and so it 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.670
 can be rotating of people and not always 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.320
 play the same people with me so that 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.030
 everyone has his chance is still 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.559
 true that in this account I almost never 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.269
 I put the microphone because I have to 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.589
 be several things at once but I 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.120
 I promise that I will always wear the 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.280
 microphone to talk to you and 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.649
 give us a little laugh but not good 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.420
 let's go to the good mess lie 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.200
 before I start I have to say what does 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.880
 little bit back I came back from 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.439
 I said both of them that I think that 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.689
 you always tell me you do not pronounce both 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.610
 he is not pronounce the n of Spain 'is 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.689
 truth there are no words that do not 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.149
 pronounce well no no pronounce them 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.979
 maybe as it should be but good recently 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.570
 I came back from that event it means that I 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.520
 I think apart from having a good time 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.250
 Obviously I had a blast is 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.530
 the only event of all 2013 and what 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.840
 We took in 2014 which has not left me 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.539
 a bad taste in the mouth or there has been some 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.079
 detail that has caused me an evil 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.450
 memory 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.399
 so I really love it I feel 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.780
 super happy with that event so 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.780
 thank you very much to all the people 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.069
 that I saw that same in that same event already 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.810
 all the people that remains to be seen in 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.520
 the rest of events that there will be throughout 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.009
 2014 now so if we're going to mess 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.349
 because in the title you will be seeing something 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.750
 related to valentine this because 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:56.310
 it's good because researching a 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.840
 What is true that I am 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.640
 one of those people that although I heard 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.310
 some rumor I like to get 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.259
 investigate myself and then see with my 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.119
 own eyes if it's true then well there's 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.590
 many forums apparently from england 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.769
 that give a lot of chicha to this 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.420
 topic of looking for interest in looking for rumors 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.220
 to look for faults 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.280
 to look for any hint that can 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.140
 imply that there will be a new 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.940
 dlc things like that then it gives 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.260
 a lot of chicha of this kind of stuff and 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.390
 some users 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.700
 apparently they have found in the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.050
 last update in the code 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.630
 programming of the latest update 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.900
 for gta 5 online in playstation 3 and in 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.300
 xbox 360 a section in that code the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.130
 which refers to the experience of 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.019
 experienced valentine we are going to give 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.630
 of course it refers to the 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.400
 experience points not so this 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.370
 what does it mean then that we could have 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.700
 double experience or greater experience 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.250
 things like that not about during 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.510
 sorry the valentine dates I have 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.660
 to tell you something for those who do not 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.970
 know there are many games that as you saw 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.620
 in Christmas for example then in new 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.630
 in gta 5 online we could also 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.519
 dress of fire as santa claus 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.720
 they do that long ago 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.760
 doing in several games not 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.769
 multiplayer we will put as an example 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.480
 world of warcraft that I think is a 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.310
 perfect example for what we're going to 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.080
 speak and that is that they always have a 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.700
 multiplayer calendar what to 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.170
 refers to this calendar 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.870
 good is a calendar of events 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.670
 of days indicated throughout the year that 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.220
 extrapolate to the game itself ie 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.720
 celebrate the new year celebrate the year 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.300
 Chinese new too many times 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.730
 celebrate halloween valentine one 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.020
 lots of things not then what happens in 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.880
 this kind of events that usually starts 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.220
 what has been the remuneration 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.920
 extra or the prizes for playing or the 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.870
 Special suits usually start 3 or 4 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.790
 days before valentine is to say yes 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.850
 Valentine's Day is February 14 that 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.680
 By the way, it's my birthday on the 14th 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.970
 February so you can send me drawings 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.790
 or whatever on twitter that the truth 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.440
 is that yes I'm excited because 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.989
 usually start 3 or 4 days before as you 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.560
 I say no then I would start at 10 what is 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.930
 on Monday or the 11th which is Tuesday there is no 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.190
 nothing that is official is worth rockstar's 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.440
 done the last thing you have announced 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.440
 lately regarding the multiplayer has 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.510
 been that there are new new 10 tasks there 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.040
 10 new tasks which if you want 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.260
 I inquired about them as well 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.239
 I can investigate and bring you in mode 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.919
 video no but good there are 10 hectares 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.290
 new verified by own 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.390
 company but about valentine have not 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.500
 said nothing about it then what 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.060
 best 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.400
 these days they may announce it 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.230
 only four or five days before remembering 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.660
 that Christmas is announced with 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.100
 very short notice but I do know I 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.570
 I think it's going to be pretty good and 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.800
 I'm pretty sure they 're going to put 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.080
 something that they will put a remuneration 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.120
 of experience because if you put it in the 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.830
 programming code for something will be and 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.140
 in addition to them insurance surely we 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.910
 They also put special suits for 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.950
 dates not because I know how to dress 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.870
 cupid or giant heart and things for 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.520
 the style so nothing to tell me in the 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.740
 comments what do you think about these 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.570
 and if you want to really go there 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.000
 some extra remuneration of experience 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.740
 of money for valentine or if it goes 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.630
 have new clothes all those little things 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.010
 you already know like and favorites you can 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.470
 share the video with your friends 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.180
 so they also comment in the section 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.840
 of comments and with nothing more to say 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:18.040
 elias 360 is dismissed until next time 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.040
 I love
