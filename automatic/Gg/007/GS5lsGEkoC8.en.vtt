hello guys and welcome back to team de
madness<00:00:07.950> today<00:00:08.280> I'm<00:00:08.580> going<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.880> be<00:00:08.940> going<00:00:09.120> to

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
madness today I'm going to be going to

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.450 
madness today I'm going to be going to
show<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:09.870> guys<00:00:10.110> something<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:11.010> lot

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
show you guys something that is a lot

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.249 
show you guys something that is a lot
bigger<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:12.150> lot<00:00:12.360> less<00:00:12.509> practical<00:00:13.080> and

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
bigger and a lot less practical and

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.200 
bigger and a lot less practical and
functional<00:00:13.530> they're<00:00:14.219> mostly<00:00:14.519> Ella<00:00:14.700> cans<00:00:14.969> that

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
functional they're mostly Ella cans that

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.420 
functional they're mostly Ella cans that
I've<00:00:15.450> been<00:00:15.599> doing<00:00:15.900> recently<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.949> essentially

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
I've been doing recently and essentially

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.090 
I've been doing recently and essentially
what<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.119> it's<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.289> giant<00:00:19.920> ear

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
what it is is it's just a giant ear

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.400 
what it is is it's just a giant ear
bursting<00:00:20.580> tea<00:00:20.789> cannon<00:00:21.150> or<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.359> superhero<00:00:21.900> stand

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
bursting tea cannon or a superhero stand

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.710 
bursting tea cannon or a superhero stand
he<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.880> pretty<00:00:24.269> much<00:00:24.390> just<00:00:24.630> an

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
he can so it is pretty much just an

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.230 
he can so it is pretty much just an
extremely<00:00:25.340> blown-up<00:00:26.340> version<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.210> that

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
extremely blown-up version of it that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.990 
extremely blown-up version of it that
uses<00:00:27.720> some<00:00:27.869> interesting<00:00:28.590> TNT<00:00:29.220> mechanics<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
uses some interesting TNT mechanics and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.060 
uses some interesting TNT mechanics and
redstone<00:00:30.330> mechanics<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.349> allow<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:31.859> thing

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
redstone mechanics that allow this thing

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.130 
redstone mechanics that allow this thing
to<00:00:32.189> work<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:33.540> pretty<00:00:33.690> much<00:00:33.750> just<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
to work and it's pretty much just a

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.990 
to work and it's pretty much just a
giant<00:00:34.350> blown-up<00:00:34.829> version<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.820> original

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
giant blown-up version of the original

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.720 
giant blown-up version of the original
ear<00:00:36.540> Burstein<00:00:37.020> TKE<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.680> did<00:00:37.890> using<00:00:38.280> slime

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
ear Burstein TKE and I did using slime

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.729 
ear Burstein TKE and I did using slime
blocks<00:00:39.030> back<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> day<00:00:39.719> except<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.559> one

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
blocks back in the day except this one

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.229 
blocks back in the day except this one
uses<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> lot<00:00:41.250> more<00:00:41.430> timing<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.059> uses

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
uses a lot more timing and it uses

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.560 
uses a lot more timing and it uses
dispensers<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.680> too<00:00:43.890> far<00:00:44.219> off<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:45.000> if<00:00:45.450> we

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
dispensers just too far off so if we

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.420 
dispensers just too far off so if we
take<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> look<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.200> at<00:00:46.500> first<00:00:46.739> glance<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.309> we

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
take a look this at first glance as we

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.100 
take a look this at first glance as we
can<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.730> there<00:00:47.910> are<00:00:48.030> four<00:00:48.270> dispensers<00:00:48.809> from

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
can see there are four dispensers from

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.529 
can see there are four dispensers from
the<00:00:49.230> main<00:00:49.440> line<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.610> bottom<00:00:50.879> ones<00:00:51.120> are

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the main line and the bottom ones are

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.020 
the main line and the bottom ones are
the<00:00:51.690> ones<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.960> fire<00:00:52.320> off<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.890> TNT<00:00:53.610> that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the ones that fire off the TNT that

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.150 
the ones that fire off the TNT that
actually<00:00:54.539> shoots<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.079> main<00:00:55.260> TNT<00:00:55.739> into<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
actually shoots the main TNT into the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.849 
actually shoots the main TNT into the
ear<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.940> I've<00:00:57.059> got<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.420> little<00:00:58.170> sticky<00:00:58.680> for

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
ear so I've got this little sticky for

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.770 
ear so I've got this little sticky for
stuffing<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.370> left<00:00:59.609> side<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.510> so

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
stuffing on the left side and that is so

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.680 
stuffing on the left side and that is so
the<00:01:01.559> TNT<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.460> fired<00:01:02.730> straight<00:01:03.059> away<00:01:03.300> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the TNT can be fired straight away and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.080 
the TNT can be fired straight away and
that<00:01:04.320> way<00:01:04.500> when<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.100> gets<00:01:05.280> shot<00:01:05.549> into<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.820> ear

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
that way when it gets shot into the ear

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.410 
that way when it gets shot into the ear
it<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.510> blow<00:01:06.720> up<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:07.049> soon<00:01:07.350> as<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.549> Allen<00:01:08.909> TNT

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it can blow up as soon as the Allen TNT

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.080 
it can blow up as soon as the Allen TNT
is<00:01:09.689> exFAT<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.860> what<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.159> mean<00:01:11.310> by<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.820> when

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
is exFAT so what I mean by that is when

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.120 
is exFAT so what I mean by that is when
the<00:01:12.299> Pistons<00:01:12.810> pull<00:01:13.049> back<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.470> then<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.740> TNT

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the Pistons pull back and then the TNT

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.679 
the Pistons pull back and then the TNT
gets<00:01:14.310> shot<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.549> into<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.000> air<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
gets shot up into the air and on the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.320 
gets shot up into the air and on the
other<00:01:15.900> side<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.740> TNT<00:01:17.130> gets<00:01:17.369> activated<00:01:17.909> as

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
other side the TNT gets activated as

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.350 
other side the TNT gets activated as
soon<00:01:18.689> as<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.080> bottom<00:01:19.380> one<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:20.090> deactivate<00:01:21.090> or

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
soon as the bottom one is deactivate or

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.570 
soon as the bottom one is deactivate or
activates<00:01:21.840> or<00:01:22.020> blows<00:01:22.259> up<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.070> way<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.460> can

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
activates or blows up so that way it can

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.370 
activates or blows up so that way it can
be<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.729> projectile<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.570> fire<00:01:24.810> off<00:01:24.960> into<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
be a projectile and fire off into the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.350 
be a projectile and fire off into the
distance<00:01:25.530> God<00:01:26.100> knows<00:01:26.310> where<00:01:26.610> God<00:01:26.880> knows<00:01:27.119> how

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
distance God knows where God knows how

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.490 
distance God knows where God knows how
and<00:01:27.540> God<00:01:27.689> knows<00:01:27.900> why

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
and God knows why

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.560 
and God knows why
so<00:01:29.040> that's<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> whole<00:01:29.700> reason<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:30.270> how<00:01:30.420> this

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
so that's the whole reason of how this

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.390 
so that's the whole reason of how this
works<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.079> let's<00:01:31.200> take<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> closer<00:01:31.829> look<00:01:31.950> at<00:01:32.159> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
works so let's take a closer look at it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.190 
works so let's take a closer look at it
okay<00:01:33.000> guys<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.570> go<00:01:33.689> down<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
okay guys so if we go down here and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.810 
okay guys so if we go down here and
press<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.680> button<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.220> see<00:01:35.430> t<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.729> he

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
press this button we can see t and he

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.730 
press this button we can see t and he
gets<00:01:36.000> dispensed<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.540> bottom<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.229> there<00:01:37.470> and

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
gets dispensed on bottom then there and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.590 
gets dispensed on bottom then there and
then<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.369> second<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.880> should<00:01:39.060> fire<00:01:39.299> up<00:01:39.479> in

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
then in a second it should fire up in

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.390 
then in a second it should fire up in
the<00:01:39.750> air<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.170> then<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.130> most

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the air and then as we can see most

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.950 
the air and then as we can see most
attend<00:01:41.759> he<00:01:41.909> gets<00:01:42.090> fired<00:01:42.299> off<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> distance

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
attend he gets fired off in the distance

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.690 
attend he gets fired off in the distance
and<00:01:43.439> then<00:01:43.530> some<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.040> gets<00:01:44.280> thrown<00:01:44.460> off

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and then some of it gets thrown off

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.460 
and then some of it gets thrown off
straight<00:01:45.329> up<00:01:45.509> most<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> time<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.350> quite

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
straight up most of the time it's quite

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.679 
straight up most of the time it's quite
random<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.130> won't<00:01:47.340> get<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> same<00:01:47.909> every

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
random and you won't get the same every

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.149 
random and you won't get the same every
time<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.229> that's<00:01:49.350> pretty<00:01:49.649> much<00:01:49.740> how<00:01:49.860> this

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
time so that's pretty much how this

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.910 
time so that's pretty much how this
thing<00:01:50.310> fires<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.240> if<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.479> press<00:01:51.689> us<00:01:51.930> again<00:01:52.350> but

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
thing fires so if we press us again but

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.530 
thing fires so if we press us again but
actually<00:01:53.340> not<00:01:53.490> teamlook<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.180> year<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:54.390> can

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
actually not teamlook in the year we can

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.450 
actually not teamlook in the year we can
see<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> bomb<00:01:54.960> tanta<00:01:55.380> fires<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.070> TNT

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
see the bomb tanta fires and the TNT

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.179 
see the bomb tanta fires and the TNT
here<00:01:56.700> fires<00:01:56.939> then<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.750> tick<00:01:57.990> tick<00:01:58.350> later<00:01:58.590> this

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
here fires then a tick tick later this

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.950 
here fires then a tick tick later this
gets<00:01:59.579> fired<00:01:59.790> back<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.240> gets<00:02:00.450> fired<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
gets fired back this gets fired in the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.600 
gets fired back this gets fired in the
air<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.530> then<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.770> gets<00:02:01.979> fired<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.399> there

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
air and then this gets fired in there

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.280 
air and then this gets fired in there
this<00:02:02.820> gets<00:02:03.060> fired<00:02:03.329> slightly<00:02:03.840> higher<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
this gets fired slightly higher in the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.200 
this gets fired slightly higher in the
air<00:02:04.439> than<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.490> way<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:05.850> fly

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
air than this so that way it can fly

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.930 
air than this so that way it can fly
higher<00:02:06.960> off<00:02:07.229> into<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> air<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.310> blow<00:02:08.550> off<00:02:08.610> a

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
higher off into the air and blow off a

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.639 
higher off into the air and blow off a
couple<00:02:09.300> hundred<00:02:09.479> blocks<00:02:09.810> away<00:02:09.959> maybe<00:02:10.289> that's

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
couple hundred blocks away maybe that's

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.869 
couple hundred blocks away maybe that's
why<00:02:10.830> we<00:02:10.979> can't<00:02:11.190> see<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.640> render

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
why we can't see it in the render

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.520 
why we can't see it in the render
distance<00:02:12.000> when<00:02:12.480> fire<00:02:12.780> up<00:02:12.989> but

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
distance when fire up but

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.750 
distance when fire up but
as<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.740> can<00:02:13.860> see<00:02:14.010> some<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.250> them<00:02:14.400> just<00:02:14.610> slide

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
as you can see some of them just slide

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.030 
as you can see some of them just slide
straight<00:02:15.090> up<00:02:15.270> so<00:02:15.690> it's<00:02:15.900> cool<00:02:16.080> quite<00:02:16.620> random

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
straight up so it's cool quite random

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.770 
straight up so it's cool quite random
because<00:02:17.280> some<00:02:17.490> will<00:02:17.640> fire<00:02:17.819> up<00:02:18.000> sideways<00:02:18.300> and

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
because some will fire up sideways and

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.660 
because some will fire up sideways and
up<00:02:19.230> higher<00:02:19.470> than<00:02:19.770> some<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.040> them<00:02:20.160> it's

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
up higher than some of them it's

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.550 
up higher than some of them it's
actually<00:02:20.819> relatively<00:02:21.420> hard<00:02:21.810> working<00:02:22.319> with

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
actually relatively hard working with

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.280 
actually relatively hard working with
TNT<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.220> get<00:02:23.370> very<00:02:23.610> precise<00:02:24.030> some<00:02:24.780> people<00:02:25.110> can

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
TNT to get very precise some people can

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.780 
TNT to get very precise some people can
manage<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.740> do<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.250> don't<00:02:26.310> know<00:02:26.610> how

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
manage to do that and I don't know how

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.210 
manage to do that and I don't know how
so<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.840> whole<00:02:28.020> reason<00:02:28.440> for<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.680> scanning<00:02:28.950> is

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
so the whole reason for the scanning is

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.309 
so the whole reason for the scanning is
just<00:02:29.490> just<00:02:29.730> shaft<00:02:30.000> your<00:02:30.239> friends<00:02:30.660> something

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
just just shaft your friends something

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.840 
just just shaft your friends something
that<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.590> just<00:02:31.739> pretty<00:02:31.920> much<00:02:32.130> like<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.400> giant

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
that is just pretty much like a giant

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.309 
that is just pretty much like a giant
firework<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.540> can<00:02:33.690> fire<00:02:33.930> off<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.200> the

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
firework that can fire off in the

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.710 
firework that can fire off in the
distance<00:02:34.500> if<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.310> are<00:02:35.550> in<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.850> giant<00:02:36.209> town<00:02:36.540> or

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
distance if you are in a giant town or

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.020 
distance if you are in a giant town or
something<00:02:37.080> do<00:02:37.680> not<00:02:37.709> use<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.700> will<00:02:38.850> blow

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
something do not use this you will blow

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.930 
something do not use this you will blow
up<00:02:39.150> someone's<00:02:39.510> base<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:40.170> God<00:02:40.709> knows<00:02:40.920> where<00:02:41.250> and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
up someone's base in God knows where and

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.940 
up someone's base in God knows where and
they<00:02:42.300> will<00:02:42.450> not<00:02:42.600> be<00:02:42.660> happy<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.290> in<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.530> then<00:02:43.800> if

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
they will not be happy and in it then if

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.530 
they will not be happy and in it then if
you<00:02:44.069> fire<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.459> off<00:02:44.550> again<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.180> might<00:02:45.360> hit

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
you fire it off again and might hit

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.570 
you fire it off again and might hit
their<00:02:45.690> neighbor's<00:02:46.050> house<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:46.950> please<00:02:47.370> do<00:02:47.550> not

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
their neighbor's house so please do not

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.310 
their neighbor's house so please do not
do<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:48.000> but<00:02:48.330> anyway<00:02:48.600> let's<00:02:48.870> take<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.110> look<00:02:49.230> at

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
do that but anyway let's take a look at

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.620 
do that but anyway let's take a look at
the<00:02:49.380> river<00:02:49.560> okay<00:02:50.100> guys<00:02:50.519> so<00:02:50.880> as<00:02:51.120> we<00:02:51.269> can<00:02:51.420> see

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
the river okay guys so as we can see

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.570 
the river okay guys so as we can see
here<00:02:51.900> we<00:02:52.260> have<00:02:52.290> just<00:02:52.800> got<00:02:52.920> our<00:02:53.040> main<00:02:53.280> button

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
here we have just got our main button

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.430 
here we have just got our main button
and<00:02:53.820> this<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:54.450> pretty<00:02:54.600> much<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:55.200> does

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
and this is pretty much it does

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.930 
and this is pretty much it does
everything<00:02:55.980> because<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.489> splits<00:02:56.760> off<00:02:56.880> into

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
everything because it splits off into

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.699 
everything because it splits off into
four<00:02:57.239> directions<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.110> then<00:02:58.290> we<00:02:58.380> got<00:02:58.530> this

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
four directions and then we got this

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.680 
four directions and then we got this
repair<00:02:59.069> what<00:02:59.280> splits<00:02:59.700> off<00:02:59.880> into<00:03:00.120> two<00:03:00.300> and

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
repair what splits off into two and

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.360 
repair what splits off into two and
pretty<00:03:01.050> much<00:03:01.200> it's<00:03:01.410> just<00:03:01.440> all<00:03:01.830> about<00:03:02.069> timing

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
pretty much it's just all about timing

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.850 
pretty much it's just all about timing
there's<00:03:02.730> nothing<00:03:03.060> really<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.860> particularly

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
there's nothing really that particularly

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.040 
there's nothing really that particularly
special<00:03:05.130> it's<00:03:05.610> just<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:06.060> bunch<00:03:06.269> of<00:03:06.390> timing<00:03:06.870> to

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
special it's just a bunch of timing to

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.750 
special it's just a bunch of timing to
make<00:03:07.200> sure<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.739> TNT<00:03:08.130> fires<00:03:08.370> off<00:03:08.580> at<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
make sure that the TNT fires off at the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.500 
make sure that the TNT fires off at the
right<00:03:08.940> time

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
right time

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.690 
right time
so<00:03:10.140> everything<00:03:10.830> works<00:03:11.069> because<00:03:11.459> there's<00:03:11.640> a

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
so everything works because there's a

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.000 
so everything works because there's a
lot<00:03:11.910> happening<00:03:12.090> at<00:03:12.540> one<00:03:12.720> time<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.650> it's<00:03:13.680> first

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
lot happening at one time so it's first

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.350 
lot happening at one time so it's first
when<00:03:14.160> we<00:03:14.280> have<00:03:14.430> down<00:03:14.610> here<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:14.970> activates

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
when we have down here the activates

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.690 
when we have down here the activates
first<00:03:15.600> is<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.680> button<00:03:17.069> activates<00:03:17.549> this

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
first is the button activates this

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.670 
first is the button activates this
redstone<00:03:18.030> bomb<00:03:18.420> which<00:03:18.690> goes<00:03:18.959> through<00:03:19.530> this

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
redstone bomb which goes through this

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.470 
redstone bomb which goes through this
repeater<00:03:20.070> which<00:03:20.370> then<00:03:20.640> after<00:03:21.060> one<00:03:21.239> Tec

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
repeater which then after one Tec

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.630 
repeater which then after one Tec
activates<00:03:22.079> all<00:03:22.320> these<00:03:22.620> dispensers<00:03:23.190> one<00:03:23.459> tick

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
activates all these dispensers one tick

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.550 
activates all these dispensers one tick
after<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.150> thing<00:03:24.360> has<00:03:24.570> been<00:03:24.750> pressed<00:03:25.019> the

after that thing has been pressed the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.410 
after that thing has been pressed the
next<00:03:25.829> thing<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.010> activates<00:03:26.549> is<00:03:26.790> if<00:03:27.180> we<00:03:27.269> go

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
next thing that activates is if we go

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.330 
next thing that activates is if we go
along<00:03:27.600> here<00:03:27.840> we've<00:03:28.019> got<00:03:28.170> free<00:03:28.500> free<00:03:29.070> text

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
along here we've got free free text

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.890 
along here we've got free free text
delay<00:03:29.549> here<00:03:29.790> from<00:03:29.970> this<00:03:30.090> repeater<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.690> goes

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
delay here from this repeater that goes

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.870 
delay here from this repeater that goes
into<00:03:31.079> redstone<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.980> then<00:03:32.280> another<00:03:32.579> tick

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
into redstone and then another tick

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.430 
into redstone and then another tick
delay<00:03:33.000> so<00:03:33.180> our<00:03:33.450> four<00:03:33.630> ticks<00:03:33.810> off<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.170> buttons

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
delay so our four ticks off the buttons

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.560 
delay so our four ticks off the buttons
pressed<00:03:34.709> these<00:03:35.010> dispensers<00:03:35.610> get<00:03:35.850> the

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
pressed these dispensers get the

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.710 
pressed these dispensers get the
dispenser<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.620> way<00:03:37.850> free<00:03:38.850> these<00:03:39.269> activate

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
dispenser that way free these activate

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.660 
dispenser that way free these activate
free<00:03:39.959> ticks<00:03:40.170> before<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.860> one<00:03:41.070> does<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.310> that

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
free ticks before this one does so that

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.539 
free ticks before this one does so that
way<00:03:41.850> these<00:03:42.269> can<00:03:42.720> fire<00:03:42.989> slightly<00:03:43.500> higher<00:03:43.680> that

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
way these can fire slightly higher that

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:45.380 
way these can fire slightly higher that
make<00:03:44.730> sense

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
make sense

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.569 
make sense
so<00:03:46.019> after<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.590> we<00:03:46.829> have<00:03:46.950> then<00:03:47.160> got<00:03:47.340> these

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
so after that we have then got these

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.000 
so after that we have then got these
these<00:03:48.390> dispensers<00:03:48.989> on<00:03:49.109> the<00:03:49.200> top<00:03:49.380> after<00:03:49.560> 12

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
these dispensers on the top after 12

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.039 
these dispensers on the top after 12
ticks<00:03:50.250> dispensing<00:03:50.730> off<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.540> these<00:03:51.840> will

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
ticks dispensing off so and these will

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.319 
ticks dispensing off so and these will
just<00:03:52.260> sit<00:03:52.500> down<00:03:52.530> here<00:03:53.220> on<00:03:53.400> this<00:03:53.700> glass<00:03:54.000> here

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
just sit down here on this glass here

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.690 
just sit down here on this glass here
and<00:03:54.530> that<00:03:55.530> will<00:03:55.650> do<00:03:55.769> nothing<00:03:55.980> until<00:03:56.400> these

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
and that will do nothing until these

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.150 
and that will do nothing until these
Pistons<00:03:57.090> retract<00:03:57.510> but<00:03:58.170> after<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.709> we've<00:03:58.950> got

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
Pistons retract but after that we've got

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.460 
Pistons retract but after that we've got
40<00:03:59.489> tick<00:03:59.670> delay<00:03:59.790> here<00:04:00.329> which<00:04:00.600> turns<00:04:01.260> this

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
40 tick delay here which turns this

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.349 
40 tick delay here which turns this
redstone<00:04:01.769> torch<00:04:02.100> off<00:04:02.340> which<00:04:02.549> makes<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.940> 41

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
redstone torch off which makes it 41

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.900 
redstone torch off which makes it 41
ticks<00:04:03.630> delay<00:04:03.930> then<00:04:04.620> these<00:04:04.799> Pistons<00:04:05.370> will

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
ticks delay then these Pistons will

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.560 
ticks delay then these Pistons will
retract<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:07.410> TNT<00:04:07.859> will<00:04:08.010> fall<00:04:08.250> about<00:04:09.030> half

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
retract and the TNT will fall about half

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.050 
retract and the TNT will fall about half
a<00:04:09.720> block<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.650> TNT<00:04:11.070> below<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:11.549> will<00:04:11.760> fire

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
a block and the TNT below it will fire

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.390 
a block and the TNT below it will fire
it<00:04:12.180> up<00:04:12.299> really<00:04:12.720> high<00:04:12.840> in<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.170> air<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.560> the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
it up really high in the air and the

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.880 
it up really high in the air and the
final<00:04:14.730> one<00:04:14.850> that<00:04:14.880> activates<00:04:15.480> after<00:04:15.780> those<00:04:16.560> are

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
final one that activates after those are

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.190 
final one that activates after those are
activated<00:04:17.609> is<00:04:17.729> about<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.359> tick<00:04:18.630> later<00:04:18.870> these

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
activated is about a tick later these

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.900 
activated is about a tick later these
ones<00:04:19.440> fire<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.010> as<00:04:20.100> soon<00:04:20.280> as<00:04:20.310> they<00:04:20.519> dispense

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
ones fire and as soon as they dispense

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.360 
ones fire and as soon as they dispense
their<00:04:21.209> shot<00:04:21.479> way<00:04:21.780> up<00:04:21.900> into<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.260> year<00:04:22.440> okay

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
their shot way up into the year okay

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.399 
their shot way up into the year okay
guys<00:04:23.760> so<00:04:24.120> that's<00:04:24.780> pretty<00:04:24.990> much<00:04:25.050> this<00:04:25.349> whole

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
guys so that's pretty much this whole

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:27.050 
guys so that's pretty much this whole
thing<00:04:25.830> in<00:04:26.070> detail

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
thing in detail

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.490 
thing in detail
of<00:04:27.120> course<00:04:27.330> I'm<00:04:27.600> not<00:04:27.750> going<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.139> be<00:04:28.230> doing<00:04:28.410> a

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
of course I'm not going to be doing a

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.780 
of course I'm not going to be doing a
tutorial<00:04:28.650> on<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.280> just<00:04:29.430> because<00:04:29.610> it's

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
tutorial on it just because it's

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.670 
tutorial on it just because it's
extremely<00:04:30.300> vague<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.660> impractical<00:04:31.290> and<00:04:31.590> the

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
extremely vague and impractical and the

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.200 
extremely vague and impractical and the
whole<00:04:31.830> point<00:04:32.100> of<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:32.490> just<00:04:32.520> a<00:04:32.790> shot<00:04:33.030> off

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
whole point of this is just a shot off

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.030 
whole point of this is just a shot off
so<00:04:33.750> I'm<00:04:34.050> not<00:04:34.169> going<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.530> be<00:04:34.620> doing<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.860> tutorial

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
so I'm not going to be doing a tutorial

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.890 
so I'm not going to be doing a tutorial
but<00:04:35.580> if<00:04:35.730> you<00:04:35.850> do<00:04:35.970> want<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.240> take<00:04:36.389> a<00:04:36.450> closer<00:04:36.750> look

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
but if you do want to take a closer look

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.480 
but if you do want to take a closer look
at<00:04:37.139> this<00:04:37.230> there<00:04:37.680> will<00:04:37.770> be<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:37.950> world<00:04:38.220> download

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
at this there will be a world download

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.040 
at this there will be a world download
in<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:38.940> description<00:04:39.000> below<00:04:39.690> for<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:39.960> to
