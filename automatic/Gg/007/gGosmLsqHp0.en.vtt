00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.800
 Today you take me from the bed 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.990
 a pleasant surprise and it is that it turns out that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.509
 We have already exceeded 5000 subscribers 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.609
 which I thank you infinitely 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.949
 By the way mark on my son as I have 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.749
 cost these 5 thousand subscribers but 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.880
 thanks to this effort thanks to this

 collaboration between you and me I know 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.320
 that behind each one of those monitors 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.840
 behind each of those subscribers 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.700
 I know there is a real person who is 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.220
 watching my videos this year had like 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.110
 purpose five thousand subscribers just 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.090
 goes to the middle of the year and already fulfilled this 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.740
 purpose so let's do something 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.990
 I want your ideas to give me their 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.760
 opinions since when we get to 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.980
 the 10,000 subscribers I want to make a 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.990
 very special video so I want that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.760
 be a collaboration between all of you 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.920
 see those opinions to see what they 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.810
 would like to see in this special video of 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.780
 the 10,000 subscribers that is but 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.440
 Well hopefully this year I can achieve it and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.540
 good today I bring you an idea 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.340
 very great and had plenty of time to 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.130
 I wanted to do them practically it 's a 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.100
 museum where you combine crafts 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.590
 with food to say food 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.960
 I mean sweet desserts at 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.730
 dungeon to all that we like and 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.190
 simply that's why it's a great idea 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.350
 a few weeks ago I taught them to 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.930
 make snow from carafe that by the way 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.030
 It is very, very rich so today you 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.950
 I want to teach a super cool idea 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.870
 to complement your desserts for 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.700
 decorate your dishes to give a little 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.140
 more elegance and good you'll see that 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.730
 many things will happen to you 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.410
 you can do with this idea when 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.470
 Snow shopping regularly is served to you 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.270
 with household keel or in a glass so 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.970
 today I'm going to teach you a new way to 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.220
 enjoy your ice cream and good for 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.800
 you know that you are going to sell marvel and very 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.020
 elegant chocolate reasons this is 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.240
 you heard right let's do some 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.610
 ingenious bowls made completely 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.300
 of chocolate where you can serve 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.550
 that the side snow the fresh fruit 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.290
 icy things good anything 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.459
 come on and well these are the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.459
 ingredients that we are going to need 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.790
 chocolate to cover this pot what 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.380
 I bought at a pastry shop already 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.390
 it comes a little melted but also what 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.580
 You can buy in bulk optionally 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.920
 We can use white chocolate to 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.830
 coverage I only bought a few 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.330
 how many old pieces, these guys 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.730
 balloons are from number seven but 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.340
 they turned out to be something big I recommend you 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.580
 comprises a smaller size maybe a 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.500
 number 516 likewise they do not serve 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.510
 say only that more boys are 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.120
 more economical and that's all 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.990
 we need are very few things so 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.990
 grabs 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.670
 we begin by completely melting the 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.650
 chocolate to bain- marie if you do not know how 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.660
 this procedure is done I leave you a 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.670
 link so you can learn easily 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.740
 once our chocolate is 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.130
 completely liquid we will leave it 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.470
 rest so that it thickens a bit has 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.450
 to be liquid but not so much while 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.740
 so much we can go inflating the balloons that 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.720
 we will use 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.120
 we have to inflate a size more or less 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.950
 like a fist before proceeding to 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.810
 do anything else we are going to 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.200
 rinse each of the balloons with water 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.880
 to remove impurities that have 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.890
 I'm going to use this frozen table 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.620
 special but if you do not have it you can 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.660
 use any flat plate the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.520
 procedure is as simple as 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.580
 can you imagine we just have 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.200
 to submerge each of the balloons 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.210
 approximately until covering half of 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.610
 its size this way we're going to 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.620
 get the bowl shape we stretch a 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.050
 little and let stand on the bar 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.180
 frost or a flat plate we do the same 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.820
 with our balloons and we put them into 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.050
 freezer for a few minutes 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.270
 after a couple of minutes the 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.340
 chocolate must have hardened is 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.930
 time to add a second layer to 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.610
 that the chocolate does not break when 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.260
 we unmold 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.780
 try that the second layer of 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.830
 chocolate is more or less flush with the 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.540
 previous layer or a little lower 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.380
 also melt some chocolate 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.450
 white to make another type of bowl 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.489
 we add chocolate in this way and 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.950
 let's let it spill around 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.770
 of the globe 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.810
 we put in the refrigerator and once the layer lasts 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.190
 of white chocolate we do the same 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.190
 but with dark chocolate 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.510
 obviously refrigerated so that it 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.790
 harden then comes the part 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.830
 most important very carefully 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.680
 we try to take off the balloon 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.170
 chocolate in this way and with a 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.390
 knife or with scissors we make a 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.170
 small hole for the air to escape 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.170
 slowly 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.300
 with your fingers we try to take off with 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:03.810
 very careful the chocolate balloon and 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.910
 ready we have our first bowl 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.620
 for this second bowl we are going to do 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.020
 exactly the same procedure 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.639
 we just have to have a lot 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.820
 careful since it will be impossible 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:18.980
 keep the original shape but good 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.980
 let's try to make it decently 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.710
 the fact 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.030
 and well that was all for today I hope that 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.040
 have you liked this tutorial so much 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.900
 like me and especially that they have fun 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.090
 doing it the truth of this idea was it 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.040
 It makes great when I saw her I fell in love 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.900
 of her and choose I have to make a video 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.850
 this is something that can easily 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.740
 Serve in any restaurant and good 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.900
 as I said earlier I think that 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.660
 it's the perfect combination between a 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.190
 craftsmanship and desserts already know my 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.200
