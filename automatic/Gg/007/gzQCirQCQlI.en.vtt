00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello and welcome back to my channel 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.210
 here I want to share a new boxing 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.890
 and something that came to me also from China 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.860
 of the page where I'm asking everyone 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.900
 the details I will give the link to 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.230
 get those products then we go 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.220
 here 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.170
 the jump-off without hurting this is something 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.270
 an accessory that I bought for my camera 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.369
 well then let's break this 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.460
 equip the scalpel basically this is 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.919
 a tripod and an accessory that I do not know how 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.160
 really call but they are accessories very 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.470
 economically I basically want to change the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.480
 tripod that you currently use 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.699
 currently used this this I have it 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.860
 a long time ago and when I bought it I 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:47.360
 It cost about 30 dollars but I do not remember 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.739
 how long it does not have not have it 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.780
 It has three legs and does not have something in 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.000
 the center that the image is via as the 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.670
 new gut that can show you us 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.930
 let's go to the first one is this accessory 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.269
 accessory the cost I think more or less 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.170
 six dollars with shipping something very 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.610
 economic, what they do is serve me 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.560
 to hold the camera here in the 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.450
 hostile desktop of the camera with the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.580
 which I am recording I hold it with a 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.369
 small tripod explained of little ones that 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.280
 they sell and right now this one is not going to be able to 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.740
 put the desk here so say be 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.290
 biting the desk table 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.860
 and will be able to locate this camera with the 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.320
 I'm filming a little bit further back and 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.630
 that way I will be able to put here more or 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.570
 less and get a larger area of 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.960
 recording 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.790
 in this way it is going to be more or less 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.250
 it's a very economical accessory only 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.470
 6 dollars from the Chinese page 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.740
 is buying right now let's give them the 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.440
 tripod that cost me only 11 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.450
 dollars a lot cheaper in the 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.260
 tripod that I had before with the cost 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.600
 like 30 dollars a long time ago 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.230
 this is a tripod or much more stable 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.570
 I will show you because basically this 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.390
 what you have here in the middle gives you 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.860
 more stability to put here to the 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.399
 left of the previous time that I 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.500
 I had 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.100
 we move away a little so that you 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.460
 see 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.070
 both by stretching all your legs more or 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.700
 less they arrive at the same level this 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.410
 reaches goal one meter with 14 centimeters 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.170
 and I think a meter with 4 centimeters 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.780
 with 14 and this is a meter with 13 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.120
 centimeters or three centimeters the others 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.890
 two have the same height however 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.800
 this one that I just bought a lot more 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.150
 cheap at 10 dollars has this thing in 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.850
 the center which gives much more 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.970
 stability and besides that has a 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.670
 little ball when I can leave the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.160
 completely horizontal camera then 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.530
 I'm going to pause the video here and I'm going to marm 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.270
 to both show them all completely 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.760
 stretched for you to see more or 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.560
 minus its height below the details that to 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.720
 the links for this accessory that 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.340
 I showed you earlier and also for 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.050
 the good one here we can already see the two 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.840
 tripods the one on the left the one that had 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.180
 before and the one on the right the new one will see 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.400
 that the right is suddenly one or two 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.010
 centimeters taller than I had before 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.630
 left the form to which 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.760
 open legs open too 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.070
 basically it's more unstable because to 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.830
 Sometimes a plant slips with more 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.320
 ease the legs slip with 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.660
 much ease while this new 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.460
 it does not open so much and this thing that has 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.300
 here in the center it gives much more 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:39.590
 stability to this this is a kind of 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.480
 aluminum very very light and in addition to that 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.360
 It has the level that I showed you 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.800
 previously so I can square the 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.550
 camera so that it is completely 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.550
 leveled 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.610
 so I recommend them below 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.739
 details to fall in link so that it is 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.879
 interested to buy it only worth 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.080
 10 dollars 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:03.150
