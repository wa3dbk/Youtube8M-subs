00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
lombaxes so much then why didn't he

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.920 
lombaxes so much then why didn't he
follow<00:01:02.430> them<00:01:02.670> into<00:01:02.850> their<00:01:03.059> own<00:01:03.120> dimension<00:01:03.780> and

follow them into their own dimension and

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
continue with this genocide well because

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
continue with this genocide well because
he<00:01:07.170> didn't<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> technology<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.610> because

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
he didn't have the technology to because

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.940 
he didn't have the technology to because

especially<00:02:02.729> when<00:02:02.850> others<00:02:03.149> look<00:02:03.329> like<00:02:03.360> this

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
especially when others look like this

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.620 
especially when others look like this
they<00:02:04.649> just<00:02:04.890> look<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.340> lot<00:02:05.579> smarter<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:06.450> they're

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
they just look a lot smarter but they're

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.270 
they just look a lot smarter but they're
not

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
not

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.880 
not
so<00:02:07.520> why<00:02:07.820> are<00:02:08.060> they<00:02:08.240> so<00:02:08.509> much<00:02:08.660> smarter<00:02:09.050> well<00:02:09.560> it

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
so why are they so much smarter well it

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.070 
so why are they so much smarter well it
may<00:02:10.190> not<00:02:10.399> exactly<00:02:10.610> have<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.540> do<00:02:11.660> with<00:02:11.870> their

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
may not exactly have to do with their

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.200 
may not exactly have to do with their
smartness<00:02:12.530> as<00:02:12.860> much<00:02:13.250> as<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.550> does<00:02:13.730> their

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
smartness as much as it does their

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.180 
smartness as much as it does their
circumstances<00:02:15.050> well<00:02:15.560> playing<00:02:15.860> through<00:02:16.130> the

Ratchet and Clank series you may notice

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.030 
Ratchet and Clank series you may notice
something<00:02:18.430> work<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:20.210> human<00:02:21.050> or<00:02:21.230> whatever<00:02:21.440> the

human ask thing only has three fingers

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.699 
human ask thing only has three fingers
now<00:02:25.490> look<00:02:25.850> at<00:02:26.030> almost<00:02:26.510> every<00:02:27.110> other<00:02:27.290> species

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
now look at almost every other species

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.160 
now look at almost every other species
on<00:02:28.100> top<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.520> that<00:02:28.640> even<00:02:29.120> every<00:02:29.540> other<00:02:29.630> robot

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
on top of that even every other robot

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.670 
on top of that even every other robot
even<00:02:30.440> Clank<00:02:31.280> they<00:02:31.910> all<00:02:32.240> only<00:02:32.780> have<00:02:33.230> three

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
even Clank they all only have three

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.190 
even Clank they all only have three
fingers<00:02:34.280> but<00:02:34.880> now<00:02:35.000> look<00:02:35.240> at<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.450> long<00:02:35.660> boxes

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
fingers but now look at the long boxes

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.490 
fingers but now look at the long boxes
five<00:02:37.070> fingers<00:02:37.850> now<00:02:38.600> I'm<00:02:38.780> not<00:02:39.020> saying<00:02:39.320> that

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
five fingers now I'm not saying that

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.560 
five fingers now I'm not saying that
more<00:02:39.830> fingers<00:02:40.190> equals<00:02:40.580> more<00:02:40.730> intelligence<00:02:41.390> if

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
more fingers equals more intelligence if

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.000 
more fingers equals more intelligence if
that<00:02:41.810> was<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.050> case<00:02:42.200> I'm<00:02:42.380> sure<00:02:42.410> incest<00:02:42.920> would

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
that was the case I'm sure incest would

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.780 
that was the case I'm sure incest would
be<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.190> lot<00:02:43.430> more<00:02:43.580> popular<00:02:44.890> no<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:46.160> believe<00:02:46.580> it's

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
be a lot more popular no I believe it's

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.820 
be a lot more popular no I believe it's
just<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.270> with<00:02:47.420> five<00:02:47.630> fingers<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.470> can<00:02:48.620> do<00:02:48.800> a

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
just that with five fingers you can do a

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.280 
just that with five fingers you can do a
lot<00:02:49.250> more<00:02:49.280> with<00:02:49.760> tiny<00:02:50.090> electronic<00:02:50.660> parts<00:02:51.050> and

lot more with tiny electronic parts and

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.010 
lot more with tiny electronic parts and
keyboards<00:02:52.160> take<00:02:52.640> your<00:02:52.820> hand<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.270> tape<00:02:53.690> down

a<00:02:55.970> spider-man<00:02:56.540> now<00:02:57.110> try<00:02:57.440> typing<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:57.950> sentence

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
a spider-man now try typing a sentence

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.280 
a spider-man now try typing a sentence
into<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.730> comments<00:02:59.150> as<00:02:59.239> fast<00:02:59.570> as<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.840> can

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
into the comments as fast as you can

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.960 
into the comments as fast as you can
it<00:03:00.590> takes<00:03:00.830> a<00:03:00.920> lot<00:03:01.100> longer<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.610> it's<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.820> bit

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
it takes a lot longer and it's a bit

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.610 
it takes a lot longer and it's a bit
more<00:03:02.120> complicated<00:03:02.480> isn't<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.080> maybe<00:03:03.410> it's

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
more complicated isn't it maybe it's

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.020 
more complicated isn't it maybe it's
just<00:03:03.739> because<00:03:04.070> you're<00:03:04.160> not<00:03:04.310> used<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.880> but

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
just because you're not used to it but

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.580 
just because you're not used to it but
if<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.270> were<00:03:05.390> born<00:03:05.600> with<00:03:05.720> only<00:03:05.900> three<00:03:06.230> fingers

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
if you were born with only three fingers

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.760 
if you were born with only three fingers
maybe<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.160> would<00:03:07.370> be<00:03:07.520> would<00:03:08.239> be<00:03:08.510> easier<00:03:09.080> sure

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
maybe you would be would be easier sure

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.160 
maybe you would be would be easier sure
but<00:03:10.550> you<00:03:10.670> would<00:03:10.820> still<00:03:10.940> not<00:03:11.299> be<00:03:11.540> as<00:03:11.660> fast<00:03:11.930> as

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
but you would still not be as fast as

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.380 
but you would still not be as fast as
someone<00:03:12.680> with<00:03:12.799> five<00:03:13.070> fingers<00:03:13.519> and<00:03:13.700> this<00:03:14.209> is

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
someone with five fingers and this is

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.770 
someone with five fingers and this is
just<00:03:14.780> typing<00:03:15.260> now<00:03:15.739> try<00:03:16.160> writing<00:03:16.820> now<00:03:17.420> try

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
just typing now try writing now try

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.620 
just typing now try writing now try
soldering<00:03:18.380> now<00:03:18.890> try<00:03:19.250> eating<00:03:19.519> with<00:03:19.850> chopsticks

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
soldering now try eating with chopsticks

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.449 
soldering now try eating with chopsticks
now<00:03:21.260> try<00:03:21.620> riding<00:03:21.920> with<00:03:22.220> soldered<00:03:22.640> chopsticks

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
now try riding with soldered chopsticks

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.920 
now try riding with soldered chopsticks
so<00:03:25.459> with<00:03:25.580> more<00:03:25.820> fingers<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.420> can<00:03:26.540> see<00:03:26.780> why

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
so with more fingers you can see why

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.660 
so with more fingers you can see why
lombaxes<00:03:27.590> are<00:03:27.739> so<00:03:27.920> good<00:03:28.130> with<00:03:28.250> tech<00:03:28.489> and

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
lombaxes are so good with tech and

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.400 
lombaxes are so good with tech and
weapons<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.150> stuff<00:03:29.360> they<00:03:29.690> can<00:03:29.870> do<00:03:29.989> a<00:03:30.019> lot<00:03:30.380> more

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
weapons and stuff they can do a lot more

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.259 
weapons and stuff they can do a lot more
things<00:03:30.650> easily<00:03:31.190> that<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.820> rest<00:03:32.030> of<00:03:32.180> the

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
things easily that the rest of the

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.729 
things easily that the rest of the
universe<00:03:32.630> would<00:03:32.810> see<00:03:32.989> is<00:03:33.110> too<00:03:33.350> complicated

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
universe would see is too complicated

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.100 
universe would see is too complicated
and<00:03:34.190> clumsy<00:03:34.640> this<00:03:34.910> is<00:03:35.030> also<00:03:35.239> why<00:03:35.540> lombaxes

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
and clumsy this is also why lombaxes

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.720 
and clumsy this is also why lombaxes
would<00:03:36.260> always<00:03:36.380> customize<00:03:36.950> things<00:03:37.190> they're

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
would always customize things they're

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.160 
would always customize things they're
living<00:03:38.090> in<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.299> universe<00:03:38.750> where<00:03:38.959> almost

living in a universe where almost

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.770 
living in a universe where almost
everything<00:03:39.799> has<00:03:40.130> three<00:03:40.519> fingers<00:03:40.760> if<00:03:41.180> they

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
everything has three fingers if they

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.840 
everything has three fingers if they
were<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:42.079> buy<00:03:42.170> a<00:03:42.200> gun<00:03:42.530> odds<00:03:42.860> are<00:03:43.220> it's<00:03:43.549> built

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
were to buy a gun odds are it's built

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.759 
were to buy a gun odds are it's built
for<00:03:44.060> someone<00:03:44.390> with<00:03:44.570> three<00:03:44.870> fingers<00:03:45.140> because

for someone with three fingers because

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.190 
for someone with three fingers because
that's<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.220> norm<00:03:46.610> just<00:03:47.180> like<00:03:47.420> how<00:03:47.630> video<00:03:47.840> game

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
that's the norm just like how video game

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.110

have five so if Lombax has ever want to

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.870 
have five so if Lombax has ever want to
use<00:04:09.890> their<00:04:10.070> weapons<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.549> their<00:04:10.640> full

use their weapons to their full

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.150 
use their weapons to their full
capability<00:04:11.480> they'd<00:04:11.959> need<00:04:12.170> to<00:04:12.350> modify<00:04:12.799> it<00:04:12.860> to

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
capability they'd need to modify it to

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.580

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
make room for their extra fingers or to

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.440 
make room for their extra fingers or to
modify<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:16.130> more<00:04:16.430> so<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:16.880> make<00:04:17.000> it<00:04:17.120> so<00:04:17.270> each

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
modify it more so and make it so each

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.449 
modify it more so and make it so each
finger<00:04:17.870> movement

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
finger movement

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.640

something<00:04:18.910> different<00:04:19.299> so<00:04:19.630> now<00:04:19.660> if<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.350> are<00:04:20.380> in

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
something different so now if you are in

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.219 
something different so now if you are in
a<00:04:20.739> place<00:04:21.039> where<00:04:21.669> everyone<00:04:22.120> compared<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:23.020> you

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
a place where everyone compared to you

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.770 
a place where everyone compared to you
is<00:04:23.410> slow<00:04:24.100> at<00:04:24.370> doing<00:04:24.669> things<00:04:24.940> like<00:04:25.090> typing<00:04:25.660> on<00:04:25.750> a

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780

keyboard holding things pressing buttons
firing<00:04:28.690> weapons<00:04:29.050> then<00:04:29.560> odds<00:04:29.860> are<00:04:30.220> you<00:04:30.639> have<00:04:30.669> an

firing weapons then odds are you have an

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.120

advantage over most of them and with

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.770 
advantage over most of them and with
that<00:04:33.280> advantage<00:04:33.820> you're<00:04:34.300> not<00:04:34.539> necessarily

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
that advantage you're not necessarily

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.969 
that advantage you're not necessarily
more<00:04:35.440> intelligent<00:04:36.130> but<00:04:36.520> as<00:04:36.759> a<00:04:37.060> species<00:04:37.419> you

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
more intelligent but as a species you

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.770 
more intelligent but as a species you
advanced<00:04:38.979> faster<00:04:39.759> because<00:04:40.270> you<00:04:40.389> can<00:04:40.570> do

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
advanced faster because you can do

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.560 
advanced faster because you can do
things<00:04:41.080> faster<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:41.800> less<00:04:42.400> clumsily<00:04:42.910> right

faster thus transfer information faster

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.700 
faster thus transfer information faster
thus<00:04:45.910> advanced<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.509> computers<00:04:47.020> faster<00:04:47.470> the

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
thus advanced to computers faster the

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.749 
thus advanced to computers faster the
stipe<00:04:48.039> faster

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
stipe faster

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.700
