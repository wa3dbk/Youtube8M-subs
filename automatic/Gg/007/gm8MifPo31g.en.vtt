whatever it'll be the same and then just
hope<00:02:18.900> then<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.200> looked<00:02:19.380> at<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> few<00:02:19.800> times<00:02:21.590> into

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
hope then you looked at a few times into

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.820 
hope then you looked at a few times into
it's<00:02:22.860> nice<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.430> strong<00:02:23.849> so<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:25.410> way<00:02:25.680> that

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
it's nice and strong so that way that

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.430 
it's nice and strong so that way that
the<00:02:25.980> hair<00:02:26.190> will<00:02:28.069> take<00:02:29.069> two

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.470 

I'm<00:02:34.920> going<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.160> keep<00:02:35.400> sewing<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.090> needle<00:02:36.330> and

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
I'm going to keep sewing the needle and

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.550 
I'm going to keep sewing the needle and
I'm<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:37.190> probably<00:02:38.190> saw<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.580> thrift<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.270> the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
I'm I probably saw the thrift of the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.170 
I'm I probably saw the thrift of the
with<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.590> length<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.370> little<00:02:41.640> clip<00:02:41.910> about

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
with a length and a little clip about

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.380 
with a length and a little clip about
like<00:02:42.390> five<00:02:42.720> times<00:02:42.990> with<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.560> because<00:02:44.390> that

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
like five times with it because that

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.350 
like five times with it because that
just<00:02:45.420> makes<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.900> way<00:02:46.700> stronger<00:02:47.700> for<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.120> guys

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
just makes it way stronger for you guys

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.080 
just makes it way stronger for you guys
so<00:02:50.030> stay<00:02:51.030> clipped<00:02:51.300> into<00:02:51.510> her<00:02:51.750> even<00:02:51.990> longer<00:02:52.230> and

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
so stay clipped into her even longer and

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.460 
so stay clipped into her even longer and
you<00:02:54.090> might<00:02:54.270> want<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.540> go<00:02:54.690> in<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:55.110> way<00:02:55.320> you

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
you might want to go in this way you

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.770 
you might want to go in this way you
know<00:02:55.500> keep<00:02:55.800> going<00:02:56.070> in<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.220> way<00:02:56.550> when<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.630> go

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
know keep going in this way when you go

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.830 
know keep going in this way when you go
on<00:02:57.840> through<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.200> way<00:02:59.300> make<00:03:00.300> sure<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.570> lift

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
on through this way make sure you lift

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.360 
on through this way make sure you lift
the<00:03:01.620> thread<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.130> it'll<00:03:02.280> go<00:03:02.820> upward<00:03:04.130> not<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.280> the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
the thread so it'll go upward not to the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.940 
the thread so it'll go upward not to the
site<00:03:05.580> if<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.910> go<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.240> site<00:03:06.420> its<00:03:06.890> kind<00:03:07.890> of

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
site if you go to the site its kind of

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.290 
site if you go to the site its kind of
whack<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.430> just<00:03:08.580> kind<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:09.000> up<00:03:09.150> the

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
whack it just kind of up the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.660 
whack it just kind of up the
extension<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:09.930> just<00:03:10.140> try<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.380> keep<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.890> for

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
extension so just try to keep that for

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.910 
extension so just try to keep that for
the<00:03:11.760> top<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.600> once<00:03:12.780> you've<00:03:12.900> done<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.170> this<00:03:13.860> way

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
the top and once you've done it this way

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.340 
the top and once you've done it this way
a<00:03:14.130> few<00:03:14.370> times<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:15.630> might<00:03:15.810> want<00:03:15.990> to<00:03:16.050> take<00:03:16.200> your

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
a few times you might want to take your

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.800 
a few times you might want to take your
needle<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.770> take<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.100> little<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.780> stick<00:03:18.780> it

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
needle and take the little and stick it

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.830 
needle and take the little and stick it
in<00:03:18.990> this<00:03:19.320> way<00:03:19.500> now<00:03:20.270> just<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.360> give<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.720> little

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
in this way now just to give it a little

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.350 
in this way now just to give it a little
bit<00:03:22.080> more<00:03:22.290> strength<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:23.610> you<00:03:23.910> might<00:03:24.090> want<00:03:24.180> to

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
bit more strength and you might want to

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.610 
bit more strength and you might want to
go<00:03:24.450> buy<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.630> few<00:03:25.230> times<00:03:26.150> see<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:28.380> all<00:03:28.530> that's

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
go buy a few times see and all that's

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
go buy a few times see and all that's
going<00:03:28.860> to<00:03:28.890> do<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.160> just<00:03:29.190> make<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:31.550> extension<00:03:32.550> a

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
going to do is just make the extension a

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.900 
going to do is just make the extension a
little<00:03:32.910> stronger<00:03:33.360> than<00:03:33.740> just<00:03:34.740> having<00:03:34.860> one<00:03:35.160> it

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
little stronger than just having one it

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.270 
little stronger than just having one it
goes<00:03:36.090> in<00:03:36.120> twice<00:03:36.570> double<00:03:37.110> reach<00:03:37.680> like<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.040> few

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
goes in twice double reach like a few

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.370 
goes in twice double reach like a few
that<00:03:38.489> just<00:03:38.700> makes<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.270> lot<00:03:39.780> stronger<00:03:40.110> that

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
that just makes it a lot stronger that

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.740 
that just makes it a lot stronger that
without<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.770> hair<00:03:40.950> will<00:03:41.100> stay<00:03:41.340> on<00:03:41.520> a<00:03:41.790> bit

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
without the hair will stay on a bit

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.650 
without the hair will stay on a bit
longer<00:03:46.520> want<00:03:47.520> to<00:03:47.610> show<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:47.820> guys<00:03:47.970> that<00:03:48.090> before

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.590 
depending on how many Clips you want to
do<00:04:16.470> so<00:04:16.950> this<00:04:17.190> is<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.340> smaller<00:04:17.700> piece<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.150> used<00:04:18.359> two

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
do so this is a smaller piece I used two

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.479 
do so this is a smaller piece I used two
clips<00:04:18.930> only<00:04:19.260> there<00:04:19.890> was<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.040> little<00:04:20.340> wider

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
clips only there was a little wider

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.850 
clips only there was a little wider
piece<00:04:20.850> then<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.720> would<00:04:21.989> probably<00:04:22.140> use<00:04:22.350> three

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
piece then I would probably use three

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.250 
piece then I would probably use three
clips<00:04:23.100> but<00:04:23.340> since<00:04:23.520> it's<00:04:23.669> a<00:04:23.760> smaller<00:04:24.000> piece<00:04:24.300> are

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
clips but since it's a smaller piece are

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.850 
clips but since it's a smaller piece are
only<00:04:25.530> used<00:04:25.800> too<00:04:25.950> many<00:04:26.070> troops

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.999
