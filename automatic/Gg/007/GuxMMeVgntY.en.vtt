00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.860
 hello everyone was fought ends 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.920
 we found in the main craft lap top 14 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.990
 w 20 bs has today published judge by the 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.550
 moyan team and good is news 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.470
 pretty short but I bring a thing 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.170
 quite novel is already the possibility 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.759
 to put on screen titles and titles and 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.830
 Now I will explain how this issue will 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.949
 good is a new command as I say 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.119
 it's called title in English title and good 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.499
 we will have to put the command that 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.210
 it seems already all in question how 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.890
 it would work the first thing that we have to 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.440
 put a name for example the 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.090
 My character Julio Fis and we will put a 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.440
 title we put the command title again 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.830
 and the first title would be for example 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.210
 Welcome, welcome, as 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.530
 says that the command has been put 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.660
 correctly I understand them screen no 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.550
 there it is and we can also put a 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.920
 subtitle is to say here change title 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.920
 we put title and we welcome 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.079
 greetings for example good we are going to 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.670
 greetings greetings 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.530
 there is how you see perfect and now 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.110
 I put the subtitle and they will appear 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.520
 when you put the title in question there 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.259
 are both welcome and from under the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.880
 subtitle for it you have to put the 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.950
 first command of the entire title as 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.680
 we see here the two appear together and 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.299
 as you see there is a period of entry is 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.880
 say they challenge you a time to appear and 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.399
 in fade and that is controlled with the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.680
 command time is to say here we put time 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.750
 there are times we will have to put 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.850
 second seconds seconds the one that is 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.950
 on screen the title and the subtitle and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.390
 seconds of exit the second are counted 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.909
 of 10 in 10 is to say this would be a 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.060
 second for example let's put 20 2 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.590
 input seconds 5 seconds that are 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.149
 on screen and then 2 seconds to 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.700
 to go away and once put it 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.289
 we put the title as you see take the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.090
 second will appear without screen 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.289
 of the two seconds disappears the same 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.880
 happens with the subtitle we're going to put 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.940
 subtitles here 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.100
 subtitles and that we've put this 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.270
 according to 10 for example back 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.360
 hello goodbye 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.000
 Welcome to God is quite simple 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.120
 and really as I say here to compose 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.700
 title and you're doing tests that 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.230
 You can accept the teachers you want and how 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.950
 I already say to reset what basically 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.840
 put 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.390
 to see if it 's title 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.430
 efe there it is and it is prescribed there is no 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.709
 no subtitle title and good as 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.390
 I say investigate for your own 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.010
 mind that I highly recommend this 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.720
 then he commanded to molar enough for the 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.640
 departments entered only one and 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.069
 suddenly appear welcome I do not know where 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.870
 things like that are pretty cool and we'll see 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.069
 that will not be the most makers and good 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.500
 apart from this new command I have also 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.390
 made changes with the word border and 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.920
 you know that when we were outside the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.450
 word border we were caught not us 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.760
 we could move but they have changed it and 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.150
 thanks for the word border to see word 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.470
 border being for example I'm going to put 50 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.430
 blocks 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.620
 a little less good here is block and 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.600
 As you can see u I'm not out 20 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.700
 blocks now I'm out but without moving 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.210
 previously this did not happen and already 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.440
 can do and in mode his ritual to do 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.470
 also presented with moving captain tote 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.820
 we see it now incites away when 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.310
 you start hurting instead 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.140
 about and will begin to take off the damage and 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.730
 you can get in but we put power 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.650
 come out we can here basically it's like 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.850
 to be outside but come try 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.260
 has entered if you will not die if you 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.780
 you are basically the way 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.880
 done and good good let's put it now 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.890
 this far away I do not even want to see you 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.130
 word border and finally he has made 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.780
 a change with respect to the mode 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.890
 viewer and back mode is already that 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.510
 now we can run also when 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.730
 let's investigate from before 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.830
 it did not go down we went down pretty much 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.630
 fast also something that did not happen before 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.880
 and in the change that he has made and 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.230
 is and well we have the option of no 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.660
 pretty short I recommend a lot 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.520
 you use the title command that you investigate 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.380
 let's try it a lot there is 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.120
 many uses to see with blocks of 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.410
 more and as I say we're going to see a lot with 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.280
 the pet adventures that in between is a 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.650
 zone tell the castle 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.360
 a map inspired by history 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.720
 medieval for example by putting a 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.370
 example 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.350
 we go very cool as I say and we do 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.209
 to be able to put colors and others but that 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.580
 at the moment something I do not know how to master those 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.410
 colors put colors to the letters but 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.050
 as I say I'm investigating that it's cool 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.730
 investigate and it costs nothing and well this 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.440
 comes if not today's snacks I hope that 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.359
 you liked it and if so, thanks for 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.250
 your comment say here I did not start a 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.860
 new series a series of a map 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.230
 pretty scary I'll leave it here 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.880
 down and it 's with my little face I go from the 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.860
 video and it scared me a lot of people is 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.480
 beni river but is that the map scares a 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.760
 heap and as I say you will have the video 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.440
 here below is the most value format and 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.460
 Well, I recommend you go and nothing more if 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.140
 do you like the video thanks for your 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.600
 comment and see you in the next 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.600
 video up another goodbye
