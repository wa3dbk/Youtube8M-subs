this<00:01:07.640> exfoliating<00:01:08.640> polish<00:01:08.880> really<00:01:09.420> helps<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
this exfoliating polish really helps to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.770 
this exfoliating polish really helps to
buffer<00:01:10.380> off<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.890> dead<00:01:11.070> skin<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:12.180> prepare<00:01:12.570> your

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
buffer off the dead skin to prepare your

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.190 
buffer off the dead skin to prepare your
skin<00:01:13.049> for<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.439> day<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:14.030> wouldn't<00:01:15.030> say<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.570> makes

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
skin for the day I wouldn't say it makes

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.859 
skin for the day I wouldn't say it makes
it<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.830> put<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.159> makeup<00:01:17.750> but<00:01:18.750> it

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
it so you can put on makeup but it

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.780 
it so you can put on makeup but it
definitely<00:01:19.350> takes<00:01:19.830> away<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> lot<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
definitely takes away a lot of the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.929 
definitely takes away a lot of the
flakey<00:01:21.210> skin<00:01:21.619> generally<00:01:22.619> after<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.700> put

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
flakey skin generally after this I put

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.539 
flakey skin generally after this I put
on<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> creams<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.960> don't<00:01:25.770> put<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:25.979> any<00:01:26.189> makeup

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
on the creams I don't put on any makeup

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.980 
on the creams I don't put on any makeup
just<00:01:27.030> mascara<00:01:29.299> hopefully<00:01:30.299> after<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> six

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
just mascara hopefully after the six

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.780 
just mascara hopefully after the six
weeks<00:01:31.079> when<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> peeling<00:01:31.890> subside<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.610> can

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
weeks when the peeling subside I can

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.300 
weeks when the peeling subside I can
start<00:01:33.240> my<00:01:33.390> normal<00:01:33.780> makeup<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.320> before<00:01:35.130> that

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
start my normal makeup but before that

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.830 
start my normal makeup but before that
you<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.820> don't<00:01:36.000> want<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.329> put<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.570> makeup

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
you really don't want to put on makeup

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.300 
you really don't want to put on makeup
because<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.530> really<00:01:37.770> will<00:01:38.159> make

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
because it just really will make

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.850 
because it just really will make
everything<00:01:38.670> look<00:01:39.030> worse<00:01:39.329> after<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.200> wash<00:01:40.560> my

a moisturizer I put it on usually I'm
burning<00:02:13.769> after<00:02:14.099> I<00:02:14.160> put<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.670> brighten<00:02:15.000> eggs

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
burning after I put on the brighten eggs

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.990 
burning after I put on the brighten eggs
and<00:02:15.480> after<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.410> brighten<00:02:16.620> X<00:02:16.860> dries<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.580> put<00:02:17.849> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
and after the brighten X dries I put the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.820

daily<00:02:18.360> power<00:02:18.540> defense<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.260> just<00:02:19.500> sort<00:02:19.769> of

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
daily power defense and it just sort of

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.350 
daily power defense and it just sort of
soothes<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.670> skin<00:02:21.230> it's<00:02:22.230> also<00:02:22.410> an<00:02:23.360> anti-aging

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
soothes the skin it's also an anti-aging

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.119 
soothes the skin it's also an anti-aging
formula<00:02:24.599> so<00:02:25.080> it's<00:02:25.230> going<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.500> take<00:02:25.709> away<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
formula so it's going to take away the

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.900 
formula so it's going to take away the
fine<00:02:26.370> lines<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.910> wrinkles<00:02:28.129> the<00:02:29.129> next<00:02:29.459> step<00:02:29.670> in

firm eye brightening cream so this is

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.890 
firm eye brightening cream so this is
going<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.530> take<00:02:37.709> away<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.040> dark<00:02:38.280> circles<00:02:38.900> make

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
going to take away the dark circles make

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.660 
going to take away the dark circles make
the<00:02:40.049> eye<00:02:40.200> more<00:02:40.680> bright<00:02:40.739> so<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.519> very
