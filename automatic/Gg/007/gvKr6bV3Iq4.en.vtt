one thing we're going to add is lift

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.220 
one thing we're going to add is lift
lift<00:05:07.980> breaks<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:09.030> tension<00:05:09.300> of<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:09.750> line<00:05:09.960> on

the water breaks the tension of the line
on<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:27.720> water<00:05:28.580> then<00:05:29.580> keep<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:30.150> rod<00:05:30.330> tip

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620

horizontal<00:05:32.000> I'm<00:05:33.000> gonna<00:05:33.240> sweep<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:33.960> rod<00:05:34.140> tip

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
horizontal I'm gonna sweep the rod tip

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.310 
horizontal I'm gonna sweep the rod tip
around<00:05:34.910> to<00:05:35.910> where<00:05:36.090> it's<00:05:36.270> perpendicular<00:05:36.750> to<00:05:37.140> my
