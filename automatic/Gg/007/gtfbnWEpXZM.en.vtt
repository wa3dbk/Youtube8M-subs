00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 what antioxidants actually are and 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.220
 what's funny with these free radicals 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.560
 I want you in this video 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.960
 declare free radicals are dangerous 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.030
 unstable molecules that have an electron 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.020
 At first, this is very chemically lacking 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.310
 but free radicals are about that 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.340
 one of the worst evil for the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.960
 body lead to free radical thus 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.269
 aging processes and partly also 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.099
 to cell death or can cell function 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.900
 Restrict antioxidants then 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.029
 again these super powers and quasi 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.890
 a police can say so ours 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.630
 good police the free radicals 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.880
 capture them so they can 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.520
 donate electrons temporarily without 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.290
 itself to become radical in the free and 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.670
 then the free radicals 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.800
 make harmless when it comes to 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.920
 aging processes and co then applies the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.760
 free radicals so the main offenders 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.079
 antioxidants are thus very much 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.700
 useful for your health because you 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.649
 these free radicals as I said before 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.629
 idle and help us 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.530
 boys stay free of illnesses 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.809
 and so on 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.640
 There are quite a few antioxidant vegetables 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.530
 and fruits are free radicals 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.270
 but can also be desired in the body 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.769
 because they are not just negative 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.600
 characteristics but also a few 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.460
 positive and that can 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.799
 inhibit inflammatory processes in the body 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.409
 or aggressive, for example 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.820
 make bacteria and viruses harmless 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.680
 surely you are already whole 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.700
 curious about which antioxidants there are 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.650
 and i have such a row 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.600
 I selected you now briefly 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.950
 I do not want to see you now 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.840
 all on you I just want to have 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.759
 a few well-known say that you like that 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.530
 just know what that is and 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.060
 where it is in there and in the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.409
 you can research it yourself then so 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.110
 gives, for example, vitamin C and vitamin 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.780
 e vitamin c pretty much in all 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.729
 fruits and vegetables included and 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.100
 For example, vitamin E is one of those 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.600
 high quality oils such as wheat germ or 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.830
 lend 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.380
 included then there are for example 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.110
 mutation and opc are both very 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.000
 very strong antioxidants station is 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.920
 For example, such a drive is ebbing and has 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.590
 the very special feature that 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.049
 vitamin c itself as a free radical scavenger 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.810
 put back into active form 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.880
 if it is a free radical 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.640
 has caught and so on more free 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.860
 radical can be done and the opc it 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.479
 included in grape seed , for example 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.030
 that is also available as a preparation that it 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.709
 a very famous antioxidant then 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.110
 there are still allicin that this is such a 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.310
 called sulfide which for example 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.200
 guess so many times 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.050
 where are the included eg in onions 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.880
 leek or the knobi is eg the 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.530
 carotenoids around the let themselves again 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.060
 various groups are divided 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.470
 for example here the lycopene 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.450
 that's cooked, for example 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.430
 tomatoes contain this beta 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.680
 Carotene are so orange in the first place 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.590
 Ground vegetables contain this yuko pina 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.120
 For example, it has a positive effect 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.100
 Prostate cancer can also be preventive 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.780
 Many cancers can be used against prostate cancer 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.880
 and so on, that will be eaten 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.370
 probably the strongest antioxidant 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.950
 the astaxanthin, for example, in the dax 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.630
 is contained or in seafood and 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.100
 also keep so we do not have to 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.680
 eat fish that we get that and 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.420
 the carotenoid thus making the vegetables and 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.239
 The fruit orange is so for example 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.769
 as beta carotene also in carrots or 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.670
 in sweet potatoes 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.590
 then there is, for example, the 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.299
 phytoestrogens which are secondary 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.880
 Plant substances belong to that is to 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.560
 example soy or flaxseed and so on 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.209
 continue and contain quasi 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.859
 herbal hormones and there are 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.940
 for example, the social 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.500
 are also among the secondary 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.810
 plant substances that are for example 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.030
 contained in the dark grapes or to 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.980
 for example, if I'm not mistaken, then 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.510
 antioxidants are in very many 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.769
 Foods contain no matter if it is now 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.230
 Cucumbers would be tomatoes of high quality oils 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.880
 are or fruits like for example 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.670
 mangos papayas press wild plants 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.690
 any salad greens 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.590
 sprouted 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.610
 a ginger turmeric cumin teas 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.450
 almonds such things so 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.710
 antioxidants are very many 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.870
 contain food 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.400
 And that's all the food 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.560
 which taste very good and of course 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.600
 it does not always matter 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.240
 how many antioxidants in food 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.980
 but also on how we eg 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.680
 prepare for how long is stored and 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.010
 I have five more tips for that 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.930
 you 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.460
 First, antioxidants always come 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.810
 several times in a food before it 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.210
 So can that be a food 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.340
 not just filled with an antioxidant 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.810
 so it is always best if 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.730
 To eat these foods as naturally as 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.250
 possible consumed in the piece and me 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.380
 as a preparation because antioxidants 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.050
 vitamins also act synergistically 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.940
 means they enhance their effect 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.280
 you are each other with number two 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.560
 Should these products be so fresh 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.870
 and processed as gently as possible 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.090
 do not eat so fresh, so to speak, not too long 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.070
 stored and gently means that you 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.140
 do not fry the vegetables so much 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.340
 black tastes you pay attention to shit 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.140
 on the quality it should be on everyone 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.630
 be regional and if you know 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.040
 that really bio in there where bio on it 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.210
 then preferably this food 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.220
 because they clearly have more 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.840
 antioxidants then plant themselves 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.660
 for example, have to protect yourself from 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.450
 Rather, any pest needs to 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.100
 Defensive forces develop quasi and others 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.860
 plants to be protected 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.230
 plant toxins and so on who have 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.570
 usually not so much more needed 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.880
 to develop antioxidants so the 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.770
 Planting where then high quality 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.690
 they definitely have more 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.340
 antioxidants vegetable fruits and the 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.110
 things that contain antioxidants 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.610
 be should be stored properly to 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.539
 heard z 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.759
 that bananas are not in the refrigerator 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.379
 For example, he also owns avocados 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.810
 kept outside the fridge 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:29.590
 The last tip is organic vegetables 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:31.449
 what was not sprayed that was 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.610
 You should be the best with peel is only 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.650
 possible because then you have the quasi 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.360
 most of the antioxidants are stuck 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.780
 most in the shell or immediately 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.250
 among them 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.930
 I hope my tips were helpful 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.830
 for you and if so I would go over 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.460
 to roll a yard 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.460
 bye for now
