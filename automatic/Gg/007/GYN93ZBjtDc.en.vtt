00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
have a very good clear shot of it it's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.660 
have a very good clear shot of it it's
gonna<00:01:34.619> come<00:01:34.829> right<00:01:34.950> over<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.310> road<00:01:35.460> it's

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
gonna come right over the road it's

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.819 
gonna come right over the road it's
actually<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.270> very<00:01:36.810> strong<00:01:37.110> location<00:01:37.680> right

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
actually just very strong location right

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.539 
actually just very strong location right
now<00:01:39.710> looks<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:40.770> yeah<00:01:40.979> definitely<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
now looks like yeah definitely like a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.090 
now looks like yeah definitely like a
very<00:01:41.729> low<00:01:42.000> base<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:43.439> they're<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.649> pretty<00:01:43.860> wide

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
very low base so they're on pretty wide

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.700 
very low base so they're on pretty wide
base<00:01:44.369> Centerton<00:01:45.079> yeah<00:01:51.110> all<00:01:52.110> right<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.560> yeah

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
base Centerton yeah all right so yeah

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.980 
base Centerton yeah all right so yeah
yeah<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.189> here's<00:01:53.399> one<00:01:53.520> Tennessee<00:01:54.450> East<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.750> it

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
yeah so here's one Tennessee East in it

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.270 
yeah so here's one Tennessee East in it
this<00:01:55.259> isn't<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.770> area<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.159> we're

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
this isn't of the area that we're

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.190 
this isn't of the area that we're
looking<00:01:56.310> at<00:01:56.640> right<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:56.939> through<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.090> low<00:01:57.869> low

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
looking at right in through here low low

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200 
looking at right in through here low low
low<00:01:58.500> hanging<00:01:59.040> wall<00:01:59.399> cloud<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.909> through<00:02:00.060> here

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
low hanging wall cloud and through here

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.539 
low hanging wall cloud and through here
almost<00:02:00.479> down<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> ground<00:02:01.079> looks<00:02:01.409> like<00:02:01.590> it

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
almost down to the ground looks like it

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.310 
almost down to the ground looks like it
doesn't<00:02:03.090> appear<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.509> there's<00:02:03.899> condensation

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
doesn't appear that there's condensation

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.370 
doesn't appear that there's condensation
all<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.979> way<00:02:05.070> down

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
all the way down

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.960 
all the way down
so<00:02:05.439> it's<00:02:05.560> kind<00:02:05.740> of<00:02:05.799> coming<00:02:06.340> up<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:06.729> down<00:02:06.850> we

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
so it's kind of coming up and down we

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.930 
so it's kind of coming up and down we
didn't<00:02:07.210> see<00:02:07.420> anything<00:02:08.319> in<00:02:08.830> terms<00:02:09.009> of<00:02:09.310> really

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
didn't see anything in terms of really

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.910 
didn't see anything in terms of really
strong<00:02:10.179> rotation<00:02:10.810> at<00:02:10.899> least<00:02:11.050> from<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.380> from

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
strong rotation at least from the from

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.100 
strong rotation at least from the from
the<00:02:12.040> radar<00:02:12.400> perspective<00:02:12.970> here<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.900> looked

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
the radar perspective here it looked

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.449 
the radar perspective here it looked
like<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.380> was<00:02:14.440> up<00:02:14.620> pretty<00:02:14.770> high<00:02:15.040> but<00:02:15.250> now<00:02:15.430> I

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
like it was up pretty high but now I

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.290 
like it was up pretty high but now I
just<00:02:15.640> get<00:02:15.880> me<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.030> scan<00:02:16.239> look<00:02:16.420> at<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:18.300> it's

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
just get me a scan look at that it's

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.110 
just get me a scan look at that it's
definitely<00:02:19.959> really<00:02:20.260> really<00:02:20.819> rotating<00:02:21.819> strong

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
definitely really really rotating strong

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.699 
definitely really really rotating strong
yeah<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.870> looks<00:02:23.020> like<00:02:23.050> it's<00:02:23.290> trying<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.530> pull

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
yeah it looks like it's trying to pull

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.960 
yeah it looks like it's trying to pull
back<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.190> little<00:02:24.459> bit<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:27.550> looks<00:02:27.730> like<00:02:27.850> it's

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
back in a little bit it looks like it's

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.309 
back in a little bit it looks like it's
trying<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.180> pull<00:02:28.300> back<00:02:28.450> in<00:02:28.630> again<00:02:28.840> okay<00:02:29.260> so

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
trying to pull back in again okay so

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.229 
trying to pull back in again okay so
what<00:02:29.560> we're<00:02:29.770> watching<00:02:29.800> here<00:02:30.250> again<00:02:30.489> Tim<00:02:31.090> is

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
what we're watching here again Tim is

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.250 
what we're watching here again Tim is
that<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.110> west<00:02:32.350> of<00:02:32.580> Lake<00:02:33.580> Crystal

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
that just to the west of Lake Crystal

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.990 
that just to the west of Lake Crystal
watching<00:02:35.260> again<00:02:36.010> this<00:02:36.160> lowering<00:02:36.700> right<00:02:36.880> in

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
watching again this lowering right in

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.190 
watching again this lowering right in
through<00:02:37.150> here<00:02:37.300> certainly<00:02:37.600> could<00:02:37.810> be<00:02:37.959> a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
through here certainly could be a

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.320 
through here certainly could be a
tornado<00:02:39.130> you<00:02:39.280> see<00:02:39.519> them<00:02:39.640> tornado<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.030> couple<00:02:40.269> of

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
tornado you see them tornado a couple of

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.520 
tornado you see them tornado a couple of
times<00:02:40.480> let's<00:02:40.720> drop<00:02:40.840> down<00:02:41.050> these<00:02:41.140> briefly

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
times let's drop down these briefly

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.440 
times let's drop down these briefly
little<00:02:41.830> brief<00:02:42.010> touchdowns<00:02:42.519> here<00:02:42.790> looks

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
little brief touchdowns here looks

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.410 
little brief touchdowns here looks
pretty<00:02:44.340> sparsely<00:02:45.340> popular<00:02:45.819> second<00:02:46.120> part<00:02:46.360> of

blocking<00:02:51.610> our<00:02:51.910> view<00:02:51.940> but<00:02:52.330> then<00:02:52.959> what<00:02:53.080> are<00:02:53.140> you

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
blocking our view but then what are you

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
blocking our view but then what are you
seeing<00:02:53.410> right<00:02:53.560> now<00:02:55.350> directly<00:02:56.350> straight<00:02:56.830> north

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220

of<00:02:57.340> us<00:02:57.400> right<00:02:57.640> now<00:02:57.670> still<00:02:58.030> rapidly<00:02:58.450> rotating

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
of us right now still rapidly rotating

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.759 
of us right now still rapidly rotating
I'm<00:03:01.060> not<00:03:01.269> seeing<00:03:01.569> any<00:03:01.720> kind<00:03:02.019> of<00:03:02.140> funnels<00:03:02.680> or

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
I'm not seeing any kind of funnels or

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.600 
I'm not seeing any kind of funnels or
anything<00:03:02.920> like<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.220> it's<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.819> broad<00:03:04.090> rotation

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
anything like that it's a broad rotation

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.850
