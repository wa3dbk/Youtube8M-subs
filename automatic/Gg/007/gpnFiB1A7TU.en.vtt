00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
charges really quickly so that might be

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.380 
charges really quickly so that might be
a<00:00:29.070> consideration<00:00:29.429> haven't<00:00:29.849> used<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.179> one

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
a consideration haven't used this one

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.630 
a consideration haven't used this one
yet<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.080> previous<00:00:31.529> probable<00:00:32.369> charges

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
yet but the previous probable charges

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.389 
yet but the previous probable charges
that<00:00:32.730> I've<00:00:32.820> used<00:00:32.940> before<00:00:33.059> they<00:00:34.130> take<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> little

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
that I've used before they take a little

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.869 
that I've used before they take a little
bit<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.610> time<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.940> charge<00:00:36.149> up<00:00:36.920> so<00:00:37.920> that's<00:00:38.399> one

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
bit of time to charge up so that's one

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.690 
bit of time to charge up so that's one
is<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.570> DC<00:00:39.840> 16<00:00:40.649> not<00:00:41.219> going<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.399> look<00:00:41.489> at<00:00:41.610> that

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
is the DC 16 not going to look at that

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.920 
is the DC 16 not going to look at that
in<00:00:42.390> detail<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:43.110> that's<00:00:43.260> what<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.500> looks<00:00:43.680> like

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
in detail but that's what it looks like

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
in detail but that's what it looks like
we<00:00:45.930> are<00:00:45.960> recording<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.440> by<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> way<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
we are recording this by the way on the

own you don't need to press it like with
some<00:01:31.110> other<00:01:32.119> charges<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.240> i<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:34.880> looking

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
some other charges that i have looking

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.819 
some other charges that i have looking
at<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.000> bottom<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.390> got<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.750> couple<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.409> USB

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.830 
at the bottom you got a couple of USB
ports<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.909> i'm<00:01:39.030> guessing<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.540> use<00:01:39.689> this

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
at the same time not sure how to try it

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.929 
at the same time not sure how to try it
yet<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:44.100> charged<00:01:44.880> with<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.840> micro<00:01:46.500> USB<00:01:46.939> you

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.840 
or apple ones for android but i don't
really<00:01:55.140> think<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.530> matters<00:01:55.710> what<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.670> put

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
really think that matters what you put

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.980 
really think that matters what you put
into<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:58.520> these<00:01:59.520> are<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.180> supplied<00:02:00.570> heads

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
into that these are the supplied heads

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.359 
into that these are the supplied heads
because<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.799> don't<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:03.000> micro<00:02:03.659> USB

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
because you don't just have a micro USB

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.669 
because you don't just have a micro USB
cable<00:02:05.369> as<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.570> do<00:02:06.689> with<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.170> DC<00:02:08.129> 16<00:02:09.080> of<00:02:10.080> one<00:02:10.590> of

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679
