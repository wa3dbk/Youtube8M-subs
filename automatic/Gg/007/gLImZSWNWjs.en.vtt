when<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.180> log<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.799> believe<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.700> could<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.150> some

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
when I log in I believe it could be some

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.960 
when I log in I believe it could be some
Blizzard<00:01:16.590> stuff<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.580> choose

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
Blizzard stuff like that but I choose

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.260 
Blizzard stuff like that but I choose
this<00:01:18.030> character<00:01:18.630> straight<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.799> 80<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
this character straight up to 80 and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.399 
this character straight up to 80 and
you're<00:01:21.270> getting<00:01:21.479> some<00:01:21.780> gear<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.170> stuff<00:01:22.290> like

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
you're getting some gear and stuff like

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.929 
you're getting some gear and stuff like
that<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.799> think<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.150> let's<00:01:24.270> log<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:25.880> this<00:01:26.880> is

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
that I think so let's log in this is

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.740 
that I think so let's log in this is
like<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:28.560> minimum<00:01:29.040> stage<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.909> downloadables

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
that's it I think it's pretty cool but I

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.260 
that's it I think it's pretty cool but I
don't<00:02:01.320> always<00:02:01.829> enjoy<00:02:01.860> full<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.790> Warcraft<00:02:03.149> I

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
don't always enjoy full of Warcraft I

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.080 
don't always enjoy full of Warcraft I
think<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.719> pretty<00:02:04.469> much<00:02:04.799> boring<00:02:05.130> game<00:02:05.430> and

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
think it's a pretty much boring game and

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.550 
think it's a pretty much boring game and
it's<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:07.110> about<00:02:07.680> farming<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:09.410> stuff<00:02:10.410> like

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
it's just about farming and stuff like

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.199 
it's just about farming and stuff like
that<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:11.129> don't<00:02:11.160> really<00:02:11.610> take<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.000> because

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
that and I don't really take it because

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.430 
that and I don't really take it because
it<00:02:12.390> takes<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.840> lot<00:02:13.140> of

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
