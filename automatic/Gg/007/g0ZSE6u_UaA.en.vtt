00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
keeping this in my purse and I just pop

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.430 
keeping this in my purse and I just pop
it<00:06:38.640> on<00:06:38.730> before<00:06:38.850> I<00:06:39.060> go<00:06:39.240> somewhere<00:06:39.510> cuz<00:06:40.110> it's<00:06:40.260> not

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
it on before I go somewhere cuz it's not

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.440 
it on before I go somewhere cuz it's not
the<00:06:40.590> longest<00:06:41.100> lasting<00:06:41.280> fragrance<00:06:41.730> I<00:06:42.240> think

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.450 
the longest lasting fragrance I think

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.390 
the longest lasting fragrance I think
it's<00:06:42.570> best<00:06:42.750> to<00:06:42.990> buy<00:06:43.140> it<00:06:43.200> in<00:06:43.500> the<00:06:43.770> rollerball

it's best to buy it in the rollerball

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.100 
it's best to buy it in the rollerball
because<00:06:45.150> that<00:06:45.480> way<00:06:45.570> you<00:06:45.600> can<00:06:45.870> just<00:06:45.900> keep

because that way you can just keep

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.990 
because that way you can just keep
touching<00:06:46.320> it<00:06:46.500> up<00:06:46.620> throughout<00:06:46.800> the<00:06:46.920> day<00:06:47.070> um<00:06:47.340> but
