00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
 viewers dinner parties 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.780
 had left 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.780
 he sees years I go before and after the go 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.429
 things became 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.670
 and that is that I just want to be really big now pay attention not it 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.849
 amount that did not do but I want to go back to basics 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.669
 and like that today i would like to know to look at european union but i have to 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.250
 more people also think 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.950
 I just want to know how to make a nice dressage for the salad 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.590
 and always good rising 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.690
 well I want that the attention of agents with about 10 percent would be little 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.579
 to put on 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.289
 Okay the base is a vinaigrette audience that is becoming one for us 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.910
 therefor always dressage horse and the base itself 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.130
 it is 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.180
 part 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.820
 as his and 3 this oil 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.250
 part there are what the state is there i am always going to be this year this is out 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.250
 toes are still some oil so if I say if I just say 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.520
 the hundredth 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.530
 milliliters from his neck then I need 310 liters of oil in the freezer but what 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.210
 especially those then again yes I ended up coming home to Pauline there too 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.200
 from 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.530
 now what you want what's new is a whole year because otherwise it goes 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.690
 Immediately to get a job help the actual yes no but one because I knew 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.560
 Saturday I tell myself he replaced throws in Uccle Yes I heard the compass 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.130
 got that has paul years denied his face ucl on the grounds but that is 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.490
 need it tuesday well that is mustard but I am not so much of us 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.540
 could also add a bit to and then the will make sure that the 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.520
 profit margins does not taste too much but this is always the basis 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.570
 it is always the basics using serbia would still think i am there 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.380
 Beyond that is the last word but that is very surprised basis 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.090
 because how do I recreate this is something that is always good 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.829
 but that depends on your choice whereby a year or so we can play a ball 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.020
 bounces is a month earlier than just the end of this month we can be the man 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.030
 had to make a choice 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.759
 in fact you can both do something that you can 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.950
 In addition, honey time would also be a late home for everyone or both 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.479
 In addition, I would say make a scoop or council by extending two spoons 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.380
 to start with 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.320
 what is the French basis to start situation in which is very strong acid 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:09.889
 to make 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.009
 these observations 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.029
 that Dutch people like you set up a profession and that made it perfect 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:18.069
 the netherlands is a country a little powdered sugar or whatever you don't like 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.599
 so quickly small succeeded in softening the youth board in the side net 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.439
 the parties will speak it was driven ff you may well lie 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.459
 To counter such a weird story you must be able to fund it though 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.459
 at work hoegaarden now a sudden how long that lasts remains tied 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.230
 actually if you knock carefully 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.600
 then but that would say never mind but yes 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.560
 and then the hand blender says create bet then he goes though the list is after 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.890
 good but listen it is clear this is always good rest india have now 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.600
 seen in each other I will never forget windhoek 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.460
 i see chart roeselare i have objected american stars today 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.460
 and planets are boss but I will have a lesson every day every week 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:03:00.139
 yes, but it did indeed work well, so I didn't do that without it 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.009
 you're okay then i've been appalling 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:05.680
 if they have accepted 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.719
 understand the dressing 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.299
 throw the dressing well-being 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.859
 and by the way have nice country work I make a bottle by phone at and 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.589
 almelo 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:17.759
 from a company where I have tasted there 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.059
 and that is very nice polder what do you do that 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:21.650
