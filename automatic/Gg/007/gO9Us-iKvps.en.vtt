this is the way that I have beat this

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.709

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
helps you guys beat this level so you

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.980 
helps you guys beat this level so you
can<00:00:18.210> keep<00:00:18.359> on<00:00:18.539> playing

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990

here<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:19.859> go<00:00:20.010> level<00:00:20.340> 170<00:00:21.140> this<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.260> one<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
here we go level 170 this is one of the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.290 
here we go level 170 this is one of the
levels<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:22.980> know<00:00:23.189> where<00:00:23.369> they<00:00:23.460> drop<00:00:23.789> down<00:00:24.090> and

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
levels you know where they drop down and

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.589 
levels you know where they drop down and
then<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.510> got<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.750> move<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.080> around<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
then you got to move it around so the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.060 
then you got to move it around so the
way<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.019> beat<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.260> level<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.769> pretty

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
way that I beat this level is pretty

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.999 
way that I beat this level is pretty
much<00:00:29.279> every<00:00:29.910> time<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.630> number<00:00:31.140> comes<00:00:31.439> down<00:00:31.679> I

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
much every time a number comes down I

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.970 
much every time a number comes down I
tap<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.610> once<00:00:32.910> or<00:00:33.329> twice<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:34.079> make<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.500> small

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
tap it once or twice to make a small

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.959 
tap it once or twice to make a small
space<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:36.300> between<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.989> numbers<00:00:37.670> so<00:00:38.670> that

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
space in between the numbers so that

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.110 
space in between the numbers so that
when<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.540> come<00:00:39.989> back<00:00:40.170> around<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.579> put

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
when you come back around you can put

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.520 
when you come back around you can put
one<00:00:42.590> in<00:00:43.590> between<00:00:44.010> these<00:00:44.370> little<00:00:44.610> spaces<00:00:45.530> I've

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
one in between these little spaces I've

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.410 
one in between these little spaces I've
tried<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.950> many<00:00:46.980> various<00:00:47.579> ways<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.300> have

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
tried it many various ways like I have

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.420 
tried it many various ways like I have
tried<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.719> like<00:00:49.320> go<00:00:49.860> around<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.219> other<00:00:50.340> way

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
tried to like go around the other way

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.850 
tried to like go around the other way
and<00:00:51.059> put<00:00:51.930> them<00:00:52.020> really<00:00:52.170> close<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.590> each<00:00:52.680> other

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and put them really close to each other

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.540 
and put them really close to each other
or<00:00:53.340> I've<00:00:53.640> tried<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.860> put<00:00:55.860> like<00:00:56.010> three<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
or I've tried to put like three on the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.670 
or I've tried to put like three on the
side<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.390> then<00:00:57.600> like<00:00:57.780> go<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.230> between<00:00:58.410> those

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
side and then like go in between those

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.590 
side and then like go in between those
spaces<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.520> none<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.820> those<00:01:00.059> ways<00:01:00.359> have

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
spaces but none of those ways have

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.660 
spaces but none of those ways have
worked<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.559> way<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> beat<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.340> every

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
worked this is the way I beat it every

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.350 
worked this is the way I beat it every
single<00:01:02.820> time<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.629> may<00:01:04.290> take<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.559> few<00:01:04.680> tries

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
single time it may take a few tries

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.520 
single time it may take a few tries
granted<00:01:06.360> like<00:01:06.630> because<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.380> know<00:01:07.470> you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
granted like because it's you know you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.890 
granted like because it's you know you
pretty<00:01:07.860> much<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> timing<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.689> most

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
pretty much the timing is the most

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.070 
pretty much the timing is the most
important<00:01:10.650> part<00:01:11.010> about<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.400> level<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
important part about this level and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.660 
important part about this level and
creating<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.170> space<00:01:13.500> perfectly<00:01:14.220> big<00:01:14.460> enough

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
creating a space perfectly big enough

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.050 
creating a space perfectly big enough
for<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.780> numbers<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.080> fit<00:01:16.409> into<00:01:16.820> if<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.909> get

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
for the numbers to fit into if you get

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.730 
for the numbers to fit into if you get
to<00:01:18.180> about<00:01:18.330> 15<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:19.080> right<00:01:19.259> here<00:01:19.439> where<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.650> am

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
to about 15 like right here where I am

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.719 
to about 15 like right here where I am
should<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.610> okay<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.290> see<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.400> got<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.610> make

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
should be okay but I see you got to make

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.050 
should be okay but I see you got to make
a<00:01:23.759> space<00:01:24.560> perfectly<00:01:25.560> big<00:01:25.799> enough<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
a space perfectly big enough for the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.210 
a space perfectly big enough for the
numbers<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.960> get<00:01:28.110> into<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.040> those

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
numbers to get into and this is on those

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.950 
numbers to get into and this is on those
levels<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.880> absolutely<00:01:30.390> hate<00:01:30.750> because

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
levels that I absolutely hate because

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.890 
levels that I absolutely hate because
the<00:01:31.290> numbers<00:01:31.560> go<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.890> freaking<00:01:32.280> slow<00:01:32.600> so<00:01:33.600> if

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the numbers go so freaking slow so if

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.899 
the numbers go so freaking slow so if
you<00:01:34.020> mess<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.159> pretty<00:01:35.520> much<00:01:35.610> takes

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
you mess up you know pretty much takes

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.880 
you mess up you know pretty much takes
an<00:01:36.060> hour<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.450> go<00:01:36.869> back<00:01:37.110> around<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
an hour to go back around and do the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.280 
an hour to go back around and do the
same<00:01:38.100> thing<00:01:38.280> over<00:01:38.549> again

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
same thing over again

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.590 
same thing over again
but<00:01:40.310> as<00:01:41.310> long<00:01:41.579> as<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.909> make<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.479> know

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
but as long as you make you know

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.539 
but as long as you make you know
decently<00:01:43.110> size<00:01:43.350> not<00:01:43.619> too<00:01:43.920> big<00:01:43.950> because

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
decently size not too big because

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.340 
decently size not too big because
completely<00:01:45.329> not<00:01:45.479> too<00:01:45.659> big<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.110> don't<00:01:46.229> want

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
completely not too big is you don't want

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.050 
completely not too big is you don't want
to<00:01:46.409> run<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.680> space<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:47.369> if<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.610> get<00:01:47.850> to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
to run out of space but if you get to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.310 
to run out of space but if you get to
like<00:01:48.270> 16<00:01:49.020> or<00:01:49.380> 15<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.610> think<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.329> should<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.689> okay

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
like 16 or 15 I think you should be okay

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.639 
like 16 or 15 I think you should be okay
on<00:01:52.560> going<00:01:52.829> back<00:01:53.040> around<00:01:54.079> but<00:01:55.079> yeah<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.259> used<00:01:55.530> to

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
on going back around but yeah I used to

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.020 
on going back around but yeah I used to
do<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:55.950> one<00:01:56.159> or<00:01:56.280> two<00:01:56.310> taps<00:01:57.140> bug<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.850> like<00:01:59.850> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
do like one or two taps bug and like the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.550 
do like one or two taps bug and like the
reason<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.630> works<00:02:00.930> because<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.439> you

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
reason just this works because if you

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.760 
reason just this works because if you
just<00:02:01.740> if<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.790> do<00:02:02.939> individually<00:02:03.659> event<00:02:04.590> like

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
just if you do individually event like

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.660 
just if you do individually event like
you're<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.280> need<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.520> have

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
you're just going to need to have

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.280 
you're just going to need to have
perfect<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.360> need<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.689> basically<00:02:06.899> have

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
perfect you need to basically have

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.869 
perfect you need to basically have
perfect<00:02:07.680> timing<00:02:07.799> because<00:02:08.250> when<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.700> comes

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
perfect timing because when it comes

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.490 
perfect timing because when it comes
down<00:02:09.119> you're<00:02:09.390> Dean<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.690> go<00:02:09.810> all<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.110> way<00:02:10.289> back

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
down you're Dean to go all the way back

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.710 
down you're Dean to go all the way back
around<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.099> other<00:02:11.250> side<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:12.239> fill<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.569> that

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
around to the other side to fill on that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.320 
around to the other side to fill on that
once

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
once

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.720 
once
I see<00:02:13.540> you've<00:02:13.690> left<00:02:13.930> open<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:15.340> really

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
I see you've left open and it's really

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.800 
I see you've left open and it's really
just<00:02:15.880> impossible<00:02:16.690> I've<00:02:17.620> tried<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:19.270> this<00:02:19.630> is

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
just impossible I've tried so this is

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.230 
just impossible I've tried so this is
the<00:02:19.960> way<00:02:20.110> this<00:02:20.380> is<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.710> method<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:21.400> has

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
the way this is the method that has

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.590 
the way this is the method that has
worked<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:23.020> hope<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.410> works<00:02:23.590> for<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.860> guys<00:02:24.010> too

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
worked I hope it works for you guys too

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.280 
worked I hope it works for you guys too
sometimes<00:02:25.600> it's<00:02:25.750> all<00:02:25.840> about<00:02:25.870> getting<00:02:26.110> lucky

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
sometimes it's all about getting lucky

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.650 
sometimes it's all about getting lucky
like<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.770> little<00:02:26.950> 15<00:02:27.340> right<00:02:27.550> there<00:02:27.820> but<00:02:28.570> yeah

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
like that little 15 right there but yeah

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.900 
like that little 15 right there but yeah
the<00:02:28.780> timing<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.470> pretty<00:02:30.250> much<00:02:30.430> pretty<00:02:30.820> much

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
the timing is pretty much pretty much

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.340 
the timing is pretty much pretty much
have<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.180> keep<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.480> all<00:02:31.690> in<00:02:31.720> mind<00:02:32.020> because

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
have to keep that all in mind because

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.920 
have to keep that all in mind because
it's<00:02:32.500> like<00:02:32.650> okay<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.790> wheel<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.300> still<00:02:34.600> moving

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
it's like okay the wheel is still moving

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.620 
it's like okay the wheel is still moving
and<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:36.130> have<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.430> tap<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:37.090> where<00:02:37.240> it's<00:02:37.450> like

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
and I have to tap it to where it's like

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.870 
and I have to tap it to where it's like
goes<00:02:38.080> perfectly<00:02:38.590> right<00:02:39.010> in<00:02:39.040> between<00:02:39.250> because

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
goes perfectly right in between because

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.040 
goes perfectly right in between because
you<00:02:40.030> don't<00:02:40.180> want<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.450> touch<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.600> next<00:02:40.900> one

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
you don't want it to touch the next one

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.710 
you don't want it to touch the next one
but<00:02:41.740> you<00:02:41.950> also<00:02:42.130> want<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.030> put<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.480> over<00:02:43.600> a

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
but you also want to put it over a

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.380 
but you also want to put it over a
little<00:02:43.900> bit<00:02:44.050> more<00:02:44.520> so<00:02:45.520> that<00:02:45.550> it<00:02:45.910> doesn't<00:02:46.240> touch

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
little bit more so that it doesn't touch

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.720 
little bit more so that it doesn't touch
the<00:02:46.570> one<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.020> going<00:02:47.200> over<00:02:47.680> so<00:02:48.580> that's

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
the one that is going over so that's

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.580 
the one that is going over so that's
where<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.120> whole<00:02:49.300> thing<00:02:49.330> like<00:02:49.930> okay<00:02:50.200> making<00:02:50.500> a

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
where the whole thing like okay making a

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.320 
where the whole thing like okay making a
space<00:02:50.830> big<00:02:51.070> enough<00:02:51.310> but<00:02:51.550> not<00:02:51.670> too<00:02:51.880> small

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
space big enough but not too small

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.460 
space big enough but not too small
because<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.780> don't<00:02:52.930> want<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.110> touch<00:02:53.320> either

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
because you don't want to touch either

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.920 
because you don't want to touch either
side<00:02:53.830> but<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.880> really<00:02:55.030> is<00:02:55.150> like<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.510> little

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
side but it really is like that little

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.770 
side but it really is like that little
movement<00:02:56.440> can<00:02:56.590> make<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:57.130> biggest<00:02:57.400> difference

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
movement can make the biggest difference

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.990 
movement can make the biggest difference
like<00:02:58.780> if<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:59.020> hold<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.380> down<00:02:59.530> too<00:02:59.800> long<00:03:00.040> or

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
like if you hold it down too long or

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.460 
like if you hold it down too long or
something<00:03:01.209> like<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.690> like<00:03:01.959> that<00:03:02.020> little

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
something like that like that little

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.720 
something like that like that little
loophole<00:03:02.920> oh<00:03:03.630> all<00:03:04.630> right<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:06.070> there<00:03:06.370> we<00:03:06.520> go

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
loophole oh all right and there we go

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.350 
loophole oh all right and there we go
that<00:03:07.360> is<00:03:07.600> level<00:03:08.250> 174<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.370> guys<00:03:09.550> I<00:03:09.910> hope<00:03:10.180> it
