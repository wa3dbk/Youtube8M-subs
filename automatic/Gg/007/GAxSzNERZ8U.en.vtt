00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:08.490
 Hello dear friends today I want 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.460
 give you some advice when buying 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.269
 polystyrene slabs here on doing 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:20.100
 repair in the kitchen and pasted here such here 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:23.220
 tiles pay attention when buying 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.650
 that you yourself plates were even at the data 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.099
 the plates were not too smart and 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.289
 so they had to putty as in 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.340
 corners 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:39.530
 there were very long distances here 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:45.710
 we have a kitchen ceiling we generally curve 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.710
 This Khrushchev houses that is, he generally 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:55.730
 polystyrene you used to you this is an option 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.730
 budget ceiling upgrade 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.640
 also in the hallway 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:09.960
 also glued tiles from the list without 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.120
 white washable patterns and here we are 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.120
 faced the problem that the tile is very 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:20.220
 thin and shines through it 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.940
 concrete coating glue on which we 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.620
 sticking here had to paint 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:31.190
 water dispersion paints are very 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:33.840
 copy the glue ceiling carefully 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.470
 to push then not to collide with 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:42.780
 problems and in the kitchen niche pecked 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:46.110
 ceiling latex putty glue on 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.710
 put the plates in the usual way 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:55.200
 at 9 points so I also want to show 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:58.200
 first bought here is such a glue 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.229
 he did not like the descendants at all 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.240
 keeps just fall away but this one 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.119
 Ceiling mastic beautiful in the kitchen 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.709
 we will be painted ceiling in the hallway 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:16.970
 concrete and any coating is very good 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.580
 keeps advancing mastic this ethereal 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.910
 Broseks very good he immediately of course 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:29.330
 buy a bucket more from this 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:32.810
 leads to 1 and 3 is not enough for 3 meters 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.000
 the corridor extinguished such an edge with paint 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.940
 halo these sat on the field 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.840
 acrylic paint too 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:47.040
 liked it empty fits well in 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:51.680
 two words overlap everything when 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.870
 gluing the baseboards in the corners 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.140
 can be fastened with pins to be 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.030
 walked smoothly 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.659
 when painting used here such 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.599
 tray 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:06.459
 purchased fixed price it is necessary to say that 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:09.189
 well they work it is very convenient and 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.129
 we can say that it is not disposable 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:14.930
 helped and can be used again 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.689
 Well, that's still all the tips that 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.939
 I wanted to tell you 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:23.109
 when sticking polystyrene plates 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:26.109
 Thank you all very much for your attention 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.109
 goodbye
