defend<00:00:17.670> they<00:00:18.060> have<00:00:18.270> given<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:19.140> module<00:00:19.560> has<00:00:19.770> a

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
defend they have given this module has a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
defend they have given this module has a
16<00:00:20.400> by<00:00:20.580> 9<00:00:20.609> ratio<00:00:21.590> display<00:00:22.590> size<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.130> two

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
16 by 9 ratio display size and two

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.480 
16 by 9 ratio display size and two
millisecond<00:00:24.449> response<00:00:24.570> time<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:26.099> sports

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
millisecond response time and it sports

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.120 
millisecond response time and it sports
an<00:00:26.760> inbuilt<00:00:27.269> speaker<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:28.439> now<00:00:28.650> let<00:00:28.920> us<00:00:28.949> start

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
an inbuilt speaker so now let us start

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.280 
an inbuilt speaker so now let us start
off<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> unboxing<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:32.960> hope<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.110> get

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
off with the unboxing I hope you get

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.229 
off with the unboxing I hope you get
this<00:00:34.469> handle<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.070> think<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:35.880> carry<00:00:36.120> it

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
this handle I think so you can carry it

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.440 
this handle I think so you can carry it
down<00:00:39.170> so<00:00:40.190> at<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> top<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.730> get<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.910> Vijay<00:00:42.390> -

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
down so at the top you get the Vijay -

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.459 
down so at the top you get the Vijay -
Vijay<00:00:42.570> cable<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:47.450> it<00:00:48.450> has<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> hard<00:00:49.110> foam

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
Vijay cable and it has a hard foam

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.630 
Vijay cable and it has a hard foam
packing<00:00:50.100> Oh<00:00:50.750> looks<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.840> some<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.070> broken

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
packing Oh looks like some is broken

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.040 
packing Oh looks like some is broken
here

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
here

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.800 
here
so<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.740> problem<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> hard<00:00:57.000> foam<00:00:57.360> backing

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
so the problem is the hard foam backing

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.490 
so the problem is the hard foam backing
is<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.160> only<00:00:59.280> take<00:00:59.580> one<00:00:59.970> impact<00:01:00.390> ice<00:01:00.690> but

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
is you can only take one impact ice but

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.770 
is you can only take one impact ice but
if<00:01:01.860> you<00:01:02.040> put<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.400> sophomore<00:01:02.880> it<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.390> take

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
if you put the sophomore it can take

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.720 
if you put the sophomore it can take
many<00:01:03.990> impacts<00:01:04.440> so<00:01:04.800> it<00:01:04.920> will<00:01:05.070> not<00:01:05.190> get<00:01:05.370> damaged

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
many impacts so it will not get damaged

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.880 
many impacts so it will not get damaged
so<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.300> see<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:07.140> has<00:01:07.170> damaged<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
so you can see that it has damaged a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.790 
so you can see that it has damaged a
little<00:01:08.160> bit<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> at<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> side<00:01:12.500> you<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.620> the

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
little bit so at the side you get the

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:23.450

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.560 
statements and an instruction manual and
you<00:01:28.200> get<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.440> monitor<00:01:28.650> itself<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:30.060> we've<00:01:30.390> got

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
you get the monitor itself so we've got

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:38.600 
you get the monitor itself so we've got
some<00:01:30.810> stuff<00:01:30.840> here<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> stand<00:01:37.610> now

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
we got the monitor itself so let's take

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:52.870 
we got the monitor itself so let's take
it<00:01:41.400> out

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.950 

so<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.360> get<00:01:54.510> the<00:01:54.690> base<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:57.390> base<00:01:59.960> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
so here you get the base of the base the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.320 
so here you get the base of the base the
monster<00:02:01.320> itself

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.139 

nice<00:02:05.330> packaging<00:02:06.130> but<00:02:07.130> they<00:02:07.430> should<00:02:07.700> have<00:02:07.850> used

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
nice packaging but they should have used

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.100 
nice packaging but they should have used
softball<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:11.090> there's<00:02:11.300> nothing<00:02:11.450> left

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
softball so there's nothing left

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:28.320 
softball so there's nothing left
yeah<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:15.130> we<00:02:16.130> get<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.430> display<00:02:16.790> itself<00:02:17.500> okay

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:36.630 

so<00:02:29.330> did<00:02:29.630> this<00:02:29.870> monitor

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.700 

so<00:02:37.180> these<00:02:37.420> are<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.780> contents<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.290> get<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:38.620> the

and settings of the monitor assembly in

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.130 
and settings of the monitor assembly in
the<00:03:12.490> monitor<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.150> base<00:03:13.390> is<00:03:13.630> very<00:03:13.690> quick

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
the monitor to the base is very quick

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.620 
the monitor to the base is very quick
and<00:03:14.320> simple<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:15.610> you<00:03:15.670> just<00:03:16.000> need<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.330> connect

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
and simple so you just need to connect

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.070 
and simple so you just need to connect
the<00:03:16.780> stand<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.260> base<00:03:18.300> so<00:03:19.300> it<00:03:19.510> goes<00:03:19.720> in<00:03:19.870> like

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
the stand to the base so it goes in like

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.560 
the stand to the base so it goes in like
this<00:03:20.910> you're<00:03:21.910> good<00:03:22.239> punch<00:03:23.310> that's<00:03:24.310> it<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:25.450> you

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
this you're good punch that's it and you

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.440 
this you're good punch that's it and you
just<00:03:25.720> connect<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.260> here<00:03:27.720> like<00:03:28.720> this<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:31.300> you

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
just connect it here like this and you

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.940 
just connect it here like this and you
can<00:03:31.630> hear<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:31.870> click<00:03:32.230> sound<00:03:32.260> when<00:03:32.800> it's

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
can hear a click sound when it's

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:40.539 
can hear a click sound when it's
connected<00:03:34.410> yeah<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:36.250> that's<00:03:36.489> connect

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.130 

so<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.819> stand<00:03:42.090> does<00:03:42.329> not<00:03:42.480> give<00:03:42.719> you<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.900> height

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
so the stand does not give you a height

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.740 
so the stand does not give you a height
adjustment<00:03:43.859> but<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.700> can't<00:03:45.000> tilt<00:03:45.329> it<00:03:45.510> back

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
adjustment but you can't tilt it back

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.050 
adjustment but you can't tilt it back
