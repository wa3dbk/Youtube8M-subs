00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the biggest thing for us was the fact

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.020 
the biggest thing for us was the fact
that<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.720> game<00:01:24.930> was<00:01:25.400> it<00:01:26.400> was<00:01:26.640> more<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that the game was it was more of a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.460 
that the game was it was more of a
family<00:01:27.330> feel<00:01:27.720> now<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.200> work<00:01:28.350> with

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
family feel now it was work with

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.859 
family feel now it was work with
corporate<00:01:28.890> situation<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:30.150> free<00:01:30.329> agency<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
corporate situation with free agency and

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.080 
corporate situation with free agency and
players<00:01:31.110> changing<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.850> every

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
year so there's a big difference but I

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.520 
physical the game is still very physical
do<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.299> think<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.780> there<00:01:45.960> needs<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.439> be

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
do you think that there needs to be

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.609 
do you think that there needs to be
something<00:01:46.890> done<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.490> protect<00:01:47.670> players<00:01:48.090> today

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
something done to protect players today

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.080 
something done to protect players today
you<00:01:50.100> know<00:01:50.219> I<00:01:51.560> think<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:52.859> to<00:01:53.250> because<00:01:53.909> it

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
you know I think you have to because it

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.630 
you know I think you have to because it
really<00:01:54.359> takes<00:01:54.509> places<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:56.100> fact<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.399> guys

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
really takes places the fact that guys

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.830 
really takes places the fact that guys
are<00:01:56.880> bigger<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.240> stronger<00:01:58.640> any<00:01:59.640> time<00:01:59.969> if<00:02:00.569> you

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
are bigger and stronger any time if you

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.569 
are bigger and stronger any time if you
just<00:02:00.869> think<00:02:01.079> about<00:02:01.350> physics<00:02:01.859> you<00:02:02.189> know<00:02:02.219> bigger

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
just think about physics you know bigger

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.209 
just think about physics you know bigger
mass<00:02:02.819> means<00:02:03.119> bigger<00:02:03.420> mass<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:04.619> gonna<00:02:04.799> you

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
mass means bigger mass it's gonna you

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.270 
mass means bigger mass it's gonna you
know<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.909> gonna<00:02:06.000> cause<00:02:06.209> a<00:02:06.240> photo<00:02:06.539> so<00:02:07.200> give<00:02:08.190> me

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
know it's gonna cause a photo so give me

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.500 
know it's gonna cause a photo so give me
a<00:02:08.340> bit<00:02:08.580> who<00:02:08.759> do<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.879> think'll<00:02:09.149> win<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:14.510> have

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
a bit who do you think'll win it is have

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.660 
a bit who do you think'll win it is have
they<00:02:15.690> given<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.080> know<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.069> little<00:02:17.310> bit<00:02:17.459> too

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
they given you know a little bit too

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.509 
they given you know a little bit too
much<00:02:18.230> I'm<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.290> friend<00:02:19.739> of<00:02:19.830> Mike<00:02:20.010> Tomlin

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
much I'm a friend of Mike Tomlin

want the best for him so I expected that
much<00:02:26.340> closer<00:02:26.579> game<00:02:26.849> than<00:02:26.910> most<00:02:27.269> people

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
much closer game than most people

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.300 
much closer game than most people
realize<00:02:30.230> it's<00:02:31.230> hard<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.530> say<00:02:31.709> it's<00:02:32.040> hard<00:02:32.099> to

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
realize it's hard to say it's hard to

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.819 
realize it's hard to say it's hard to
say<00:02:32.730> ready<00:02:33.030> Tommy<00:02:33.569> you<00:02:33.870> gotta<00:02:34.110> go<00:02:34.379> out<00:02:34.560> they

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
say ready Tommy you gotta go out they

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:35.390 
say ready Tommy you gotta go out they
went

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
went

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.650 
went
I<00:02:35.690> like<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.900> NFC<00:02:37.379> I<00:02:37.970> mean<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.060> know<00:02:39.209> we<00:02:39.420> played
