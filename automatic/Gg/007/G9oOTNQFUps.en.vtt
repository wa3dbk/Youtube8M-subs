00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.910
 she greets to all of us we 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.990
 find today for a new 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.850
 redstone tutorial 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.070
 and this time closes pretty simple one 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.330
 attacks the cocoa farm and for the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.550
 to make it work simply 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.470
 to stay on this little plate of 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.660
 passion and plant our thumb of 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.150
 cocoa and you will soon have more cocoa 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.960
 more you will never need simple 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.310
 and practical and to build this 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.630
 farm you are going to need to 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.120
 just a few blocks of 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.540
 construction of ten redstone bone powder 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.110
 2 2 sticky pistons of 4,10 spencer of 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.600
 five repeaters of a few half dallas 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.060
 so that's the choice of these two or three 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.770
 we'll see that later for red stone 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.900
 torch it's kind of like it's a 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.880
 either 2 according to the preferences we will see 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.670
 that also just now and if not he 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.250
 will you need two two logs of 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.620
 of jungle trees and a few inches 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.480
 cocoa then it's not everything he goes 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.729
 must also have a little overhang 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.590
 matter the type is also a good 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.720
 big package of goodville to feed 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.369
 the ten thinks so let's go for the 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.829
 tutorial I hope you are not one 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.210
 go now and start 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:15.799
 will choose a blog on which we are going 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.630
 start our farm on which we go to 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.249
 fk by the way for me it will be this little 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.020
 block of quartz on which I will place 

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:23.179
 my pressure then complain about the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.490
 side i'm going to come m a torch of 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.289
 redstone with a sticky piston towards the 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.329
 down then I'm going to place blocks 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.490
 like those here and there it's going to be the 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.679
 soil on which we will put our clock 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.200
 basic that will happen to be a blister 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.149
 fast like these one will put two 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.859
 repeaters with redstone powder 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.030
 like these and you see that 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:41.780
 now as soon as we go on 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.990
 after on the spot 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.159
 laak locks triggered and we will be able 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.829
 continue now 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.649
 then we will place the piston on which 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.209
 will find our first log so 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.979
 we will place a piston like that with the 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:57.170
 log just above and he'll have to 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.429
 that we read the blister so that it 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.799
 make do the movement that one 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.159
 wish to our pistons so for that 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:08.270
 we will place the blocks like this with 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.800
 a block also there and a block here 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.750
 also these two blocks are no longer 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.810
 needed then we'll put a 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.150
 repeater like that at 3 tick a powder there 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.040
 and a repeater here at tic to have 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.410
 the best timing and you will see 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.880
 that our pistons 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.710
 a movement that is not so fast 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.110
 that blister and that is simply 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.370
 actually slowed down because repeaters a 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.230
 once all this is done we are going 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.030
 to be able to place our 10 spencer there 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.800
 will have four in all they are just the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.690
 just break the small barriers that 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.220
 I put and we will be able to directly 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.080
 connect it to the red stone 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.080
 we will simply place a small 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.700
 stair shape right there with 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.280
 half tiles that will be here 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.990
 and then blocks or 2001 as 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.540
 you want after all and we will be able to 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.940
 put red stone everywhere and 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.710
 then our farm will be almost finished 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.530
 it will take just place and still a 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.210
 repeater here that will be a tick and we're going 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.130
 power right now place our 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.350
 good city and we will go to small 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.200
 to the optional little things is this 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.670
 not so now that it's done 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.630
 must know that me when the farm is 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.270
 inactive 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.890
 I still like this piston is 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.110
 raised and that's why I'm going 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.000
 place a torch here and there is also 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.620
 one thing that is important is that 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.840
 use the farm I like it too 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.580
 that the cocos clothes do not fly 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.470
 in every way and for that I'm going 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.880
 just place and half a slab right there 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.459
 Besides, we must not forget to 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.260
 put our goal here on which we are going 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.270
 place some abine cocos from time to time 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.660
 and we will be able to already test the 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.770
 closed 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.990
 here we go and it works great 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.250
 well it hurts cocoa been more in 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.990
 any case you will never need 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.490
 believe me and that's it will be all for 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.959
 today I hope this little 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.790
 tutorial will have pleased you if that's the case 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.380
 so do not hesitate to share it put 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.720
