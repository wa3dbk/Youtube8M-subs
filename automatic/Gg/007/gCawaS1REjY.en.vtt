two of the most obvious ways they can

two of the most obvious ways they can
influence<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.979> games<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.369> mainly<00:02:02.670> played<00:02:03.060> how

I<00:02:05.759> start<00:02:05.969> putting<00:02:06.240> money<00:02:06.270> down<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> private

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
I start putting money down on a private

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.869 
I start putting money down on a private
server<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.799> actually<00:02:08.129> able<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.429> configure<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
server I actually able to configure the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.919 
server I actually able to configure the
game<00:02:09.030> how<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.270> want<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.780> and

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
game how I want to and

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.080 
game how I want to and
the<00:02:11.620> biggest<00:02:11.920> reason<00:02:12.129> I<00:02:12.430> think<00:02:12.489> everything

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
the biggest reason I think everything

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.030 
the biggest reason I think everything
should<00:02:13.120> be<00:02:13.269> talkable<00:02:13.629> is<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.870> fail<00:02:14.140> safe<00:02:14.170> but

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
should be talkable is a fail safe but

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.679 
should be talkable is a fail safe but
let's<00:02:15.189> be<00:02:15.310> honest<00:02:15.489> here<00:02:15.579> guys<00:02:15.760> all<00:02:16.000> concepts

better for everyone so you know
obviously<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:35.229> me<00:03:35.349> just<00:03:35.560> makes<00:03:35.739> tons<00:03:35.979> of

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
obviously that to me just makes tons of

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.099 
obviously that to me just makes tons of
sense<00:03:36.159> and<00:03:36.639> dice<00:03:37.329> is<00:03:37.510> obviously<00:03:37.780> showing<00:03:37.989> a

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
sense and dice is obviously showing a

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.449 
sense and dice is obviously showing a
lot<00:03:38.199> of<00:03:38.260> hesitation<00:03:38.439> towards<00:03:38.919> that<00:03:39.159> and<00:03:39.189> I

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
lot of hesitation towards that and I

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.649 
lot of hesitation towards that and I
understand<00:03:39.879> some<00:03:40.060> of<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:40.389> do<00:03:40.449> not

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
understand some of it I do not

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.099 
understand some of it I do not
understand<00:03:41.109> all<00:03:41.229> of<00:03:41.259> it<00:03:41.409> but<00:03:42.159> it<00:03:42.430> doesn't<00:03:43.109> need

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
understand all of it but it doesn't need

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.469 
understand all of it but it doesn't need
you<00:03:44.439> know<00:03:44.560> rocket<00:03:45.009> science<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.479> extrapolate

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479 
you know rocket science to extrapolate

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:48.030 
you know rocket science to extrapolate
that<00:03:46.720> a<00:03:46.810> little<00:03:47.019> further<00:03:47.229> and<00:03:47.590> realize<00:03:47.889> that

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
that a little further and realize that

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.580 
that a little further and realize that
why<00:03:48.819> can't<00:03:49.120> we<00:03:49.239> really<00:03:49.389> have<00:03:49.659> kind<00:03:50.019> of<00:03:50.109> custom

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
why can't we really have kind of custom

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.599 
why can't we really have kind of custom
game<00:03:50.829> modes<00:03:51.069> I<00:03:51.159> mean<00:03:51.280> if<00:03:51.340> you're<00:03:51.430> gonna<00:03:51.489> make

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
game modes I mean if you're gonna make

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.179 
game modes I mean if you're gonna make
everything<00:03:51.909> toggleable<00:03:52.449> then<00:03:53.349> you<00:03:53.680> know<00:03:53.799> give

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:54.189 
everything toggleable then you know give

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:56.610 
everything toggleable then you know give
us<00:03:54.340> a<00:03:54.489> parameter<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.239> core<00:03:55.599> value<00:03:55.629> of<00:03:56.229> say<00:03:56.590> the

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
we could totally customize it to exactly

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.339 
we could totally customize it to exactly
how<00:04:30.819> we<00:04:30.879> want<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.360> play<00:04:31.479> it<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:31.840> we<00:04:32.199> could

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
how we want to play it and we could

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.680 
how we want to play it and we could
throw<00:04:32.680> a<00:04:33.190> tournament<00:04:33.789> I<00:04:33.879> mean<00:04:34.240> maybe<00:04:34.509> its

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
throw a tournament I mean maybe its

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.480 
throw a tournament I mean maybe its
pistols<00:04:34.990> only<00:04:35.169> I<00:04:35.470> don't<00:04:35.860> know<00:04:36.039> just<00:04:36.280> I'm<00:04:36.460> just

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
pistols only I don't know just I'm just

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.339 
pistols only I don't know just I'm just
saying<00:04:36.849> like<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.629> possibilities<00:04:38.319> are

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
saying like the possibilities are

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.080 
saying like the possibilities are
endless<00:04:38.440> and<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.919> just<00:04:39.129> think<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.759> would<00:04:39.879> go<00:04:40.060> a

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
endless and I just think it would go a

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.330 
endless and I just think it would go a
long<00:04:40.360> way<00:04:40.659> to<00:04:41.199> add<00:04:41.349> into<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.620> longevity<00:04:41.860> of

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
long way to add into the longevity of

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.119 
long way to add into the longevity of
this<00:04:42.699> game<00:04:43.229> because<00:04:44.229> the<00:04:44.440> idea<00:04:44.560> here<00:04:44.979> is<00:04:45.009> to

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
this game because the idea here is to

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.790 
this game because the idea here is to

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:08.319 
same map and unfortunately that's all

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.279 
same map and unfortunately that's all
that's<00:05:08.470> out<00:05:08.650> there<00:05:08.919> so<00:05:09.520> I<00:05:09.550> think<00:05:10.289> influencing

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
that's out there so I think influencing

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.129 
that's out there so I think influencing
and<00:05:11.470> pushing<00:05:12.419> creativity<00:05:13.419> to<00:05:13.599> some<00:05:13.780> extent

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
and pushing creativity to some extent

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.320 
and pushing creativity to some extent
and<00:05:14.500> just<00:05:14.880> diversification<00:05:15.880> of<00:05:15.969> the<00:05:16.090> game

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
and just diversification of the game

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.850 
and just diversification of the game
modes<00:05:16.569> the<00:05:16.840> maps<00:05:17.080> I<00:05:17.289> mean<00:05:17.440> there's<00:05:17.620> been<00:05:17.710> a<00:05:17.740> lot

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
modes the maps I mean there's been a lot

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.890 
modes the maps I mean there's been a lot
of<00:05:17.889> talk<00:05:18.190> about<00:05:18.219> you<00:05:18.969> know<00:05:19.090> nighttime<00:05:19.659> daytime

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
of talk about you know nighttime daytime

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.730 
of talk about you know nighttime daytime
snow<00:05:20.469> dynamic<00:05:21.400> weather<00:05:22.050> you<00:05:23.050> know<00:05:23.139> same<00:05:23.469> map

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
snow dynamic weather you know same map

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.709 
snow dynamic weather you know same map
just<00:05:24.280> tweak<00:05:24.639> it<00:05:24.789> up<00:05:24.879> a<00:05:24.969> little<00:05:25.120> bit<00:05:25.360> just<00:05:25.569> to

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:25.719 
just tweak it up a little bit just to

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:27.600 
just tweak it up a little bit just to
change<00:05:25.960> it<00:05:26.229> so<00:05:26.379> it's<00:05:26.530> slightly<00:05:27.069> different

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
change it so it's slightly different

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.010 
change it so it's slightly different
tactics<00:05:27.969> will<00:05:28.090> work<00:05:28.240> here<00:05:28.479> they<00:05:28.659> won't<00:05:28.840> work

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
tactics will work here they won't work

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.290 
tactics will work here they won't work
there<00:05:29.319> I'm<00:05:29.860> all<00:05:30.190> for<00:05:30.400> these<00:05:30.580> things<00:05:30.819> and<00:05:31.030> I

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
there I'm all for these things and I

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.749 
there I'm all for these things and I
just<00:05:31.539> think<00:05:31.690> making<00:05:31.870> everything<00:05:32.409> on<00:05:32.830> the

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
just think making everything on the

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.809 
just think making everything on the
periphery<00:05:34.090> you<00:05:34.840> know<00:05:34.990> aside<00:05:35.319> from<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:36.250> basics

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:36.819 
periphery you know aside from the basics

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:39.930 
periphery you know aside from the basics
a<00:05:37.419> toggle<00:05:38.050> because<00:05:38.560> i<00:05:38.650> think<00:05:38.860> i<00:05:39.099> would<00:05:39.219> lead<00:05:39.789> to

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
a toggle because i think i would lead to

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.399 
a toggle because i think i would lead to
some<00:05:40.090> very<00:05:40.120> interesting<00:05:40.539> server<00:05:40.870> now<00:05:41.020> listen

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
some very interesting server now listen

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.850 
some very interesting server now listen
it'll<00:05:42.099> lead<00:05:42.460> to<00:05:42.490> some<00:05:42.880> terrible<00:05:43.539> servers<00:05:44.349> but

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
it'll lead to some terrible servers but

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.439 
it'll lead to some terrible servers but
we've<00:05:44.979> already<00:05:45.130> got<00:05:45.340> those<00:05:45.580> so<00:05:45.880> we<00:05:46.150> can't<00:05:46.360> be

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
we've already got those so we can't be

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:47.820 
we've already got those so we can't be

why can't we have server customization

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.800 
why can't we have server customization
to<00:06:27.340> the<00:06:27.370> point<00:06:27.639> where<00:06:27.789> we<00:06:27.909> can<00:06:28.120> instead<00:06:28.690> of

to the point where we can instead of

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.089 
to the point where we can instead of
just<00:06:28.900> having<00:06:29.020> standard<00:06:29.500> motor<00:06:29.650> in<00:06:29.740> hardcore

mode we can have any number of different
variations<00:06:33.219> i<00:06:33.399> think<00:06:33.909> it<00:06:33.969> would<00:06:34.029> great<00:06:34.270> be

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
variations i think it would great be

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.940 
variations i think it would great be
great<00:06:35.080> i<00:06:35.229> think<00:06:35.259> will<00:06:35.500> be<00:06:35.560> a<00:06:35.589> lot<00:06:35.710> of

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
great i think will be a lot of

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.100 
great i think will be a lot of
and<00:06:36.250> I<00:06:36.730> think<00:06:36.790> it<00:06:37.000> would<00:06:37.090> really<00:06:37.300> add<00:06:37.720> to

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
and I think it would really add to

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.140 
and I think it would really add to
longevity<00:06:38.740> of<00:06:39.100> the<00:06:39.220> game<00:06:39.400> what<00:06:39.880> do<00:06:39.970> you<00:06:40.030> guys

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
longevity of the game what do you guys

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.490 
longevity of the game what do you guys
think<00:06:40.210> hit<00:06:40.750> me<00:06:40.840> up<00:06:40.870> in<00:06:40.990> the<00:06:41.050> comments<00:06:41.410> and

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
think hit me up in the comments and

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.380 
think hit me up in the comments and
let's<00:06:41.950> start<00:06:42.070> a<00:06:42.190> discussion<00:06:42.310> on<00:06:42.610> this<00:06:42.730> like
