focus<00:00:33.230> specifically<00:00:33.949> on<00:00:34.040> distance<00:00:34.670> that<00:00:34.850> we

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
focus specifically on distance that we

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.250 
focus specifically on distance that we
were<00:00:35.059> away<00:00:35.269> from<00:00:35.329> the<00:00:35.570> threat<00:00:35.870> we

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
were away from the threat we

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.959 
were away from the threat we
incorporated<00:00:37.129> some<00:00:37.309> numbers<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:37.670> some

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
incorporated some numbers and some

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.579 
incorporated some numbers and some
letters<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:38.480> whatnot<00:00:38.750> on<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:38.989> targets<00:00:39.379> and

letters and whatnot on the targets and

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:41.979 
letters and whatnot on the targets and
we<00:00:40.550> created<00:00:40.879> an<00:00:40.969> unknown<00:00:41.329> distance<00:00:41.629> so<00:00:41.899> the

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
we created an unknown distance so the

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.270 
we created an unknown distance so the
shooter<00:00:42.230> wasn't<00:00:42.409> able<00:00:42.620> to<00:00:42.800> mentally<00:00:43.100> or

accurately albeit at that target in that
given<00:01:35.540> time<00:01:35.750> frame<00:01:35.780> now<00:01:36.260> we<00:01:36.320> know<00:01:36.620> that<00:01:36.650> the

given time frame now we know that the

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.770 
given time frame now we know that the
definition<00:01:37.010> of<00:01:37.430> insanity<00:01:37.520> is<00:01:38.090> doing<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.690> same

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
definition of insanity is doing the same

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.480 
definition of insanity is doing the same
thing<00:01:39.140> over<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:39.470> over<00:01:39.620> and<00:01:39.920> hoping<00:01:40.430> for

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
thing over and over and hoping for

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.219 
thing over and over and hoping for
different<00:01:40.880> results<00:01:41.330> so<00:01:41.540> what<00:01:41.630> we<00:01:41.720> don't<00:01:42.020> want

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
different results so what we don't want

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.140 
different results so what we don't want
to<00:01:42.290> see<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.530> shooter<00:01:42.770> do<00:01:43.070> is<00:01:43.549> fire<00:01:43.909> an

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
to see the shooter do is fire an

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.030 
to see the shooter do is fire an

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
rounds at the same target zone if we

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.490 
rounds at the same target zone if we

if<00:01:57.409> we<00:01:57.799> keep<00:01:58.070> just<00:01:58.369> firing<00:01:58.580> round<00:01:59.030> after<00:01:59.180> round

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
if we keep just firing round after round

it's going to have little to no effect
so<00:02:03.170> we've<00:02:03.290> got<00:02:03.440> to<00:02:03.530> change<00:02:03.560> things<00:02:04.070> up<00:02:04.250> now<00:02:04.610> a

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
so we've got to change things up now a

now one of the unique row are fun or

now one of the unique row are fun or
interesting<00:02:26.760> byproducts<00:02:27.659> of<00:02:27.690> this<00:02:27.840> drill<00:02:28.080> is

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
interesting byproducts of this drill is

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.990 
interesting byproducts of this drill is
that<00:02:28.409> sometimes<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.159> range<00:02:29.370> officer<00:02:29.640> is

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
that sometimes that range officer is

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.300 
that sometimes that range officer is
going<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.930> give<00:02:31.049> a<00:02:31.080> longer<00:02:31.620> exposure<00:02:31.860> and

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
going to give a longer exposure and

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.860 
going to give a longer exposure and
you'll<00:02:32.730> see<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.150> shooter<00:02:33.450> tends<00:02:33.690> to

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
you'll see that the shooter tends to

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.809 
you'll see that the shooter tends to
game<00:02:34.110> things<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:35.010> think<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.400> they're<00:02:35.610> going

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
game things and think that they're going

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.369 
game things and think that they're going
to<00:02:35.940> run<00:02:36.330> out<00:02:36.569> of<00:02:36.629> time<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:36.930> they'll<00:02:37.200> actually

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
to run out of time and they'll actually

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.680 
to run out of time and they'll actually
stop<00:02:37.769> shooting<00:02:38.220> prematurely<00:02:38.790> bad<00:02:39.390> thing<00:02:39.659> to

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
do in the fight second thing that will

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.890 
do in the fight second thing that will
happen<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.879> that<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.120> line<00:02:42.299> officer<00:02:42.720> will

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
happen is is that the line officer will

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.530 
happen is is that the line officer will
give<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.310> ridiculously<00:02:44.310> abbreviated<00:02:45.060> or<00:02:45.180> short

give a ridiculously abbreviated or short
interval<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:45.959> time<00:02:46.230> which<00:02:46.980> will<00:02:47.099> not<00:02:47.370> afford

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
interval of time which will not afford

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.369 
interval of time which will not afford
the<00:02:47.970> shooter<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.360> opportunity<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.989> get<00:02:49.110> any

the shooter the opportunity to get any
rounds<00:02:49.890> off<00:02:50.040> that's<00:02:50.760> not<00:02:50.940> going<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.239> a

rounds off that's not going to have a
big<00:02:51.390> effect<00:02:51.540> on<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:51.930> particular<00:02:52.379> string<00:02:52.920> of

big effect on that particular string of
fire<00:02:53.280> but<00:02:53.849> you<00:02:53.940> can<00:02:54.090> imagine<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.599> subsequent

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
fire but you can imagine the subsequent
