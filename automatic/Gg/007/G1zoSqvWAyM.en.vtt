obviously the microphone comes with a
USB<00:02:07.910> you<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.360> ends<00:02:09.810> which<00:02:09.989> goes<00:02:10.200> into

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
USB you do have the ends which goes into

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.140 
USB you do have the ends which goes into
the<00:02:10.500> microphone<00:02:10.770> here<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.760> do<00:02:11.910> have

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
plated which I thought editors key would

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.980 
plated which I thought editors key would
have<00:02:25.560> done<00:02:25.770> but<00:02:26.550> nevertheless<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.090> does<00:02:27.690> have

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
have done but nevertheless it does have

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.010 
have done but nevertheless it does have
awesome<00:02:28.560> response<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.970> does<00:02:30.180> pick<00:02:30.420> up<00:02:30.600> the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
awesome response and it does pick up the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.020 
awesome response and it does pick up the
audio<00:02:31.200> very<00:02:31.560> very<00:02:31.770> well<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.520> when<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.760> turn<00:02:32.940> on

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
audio very very well so when you turn on

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.330 
audio very very well so when you turn on
the<00:02:33.060> microphone<00:02:33.300> as<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.900> saw<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:34.830> does<00:02:35.040> light

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
the microphone as you saw it does light

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.699 
the microphone as you saw it does light
up<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.670> nice<00:02:35.910> blue<00:02:36.390> only<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.200> front<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.620> the

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
up a nice blue only the front of the

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.710 
up a nice blue only the front of the
condenser<00:02:38.190> lights<00:02:38.370> up<00:02:38.550> blue<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.970> was<00:02:39.390> hoping

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
condenser lights up blue I was hoping

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.120 
condenser lights up blue I was hoping
that<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.989> whole<00:02:40.170> kind<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.470> microphone<00:02:40.830> head

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
that the whole kind of microphone head

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.070 
that the whole kind of microphone head
would<00:02:41.340> light<00:02:41.489> up<00:02:41.520> but<00:02:42.420> with<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.780> front

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
would light up but with the front

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.380 
would light up but with the front
lighting<00:02:43.319> up<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.770> does<00:02:43.950> show<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.250> which<00:02:45.120> side

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
lighting up it does show you which side

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.000 
lighting up it does show you which side
to<00:02:45.420> talk<00:02:45.720> into<00:02:46.080> when<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.380> are<00:02:46.500> talking<00:02:46.650> into

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
to talk into when you are talking into

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
the standard zero decibel setting and

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.370 
the standard zero decibel setting and
i'm<00:03:02.670> just<00:03:02.790> going<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.000> switch<00:03:03.239> over<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.660> the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
i'm just going to switch over to the

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.920 
i'm just going to switch over to the
minus<00:03:04.650> 10<00:03:05.010> decibels<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:06.000> as<00:03:06.569> you<00:03:06.750> can<00:03:06.900> see

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
minus 10 decibels and as you can see

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.559 
minus 10 decibels and as you can see
there<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.440> slight<00:03:08.190> difference<00:03:08.459> in<00:03:09.120> audio

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.420 
there is a slight difference in audio
the<00:03:09.780> audio<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:10.110> much<00:03:10.560> quieter<00:03:10.860> on<00:03:11.250> this

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
the audio is much quieter on this

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.040 
the audio is much quieter on this
setting<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.000> obviously<00:03:12.510> if<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.720> needed<00:03:12.750> to

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
setting and obviously if you needed to

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.100
