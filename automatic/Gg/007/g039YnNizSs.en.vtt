berry so special is that they're loaded

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.710 
berry so special is that they're loaded
with<00:01:19.280> polysaccharides<00:01:20.280> now<00:01:20.720> polysaccharides

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
with polysaccharides now polysaccharides

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.780 
with polysaccharides now polysaccharides
are<00:01:21.869> essentially<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> carb<00:01:22.860> structure<00:01:23.490> that's

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
are essentially a carb structure that's

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.390 
are essentially a carb structure that's
digested<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.750> our<00:01:25.140> bodies<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:25.860> used<00:01:26.130> as

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
digested in our bodies and then used as

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.370 
digested in our bodies and then used as
an<00:01:26.610> energy<00:01:26.729> source<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.869> addition<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
an energy source but in addition to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.289 
an energy source but in addition to
helping<00:01:28.680> us<00:01:28.829> gain<00:01:29.189> energy<00:01:29.490> these

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
helping us gain energy these

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.359 
helping us gain energy these
polysaccharides<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.409> help<00:01:31.590> boost<00:01:31.799> our<00:01:32.070> mood
