 The main character hears an ambitious writer. 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.910
 Certainly noteworthy is that Geneix Storm was too developed. 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.650
 And Frost has a little bit of follow-up to expect Samsung to follow along 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.540

 Ahninya season 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:19.430
 I think I should still hold judgment on Storm. 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.240
 When it will feel better if you climb the grade real dalhaneunde here a little better 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.960

 But now the church shows 30% more performance than I showed 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:47.360
 I thought that some moment came up to the good spit or finals 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.950
 Five people are super- play entrepreneurs. 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:56.540

 When the rooms perfect climb plainly that x fashionistas to actively 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.390
 I do not play my part, I think I was the biggest one. Me too. I like Lenga . 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.640
 I gave it to him. 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:35.890
 Even then, it is amazing that thin writers can not yet holding the feeling did it 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.000
 It was one of the biggest causes of my retirement . 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.110
 skt1 k 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.400
 It was like this when I was so stale.

 When I was four now entered the English nation that stand yiraneunge their retirement formula 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.980
 In the same way, for example, 15 hours a day c steadily practice a series of exercises 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.070
 Let's do it. 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.360
 So I do not know if I can win the example and start questioning. 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:03.770
 If you write this down, you will be far away. It will be 2 o'clock. 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:08.030
 The crab is unconditional, and there is no payback. 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.750

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.740

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:17.359
 Alas, I have to go dwaetgo yigilkka For clothes to wear so exposed'll retire since

 Yes So I conclude that I would have 6 laps * suddenly scissors away 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:31.250
 I'll put it down to the limit. 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:35.810

 A formidable opponent you'll be like the Samsung water two days're delicious because one 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:05.900
 In this case, it's important to be honored. 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:11.210
 However, I was not impressed because I was so impressed by the second place in the solo rank . 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:15.500
 I think that's the thing and I have to see it, but anyway Blair can win the ministry

 Pick one every k differently, and I think yitto Jean also jasi position 2.1 would 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:40.190
 In the same society
