00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.640
 At all apologize in the evening for having a challenging exercise and 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.420
 Shoulder area of ​​native Indians emerge 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.969
 that conveys Honka related 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.919
 the arms cross 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.849
 take light weight 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.320
 that they can handle the 12 repetition in any case 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.099
 One can do this exercise year with a liberty 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.169
 where is the difference, unlike cats 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.350
 mostly out of the corner of my eye 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.269
 an individual on the island 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.440
 the association i have is that i am leading to something more leadership to these acts 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.640
 have given 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.940
 that also people 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.940
 the hygiene is 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.510
 by Dirk with the barbell is another exercise for the shoulder girdle 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.310
 please be careful that the elbows 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.080
 slightly bent 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.190
 But these do not bend any more value 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.260
 the more repetitions the make the harder it becomes weight for us 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.140
 become 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.400
 because then thinks the arms to pull something more 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.520
 and to help the biceps 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.540
 Please focus on that just put your shoulder 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.830
 that the army just bent slightly 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.670
 We already had practice we did with concerts 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.020
 all of us are the same because they start with a map 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.170
 In principle, we do exercises with short-time work and also 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.440
 Corinna civil engineering more demanding 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.280
 for beginners 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.000
 In weight premiums it is quite reasonable to start a treatment too soon 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.490
 use 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.150
 the two can go 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.500
 Less muscle needed the balance for the balance 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.930
 responsible is 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.450
 give all other side 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.470
 is another exercise for the shoulder look, however, we can 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.410
 this new one 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.219
 both sides both shoulders 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.610
 isolated separately 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.200
 important in this exercise 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.810
 Be careful not to over-weight your shoulder muscles 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.030
 a very very small muscular area 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.730
 therefore supply expenses were sufficient 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.030
 Giering out the weights as I did the exercise he says 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.110
 ridiculous because of a dealer 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.640
 why is it just this scope so important 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.710
 because too high 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.039
 Kriftel get problems 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.979
 with his pictures with the biceps of the shoulder area 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.709
 it would be very sensitive 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.579
 We would have to during training too 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.819
 To strain this area more than necessary
