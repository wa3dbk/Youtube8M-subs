00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello friends and welcome to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.099
 Another murder concept with this 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.880
 Although mods on the one hand we have the scania 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:13.980
 124 lhk l and the other hammer of the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.660
 cologne alcohol consisting of a pack 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.539
 following the green liquor 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.800
 container the green cabbage of an ear 26 et 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.359
 ass and the tsunami slurry container and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.529
 just the scale 140 l hkl the current 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.760
 big talk is tomorrow 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.430
 nation but it will be pretty for 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.989
 bullshit spread in the comments 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.510
 and twice thought the lap of the wall 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.140
 we look at it and it has unfortunately 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.090
 anyway 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.010
 we do not have the best weather for it 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.780
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, I hope that again 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.360
 beautiful is because well off so dark 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.030
 basic we will sunshine the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.640
 I'm not the only one to imagine 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.800
 It is so happy that you do not do it that way 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.390
 nice read comes ok plus and plus 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.809
 Minus organization are gripping 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.850
 beautiful 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.469
 the texture is his dream there is 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.359
 outwardly nothing at all 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.579
 complain in the back insanely detailed 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.409
 you get zander writing for example where 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.220
 it is nice again so it can be good 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.900
 the beautiful name offer good and know 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.090
 thus works in Germany 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.500
 Nevertheless scania is too dark for me 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.330
 is personal taste what also 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.189
 Steering wheel is always fallen in 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.860
 I do believe this error in the lok 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.000
 maybe johanning function i update 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.220
 I'm pretty sure it's not 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.740
 I would like to explain to a stockbroker 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.960
 I still want to go left or right 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.939
 turn left as you do then 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.520
 also spares right and vice versa 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.520
 Strange that you should you should only 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.530
 a little better then we have one 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.840
 few things have cheapened the ban 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.490
 is quite stylish so think so 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.009
 at least with the blue light 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.469
 above then we have under these little ones 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.810
 we humans have light 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:57.630
 this is absolutely good season for me 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.909
 what was disturbing was previously a lot of reading 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.399
 why the Sagittarius pulse is changed 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.289
 Michael hetzel but god is then 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.950
 We have the handbrake partner states 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.549
 with the enter key then we have a lot 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.310
 light 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.590
 so we have four key and norbert 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.810
 the warning lights away from me but relatively 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.209
 short season and we try but 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.230
 So all of the core zone for truck 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.200
 have available 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.140
 from village every case this device is quasi 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.989
 that is that is actually the same only 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.540
 wood for other tractors or something like that 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.849
 ok with the skadi hofmann now the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.140
 We therefore go and try 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:39.060
 now very cheeky with spicy in 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.549
 liquid things try but go 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.790
 we have the key n with it 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.900
 this stuff almost from driving several times 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.430
 tries to raise his container 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.200
 and we have now extended friends 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.510
 we're starting to track back the start 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.510
 motor and the Finther was hearted 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.510
 after 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.230
 the compressed-air brakes be devastating 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.470
 So far, there is 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.599
 outrider has been weird and 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.790
 now the right device again 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.920
 otherwise you will vote for it 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:20.670
 try to demonstrate how to do that 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:23.440
 in the correct height verbatim located 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.319
 brings normal about the face quite well 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.280
 It was on my way again 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:32.379
 swung down and what 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.170
 awesome on the kruger thing so 60 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.549
 but do not give up this chance 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.680
 The mature looks at the container 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.540
 Ripen as she turns her like that 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.920
 in detail, alcohol is an aspect 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.200
 it is really cool 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.299
 and then we have loaded friends we 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.040
 have already loaded the money so 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.879
 fast really it goes so fast it 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.040
 is madness we now at the court and 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:57.000
 look at the islamic first drives 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.000
 the most beautiful drives 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.050
 ok so far lawn mower tractor 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.170
 cute funny or salatic so what 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.200
 always said or shipped in konz okay 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:16.579
 is or is cool to revise me what 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.470
 he funny it's always anyway 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.019
 more on TV at the axa 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.570
 remote controlled gasoline engine car seen 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.860
 or remote-controlled car 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.720
 personally , kerth does not currently exist 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.590
 I will be able to improve its borders 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:33.740
 but similar but I do not think so 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.090
 should listen anyway similar truck so 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.180
 that you may have a bit 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.490
 polishing up on the sound of the four powers 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.220
 really calls it will like me 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.310
 not I have to say honestly so in 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.000
 foundation calls but were experiencing it 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.000
 is nothing 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.510
 So let's accelerate like speed 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.870
 from zero to one hundred per second 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.550
 be at a full load so there comes 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.260
 that's nice at kröger 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.050
 alcohol of a peg insanely horny 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.360
 So it really needs extreme sky 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.980
 do you feel quite good comano 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.900
 where on comma comma use os 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.790
 now container drops that you create 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.820
 so picked up later so right 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.620
 yellow makes heart muscle 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.910
 something in need of improvement feels so bad 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.070
 around the dark chor the weekly 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.870
 or should tear up in the air 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.850
 candle just not because the mass murder 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.350
 phones and pretty in any case 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.600
 worse devices lowered that says that 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.420
 best or worst somewhere 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.400
 in between, we were looking at the people 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.160
 function update stories otherwise nothing 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.639
 but twice great thing thank you for 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.740
 watch 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.090
 that was the horn that absolutely try 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.400
 They want to bring that to sales 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.930
 thumbs down and I would subscribe 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.789
 say yes a container manure container 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:55.189
 and this alcohol of a r26 toned 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:57.169
 tried server out would suggest 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.639
 but works well and in any case 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.560
 but it has to be coal stories as well 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.439
 container fill the completion 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.039
 according to müller fits with these words 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:08.990
 say thank you but told dollar 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.080
 thumbs up until the next 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.080
 times
