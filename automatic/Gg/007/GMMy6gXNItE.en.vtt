of weird so I'm going to go ahead and
just<00:01:05.519> make<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> pattern<00:01:06.000> out<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.860> to<00:01:07.860> do

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
tool and select a part of the image and

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.399 
tool and select a part of the image and
then<00:01:13.470> go<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.680> filter<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.840> generate<00:01:15.840> pattern

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
then go to filter and generate pattern

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.080 
then go to filter and generate pattern
or<00:01:16.590> create<00:01:16.830> new<00:01:16.860> pattern<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.850> will<00:01:17.970> open

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
or create new pattern and it will open

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.760 
or create new pattern and it will open
up<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.509> little<00:01:18.689> pattern<00:01:19.080> maker<00:01:19.290> window<00:01:19.650> that

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
up that little pattern maker window that

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.260 
up that little pattern maker window that
you<00:01:19.860> saw<00:01:20.330> generate<00:01:21.330> what<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.570> want<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:23.270> it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
you saw generate what you want and it

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.070 
you saw generate what you want and it
will<00:01:24.330> actually<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.720> turned<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.930> whole

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
will actually just turned the whole

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.060 
will actually just turned the whole
image<00:01:25.200> into<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> pattern<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.890> don't<00:01:26.009> have

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
image into a pattern so you don't have

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.350 
image into a pattern so you don't have
to<00:01:26.189> worry<00:01:26.369> about<00:01:26.490> anything<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.119> want<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
make it like a pattern brush you can

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.490 
make it like a pattern brush you can

distorted thing that's pretty cool
actually<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.890> free<00:01:47.579> transform<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.970> didn't

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
actually the free transform I didn't

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.940 
actually the free transform I didn't
trail<00:01:48.270> else<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.509> could<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.049> what<00:01:49.890> you

trail else we could do that so what you
want<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.369> want<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.579> make<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.729> decent

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
want to do is you want to make a decent

want to do is you want to make a decent
sized<00:01:51.720> space<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.380> your<00:01:52.470> video<00:01:53.540> to<00:01:54.540> fit<00:01:54.720> on

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
sized space for your video to fit on

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.359 
sized space for your video to fit on
that's<00:01:55.439> what<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.040> make<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> new

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
that's what this is so you make a new

bit and make sure your template layer is
your<00:05:03.909> frame<00:05:04.090> layer<00:05:04.270> is<00:05:04.509> on<00:05:04.750> top<00:05:05.080> so<00:05:05.620> that<00:05:05.650> it

and<00:05:08.289> that's<00:05:09.250> pretty<00:05:09.400> much<00:05:09.520> all<00:05:09.789> there<00:05:10.090> is<00:05:10.150> to

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
and that's pretty much all there is to

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.700 
and that's pretty much all there is to
it<00:05:11.129> now<00:05:12.129> you<00:05:12.789> can<00:05:12.969> also<00:05:13.180> do<00:05:13.930> the<00:05:14.080> reverse<00:05:14.349> and

it now you can also do the reverse and

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.640 
it now you can also do the reverse and
make<00:05:15.099> your<00:05:15.280> template<00:05:15.759> so<00:05:15.940> that<00:05:15.969> it<00:05:16.240> it

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
accommodates the video so you'll put

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:20.279 
accommodates the video so you'll put
your<00:05:18.940> video<00:05:19.120> on<00:05:19.300> top<00:05:19.629> of<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:19.810> template<00:05:20.139> and

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
your video on top of the template and

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:22.379 
your video on top of the template and
kind<00:05:20.590> of<00:05:20.620> like<00:05:20.710> it<00:05:20.860> sets<00:05:21.430> into<00:05:21.729> the<00:05:22.030> frame

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
kind of like it sets into the frame

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:23.909 
kind of like it sets into the frame
instead<00:05:22.629> of<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:22.990> frame<00:05:23.139> covering<00:05:23.560> it<00:05:23.680> like<00:05:23.800> it

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
instead of the frame covering it like it

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.559 
instead of the frame covering it like it
sets<00:05:24.069> into<00:05:24.219> the<00:05:24.400> template<00:05:24.789> that's<00:05:25.389> what<00:05:25.509> I

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
sets into the template that's what I

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.300 
sets into the template that's what I
used<00:05:25.750> to<00:05:25.810> do<00:05:25.960> so<00:05:26.229> it<00:05:26.590> just<00:05:26.830> depends<00:05:27.069> on<00:05:27.129> what

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
used to do so it just depends on what

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.100 
used to do so it just depends on what
you're<00:05:27.550> looking<00:05:27.580> for<00:05:28.030> in<00:05:28.120> your<00:05:28.150> needs<00:05:28.389> are<00:05:28.629> but

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
you're looking for in your needs are but

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.769 
you're looking for in your needs are but
hopefully<00:05:29.620> that<00:05:30.340> explains<00:05:30.580> some<00:05:31.180> stuff<00:05:31.419> I

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:31.779 
hopefully that explains some stuff I

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:33.659 
hopefully that explains some stuff I
know<00:05:32.229> it's<00:05:32.349> kind<00:05:32.500> of<00:05:32.529> fast<00:05:32.770> but<00:05:33.099> I<00:05:33.130> don't<00:05:33.460> have

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
know it's kind of fast but I don't have

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.610 
know it's kind of fast but I don't have
the<00:05:33.759> ability<00:05:34.120> to<00:05:34.150> narrate<00:05:34.539> while<00:05:35.020> actually

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
the ability to narrate while actually

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.200 
the ability to narrate while actually
doing<00:05:36.250> something<00:05:36.490> so<00:05:37.469> yeah<00:05:38.469> if<00:05:38.770> this<00:05:39.279> fails<00:05:39.759> I

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
doing something so yeah if this fails I

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.080 
doing something so yeah if this fails I
will<00:05:40.389> remake<00:05:41.110> it<00:05:41.349> and<00:05:41.590> in<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.490> future<00:05:42.639> I<00:05:42.940> will

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
will remake it and in the future I will

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.930 
will remake it and in the future I will
make<00:05:43.449> it<00:05:43.630> probably<00:05:44.050> next<00:05:44.469> year<00:05:44.620> next<00:05:45.159> school

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
make it probably next year next school

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.689 
make it probably next year next school
year<00:05:46.529> but<00:05:47.529> for<00:05:47.770> now<00:05:47.889> hopefully<00:05:48.370> that<00:05:48.580> works

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
year but for now hopefully that works
