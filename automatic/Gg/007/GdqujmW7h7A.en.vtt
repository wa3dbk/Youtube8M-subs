00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.680
 grandchildren until today I show you as you 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.599
 gta 4 for mac unterland can gta 4 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.719
 one of you probably knows that 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:19.380
 gta is only live for windows windows as 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.730
 he windows live game is there for the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.460
 playstation and for the xbox and show 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.849
 I can load you like that for mac os 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.750
 for the sake of chamber I will also be short 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.239
 start 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.300
 the short second smith the car 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.890
 drive and a more accurate gameplay so 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.460
 in the last test gta4 without mac or leaves 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.520
 yes four review or let's print exactly 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.090
 then comes in another video 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.840
 One hundred percent I think so 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.210
 also promised to have windows 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.070
 This is also about tomb 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.500
 downloaded connections and and and 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.800
 and if then with the recordings program 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.110
 for such a qual 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.670
 Since recommend screen run away are the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.100
 just watch the screen for something 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.780
 that's a game now and not because 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.890
 we there are several programs 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.840
 camtasia studio for screen fraps 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.000
 games and I am still happy 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.560
 why a universal loo easy 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.710
 everything in any case so it goes first 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.180
 on the first link youtube the sound clear 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.610
 the case does not matter 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.380
 then does not everything goes here 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.500
 then download the costs 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.689
 between under zack when her down 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.460
 have started loading here or the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.790
 new applications folder purely like her 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.570
 want 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.329
 in the city utah and tiff open then go 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.460
 Here it goes and then you appear 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:53.760
 the drumming window and you are ok 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:58.770
 then a download appears here 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.310
 he already looks like the partner 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.870
 The below can also be found in the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.180
 green the upload and blue 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.700
 the download speed can 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.480
 take a bit with me 2000 line 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.920
 so 12 days depending how preserve like 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.200
 long loading that stays at night when you are 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:25.160
 did you do that you wait just until 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:29.670
 has downloaded then you have download 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:35.430
 where the play knows I could 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.780
 not where you should be able to adjust 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.600
 that actually in the users 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.190
 invite 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.680
 at least something for me 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.200
 changed if I get you now 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.080
 determined since then so dohle 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.990
 then you open happiness on it 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.100
 can you do it here with a fine 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.260
 that you certainly know you from 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.830
 other installed then you have that 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.670
 Here you can see the app either in 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.610
 pull in your applications folder 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.940
 or if you do not hold the score 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.410
 Help steady speakers save 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:19.560
 Just double click on it 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:23.340
 he opens it and then comes the whole 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.510
 Make sure you do not finish the gate 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.880
 I'm sorry that the sound is different though 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.290
 I wanted is not the point 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.890
 show but really just how to 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.150
 can download 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.670
 I show I once briefly the first 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.830
 two three steps goes from gta me 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.510
 catch two meters in the car quite simply 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.910
 so you know it works and 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.750
 so I do not start fooling around 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:52.580
 maybe I will discover more of windows 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:55.240
 and windows pc or now on 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.240

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:12.760
 So just started nine new ones 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:15.099
 save the save because I can 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.810
 it now directly out of the environment 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:22.960
 has started and not in the programs 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:25.060
 Folder pull only takes people 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.509
 pronounced at the state 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.520
 I have to say from time to time a glasses 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.729
 a little bit 100 jerky little one 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.520
 little but big all it runs 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:42.570
 It's good that you see it 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:44.580
 is played has no idea how 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.199
 keyboard shortcut 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.479
 you can but this is also graphic here 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:57.509
 almost everything set to high very 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:57.509
 high looks good display 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:02.940
 I will continue to work with language 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:06.250
 can french german yes everything goes 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.560
 display graphic game so you can do it 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.430
 in German is the map 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.430
 saw you have to like it then 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:20.800

 options occupancy classic standard me 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.789
 so it knows can change 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.590
