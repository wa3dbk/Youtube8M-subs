00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.049
 good 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.459
 well hello everyone this is 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.869
 silly day we find ourselves for 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.119
 this part of the is surely the 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.830
 last part of this story of 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.590
 maubeuge and so sorry for not having 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.180
 laid the video rather but I had 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.070
 priorities like appearing blue dragon 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.099
 there was the coolest business as well 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.300
 that poker night 2 so as you say that 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.619
 will surely be the last video because 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.719
 it's just a big conclusion 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.670
 as well as some last little thing 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.980
 that I can not explain that 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.750
 maybe you'll be able to me 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.579
 say a convict who if we look at me 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.249
 also I ask myself questions I do not 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.120
 am not god 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:47.710
 so my make a breach finding 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.199
 so for starters we are on the island 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.210
 of alcatraz the beginnings of the game our four 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.820
 protagonists end up on an island 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.129
 and of course on this front encircled by 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.989
 audio zombies so I'm going to come 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.879
 directly to spoil so we get 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.190
 found facing zombies that are 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.890
 possessed by the devil actually because 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.479
 that they have reds and that many 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.000
 signs in the prison shows to believe 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.070
 that the devil is in the rain so 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.810
 for now we have not seen 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.990
 signs of outdoor life for example 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.009
 but hey I'll come to that first 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.320
 as I say there are the three 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.390
 cerberers who light up so long and so 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.740
 the three cerberes are fed 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.689
 decision of the economy or the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.579
 superphones this is so hot these are 2.6 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.860
 trololo then when we go in the far 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.990
 and that we type element 115 element 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.689
 which helps to summarize the zombies al 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.420
 ben coat and a voice tells us is 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.960
 do not miss this time finally savary the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.250
 message varies according to randomly I 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.340
 think I remember well because 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.359
 be his failures or his years spent in 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.880
 this time here I understood but at 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.180
 the end it is either 666 of the figure of the 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.590
 Devil 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.409
 so when you could notice a 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.450
 communicate the prison the atmosphere is rather 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.229
 lugubrious morbid and satanic since 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.990
 are several skulls 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.939
 there are plenty of writing that make 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.219
 think about Satanist writing since 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.719
 a Satanist writing because simon after 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.729
 well in some occult rites them 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:13.030
 because Satanism is a derivative of 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.950
 Gothic the shop has derived from like 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.970
 we call that occultism finally you 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.150
 see all these kinds of things 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.170
 completely crazy 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.120
 yeah it's not just that what 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.590
 that I wanted to say so here is the prison 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.560
 is possessed by the devil the zombies 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.590
 also and not four protagonists get 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.849
 reminds when the game starts that are 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.590
 out of their bodies and who say he 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.909
 was drunk ghosts well you 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.319
 know why he is explaining it to you 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.859
 so simply because we 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.510
 are in hell here is like you 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.370
 heard it in the previous video 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.290
 the leave if you have not seen you 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.959
 invite to go see her by clicking the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.780
 description on the video and ben and our 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.879
 four protagonists there you will say 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.319
 in the radio narrated by a guardian of the 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.659
 jail 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:00.349
 well he normally had to build 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:02.930
 a fortune plane that was well on the 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.760
 plan to escape and is driven by the 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.069
 head of a smell but albert 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.290
 harrington who had convinced three 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:13.939
 Hardly hardened prisoners of durmand 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.500
 hardened to join him for 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.689
 make a makeshift airplane with 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.510
 best age horses of the bars in 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.190
 metal radiators as well as 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.250
 fans plus shirts and 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.599
 gas cylinders for production 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.459
 unfortunately and ben the tensions 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.319
 remont was being born within 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.220
 of the group which caused the death of 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:37.599
 harrington of the three protagonists who 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.560
 was called salvador of the case the other 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.269
 Switzerland only their actors names 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.980
 that I remember michael madsen and ray 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.090
 liotta here we kill and albert 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.560
 harrington they went to let go 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.209
 the electric except in the 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.340
 trailer not in the balance in 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.859
 the intro the move the dead by raising 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.959
 carlington power down the guardian for 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.579
 able to escape putting his plan 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.859
 of action but the guardian reborn under a 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.659
 form of satanist zombies here is so 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.609
 it's melting now that the more one becomes a 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.889
 Nazi not a Nazi since it's not 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.440
 the same thing becomes the den of the 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.780
 devil or hours 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.299
 simply because we actually 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.919
 found in hell after our notes get 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.609
 say our three prisoners be 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:18.859
 passed to the electric chair in the 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.810
 story that is narrated by the guardian 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.820
 and that albert arlington night died at 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.139
 share these three people they get 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.719
 find all four in auction 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.250
 a hell that is rather like it's called 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:29.930
 that with their environment because 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.790
 you know that when you sell the auction 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.080
 most of the time 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.180
 we are with his environment that we 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.470
 was on chip it was jail and ben 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.030
 he finds himself in a prison 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.430
 a bad chariot for example quote that a 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.770
 hate mcdonald's and who goes to hell 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.930
 well he will be in a mcdonald's here 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.340
 so that at purely count what 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.980
 I said we are good it is not attention 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.390
 so that was basically our four 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.820
 protagonists find themselves in a 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.440
 little hell foot who's doing them 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.460
 a staff since the four with 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.230
 common points that they were all 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.390
 two then four years farm and alcatraz 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.150
 and so when we get on the plane and we 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.730
 is getting a secret secret eh ben 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.650
 there are four electric seats and which 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.960
 often appears after two rounds 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.760
 to have was on the bridge and where there is 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.230
 marked our purchases and your kind 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.540
 finally you will put a small miniature 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.010
 to enlighten you as to what in 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.110
 do the devil and impute a big troll 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.900
 and who in fact no one can 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.370
 stand out at 2000 finally seemingly 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:25.660
 nobody can leave because here 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.820
 a fake date the bundle push of 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.200
 bridges at that year in the game 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.460
 is not built yet it was 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.080
 only the developers who had 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.340
 all this solution to be able to put 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.120
 the taste buds pornichet do a sequel 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.260
 to secrecy 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.360
 the point is like you could 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.970
 find right in the middle of the ocean and 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.170
 only one way out and 10 at the 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.550
 swim but unfortunately this time 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.780
 it's real milk visited in prison 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.830
 alcatraz people we make them 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.330
 niche points over 30 degrees for 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.040
 the usual or hot like that if a 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.440
 day a person failed to 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.190
 escape into the cold water that was at 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.750
 minus 2 I'm more at first summer at 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.190
 -10 ° in the month and a ferret a crisis 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.530
 cardiac a thermal shock or so 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.910
 would not be flat at all to swim 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.950
 would eat by retaining them 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.590
 so basically we four prisoners 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.830
 are destined to live and relive the same 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.540
 thing 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.550
 then there may be some dirt 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.860
 relative with the weasel since one can 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.360
 redo of course trace the story of 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.070
 our four protagonists in their 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.660
 own hell then located in arlington 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.700
 why here it stops but in 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.140
 does the cycle continues since and on a 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.570
 movie they're jailed for a 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.000
 prison understood at the end so well no 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.370
 will come to the two things that are 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.290
 very very weird as you know we in 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.020
 normally do everything there is lias 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.759
 dollar everywhere there are dragons 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.550
 as there are monsters there are corpses 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.180
 more skull of meaning to all that 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.129
 is morbid 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.500
 so why are we on the bridge 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:46.470
 sees there on earth what does not allow to 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.479
 land the moon francisco franco 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.849
 san francisco by lampard in francisco 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.900
 this is eh ben there are the fireworks 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:53.310
 which are drawn no I have not yet 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.720
 found of date at a time when there was 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.419
 fireworks maybe the 14th 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.530
 July I do not really know where I 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:00.419
 have not found because such a means of fire 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.680
 fireworks drawn at this time surely 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.759
 to inaugurate a perhaps the 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.680
 new bridge that was going to be built 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:06.620
 well, that 's what it's all about 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:11.099
 any means it is me who thinks 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.360
 experts but how do you explain that to me 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:15.090
 will say in the comments if there is any 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.199
 who go through there then the second 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.400
 something that's weird it's this you 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:19.169
 know when we're on the docks 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.090
 they all come to camp for money 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:22.349
 sniper bullets fired and 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.759
 succeed at one shot and the unspoken 

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:24.930
 and if they of course did not see the 

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.319
 electrical impulse and he scales 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.090
 rockets 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:28.380
 it means that someone in this is 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.690
 not automatic since, turret 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.710
 that time the star tomatoes 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.909
 does not exist my come from the ranks 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.500
 kinder toten automatic turrets 

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:35.909
 in the theater a sense not either 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.080
 if they moan that that but hey we can 

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:38.130
 always consider who is someone from 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.020
 living inside this tower which 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.490
 wants to help them but also good this 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.520
 small or Belgian mentioned in the 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:46.590
 loading time of mauvezin 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.880
 so these are the two elements the load 

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.240
 not at all explain them if someone 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.340
 can help me I would make him 

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.509
 give my full gratitude here and 

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.979
 well that's what the video sarhane 

00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:57.779
 of course there will be a bonus 3 game 

00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:59.550
 for those two things that are not 

00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:01.500
 maybe not explained hamelin who 

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.509
 will remain a mystery or even then the 

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.949
 numbers the codes all here finally so 

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:06.960
 it's part 2 for me it's the end 

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:07.949
 that was the conclusion and I hope that 

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.029

00:08:07.949 --> 00:08:11.460
