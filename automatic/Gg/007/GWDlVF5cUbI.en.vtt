you<00:00:02.170> don't<00:00:02.470> always<00:00:02.800> have<00:00:03.010> to<00:00:03.370> have<00:00:03.639> a<00:00:03.669> new

00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:03.879 
you don't always have to have a new

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:05.460 
you don't always have to have a new
cylinder<00:00:04.240> there's<00:00:04.420> a<00:00:04.480> couple<00:00:04.720> of<00:00:04.899> ways<00:00:05.140> of

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:05.470 
cylinder there's a couple of ways of

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.270 
cylinder there's a couple of ways of
doing<00:00:06.220> it<00:00:06.309> without<00:00:06.460> now<00:00:07.359> one<00:00:08.200> way<00:00:08.440> is<00:00:08.830> to<00:00:08.889> put

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:09.280 
doing it without now one way is to put

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.460 
doing it without now one way is to put
in<00:00:09.370> a<00:00:09.400> preheated<00:00:09.910> up<00:00:10.600> which<00:00:10.840> is<00:00:11.020> obviously

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:11.470 
in a preheated up which is obviously

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.990 
in a preheated up which is obviously
it's<00:00:11.650> another<00:00:11.890> new<00:00:12.160> cylinder<00:00:12.610> but<00:00:12.700> it's<00:00:12.850> not

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
it's another new cylinder but it's not

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.750 
it's another new cylinder but it's not
replacing<00:00:13.570> your<00:00:13.690> existing<00:00:14.170> one<00:00:14.380> and<00:00:15.280> that<00:00:15.490> has

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
replacing your existing one and that has

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.580 
replacing your existing one and that has
quite<00:00:16.059> a<00:00:16.090> good<00:00:16.299> benefit<00:00:16.750> because<00:00:16.960> the<00:00:17.289> solar

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
quite a good benefit because the solar

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.939 
quite a good benefit because the solar
is<00:00:17.980> never<00:00:18.430> competing<00:00:19.440> against<00:00:20.440> anything<00:00:20.650> in

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
is never competing against anything in

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.830 
is never competing against anything in
its<00:00:21.340> cylinder<00:00:21.760> so<00:00:21.910> can<00:00:22.090> always<00:00:22.390> heat<00:00:22.600> that

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
its cylinder so can always heat that

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.580 
its cylinder so can always heat that
cylinder<00:00:23.199> up<00:00:23.410> from<00:00:23.770> cold<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:26.199> other<00:00:26.350> ways

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
cylinder up from cold the other ways

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.680 
cylinder up from cold the other ways
there's<00:00:27.010> there's<00:00:27.220> a<00:00:27.310> few<00:00:27.609> systems<00:00:28.240> for

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690 
there's there's a few systems for

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.720 
there's there's a few systems for
instance<00:00:28.960> that<00:00:29.109> will<00:00:29.320> is<00:00:29.440> so<00:00:29.770> a<00:00:29.800> siphon<00:00:30.400> that

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
instance that will is so a siphon that

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.660 
instance that will is so a siphon that
can<00:00:30.880> be<00:00:30.970> attached<00:00:31.300> to<00:00:31.600> the<00:00:31.840> cylinder<00:00:32.370> but<00:00:33.370> used

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
can be attached to the cylinder but used

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.489 
can be attached to the cylinder but used
how<00:00:33.879> to<00:00:33.940> make<00:00:34.359> sure<00:00:34.690> that<00:00:34.960> your<00:00:35.079> existing

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:35.499 
how to make sure that your existing

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:37.410 
how to make sure that your existing
cylinder<00:00:35.890> is<00:00:36.100> of<00:00:36.399> sufficient<00:00:36.729> storage

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
cylinder is of sufficient storage

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.290 
cylinder is of sufficient storage
capacity<00:00:38.229> in<00:00:38.319> the<00:00:38.409> first<00:00:38.679> place<00:00:38.920> because<00:00:39.639> the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
capacity in the first place because the

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.779 
capacity in the first place because the
solar<00:00:40.600> systems<00:00:41.170> will<00:00:41.739> work<00:00:42.159> when<00:00:42.429> the<00:00:42.519> sun's

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
solar systems will work when the sun's

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.969 
solar systems will work when the sun's
shining<00:00:43.329> so<00:00:43.749> you<00:00:43.809> have<00:00:44.019> to<00:00:44.170> ensure<00:00:44.469> that<00:00:44.739> when

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:44.979 
shining so you have to ensure that when

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:46.619 
shining so you have to ensure that when
the<00:00:45.100> sun<00:00:45.249> shining<00:00:45.489> you<00:00:45.729> make<00:00:45.909> the<00:00:46.059> most<00:00:46.239> of<00:00:46.449> it

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
the sun shining you make the most of it

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.469 
the sun shining you make the most of it
so<00:00:47.379> it's<00:00:48.039> very<00:00:48.370> important<00:00:49.059> to<00:00:49.120> ensure<00:00:49.420> that

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
so it's very important to ensure that

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.209 
so it's very important to ensure that
you've<00:00:49.749> got<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.109> crack<00:00:50.319> storage<00:00:50.679> capacity

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
you've got the crack storage capacity

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.189 
you've got the crack storage capacity
and<00:00:51.429> it's<00:00:52.089> also<00:00:52.299> very<00:00:52.569> important<00:00:52.959> that<00:00:52.989> you've

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
and it's also very important that you've

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.579 
and it's also very important that you've
got<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.530> correct<00:00:54.179> exchange<00:00:55.179> rate<00:00:55.600> inside

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
got the correct exchange rate inside

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:57.750 
got the correct exchange rate inside
whatever<00:00:57.010> you<00:00:57.129> are<00:00:57.190> attaching<00:00:57.429> to<00:00:57.729> the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
whatever you are attaching to the

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.939 
whatever you are attaching to the
cylinder<00:00:58.239> because<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.839> solar<00:00:59.079> panels<00:00:59.530> quite

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
cylinder because the solar panels quite

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.349 
cylinder because the solar panels quite
often<00:01:00.129> will<00:01:00.489> work<00:01:00.670> at<00:01:00.850> a<00:01:00.909> very<00:01:01.119> low

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
often will work at a very low

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.689 
often will work at a very low
temperature<00:01:01.569> that<00:01:02.499> that<00:01:02.679> low<00:01:02.949> gradient<00:01:03.280> is

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
temperature that that low gradient is

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.250 
temperature that that low gradient is
still<00:01:03.909> very<00:01:04.059> useful<00:01:04.629> so<00:01:04.809> you<00:01:04.869> want<00:01:05.019> to<00:01:05.110> make

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
still very useful so you want to make

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.470 
still very useful so you want to make
sure<00:01:05.290> that<00:01:05.530> you<00:01:05.800> can<00:01:06.070> get<00:01:06.970> every<00:01:07.270> bit<00:01:07.300> of

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
sure that you can get every bit of

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.170 
sure that you can get every bit of
energy<00:01:07.690> out<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.110> it<00:01:08.350> possible<00:01:08.920> so<00:01:09.550> in<00:01:09.940> most

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
energy out of it possible so in most

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.690 
energy out of it possible so in most
cases<00:01:10.570> we<00:01:11.200> fit<00:01:11.500> new<00:01:11.890> to<00:01:12.070> them<00:01:12.160> as<00:01:12.310> we<00:01:12.430> believe

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
cases we fit new to them as we believe

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.520 
cases we fit new to them as we believe
that<00:01:12.730> the<00:01:13.030> additional<00:01:13.510> costs<00:01:13.780> involved<00:01:14.260> with

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
that the additional costs involved with

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.530 
that the additional costs involved with
fitting<00:01:14.800> a<00:01:14.860> new<00:01:14.890> cylinder<00:01:15.520> is<00:01:15.880> far<00:01:16.360> outweighed

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
fitting a new cylinder is far outweighed

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.050 
fitting a new cylinder is far outweighed
with<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.290> efficiency<00:01:17.830> gains<00:01:18.340> in<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.730> life<00:01:18.910> of

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
most cases again rough rule of thumb we

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.770 
most cases again rough rule of thumb we
normally<00:01:29.890> double<00:01:30.520> what<00:01:31.180> you<00:01:31.390> all<00:01:31.540> you<00:01:31.750> all

your data capacity is now in a normal
household<00:01:35.110> you're<00:01:35.620> normally<00:01:35.980> looking<00:01:36.310> at

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
household you're normally looking at

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.900 
household you're normally looking at
around<00:01:36.700> about<00:01:36.910> 50<00:01:37.480> litres<00:01:37.870> per<00:01:37.900> person<00:01:38.770> in<00:01:39.730> the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
around about 50 litres per person in the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.450 
around about 50 litres per person in the
household<00:01:40.390> anywhere<00:01:40.960> from<00:01:41.080> from<00:01:41.470> 30<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.920> 60

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
household anywhere from from 30 to 60

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.190 
household anywhere from from 30 to 60
litres<00:01:42.730> per<00:01:42.790> person<00:01:43.300> use<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.720> around<00:01:43.810> 50

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
litres per person use it around 50

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.320 
litres per person use it around 50
litres<00:01:44.500> per<00:01:44.530> person<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.340> then<00:01:45.880> we<00:01:46.000> look<00:01:46.180> at

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
litres per person and then we look at

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.230 
litres per person and then we look at
doubling<00:01:46.750> it<00:01:46.930> for<00:01:47.200> sober<00:01:47.409> so<00:01:48.190> in<00:01:48.550> most<00:01:48.850> cases
