00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.830
 Hey, guys, weibo, guys, in the video. 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.080
 I'm going to have to redo a video that I've already 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.849
 I made an editorial to download and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.070
 install a map of the time of ventura that 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.660
 it would be this video here I 'm doing there 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.700
 again because there are a lot of people 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.320
 no doubt minecraft updated by 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.140
 In addition, doubts are 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.910
 increasing and I was also asked to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.100
 comments for me to do again then 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.900
 is redoing to clarify everything to 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.780
 you and let's go 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.559
 the first attack of 1972 20 this one 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.920
 the map 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.020
 obviously I'm going to copy files to the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.570
 subscription is leaving you 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.219
 so there is no beauty error since here 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.379
 he will appear and if this little window 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.629
 here youtube you click the first 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.570
 link and then stays back on the first 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.789
 link it will already download direct you can 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.860
 realize that male that we already can 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.350
 close and define on the internet and you 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:09.000
 going slow or slow there varies from 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.130
 every internet and cleaning is heavy case 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.229
 so depending on your internet can 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.890
 take a little but have no error is just 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.080
 download the beauty and the second link to people 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.670
 You'll find this is a program. 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.349
 so we can install the texture 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.899
 because the map comes along with a texture 

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:28.380
 and it 's all here within yourself 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:30.030
 so do not worry about 2 20 of map and 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.619
 texture contact along with it so went 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.490

 file alone here is the texture and pec 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:45.120
 This is a beauty map, we'll do it. 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.530
 the following will open this text in 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.170
 Spotlight 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.090

 select ipec text you want for the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.609
 people like to convert 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:02.609
 Are you selecting adventure here?

 interests that here we can play 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.659
 It's no use for me anymore than the 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.069
 which turned out to be probably 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.159

 these two files here we already have 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.609
 and they are unnecessary and we have a 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:26.519
 map and the texture we will see even if the 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.419
