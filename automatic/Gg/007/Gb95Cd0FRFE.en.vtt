00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.600
 highly 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:05.040
 probably a feeling of annoyance after such a game 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.100
 there must be moments in this game with us 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.870
 of course it was to get more but I want 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.150
 say what is really a game 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.150
 It was such an interesting battle on 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.190
 truly uncompromising fans 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.380
 which was really a lot and 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.030
 fans on one side 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.490
 I think we enjoyed it 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.770
 I would certainly like to play better not 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.440
 everything turned out including in 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.130
 organizational implementations of some kind 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.950
 moments here we will need to work 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:42.690
 before the next but rather than but 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:46.460
 In general, the guys are very fully laid out 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.460
 I am grateful to them for this match
