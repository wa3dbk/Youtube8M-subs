00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 two 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.719
 hi players since I liked them so much 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.959
 the 23 things you did not know about sailor 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:13.820
 moon 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.650
 in this chapter we will draw the 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.140
 pet that we all wanted to have in 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.410
 our childhood to the cute and adorable 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.390
 good moon in this case to draw the 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.220
 Let moon from his eyes as 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.009
 they are the center of your face and hence 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.910
 we can take out the body milestone then what 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.910
 let's do like this 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.629
 and the other eye we are going to do 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.629
 exactly the same 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.170
 let's do here the shape of inside 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.330
 on the other side and half 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.370
 Well there are many ways to do 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.110
 river that have the eyes of the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.850
 Japanese animation characters from 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.890
 Suddenly they can be redondito or they can 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.530
 be oval and depending on its size 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.030
 can emphasize the expression but in 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.620
 this case how are we going to make the moon 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.020
 is the normal one has a shine in shape 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.610
 triangular with a very large pupil that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.160
 It gives the appearance of a kitten very very 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.560
 tender then let's do here the 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.770
 brightness 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.939
 to one side the same brightness to the other side 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.630
 which, as I said, is in the form of 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:23.500
 triangle and here we are going to make your pupil 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.500
 a big man 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.960
 and on the other side you can already see how they are 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.229
 a little bit your eyes after we go to 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.659
 make a small nose in the center 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.490
 that are alice is very very small and its 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.590
 boquita tiny cookie 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.250
 Now let's continue on his face to 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.770
 to be able to emphasize your body and so 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.580
 it goes and it will give us a better order 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.720
 let's start on this side 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.720
 his story 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.920
 your forehead up there 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.920
 we can do it up here to your ear 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.920
 and so we mark the inside 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.629
 that have the ears of cats that 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.850
 Normally it is a different color 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.600
 color of j 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.600
 here we are 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.710
 and the same in the inside 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.410
 we are going to mark the inside 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.360
 our cheek 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.660
 here we are going to do about pivot milestones 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.170
 define on each side 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.170
 Y 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.720
 that depending on which side it is 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.810
 looking normally one side is more 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.270
 big mustaches heat 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.480
 obviously in the center of your forehead 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.200
 let's make your moon which is what I 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.200
 gives his name 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.770
 in this case a whole moon a half 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.200
 moon but as with their little pieces looking 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.420
 upwards now let's continue with your 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.640
 body let's start the for everything 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.830
 which is the outline of your body so that 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.720
 so this we can define their legs their 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.060
 tail and everything that goes inside the body 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.940
 then let's start with your back 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.100
 here 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.320
 it's a big curve 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.710
 down here and we're going to end up with 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.810
 your little leg then let's do the part 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.430
 from al pechito we are going to leave a space 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.590
 because the image that I have reference 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.660
 and one has its tail that comes out 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.360
 behind and we will make him a 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.310
 little bit forward 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.300
 we are going to do here 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.140
 her little leg 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:43.240
 there 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:45.010
 the leg that passes over water 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.020
 and we're also going to leave the space of the 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.630
 cabbage 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.630
 then now let's make your tail that 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.140
 it goes from here down to 10 at 3 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.150
 legs 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.150
 splendorous goes ahead 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.620
 and to finish we're going to do his knee 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.159
 from the back leg 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.159
 milito 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.470
 good to players I hope you have them 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.120
 served these tips to learn to 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.220
 draw the moon so remember
