worry about secrecy to too much

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.330 
worry about secrecy to too much
obviously<00:00:46.590> that's<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.010> say<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.129> they

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
obviously that's not to say that they

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.580 
obviously that's not to say that they
don't<00:00:47.370> care<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.930> less<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.440> concern

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
don't care but it is less of a concern

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.319 
don't care but it is less of a concern
for<00:00:49.770> than<00:00:49.980> arguably<00:00:50.550> i<00:00:50.610> would<00:00:50.789> say<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.149> for

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
for than arguably i would say for is for

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.290 
for than arguably i would say for is for
some<00:00:51.449> other<00:00:51.570> companies<00:00:52.969> this<00:00:53.969> would<00:00:54.120> be<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
some other companies this would be the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.049 
some other companies this would be the
note<00:00:54.480> i<00:00:55.320> believe<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.160> upper<00:00:56.640> there's

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
note i believe this is the upper there's

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.729 
note i believe this is the upper there's
a<00:00:57.120> tat<00:00:57.329> pro<00:00:57.539> big<00:00:57.870> difference<00:00:58.199> obviously<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
a tat pro big difference obviously it

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.729 
a tat pro big difference obviously it
lacks<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.340> s-pen<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.780> does<00:01:00.989> actually<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.410> think

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
lacks the s-pen it does actually I think

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.930 
lacks the s-pen it does actually I think
that's<00:01:01.859> interesting<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.370> sort<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.579> retains

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
that's interesting it sort of retains

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.780 
that's interesting it sort of retains
the<00:01:03.600> sort<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.409> faux<00:01:04.619> leather<00:01:04.979> trim<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.670> we

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
style interface this is very interesting

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.130

what's<00:04:18.700> called<00:04:18.880> it<00:04:18.970> back<00:04:19.090> then<00:04:19.150> yeah<00:04:19.620> but<00:04:20.620> I

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
what's called it back then yeah but I

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.170 
what's called it back then yeah but I

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
think it makes a lot more sense on an

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.480 
think it makes a lot more sense on an
actual<00:04:22.330> travel<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:24.669> galaxy<00:04:24.990> note<00:04:25.990> 10.1<00:04:26.800> way

android<00:04:29.500> tablets<00:04:29.800> because<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.550> note<00:04:30.760> formula

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
android tablets because the note formula

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.690 
android tablets because the note formula
just<00:04:31.630> makes<00:04:31.930> so<00:04:32.260> much<00:04:32.500> more<00:04:32.770> sense<00:04:32.830> on<00:04:33.639> a

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
just makes so much more sense on a
