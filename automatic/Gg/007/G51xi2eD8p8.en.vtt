00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
but I get the gist of it um so

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.840 
but I get the gist of it um so
apparently<00:01:07.740> youtube<00:01:08.340> has<00:01:08.460> an<00:01:08.640> automatic

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
apparently youtube has an automatic

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.910 
apparently youtube has an automatic
Content<00:01:09.600> ID<00:01:09.720> claim<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.229> goes<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.560> music

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
Content ID claim that it goes with music

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.440 
Content ID claim that it goes with music
gameplay<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.580> everything<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.299> they're

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
gameplay and everything so they're

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.780 
gameplay and everything so they're
making<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> can't<00:01:13.170> really<00:01:13.260> claim

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
making it so you can't really claim

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.210 
making it so you can't really claim
which<00:01:14.790> means<00:01:15.000> put<00:01:15.210> money<00:01:15.420> ads<00:01:15.689> etc<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.530> stuff

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
which means put money ads etc on stuff

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.760 
which means put money ads etc on stuff
that<00:01:17.250> isn't<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:18.000> hundred<00:01:18.780> percent<00:01:18.900> yours<00:01:19.530> if

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that isn't a hundred percent yours if

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.140 
that isn't a hundred percent yours if
that<00:01:19.890> makes<00:01:20.070> sense<00:01:20.220> even<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.060> have

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
that makes sense even if you have

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.390 
that makes sense even if you have
permission<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:22.229> can't<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.830> unless<00:01:22.979> it's

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
permission you can't do that unless it's

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.179 
permission you can't do that unless it's
yours<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.060> uh<00:01:24.439> basically<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.650> only<00:01:25.770> people

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
yours and uh basically the only people

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.920 
yours and uh basically the only people
that<00:01:26.250> are<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.610> able<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.150> continue<00:01:27.390> do

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
that are going to be able to continue do

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.020

managed by their partnership company so

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.490 
managed by their partnership company so
that<00:01:33.060> means<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> comp<00:01:33.600> partition<00:01:34.200> company

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
then you won't have to worry about

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.069 
then you won't have to worry about
anything<00:01:38.119> you're<00:01:39.119> rather<00:01:39.210> affiliated<00:01:39.900> or

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
anything you're rather affiliated or

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.749 
anything you're rather affiliated or
your<00:01:40.350> matters<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.280> think<00:01:41.460> there's<00:01:41.579> some<00:01:41.670> other

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
your matters I think there's some other

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.340 
your matters I think there's some other
stuff<00:01:41.850> too<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> little<00:01:42.899> generally

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
stuff too but it's a little generally

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.319 
stuff too but it's a little generally
I'm<00:01:43.740> affiliated<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.460> I'm<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:44.670> mission<00:01:45.240> him

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
I'm affiliated so I'm not mission him

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.789 
I'm affiliated so I'm not mission him
doesn't<00:01:45.570> manage<00:01:45.869> my<00:01:45.990> channel<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.350> manage<00:01:46.770> my

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
doesn't manage my channel I manage my

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.100 
doesn't manage my channel I manage my
channel<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.820> uh<00:01:47.850> yeah<00:01:48.390> basically<00:01:48.630> i<00:01:48.840> would

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
channel so uh yeah basically i would

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.230 
channel so uh yeah basically i would
have<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.290> do<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.829> myself<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.399> basically<00:01:51.119> i

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
have to do it for myself and basically i

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.670 
have to do it for myself and basically i
think<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.659> takes<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.869> two<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.200> four<00:01:52.350> days<00:01:52.530> to

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
think it takes a two to four days to

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.859 
think it takes a two to four days to
monetize<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> video<00:01:53.490> i'll<00:01:54.090> put<00:01:54.360> ads<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.720> it

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
monetize the video i'll put ads on it

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.950 
monetize the video i'll put ads on it
etc<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:56.299> that's<00:01:57.299> what's<00:01:57.509> basically<00:01:57.689> happening

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
etc so that's what's basically happening

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.569 
etc so that's what's basically happening
and<00:01:58.439> they're<00:01:58.649> making<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.040> Content<00:01:59.430> ID
