 remember that we had previously 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.420
 made the sweater quoted was extracted by the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.210
 parts of here in front of the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.130
 shoulders and this panties is the same

 who are encouraged to do this work 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.630
 on board today we are going to 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.720
 use thread in this case 3 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.270
 millimeters thick 22 chillos 1 of 2 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.550
 millimeters and the other 2 points 75 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.550
 millimeters and scissors 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.129
 to start our pants we are going to 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.199
 make 50 +2 chains to form your 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.780
 first high point and our first 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:49.200
 back would be high points only 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.240
 there would be 53 high points 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.240
 turn 2 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.220
 3 4 5 and 6 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.920
 we are going to make them in elastic point 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.520
 alternating a high point and a high point 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.520
 raised 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.410
 is to form the waistband of our 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.120
 pants this pants are going to do 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.370
 in two parts 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.390
 let's go to two equal parts this would be the 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.390
 half only 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.000
 and already the other would be exactly the same as 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.010
 is 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 then of the return number 2 3 4 5 and 6 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.620
 let's make elastic knit 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.510
 once we have finished our 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.360
 six turns of elastic knit we go to 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.980
 continue with our reasons I forgot 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.600
 tell them that for our point 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.380
 elastic we are going to use the crochet 2 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.150
 millimeters already for our reasons 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.150
 let's start with the crochet 2 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.830
 points 75 millimeters and we make two 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.900
 chains let's make a high point to the 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.710
 start and another at the end of each of 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.659
 our laps 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.159
 and in the first point we are going to make a 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.159
 pineapple we make 1 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.960
 two 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.380
 and three half high points we close them 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.370
 1 2 and the third point we make a point 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.370
 high here the cross points 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.550
 and in the previous point we do again 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.360
 a point 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.360
 high 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.250
 we continue with the pineapple 1 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.210
 two 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.190
 and three out of ten high points we closed 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.630
 we recount 1 2 and 3 to do 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.280
 our cross points 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.510
 is the pattern that we are going to follow in 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.720
 our first round of our 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.720
 grounds 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.830
 the next point we make the pineapple 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.800
 to start our second round of 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.240
 the reasons we are going to be exactly in 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.250
 the procedure but here where we have 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:24.090
 the cross point let's make the pineapple 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.690
 with 1 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.690
 two 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.200
 three half high points closed 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.470
 and where we have the pineapple 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.770
 cross point we make a high point 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.760
 after our pineapple and another point 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:47.600
 high before the is the procedure 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.760
 what are we going to continue 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.410
 and this we are going to do for 15 laps 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.319
 be 15 laps 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.030
 before 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.260
 and I started what has been the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.370
 part of the 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.370
 of the leg 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.120
 two 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.670
 and three half points now more equal 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.060
 here we make the high point after the 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.060
 pineapple 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.100
 and a previous one like that and that's the only thing 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.110
 what are we going to do as we commented 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.569
 go contrasting 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.340
 we do not have the pineapple is the cross point 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.350
 then pineapple and cross point until 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.630
 get to 15 laps 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.420
 once we have finished 15 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.050
 turns 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:46.680
 let's eliminate three reasons at the beginning 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.410
 and three at the end 1 2 3 and and we continue 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.970
 with the same pattern that we had 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.970
 Cross points and pineapples 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.670
 and this we would do the same for 15 laps 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.670
 as well 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.110
 only in this as I commented 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.780
 we are going to decrease three reasons at the beginning 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.560
 and three at the end and in the other laps 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.070
 let's make the points that were left of 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.070
 of this round 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.830
 once we have sown our 15 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.770
 laps from where we did the 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.690
 decreases 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.240
 let's change a new crochet 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.150
 2 millimeters and this is because we are going to 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.220
 make the waistband point again 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.919
 We make two chains to form our 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.199
 first high point and here we are going to 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.539
 take as follows where 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:45.129
 we have the pineapple we're just going to do 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:46.899
 a high point 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.379
 when they were crossed points and 

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:49.379
 let's do 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.260
 1 and 2 high points are in each of 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.420
 the points that we cross again the pineapple 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.800
 it's just a high point is the pattern 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.470
 that we will continue in the first round 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.880
 of the waistband already from the bottom 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.880
 of the trousers 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:15.630
 2 again the pineapple is 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.630
 we have to be 30 high points 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.560
 and once we finish our first 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:23.599
 return of high points the return of two 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.349
 three and the fourth we will make a 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:26.349
 elastic point 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.889
 and he has finished all four laps 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.990
 we cut our thread the other part and 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:38.110
 remember that there are going to be two two parts 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.240
 two halves this is one the exactly 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:45.389
 equal to this after this we will join now 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.389
 our pant pieces 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:50.580
 once we have had our two 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:52.529
 pieces let's start to join and 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.779
 first we are going to join the part of the 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:57.089
 only leg is here until the shot 

00:06:54.779 --> 00:07:00.150
 this is still not going to be done by me 

00:06:57.089 --> 00:07:04.180
 they are and here the two parties 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:08.340
 in the little legs, we are going to join 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.340
 the front and back 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.100
 as we usually join our pieces 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.740
 What are we going to 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.750
 do next 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:25.129
 we make the front 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:28.430
 the back and at the end 

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:31.670
 and we would still go what it is 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:35.380
 the shot and this part of here is what 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:37.180
 last thing that we would have to do and now 

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:40.140
 we almost finished our 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.140
 trousers 

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.860
 once we have joined the part of 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.750
 front and back crotch 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.360
 we would only have to make a ribbon 

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.990
 quoted I only did the little thing the 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.750
 chains 

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:57.080
 after this only hide and 

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.310
 cut our threads 

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.020
 and that would be all 

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:03.800
 I hope and are encouraged to do this 

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.800
 trousers
