00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:08.040
 evaluate everything has accelerated on the booth 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.900
 of such a rise if we would be 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.330
 very intimate devices so it's not 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.880
 a device like all games 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:18.080
 of device with reference design 2 intel 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.039
 for its new processor 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.470
 we will tell our gadgets to be able to 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.360
 pay more the weaker haider who 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.820
 is named alex hinton kennedy who is a 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.590
 little bit below the previous 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.559
 straw metrics that also equips 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.620
 the oranje with intel inside so its 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.960
 particularity actually is to be very 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.760
 dense and a wave of rigor and 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.440
 to propose perf in his tenth novel 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.440
 good enough so we did not have 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.840
 the opportunity to make sentences a 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.850
 maybe later their speed but 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.260
 ends with with this processor is 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.890
 second finally second point it's kelly 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.960
 block another well he announced some 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.150
 thing like at 13h11 autonomy in 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.530
 conversation and what's interesting 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.690
 it's with his kind that you 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.430
 will find you with bouquet 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.820
 less than 200 euros 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.260
 in any case what will happen 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.960
 it's just that we're done 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.280
 feeling with as such already has 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.370
 done with laurent gilles thalys had to 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.080
 you had prices and put back lower 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.850
 course to determine 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.210
 just as convinced as with the network 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.680
 grind inside with the terminals there that 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.180
 use the reference design one have 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.630
 not necessarily it will not always be 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.729
 the case 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.960
 it was with the orange tennis was 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.940
 loosely said to himself or if it can be 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.080
 something it depends on 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.119
 builders is also in terms of 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.860
 manufacturers this summer or interested 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.890
 that's a certainty of both 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.960
 builders at 4 kg or no and a 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.450
 cutter 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.549
 in south america for now 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.360
 Only 40 tracks on 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.550
 markets 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.740
 on products this way with 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.850
 very lower prices Chinese market 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.640
 African markets etc 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.370
 after his prey end up in europe and 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.590
 in the united states 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.120
 he was talking about first quarter 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.100
 end of the first quarter of that we did not 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.770
 not bad date yet is interesting 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.770
 as it is to show that other mwc 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.410
 mega man things potentially more than 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.150
 terminals with this processor is 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.440
 also eventually it would be 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.850
 maybe not hurt but with 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.060
 processor a little bit more powerful 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.500
 are engraved still below the agent 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.290
 we have in 22 Rennes 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.610
 m I believe we can invent one I 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.960
 'm not too sure I'm not the expert 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.880
 dent but I think we found there 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.420
 with lice in one them etc. 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.850
 etc. 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.010
 described as 2013 a big year for 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.060
 intel script that still in 2012 or 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.980
 that does a good job 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.330
 the body in gite and the unsa and the network 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.020
 scratched every other terminal there had 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.330
 also the medicine center and our classes 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.410
 2013 that's really the big boom with 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.760
 especially the arrival of the first 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.120
 keys is god so we can not wait to see 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.120
 it
