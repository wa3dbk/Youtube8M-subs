00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
now on the second fret we're going to go

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.789 
now on the second fret we're going to go
from<00:02:01.009> two<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.549> four<00:02:02.110> right<00:02:03.110> another<00:02:03.289> staccato

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
from two to four right another staccato

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.910 
from two to four right another staccato
hit<00:02:04.069> or<00:02:05.060> palm<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:05.569> hit<00:02:05.750> my<00:02:05.959> button<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.289> then

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
hit or palm you hit my button and then

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.910 
hit or palm you hit my button and then
slide<00:02:07.220> from<00:02:07.429> two<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.819> four<00:02:08.259> um<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:09.890> kind

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
slide from two to four um and I kind

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.509 
slide from two to four um and I kind
likely<00:02:10.280> did<00:02:10.369> that<00:02:10.459> twice<00:02:10.610> so<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:12.190> double<00:02:13.190> slide

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
likely did that twice so a double slide

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.800 
likely did that twice so a double slide
but<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.760> can<00:02:13.819> go<00:02:15.010> so<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.190> ring<00:02:16.340> out<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:17.569> now

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
but you can go so that ring out and now

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.660 
but you can go so that ring out and now
to<00:02:17.870> get<00:02:18.110> that<00:02:18.230> fullness<00:02:18.560> sound<00:02:18.980> all<00:02:19.250> I'm<00:02:19.340> doing

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
to get that fullness sound all I'm doing

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.130 
to get that fullness sound all I'm doing
