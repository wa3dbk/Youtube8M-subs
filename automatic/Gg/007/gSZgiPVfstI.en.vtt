eagles before having a close win against
the<00:01:24.150> chiefs<00:01:24.509> i<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:25.619> there<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:25.920> be<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the chiefs i think there would be on the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.710 
the chiefs i think there would be on the
edge<00:01:26.430> are<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> little<00:01:26.909> bit<00:01:27.060> over<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> cheese<00:01:27.509> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
edge are a little bit over the cheese I

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.580 
edge are a little bit over the cheese I
don't<00:01:27.900> think<00:01:28.020> that's<00:01:28.080> gonna<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.409> really

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
don't think that's gonna be a really

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.170 
don't think that's gonna be a really
good<00:01:28.770> game<00:01:28.950> though<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.880> will<00:01:30.000> show

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
good game though but that will show

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.980 
good game though but that will show
either<00:01:30.360> way<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.430> yeah<00:01:32.430> then<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.600> them

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
either way so yeah then I have them

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.810 
either way so yeah then I have them
beating<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> ramp<00:01:34.740> before<00:01:35.130> losing<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
beating the ramp before losing to the
