00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
makes with the controller so it if I'm

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.600 
makes with the controller so it if I'm
low<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.540> ammo<00:00:36.989> which<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.440> am<00:00:37.590> right<00:00:37.829> now<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.219> just

you'll<00:01:54.250> see<00:01:54.430> on<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.610> screen<00:01:54.730> my<00:01:55.180> camera

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
you'll see on the screen my camera

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.030 
you'll see on the screen my camera
starts<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:55.930> move<00:01:56.050> all<00:01:56.260> over<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.620> place<00:01:56.800> and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
starts to move all over the place and

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.040 
starts to move all over the place and
I'm<00:01:57.130> no<00:01:57.310> longer<00:01:57.490> able<00:01:57.760> to<00:01:58.090> aim<00:01:58.330> where<00:01:58.930> my

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
I'm no longer able to aim where my

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.170 
I'm no longer able to aim where my
grenade<00:01:59.380> is<00:01:59.500> coming<00:01:59.830> so<00:02:00.550> what<00:02:01.000> we've<00:02:01.150> done

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
grenade is coming so what we've done

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.080

this<00:02:01.480> time<00:02:01.660> around<00:02:01.810> is<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:03.490> can<00:02:03.640> actually<00:02:03.670> use

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
this time around is you can actually use

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.380 
this time around is you can actually use
l1<00:02:04.570> to<00:02:05.290> pick<00:02:05.860> up<00:02:05.980> a<00:02:06.040> grenade<00:02:06.340> and<00:02:07.030> you<00:02:07.150> start

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
l1 to pick up a grenade and you start

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.020 
l1 to pick up a grenade and you start
cooking<00:02:07.510> it<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:07.990> I<00:02:08.170> can<00:02:08.350> aim<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:09.640> throw<00:02:09.670> the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
cooking it and I can aim and throw the

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.550 
cooking it and I can aim and throw the
grenade<00:02:10.270> exactly<00:02:10.750> where<00:02:10.930> I<00:02:10.960> wanted<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.290> throw

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
grenade exactly where I wanted to throw

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.310 
grenade exactly where I wanted to throw
so<00:02:12.340> again<00:02:12.820> this<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.150> very<00:02:13.360> intuitive<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:14.050> just

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
so again this is very intuitive I just

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.900 
so again this is very intuitive I just
hold<00:02:15.310> l1<00:02:15.580> right<00:02:16.330> here<00:02:16.630> aim<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:18.490> throw<00:02:18.550> my

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
hold l1 right here aim and throw my

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.590 
hold l1 right here aim and throw my
grenade<00:02:18.970> right<00:02:19.420> there<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.970> course<00:02:22.270> one<00:02:22.420> of<00:02:22.510> the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
grenade right there of course one of the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.470 
grenade right there of course one of the
other<00:02:22.720> things<00:02:23.020> in<00:02:23.470> terms<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:24.450> gestures<00:02:25.450> that

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
other things in terms of gestures that

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.770 
other things in terms of gestures that
is<00:02:25.720> really<00:02:25.990> cool<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.410> we
