00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.770
 formerly frowned upon as poor-people-eating 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.180
 you can find the cabbage in today long ago 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.590
 a good kitchen of this world 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.910
 Today we want to get the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:28.079
 different types of cabbage and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:30.029
 look at the preparation of the 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.250
 Spicy cabbage is the digestible of all 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.710
 Cabbage tastes a bit sweetish 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.270
 and has a high content of vitamin c 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.420
 red cabbage, on the other hand, contains a lot of iron and 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.860
 Fiber is low in calories too 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.719
 the white cabbage has a high content 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.690
 Vitamin C and have the fall and 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.859
 winter months tv and as a fourth course 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.019
 I have the filigree Brussels sprouts 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.789
 brought just after the first frost 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.289
 he tastes especially good at 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.030
 Make sure that the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.350
 cabbages have no pressure points and 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.030
 that the leaves are close to the body 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.140
 Let's start with the Brussels sprouts 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.289
 we can actually do it all 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.180
 make blanched just normal 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.460
 sauté a bit of butter in onions 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.580
 lard salt pepper and sugar as 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.799
 side my personal tip 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.250
 Strunk remove the leaves from each other 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.380
 Dissolve it as a lukewarm salad of red cabbage 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.320
 who does not know it in the winter time too 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.200
 into dumplings pension need to sweet part 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.710
 it is suitable for me third pear and 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.569
 apple very well spitz nationwide 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.770
 most versatile we can give you one 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.509
 preparing salad 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.970
 we can make casseroles or soups 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.500
 I think that's very small 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.050
 a sweat is cut 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.179
 fill in salt pepper and nutmeg with 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.550
 white wine cream deglaze as a game of cola 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.950
 la creme and as the last coal who at 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.590
 Skoda is of course excellent 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.000
 as sauerkraut the absolute classic 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.319
 also as white cabbage soup the leaves 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.179
 could be great for kohlrouladen 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.860
 use there is simply no 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.929
 border we stood today the times 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.729
 white cabbage and make it the delicious 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.729
 american coleslaw kosler 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.040
 for that we need milk and oil 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.910
 for us our donkey salt and 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.370
 sugar yogurt carrots lemon and 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.680
 Of course you have to have our white cabbage 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.390
 at the white cabbage first the strunk 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.490
 remove 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.200
 Here is solid tastes quite bitter 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:29.570
 of course we do not want ours 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.740
 Salata then halves conditionally you can 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:42.860
 either rub him over the kitchens 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:45.350
 rub or take and got up well 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.910
 press the whole with the stripes 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:53.030
 do not hang together and everyone 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.540
 right on a marinade get that 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.150
 we marinate whole with 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.690
 really have a good pinch of salt there 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.530
 no fear we will need too much 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.030
 salt and sugar 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.709
 I personally used brown 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.690
 cane sugar because it is a single note 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.810
 we bring the whole thing good now 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.810
 on 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.170
 and that draws the whole water 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:22.780
 gets softer and let's go for good 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.780
 20 minutes just stand by 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.810
 for the sauce for our kosler 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:34.860
 we need homemade first 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:41.790
 a donkey to milk around 75 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:44.420
 milliliters a pinch of salt then he means 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.420
 died 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.390
 mix by and now comes to it 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:04.840
 just drop by drop under the milk 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.840
 also beat at a higher level 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:16.410
 then we take two good tablespoons of 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:22.700
 a pinch of our nürburg nail 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.700
 salt a piece of casual 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:37.120
 the whole thing through for your son 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.380
 before de mayo in ours now 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.000

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.690
 whole carrot and the juice of a lemon 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.690
 version 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:05:03.700
 and now we can do ours 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:05:05.140
 still to pass pinch of pepper and 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.720
 finished is our American 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.920
 coleslaw koslov served to classic 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.720
 Spareribs in Hamburg 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.480
 I personally like it most 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.990
 nice rye bread cent butter and basra 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.990
