00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.179 

okay<00:00:18.050> I<00:00:19.039> think<00:00:19.880> it's<00:00:20.060> funny<00:00:20.240> just<00:00:20.689> that<00:00:21.189> we're

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
okay I think it's funny just that we're

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.620 
okay I think it's funny just that we're
take<00:00:22.400> it<00:00:22.609> seems<00:00:22.849> like<00:00:23.029> we're<00:00:23.210> taking<00:00:23.509> this

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
take it seems like we're taking this

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.470 
take it seems like we're taking this
more<00:00:23.869> seriously<00:00:23.929> this<00:00:24.470> time<00:00:24.529> when<00:00:25.160> really<00:00:26.090> we

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
more seriously this time when really we

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.370 
more seriously this time when really we
should<00:00:26.689> have<00:00:26.779> been<00:00:26.899> taking<00:00:27.169> it<00:00:27.230> more

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
should have been taking it more

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.200 
should have been taking it more
seriously<00:00:27.439> the<00:00:28.070> first<00:00:28.340> time<00:00:28.640> years<00:00:29.119> ago

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
seriously the first time years ago

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.030 
seriously the first time years ago
because<00:00:29.599> we<00:00:29.809> knew<00:00:30.649> less<00:00:30.949> back<00:00:31.579> then<00:00:32.829> do<00:00:33.829> you

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
because we knew less back then do you

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.160 
because we knew less back then do you
worry<00:00:34.670> your<00:00:34.879> thoughts<00:00:35.120> on<00:00:35.300> that<00:00:35.329> well<00:00:35.600> no<00:00:36.140> I

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
worry your thoughts on that well no I

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.569 
worry your thoughts on that well no I
mean<00:00:36.320> I<00:00:37.000> mean<00:00:38.530> no<00:00:39.530> I<00:00:39.559> think<00:00:39.800> that<00:00:40.159> the<00:00:40.370> first

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
mean I mean no I think that the first

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.910 
mean I mean no I think that the first
time<00:00:40.820> I<00:00:40.850> think<00:00:41.030> we<00:00:41.239> were<00:00:41.360> careful<00:00:41.629> we<00:00:42.199> we<00:00:42.710> tried

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
time I think we were careful we we tried

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.460 
time I think we were careful we we tried
a<00:00:42.949> couple<00:00:43.460> different<00:00:43.640> ways<00:00:44.000> of<00:00:44.149> doing<00:00:44.300> it<00:00:44.600> we

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
a couple different ways of doing it we

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.630 
a couple different ways of doing it we
did<00:00:45.620> only<00:00:45.739> very<00:00:46.070> small<00:00:46.220> amount<00:00:46.729> and<00:00:47.089> I<00:00:48.640> think

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
did only very small amount and I think

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.210 
did only very small amount and I think
that<00:00:49.790> you<00:00:49.939> know<00:00:50.059> I<00:00:50.089> would<00:00:50.510> spent<00:00:50.839> a<00:00:51.140> good<00:00:51.769> five

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
that you know I would spent a good five

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.030 
that you know I would spent a good five
plus<00:00:52.549> years<00:00:52.930> researching<00:00:53.930> it<00:00:54.229> but<00:00:54.769> I<00:00:54.799> mean

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
plus years researching it but I mean

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.729 
plus years researching it but I mean
there<00:00:55.790> was<00:00:55.879> only<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:56.299> much<00:00:56.479> you<00:00:56.540> can<00:00:56.930> write<00:00:57.710> I

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
there was only so much you can write I

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.130 
there was only so much you can write I
did<00:00:58.100> with<00:00:58.339> Jedi<00:00:58.879> research<00:00:59.390> I<00:00:59.629> still<00:00:59.930> feel<00:01:00.110> bad

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
did with Jedi research I still feel bad

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.649 
did with Jedi research I still feel bad
because<00:01:00.559> I<00:01:00.710> remember<00:01:01.189> that<00:01:01.460> we<00:01:02.059> went<00:01:02.449> deep

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
because I remember that we went deep

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.840 
because I remember that we went deep
under<00:01:03.049> I<00:01:03.110> that<00:01:03.470> went<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:03.860> first<00:01:04.100> time<00:01:04.189> and

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
under I that went the first time and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.390 
under I that went the first time and
there<00:01:05.630> was<00:01:05.750> no<00:01:05.930> way<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:06.170> know<00:01:06.409> well<00:01:06.979> when<00:01:07.189> was

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
there was no way to know well when was

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.950 
there was no way to know well when was
too<00:01:07.580> deep<00:01:07.820> well<00:01:08.119> I<00:01:08.180> think<00:01:08.240> it's<00:01:08.540> inevitable

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
too deep well I think it's inevitable

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.660 
too deep well I think it's inevitable
that<00:01:09.439> you're<00:01:09.650> going<00:01:09.799> to<00:01:09.829> have<00:01:09.920> define<00:01:10.460> those

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
that you're going to have define those

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.210 
that you're going to have define those
limits<00:01:11.210> right<00:01:11.509> now<00:01:12.259> a<00:01:12.290> problem<00:01:12.650> is<00:01:13.040> when

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
limits right now a problem is when

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.520 
limits right now a problem is when
people<00:01:13.369> repeat<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.299> mistake<00:01:14.659> not<00:01:14.810> will<00:01:15.200> make

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
people repeat the mistake not will make

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.219 
people repeat the mistake not will make
me<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.829> first<00:01:15.979> time<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.939> also<00:01:17.119> that<00:01:17.540> it

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
me the first time and also that it

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.020 
me the first time and also that it
seemed<00:01:18.500> rather<00:01:18.710> but<00:01:18.979> it<00:01:19.159> seems<00:01:19.369> to<00:01:19.520> me<00:01:19.700> now

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
seemed rather but it seems to me now

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.230 
seemed rather but it seems to me now
rather<00:01:20.630> barbaric<00:01:20.929> that<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:22.700> different<00:01:23.060> types

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
rather barbaric that the different types

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.730 
rather barbaric that the different types
of<00:01:23.359> hand<00:01:23.600> pilgrim<00:01:23.960> that<00:01:24.079> I<00:01:24.109> tried<00:01:24.350> on<00:01:24.499> Paulie

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
of hand pilgrim that I tried on Paulie

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.919 
of hand pilgrim that I tried on Paulie
at<00:01:25.009> first<00:01:25.219> I'm<00:01:25.460> like<00:01:25.729> that<00:01:26.420> guy<00:01:26.450> I<00:01:26.780> remember

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
at first I'm like that guy I remember

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.929 
at first I'm like that guy I remember
like<00:01:27.259> you<00:01:27.499> even<00:01:27.829> were<00:01:27.920> taking<00:01:28.219> a<00:01:28.280> back<00:01:28.460> bro<00:01:28.759> get

like you even were taking a back bro get
it<00:01:29.030> there<00:01:29.179> what<00:01:29.390> I<00:01:29.420> started<00:01:29.810> going<00:01:30.079> at<00:01:30.259> but<00:01:30.469> the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
it there what I started going at but the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.800 
it there what I started going at but the
thing<00:01:30.770> about<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:31.189> invoking<00:01:31.670> is<00:01:31.999> is<00:01:32.479> that

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
thing about the invoking is is that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.779 
thing about the invoking is is that
we've<00:01:33.229> got<00:01:33.409> a<00:01:33.439> hundred<00:01:33.799> you<00:01:34.369> know<00:01:34.399> a<00:01:34.520> hundred

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
we've got a hundred you know a hundred

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.700 
we've got a hundred you know a hundred
even<00:01:35.149> a<00:01:35.210> two<00:01:35.359> thousand<00:01:35.840> year<00:01:35.869> track<00:01:36.229> record<00:01:36.409> of

even a two thousand year track record of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.649 
even a two thousand year track record of
people<00:01:36.889> successfully<00:01:37.189> hand<00:01:37.969> poking<00:01:38.329> on<00:01:38.479> it's

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
people successfully hand poking on it's

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.959 
people successfully hand poking on it's
right<00:01:38.929> side<00:01:38.990> seam<00:01:39.590> what<00:01:39.829> we<00:01:39.979> had<00:01:40.310> did<00:01:40.579> we<00:01:40.759> had

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
right side seam what we had did we had

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:42.940 
right side seam what we had did we had
to<00:01:41.149> try<00:01:41.420> that<00:01:41.630> method<00:01:41.840> even<00:01:42.439> though<00:01:42.710> we<00:01:42.859> were

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
to try that method even though we were

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.319 
to try that method even though we were
pretty<00:01:43.219> sure<00:01:43.429> that<00:01:43.609> the<00:01:43.729> injection<00:01:44.179> method

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
pretty sure that the injection method

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:45.309 
pretty sure that the injection method
was<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.659> right<00:01:44.929> one

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
was the right one

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.020 
was the right one
the<00:01:45.560> injection<00:01:46.069> method<00:01:46.219> had<00:01:46.429> never<00:01:46.609> been<00:01:46.789> done

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
the injection method had never been done

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.270 
the injection method had never been done
before<00:01:47.060> but<00:01:47.869> but<00:01:48.049> hand<00:01:48.319> poking<00:01:48.920> there<00:01:49.069> was<00:01:49.249> a

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
before but but hand poking there was a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.120 
before but but hand poking there was a
track<00:01:49.609> record<00:01:49.789> formed<00:01:50.389> yeah<00:01:50.959> but<00:01:51.679> what's

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
track record formed yeah but what's

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.129 
track record formed yeah but what's
interesting<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.789> me<00:01:52.819> is<00:01:52.999> that<00:01:53.359> even<00:01:53.569> though

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:54.139 
interesting to me is that even though

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:57.399 
interesting to me is that even though
there's<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:55.369> know<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.840> last<00:01:57.020> time<00:01:57.259> your

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
there's you know the last time your

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.469 
there's you know the last time your
cures<00:01:57.619> doctors<00:01:58.069> have<00:01:58.249> been<00:01:58.399> doing<00:01:58.789> hand

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
cures doctors have been doing hand

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.269 
cures doctors have been doing hand
poking<00:01:59.929> after<00:02:00.200> hand<00:02:00.380> poking<00:02:00.679> after<00:02:00.920> Handbook

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:01.279 
poking after hand poking after Handbook

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:02.980 
poking after hand poking after Handbook
and<00:02:01.310> they<00:02:01.759> keep<00:02:01.939> refining<00:02:02.329> the<00:02:02.630> procedure

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
and they keep refining the procedure

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.809 
and they keep refining the procedure
they're<00:02:03.259> clearly<00:02:03.499> not<00:02:03.649> happy<00:02:04.279> with<00:02:04.429> it<00:02:04.670> so

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
they're clearly not happy with it so

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.300 
they're clearly not happy with it so
that<00:02:05.600> says<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.869> me<00:02:06.049> that<00:02:06.409> it's<00:02:06.590> not<00:02:06.829> an<00:02:07.009> ideal

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
that says to me that it's not an ideal

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.070 
that says to me that it's not an ideal
procedure<00:02:07.549> no<00:02:08.360> not<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.229> why<00:02:09.369> realist<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.700> I

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
procedure no not and why realist and I

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.140 
procedure no not and why realist and I
often<00:02:12.080> think<00:02:12.290> about<00:02:12.380> this<00:02:12.620> like<00:02:12.770> if<00:02:13.099> if<00:02:13.550> we

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
often think about this like if if we

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.860 
often think about this like if if we
could<00:02:14.390> go<00:02:14.510> back<00:02:14.810> will<00:02:15.170> we<00:02:15.319> still<00:02:15.620> do<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.220> I'm<00:02:16.870> I

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
could go back will we still do it I'm I

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.440 
could go back will we still do it I'm I
don't<00:02:18.709> know<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:19.340> think<00:02:19.640> like<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:21.700> think<00:02:22.700> that

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
don't know I think like I think that

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.240 
don't know I think like I think that
have<00:02:23.599> we<00:02:23.690> not<00:02:23.840> done<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.290> day<00:02:24.560> there

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
have we not done it that day there

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.010 
have we not done it that day there
probably<00:02:25.370> be<00:02:25.700> no<00:02:25.910> eyeball<00:02:26.300> tattoos<00:02:26.690> right<00:02:26.840> now

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
probably be no eyeball tattoos right now

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.990 
probably be no eyeball tattoos right now
I<00:02:27.490> think

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
I think

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.570 
I think
that's<00:02:29.270> safe<00:02:29.480> assumption<00:02:29.810> yeah<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.770> maybe

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
that's safe assumption yeah and maybe

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.700 
that's safe assumption yeah and maybe
that<00:02:31.790> would<00:02:31.880> be<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.030> better<00:02:32.180> thing<00:02:32.270> like<00:02:32.750> if<00:02:32.930> if

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
that would be a better thing like if if

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.940 
that would be a better thing like if if
just<00:02:34.160> one<00:02:34.730> person<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:35.330> completely<00:02:36.110> blind<00:02:36.320> yeah

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
just one person is completely blind yeah

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.250 
just one person is completely blind yeah
then<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.730> think<00:02:38.570> that's<00:02:38.690> too<00:02:38.900> high<00:02:39.050> of<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.230> price

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
then I think that's too high of a price

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.440 
then I think that's too high of a price
oh<00:02:39.650> well<00:02:40.070> and<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.430> big<00:02:40.580> problem<00:02:40.940> is<00:02:41.030> is<00:02:41.210> like<00:02:41.360> I

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
oh well and the big problem is is like I

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.690 
oh well and the big problem is is like I
said<00:02:41.510> it's<00:02:42.440> inevitable<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.310> in<00:02:43.610> the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
said it's inevitable that in the

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.270 
said it's inevitable that in the
learning<00:02:44.090> curve<00:02:44.330> of<00:02:44.510> doing<00:02:44.780> procedures<00:02:45.280> that

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
learning curve of doing procedures that

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.650 
learning curve of doing procedures that
there<00:02:46.490> are<00:02:46.580> going<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.790> be<00:02:46.880> mistakes<00:02:47.060> made

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
there are going to be mistakes made

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.520 
there are going to be mistakes made
going<00:02:48.110> too<00:02:48.380> deep<00:02:48.620> going<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.160> too<00:02:49.640> shallow<00:02:50.530> and

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
going too deep going to too shallow and

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.170 
going too deep going to too shallow and
any<00:02:51.680> number<00:02:52.070> of<00:02:52.160> other<00:02:52.280> mistakes<00:02:52.790> one<00:02:53.000> can

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
any number of other mistakes one can

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.880 
any number of other mistakes one can
make<00:02:53.390> I<00:02:54.170> think<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:55.100> can<00:02:55.280> excuse<00:02:55.880> I<00:02:56.830> think<00:02:57.830> you

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
make I think you can excuse I think you

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.170 
make I think you can excuse I think you
can<00:02:58.010> excuse<00:02:58.370> that<00:02:58.400> happening<00:02:58.970> when<00:02:59.090> you're

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
can excuse that happening when you're

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.870 
can excuse that happening when you're
talking<00:02:59.600> about<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.900> single<00:03:00.440> practitioner<00:03:01.160> you

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
talking about a single practitioner you

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.090 
talking about a single practitioner you
know<00:03:02.000> that's<00:03:02.360> defining<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.170> procedure<00:03:03.590> right

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
know that's defining the procedure right

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.800 
know that's defining the procedure right
that<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.730> problem<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.180> we<00:03:05.420> have<00:03:05.570> right

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
that is the problem that we have right

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.830 
that is the problem that we have right
now<00:03:05.840> is<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.910> know<00:03:08.000> so<00:03:08.209> many<00:03:08.420> people<00:03:08.690> want

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
now is that you know so many people want

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.690 
now is that you know so many people want
to<00:03:08.870> do<00:03:09.050> this<00:03:09.200> procedure<00:03:09.590> it's<00:03:09.980> your<00:03:10.190> assistant

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
to do this procedure it's your assistant

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.380 
to do this procedure it's your assistant
lee<00:03:10.820> exciting<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.830> instead<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:13.240> taking<00:03:14.240> the

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
lee exciting and instead of taking the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.949 
lee exciting and instead of taking the
time<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.890> know<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.390> learn<00:03:17.390> from<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.840> people

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
time you know to learn from the people

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.570 
time you know to learn from the people
who've<00:03:18.290> done<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:18.709> before<00:03:18.740> it's<00:03:19.130> almost<00:03:19.370> like

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
who've done it before it's almost like

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.980 
who've done it before it's almost like
they're<00:03:19.760> reinventing<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.450> wheel<00:03:20.570> every<00:03:20.840> time

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
they're reinventing the wheel every time

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.410 
they're reinventing the wheel every time
but<00:03:21.770> you<00:03:21.830> know<00:03:22.070> so<00:03:22.250> with<00:03:22.459> this<00:03:22.610> so<00:03:23.000> really<00:03:23.390> a

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
but you know so with this so really a

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.780 
but you know so with this so really a
record<00:03:23.750> about<00:03:24.080> a<00:03:24.230> bill<00:03:24.470> every<00:03:24.950> single<00:03:24.980> person

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
record about a bill every single person

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.810 
record about a bill every single person
is<00:03:25.940> recreating<00:03:26.510> those<00:03:27.050> same<00:03:27.560> errors<00:03:28.100> those

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
is recreating those same errors those

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.960 
is recreating those same errors those
those<00:03:29.120> same<00:03:29.330> learning<00:03:29.480> curve<00:03:29.900> errors<00:03:30.970> rather

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
those same learning curve errors rather

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.199 
those same learning curve errors rather
than<00:03:32.769> you<00:03:33.769> know<00:03:33.890> just<00:03:33.920> just<00:03:34.190> coming<00:03:34.790> for

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
than you know just just coming for

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.240 
than you know just just coming for
training<00:03:35.690> or<00:03:35.900> coming<00:03:36.200> yeah<00:03:36.650> now<00:03:37.010> we're<00:03:37.160> even

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
training or coming yeah now we're even

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.280 
training or coming yeah now we're even
just<00:03:37.489> waiting<00:03:37.820> another<00:03:37.970> five<00:03:38.269> years<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:38.840> see

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
just waiting another five years to see

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.110 
just waiting another five years to see
where<00:03:39.530> this<00:03:39.709> goes<00:03:39.950> which<00:03:40.370> would<00:03:40.519> really<00:03:40.640> be<00:03:40.850> no

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
where this goes which would really be no

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.240 
where this goes which would really be no
big<00:03:41.300> deal<00:03:41.450> at<00:03:41.600> all<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:42.110> know<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.500> we<00:03:43.160> were

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
big deal at all you know and we were

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.520 
big deal at all you know and we were
talking<00:03:43.400> about<00:03:43.519> this<00:03:43.820> this<00:03:44.209> earlier<00:03:44.570> but<00:03:44.810> you

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
talking about this this earlier but you

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.110 
talking about this this earlier but you
know<00:03:45.590> people<00:03:45.860> go<00:03:46.010> into<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.459> try<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:46.910> warn

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
know people go into it you try and warn

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.780 
know people go into it you try and warn
them<00:03:47.360> and<00:03:47.540> they<00:03:47.630> say<00:03:47.900> oh<00:03:47.930> well<00:03:48.860> I<00:03:49.070> know<00:03:49.220> I'm

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
them and they say oh well I know I'm

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.430 
them and they say oh well I know I'm
confident<00:03:50.330> about<00:03:50.480> this<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:50.900> feel<00:03:50.930> really<00:03:51.230> good

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
confident about this I feel really good

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.800 
confident about this I feel really good
about<00:03:51.500> this<00:03:51.950> you<00:03:52.640> know<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.000> that<00:03:53.150> got<00:03:53.360> in<00:03:53.660> and

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
about this you know and that got in and

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.420 
about this you know and that got in and
of<00:03:53.900> itself<00:03:54.170> is<00:03:54.380> a<00:03:54.410> worrying<00:03:54.769> statement

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
of itself is a worrying statement

always haunted me until like we finally
and<00:04:39.230> together<00:04:39.920> and<00:04:40.220> then<00:04:40.370> how<00:04:41.300> I<00:04:41.330> remember<00:04:41.840> it

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
and together and then how I remember it

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.670 
and together and then how I remember it
is<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:43.780> saw<00:04:44.780> out<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:44.960> them<00:04:45.140> when<00:04:45.290> we<00:04:45.320> got<00:04:45.440> up<00:04:45.560> I

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
is I saw out of them when we got up I

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.680 
is I saw out of them when we got up I
really<00:04:45.980> really<00:04:46.550> wanted<00:04:46.760> to<00:04:46.820> try<00:04:47.060> it<00:04:47.090> yeah<00:04:47.420> well

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
really really wanted to try it yeah well

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.210 
really really wanted to try it yeah well
I<00:04:47.720> mean<00:04:47.840> that's<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:48.140> thing<00:04:48.170> you<00:04:48.530> know<00:04:48.650> even<00:04:48.980> in

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
I mean that's the thing you know even in

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.550 
I mean that's the thing you know even in
the<00:04:49.250> early<00:04:49.670> early<00:04:50.300> writers<00:04:50.870> credit<00:04:51.110> photos

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
the early early writers credit photos

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.350 
the early early writers credit photos
and<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:51.890> on<00:04:51.980> I<00:04:52.070> would<00:04:52.190> photoshop<00:04:52.640> my<00:04:52.820> eyes<00:04:53.000> to

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
and so on I would photoshop my eyes to

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.060 
and so on I would photoshop my eyes to
be<00:04:53.480> blue<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:53.990> I<00:04:54.290> think<00:04:54.530> that's<00:04:54.680> because<00:04:54.770> some

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
be blue and I think that's because some

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.860 
be blue and I think that's because some
of<00:04:55.100> my<00:04:55.220> earliest<00:04:55.640> memories<00:04:55.850> are<00:04:56.240> watching

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
of my earliest memories are watching

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.720 
of my earliest memories are watching
science<00:04:57.110> fiction<00:04:57.560> with<00:04:57.680> my<00:04:57.800> father<00:04:58.070> you<00:04:58.640> know

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
science fiction with my father you know

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.150 
science fiction with my father you know
and<00:04:59.120> my<00:04:59.660> memory<00:04:59.960> is<00:04:59.990> not<00:05:00.080> very<00:05:00.380> good<00:05:00.590> so<00:05:00.740> I<00:05:00.770> only

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
and my memory is not very good so I only

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.040 
and my memory is not very good so I only
have<00:05:01.370> a<00:05:01.400> very<00:05:01.700> small<00:05:02.060> number<00:05:02.120> of<00:05:02.570> memories<00:05:02.900> in

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
have a very small number of memories in

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.200 
have a very small number of memories in
my<00:05:03.080> early<00:05:03.320> life<00:05:03.350> and<00:05:03.770> they're<00:05:04.220> all<00:05:04.400> you<00:05:05.180> know

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
my early life and they're all you know

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.090 
my early life and they're all you know
watching<00:05:05.720> Star<00:05:05.990> Trek<00:05:06.020> watching<00:05:06.650> dinner<00:05:06.890> and

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
so that's always been what's defined the

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.680 
so that's always been what's defined the
standard<00:05:17.480> of<00:05:17.840> beauty<00:05:18.050> for<00:05:18.410> me<00:05:18.560> rather<00:05:18.740> than

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
standard of beauty for me rather than

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.930 
standard of beauty for me rather than
conventional<00:05:20.950> it's<00:05:21.950> when<00:05:22.160> to<00:05:22.370> illustrate

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
conventional it's when to illustrate

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.900

achieve their magazine standard I like
that<00:05:26.150> it<00:05:26.300> was<00:05:26.480> a<00:05:26.510> great<00:05:30.460> well<00:05:31.460> any<00:05:32.240> other<00:05:32.480> last

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
that it was a great well any other last

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.720 
that it was a great well any other last
questions<00:05:32.990> or<00:05:33.500> anything<00:05:33.680> Elsie<00:05:34.310> what<00:05:34.550> what<00:05:34.700> a

say Before we jump in feet first no
other<00:05:38.990> than<00:05:39.230> I<00:05:39.320> think<00:05:39.590> that<00:05:39.710> if<00:05:39.830> anybody<00:05:40.340> wants

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
other than I think that if anybody wants

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.330 
other than I think that if anybody wants
to<00:05:41.360> do<00:05:41.540> this<00:05:41.750> they<00:05:42.080> should<00:05:42.320> realize<00:05:42.650> that<00:05:43.130> it's

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
to do this they should realize that it's

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.920 
to do this they should realize that it's
an<00:05:43.520> experimental<00:05:44.270> procedure

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
an experimental procedure

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.020 
an experimental procedure
it'll<00:05:45.290> be<00:05:45.500> an<00:05:45.560> experimental<00:05:46.130> procedure<00:05:46.430> for<00:05:47.000> a

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
it'll be an experimental procedure for a

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.870 
it'll be an experimental procedure for a
long<00:05:47.270> time<00:05:47.570> even<00:05:48.200> as<00:05:48.980> we<00:05:49.280> figure<00:05:49.490> out<00:05:49.640> the

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
long time even as we figure out the

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.640 
long time even as we figure out the
short-term<00:05:50.360> risks<00:05:50.870> there<00:05:51.080> are<00:05:51.200> still<00:05:51.470> long

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
short-term risks there are still long

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.160 
short-term risks there are still long
term<00:05:51.950> risks<00:05:52.280> so<00:05:52.370> we<00:05:52.520> won't<00:05:52.700> know<00:05:52.850> for<00:05:53.170> 15-20

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
term risks so we won't know for 15-20

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.550 
term risks so we won't know for 15-20
years<00:05:54.200> or<00:05:54.680> longer<00:05:54.950> you<00:05:55.430> know<00:05:56.000> because<00:05:56.560> when

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
years or longer you know because when

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.170 
years or longer you know because when
you<00:05:57.650> have<00:05:57.740> a<00:05:57.830> tattoo<00:05:58.010> on<00:05:58.280> your<00:05:58.400> skin<00:05:58.700> you<00:05:59.030> know

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
you expose it to light and the color

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.690 
you expose it to light and the color
changes<00:06:01.910> you<00:06:02.660> know<00:06:02.750> it<00:06:02.870> fades<00:06:03.230> it<00:06:03.620> blurs<00:06:04.310> out

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
changes you know it fades it blurs out

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.250 
changes you know it fades it blurs out
you<00:06:05.390> know<00:06:05.450> all<00:06:05.630> those<00:06:05.780> things<00:06:05.990> are<00:06:06.080> going<00:06:06.200> to

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
you know all those things are going to

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.510 
you know all those things are going to
happen<00:06:06.380> in<00:06:06.590> your<00:06:06.710> eye<00:06:06.770> as<00:06:06.980> well<00:06:07.160> but<00:06:07.310> your<00:06:07.490> eye

happen in your eye as well but your eye

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.160 
happen in your eye as well but your eye
doesn't<00:06:07.730> have<00:06:07.940> the<00:06:08.060> normal<00:06:08.210> mechanisms<00:06:08.990> for

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
dealing with it your skin does we don't

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.360 
dealing with it your skin does we don't
know<00:06:12.230> what's<00:06:12.500> going<00:06:12.710> to<00:06:12.740> happen<00:06:13.130> when<00:06:13.250> those

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
know what's going to happen when those

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.430 
know what's going to happen when those
changed<00:06:13.820> chemicals<00:06:14.390> or<00:06:14.600> said<00:06:15.020> you're<00:06:15.200> trapped

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
changed chemicals or said you're trapped

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.830 
changed chemicals or said you're trapped
inside<00:06:15.650> an<00:06:15.980> eye<00:06:16.070> and<00:06:17.000> also<00:06:17.360> like<00:06:17.570> I<00:06:17.690> were

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
inside an eye and also like I were

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.120 
inside an eye and also like I were
talked<00:06:18.050> about<00:06:18.260> before<00:06:18.410> about<00:06:18.650> how<00:06:19.070> the

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
talked about before about how the

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.820 
talked about before about how the
muscles<00:06:19.670> and<00:06:20.180> other<00:06:20.630> pressure<00:06:21.110> issues<00:06:21.620> that

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
muscles and other pressure issues that

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.140 
muscles and other pressure issues that
could<00:06:21.950> happen<00:06:22.250> over<00:06:22.370> time<00:06:22.640> really<00:06:22.820> that's

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
could happen over time really that's

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.870 
could happen over time really that's
right<00:06:23.390> you<00:06:23.660> know<00:06:23.780> and<00:06:24.470> I<00:06:24.770> think<00:06:25.010> that<00:06:25.340> as<00:06:25.520> more

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
right you know and I think that as more

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.550 
right you know and I think that as more
and<00:06:25.940> more<00:06:26.090> people<00:06:26.390> are<00:06:26.840> being<00:06:27.050> done<00:06:27.320> it's

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
and more people are being done it's

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.960 
and more people are being done it's
becoming<00:06:27.860> clear<00:06:28.190> that<00:06:28.370> there's<00:06:28.520> a<00:06:28.610> great<00:06:28.790> deal

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
becoming clear that there's a great deal

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.390 
becoming clear that there's a great deal
of<00:06:29.090> variability<00:06:29.390> in<00:06:29.960> the<00:06:30.380> way<00:06:30.500> bodies<00:06:30.860> respond

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
of variability in the way bodies respond

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.820 
of variability in the way bodies respond
you<00:06:32.060> know<00:06:32.090> you<00:06:32.270> could<00:06:32.570> have<00:06:32.690> 99<00:06:33.170> people<00:06:33.440> be

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
you know you could have 99 people be

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.860 
you know you could have 99 people be
just<00:06:34.130> fine<00:06:34.460> you<00:06:35.060> know<00:06:35.150> and<00:06:35.300> then<00:06:35.390> one<00:06:35.600> person

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
just fine you know and then one person

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.250 
just fine you know and then one person
swells<00:06:36.740> out<00:06:36.980> for<00:06:37.580> an<00:06:38.090> inexplicable<00:06:38.840> reason

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
swells out for an inexplicable reason

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.200 
swells out for an inexplicable reason
and<00:06:39.410> then<00:06:39.500> that<00:06:39.620> swelling<00:06:39.950> puts<00:06:40.640> pressure<00:06:40.940> on

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
and then that swelling puts pressure on

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.480 
and then that swelling puts pressure on
the<00:06:41.450> C<00:06:41.750> lleol<00:06:41.960> muscles<00:06:42.380> or<00:06:42.590> the<00:06:42.620> iris<00:06:43.160> winter

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
the C lleol muscles or the iris winter

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
the C lleol muscles or the iris winter
muscles<00:06:43.820> and<00:06:44.420> you<00:06:44.540> get

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
muscles and you get

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.380 
muscles and you get
vision<00:06:46.230> problems<00:06:47.000> difficult<00:06:48.000> dealing<00:06:48.240> with

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.390 
vision problems difficult dealing with

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.130 
vision problems difficult dealing with
bright<00:06:48.660> lights

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
bright lights

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.500 
bright lights
yeah<00:06:49.740> probably<00:06:50.220> night<00:06:50.640> vision<00:06:51.000> issues<00:06:51.330> as

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 
yeah probably night vision issues as

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.830 
yeah probably night vision issues as
well<00:06:51.720> yeah

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
well yeah

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.660 
well yeah
all<00:06:54.840> right<00:06:55.020> well<00:06:55.410> all<00:06:55.830> that<00:06:56.040> being<00:06:56.220> said<00:06:56.430> I

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:56.670 
all right well all that being said I

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.800 
all right well all that being said I
guess<00:06:56.790> we're<00:06:57.120> going<00:06:57.330> ahead<00:06:57.800> okay
