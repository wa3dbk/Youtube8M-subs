00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.090
 roller where it turns out to be neat 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:34.440
 comes fourth we are sitting 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:37.940
 immediately another way so open 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.020
 the carburetor is already screwed 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.020
 stand the jets 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.800
 took out a point such is made of round 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.770
 file 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.119
 Of course it takes as we see the same korchik 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:13.130
 we won't even show us clean 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:16.610
 then take one of your favorites 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.420
 tools porya the he with such 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.600
 small duct earn if i don't 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:28.490
 I am mistaken from the dropper a little cut 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:31.460
 but spike further if we had 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.360
 speck she fell there to the bottom of us her 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:39.610
 need to get run to the bottom 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.610
 taking off from above so that it can be seen and 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:49.850
 we pull out everything is fine and in principle if 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.520
 you can even have a clean taro 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.520
 check caught you or unit 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.460
 you can add more gasoline again 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.210
 Rinse 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:05.740
 or here here in these side channels 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:10.269
 which feed the horizontal channel 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:16.840
 suck out if the carburetor is shot 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:16.840
 you can put there deeper push 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:24.850
 it's for her 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:28.240
 suck out basically and they all would say 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.040
 I donâ€™t have problems with compressor 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.860
 no compressor there is a problem 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.570
 I have to solve the problem 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.180
 way cheap and cheerful 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.300
 Well, then we collect in reverse 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.300
 sequences 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.850
 no after having collected the carburetor 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:52.740
 to get rid of vds forever 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.860
 I advise you to watch the video eternal with Alex 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.870
 and on or there to put the mesh where to pass 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.170
 mesh for many problems and problem 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.810
 Well, the sensor mesh and this mesh 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.390
 if yoga cut correctly is enough for 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.580
 two three carburetor and accordingly here 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.580
