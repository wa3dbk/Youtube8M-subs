a long way with these type of climbing
cactuses<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:45.270> see<00:00:45.420> I've<00:00:45.540> trained<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.020> up<00:00:46.140> this

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
cactuses and see I've trained it up this

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.340 
cactuses and see I've trained it up this

Christ<00:00:52.670> crucifixion<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:55.040> it<00:00:56.040> certainly

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
Christ crucifixion but it certainly

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.340 
Christ crucifixion but it certainly
stands<00:00:56.700> out<00:00:56.880> in<00:00:56.970> the<00:00:57.030> backyard<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.809> used<00:00:58.260> to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
stands out in the backyard I used to

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.200 
stands out in the backyard I used to
have<00:00:58.440> passion<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.829> its<00:00:59.070> growing<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.640> that

have passion for its growing on it that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.880 
have passion for its growing on it that
grew<00:01:00.420> quite<00:01:00.660> well<00:01:00.870> until<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> cockatoos<00:01:01.590> kept

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
grew quite well until the cockatoos kept

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.010 
grew quite well until the cockatoos kept
on<00:01:02.010> eating<00:01:02.280> them<00:01:02.340> all<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.090> decided<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.899> move

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
on eating them all so I decided to move

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.859 
on eating them all so I decided to move
the<00:01:04.170> passion<00:01:04.500> fruit<00:01:04.680> vine<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.660> stick<00:01:06.660> this

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the passion fruit vine and stick this

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.680 
the passion fruit vine and stick this
there<00:01:07.080> instead<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.040> what<00:01:08.160> I've<00:01:08.280> done<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:10.040> these

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
there instead so what I've done is these

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.779 
there instead so what I've done is these
dragon<00:01:12.690> fruits<00:01:12.899> love<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.320> grow<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.430> if<00:01:14.550> you

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
dragon fruits love to grow and if you

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:16.790 
dragon fruits love to grow and if you
are<00:01:14.940> safe<00:01:15.390> place<00:01:15.660> it<00:01:15.840> at<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> bottom<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
are safe place it at the bottom of the

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
are safe place it at the bottom of the
tree<00:01:17.070> would<00:01:17.940> grow<00:01:18.000> right<00:01:18.630> up<00:01:18.840> right<00:01:19.520> up<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
tree would grow right up right up to the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.279 
tree would grow right up right up to the
top<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:21.330> it'd<00:01:21.450> start<00:01:21.479> fretting<00:01:22.020> you

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
top and then it'd start fretting you

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.130 
top and then it'd start fretting you
couldn't<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.649> you<00:01:22.710> free<00:01:23.690> so<00:01:24.690> it's<00:01:24.869> best<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
couldn't get you free so it's best to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.770 
couldn't get you free so it's best to
have<00:01:25.319> them<00:01:25.440> on<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.860> trellis<00:01:26.550> a<00:01:26.910> climbing

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
have them on a trellis a climbing

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.929 
have them on a trellis a climbing
trellis<00:01:28.050> that<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.709> manage

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
trellis that that you can manage

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.590 
trellis that that you can manage
and<00:01:31.359> so<00:01:32.049> here<00:01:32.350> I've<00:01:32.469> got<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:33.240> red<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.479> a<00:01:34.569> yellow

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
and so here I've got a red and a yellow

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.969 
and so here I've got a red and a yellow
variety<00:01:35.469> growing<00:01:35.710> together<00:01:35.859> I<00:01:37.770> feel<00:01:38.770> look

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
variety growing together I feel look

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.050 
variety growing together I feel look
quite<00:01:39.250> nice<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:40.840> going<00:01:41.140> really<00:01:41.319> well

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
quite nice and it's going really well

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.380 
quite nice and it's going really well
and<00:01:43.289> this<00:01:44.289> is<00:01:44.409> what<00:01:44.560> this<00:01:44.740> video<00:01:45.009> is<00:01:45.069> about

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
and this is what this video is about

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.029 
and this is what this video is about
just<00:01:46.390> seeing<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:46.810> difference<00:01:47.200> between<00:01:47.560> a

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
just seeing the difference between a

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.069 
just seeing the difference between a
yellow<00:01:48.399> and<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.819> red<00:01:49.109> dragon<00:01:50.109> fruit<00:01:50.560> or<00:01:51.099> PD<00:01:51.369> ayah

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
yellow and a red dragon fruit or PD ayah

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.770 
yellow and a red dragon fruit or PD ayah
is<00:01:53.079> the<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:56.079> name<00:01:56.259> for<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.619> I<00:01:56.709> think<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:57.780> like

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
is the is the name for it I think I like

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.089 
is the is the name for it I think I like
to<00:01:58.810> call<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.109> dragon<00:01:59.289> fruit<00:01:59.619> that<00:01:59.709> sounds

00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:00.099 
to call it dragon fruit that sounds

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:07.410 
to call it dragon fruit that sounds
easier<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.640> let's<00:02:04.420> have<00:02:04.569> a<00:02:04.659> look<00:02:05.159> at<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.909> red

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
easier so let's have a look at the red

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.229 
easier so let's have a look at the red
now<00:02:07.689> these<00:02:07.899> ripen<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:08.890> develop<00:02:09.459> fast<00:02:09.970> they

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
now these ripen and develop fast they

and I've got the red dragon fruit and

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.909 
and I've got the red dragon fruit and
the<00:04:43.389> yellow<00:04:43.630> dragon<00:04:44.020> fruit<00:04:44.289> here<00:04:44.500> on<00:04:44.590> a<00:04:44.620> plate

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
the yellow dragon fruit here on a plate

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.730 
the yellow dragon fruit here on a plate
of<00:04:45.190> take<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.430> little<00:04:45.699> bite<00:04:46.000> out<00:04:46.030> of<00:04:46.300> each<00:04:46.419> one

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
of take a little bite out of each one

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.040 
of take a little bite out of each one
just<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:47.860> show<00:04:48.130> its<00:04:49.120> consistency<00:04:49.960> so<00:04:50.560> the<00:04:51.280> red

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
just to show its consistency so the red

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.490 
just to show its consistency so the red
looks<00:04:53.050> like<00:04:53.410> a<00:04:53.440> beetroot<00:04:54.070> on<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.550> inside<00:04:55.500> the

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
looks like a beetroot on the inside the

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.939 
looks like a beetroot on the inside the
pulp<00:04:57.130> is<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:57.759> guess<00:04:58.599> it's<00:04:58.810> consistency<00:04:59.710> of<00:04:59.889> a

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
pulp is I guess it's consistency of a

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.610 
pulp is I guess it's consistency of a
watermelon<00:05:00.280> when<00:05:01.240> you<00:05:01.479> scrape<00:05:01.990> it<00:05:02.229> out<00:05:02.349> you

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
watermelon when you scrape it out you

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.580 
watermelon when you scrape it out you
can<00:05:02.770> scrape<00:05:03.009> it<00:05:03.190> out<00:05:03.280> into<00:05:03.550> chunks<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.560> with<00:05:05.560> a

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
can scrape it out into chunks and with a

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.900 
can scrape it out into chunks and with a
spoon<00:05:05.949> or<00:05:06.310> whatever<00:05:06.960> the<00:05:08.160> yellow<00:05:09.160> is<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:09.460> same

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
spoon or whatever the yellow is the same

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.180 
spoon or whatever the yellow is the same
type<00:05:10.330> of<00:05:10.360> consistency<00:05:10.840> these<00:05:11.830> aren't<00:05:12.070> the

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
type of consistency these aren't the

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.820 
type of consistency these aren't the
best<00:05:12.370> specimens<00:05:12.970> mind<00:05:13.270> you<00:05:13.509> that<00:05:14.080> I've<00:05:14.289> that

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
best specimens mind you that I've that

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.070 
best specimens mind you that I've that
I've<00:05:14.949> got<00:05:15.280> but<00:05:15.940> they're<00:05:16.479> the<00:05:16.630> only<00:05:16.660> ones<00:05:16.960> that

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.260 
I've got but they're the only ones that
arrive<00:05:17.410> at<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:17.650> moment<00:05:18.039> so<00:05:18.310> thought<00:05:18.970> I<00:05:19.000> would

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
arrive at the moment so thought I would

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.469 
arrive at the moment so thought I would
use<00:05:19.539> them<00:05:19.810> they<00:05:20.800> do<00:05:20.860> look<00:05:21.820> a<00:05:21.910> lot<00:05:22.060> better<00:05:22.300> than

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
use them they do look a lot better than

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:22.680

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
usually you can see they both have the

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.370 
usually you can see they both have the
black<00:05:25.960> scenes<00:05:26.289> the<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:28.300> red<00:05:28.479> one<00:05:28.720> can<00:05:28.990> be<00:05:29.139> used

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
black scenes the the red one can be used

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.370
