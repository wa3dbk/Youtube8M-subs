00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
it's just got a few fingerprints but

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.729 
it's just got a few fingerprints but
we<00:02:13.489> can<00:02:13.700> scratch<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.569> up<00:02:14.629> and<00:02:15.019> immediately

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
we can scratch that up and immediately

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.160 
we can scratch that up and immediately
you<00:02:16.040> can<00:02:16.219> actually<00:02:16.700> we<00:02:16.969> can<00:02:17.150> feel<00:02:17.510> it's

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
you can actually we can feel it's

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.349

causing<00:02:18.709> some<00:02:18.739> real<00:02:19.159> let's<00:02:19.819> get<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.180> in<00:02:20.269> the

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 
causing some real let's get it in the

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.080 
causing some real let's get it in the
like<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:20.750> real<00:02:21.379> damage<00:02:21.859> right<00:02:22.189> there<00:02:22.579> it's

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
like that real damage right there it's

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.300 
like that real damage right there it's
just<00:02:23.390> dug<00:02:23.569> straight<00:02:23.989> through<00:02:24.290> there<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:24.739> this

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
just dug straight through there so this

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.179 
just dug straight through there so this
one<00:02:25.489> isn't<00:02:26.000> anywhere<00:02:26.719> near<00:02:27.019> as

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
one isn't anywhere near as

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.530 
one isn't anywhere near as

were<00:02:30.049> in<00:02:30.349> our<00:02:30.500> pocket<00:02:31.010> with<00:02:31.459> lots<00:02:31.879> of<00:02:32.060> coins<00:02:32.950> so

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
were in our pocket with lots of coins so

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.280 
were in our pocket with lots of coins so
now<00:02:34.459> that's<00:02:34.670> getting<00:02:35.269> scratched<00:02:35.599> up<00:02:38.049> we<00:02:39.049> can

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
now that's getting scratched up we can

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.530 
now that's getting scratched up we can
pull<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.889> cleaning<00:02:40.370> cloth<00:02:40.519> into<00:02:41.030> frame<00:02:41.269> so<00:02:41.480> you

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
pull a cleaning cloth into frame so you

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.819 
pull a cleaning cloth into frame so you
can<00:02:41.780> get<00:02:42.230> rid<00:02:42.379> of<00:02:42.409> some<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.680> these

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
can get rid of some of these

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.490 
can get rid of some of these
fingerprints<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.760> show<00:02:44.389> you<00:02:44.450> exactly<00:02:45.109> what

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
fingerprints and show you exactly what

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.860 
fingerprints and show you exactly what
kind<00:02:45.769> of<00:02:45.859> damage<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.430> done<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:47.239> can<00:02:47.269> see<00:02:47.629> there

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
kind of damage is done you can see there

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.559 
kind of damage is done you can see there
that<00:02:48.109> is<00:02:48.769> not<00:02:48.829> going<00:02:49.459> away<00:02:49.700> with<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.180> cleaning

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
that is not going away with a cleaning
