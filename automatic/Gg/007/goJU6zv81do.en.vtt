00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.570
 you can somehow switch over here 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.119
 but I do not know what the button 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.660

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.380
 write 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.910

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.730

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:00.370
 do not need a chance 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:08.440
 would have 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:12.600
 now also needed a corner for the 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.580
 switzerland decided this 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.080

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.080
 unnecessary used that already 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.420
 once I have no bonuses anymore 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.960
 I let my wings grow and there 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.960

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.130

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:29.680

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:31.650

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:39.850
 coming dangerously close 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:45.010
 away with it all my kills all mine 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:53.650

 You see, that's really it 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:08.820

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:21.630
 30 11 140 km h manages to rule here 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:21.630
 tdm no matter what comes on behind me 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.720
 that amy is going to make it fast 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:43.910

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.910

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.769

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:05.580
 an escalation in 490 meters board 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.590
