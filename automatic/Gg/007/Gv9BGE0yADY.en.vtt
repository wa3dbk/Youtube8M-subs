diet anyone may so the short answer is I
went<00:00:06.629> on<00:00:06.750> essentially<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.379> plant-based<00:00:07.830> diet

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
went on essentially a plant-based diet

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.150 
went on essentially a plant-based diet
I<00:00:08.490> live<00:00:08.760> on<00:00:10.880> beans<00:00:11.880> legumes<00:00:12.210> vegetables

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
I live on beans legumes vegetables

I live on beans legumes vegetables
fruits<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.540> drink<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.630> protein<00:00:15.809> supplement

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
fruits I drink a protein supplement

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.400 
fruits I drink a protein supplement
every<00:00:16.650> morning<00:00:17.869> no<00:00:18.869> dairy

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
every morning no dairy

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.429 
every morning no dairy
I<00:00:19.439> drink<00:00:19.980> almond<00:00:20.400> milk<00:00:20.779> mixed<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.930> with<00:00:22.080> fruit

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
I drink almond milk mixed in with fruit

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.410 
I drink almond milk mixed in with fruit
and<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.980> protein<00:00:23.369> powder<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.000> get<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
and a protein powder so I get the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.790 
and a protein powder so I get the
protein<00:00:24.750> for<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:24.990> day<00:00:25.109> when<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.320> start<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> day

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
protein for the day when I start the day

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.029 
protein for the day when I start the day
out<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.660> it<00:00:27.660> changed<00:00:27.990> my<00:00:28.080> whole<00:00:28.109> metabolism

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
out and it changed my whole metabolism

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.299 
out and it changed my whole metabolism
and<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.480> lost<00:00:30.480> 24<00:00:31.019> pounds<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.800> got<00:00:31.949> back<00:00:32.160> to

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
and I lost 24 pounds and I got back to

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.270 
and I lost 24 pounds and I got back to
basically<00:00:32.700> what<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> weighed<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.180> high<00:00:33.329> school

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
basically what I weighed in high school

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.830 
basically what I weighed in high school
but<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.340> did<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.850> for<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.120> different<00:00:36.270> reason<00:00:36.480> but

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
but I did it for a different reason but

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.479 
but I did it for a different reason but
I<00:00:37.410> mean<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.800> want<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.100> lose<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> little<00:00:38.370> weight

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
I mean I want to lose a little weight

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.440 
I mean I want to lose a little weight
but<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.090> didn't<00:00:39.600> dream<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.140> would<00:00:40.290> happen<00:00:40.649> I

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
but I didn't dream this would happen I

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.590 
but I didn't dream this would happen I
did<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.600> because<00:00:43.340> after<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.730> had<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.180> stent

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
did it because after I had this stent

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.770 
did it because after I had this stent
put<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.489> realized<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:48.059> even<00:00:48.390> though<00:00:48.660> it

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
put in I realized that even though it

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.860 
put in I realized that even though it
happens<00:00:49.200> quite<00:00:49.410> often<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.950> after<00:00:50.840> you<00:00:51.840> have

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
happens quite often that after you have

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.869 
happens quite often that after you have
bypasses<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.829> lose<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.309> veins<00:00:53.550> because

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
bypasses you lose the veins because

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.720 
bypasses you lose the veins because
there's<00:00:54.090> thinner<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.600> weaker<00:00:54.870> than<00:00:55.020> arteries

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
there's thinner and weaker than arteries

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.180 
there's thinner and weaker than arteries
the<00:00:56.730> truth<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.629> clogged<00:00:57.899> up<00:00:58.190> which

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
the truth is that it clogged up which

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.740 
the truth is that it clogged up which
means<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> cholesterol<00:01:00.390> was<00:01:00.570> still

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
means that the cholesterol was still

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.070 
means that the cholesterol was still
calling<00:01:01.050> buildup<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.920> my<00:01:02.510> vein<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.780> was<00:01:03.870> part

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
calling buildup in my vein it was part

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.859 
calling buildup in my vein it was part
of<00:01:04.140> my<00:01:04.229> bypass<00:01:04.650> too<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:06.180> thank<00:01:06.479> God<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> could

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
of my bypass too and thank God I could

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.200 
of my bypass too and thank God I could
take<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> stents<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.920> don't<00:01:08.700> want<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.909> happen

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
take the stents I don't want to happen

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.260 
take the stents I don't want to happen
again<00:01:09.979> so<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.010> did<00:01:11.250> all<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.460> research<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.119> I

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
again so I did all this research and I

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.929 
again so I did all this research and I
saw<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.659> 82%<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.619> people<00:01:13.650> since<00:01:14.159> 1986

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
saw that 82% of the people since 1986

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.539 
saw that 82% of the people since 1986
who<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:15.840> gone<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> plant-based<00:01:16.619> no<00:01:17.280> dairy

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
who have gone on a plant-based no dairy

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.020 
who have gone on a plant-based no dairy
no<00:01:17.850> meat<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.330> any<00:01:18.509> kind<00:01:18.840> no<00:01:19.049> chicken<00:01:19.619> turkey

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
no meat of any kind no chicken turkey

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.609 
no meat of any kind no chicken turkey
ate<00:01:21.030> very<00:01:21.450> little<00:01:21.570> fixed<00:01:22.080> once<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> while

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
ate very little fixed once in a while

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.190 
ate very little fixed once in a while
I'll<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> little<00:01:23.159> fish<00:01:23.340> not<00:01:23.610> often<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
I'll have a little fish not often if you

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.170 
I'll have a little fish not often if you
can<00:01:25.380> do<00:01:25.590> it

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
can do it

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.270 
can do it
82%<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.720> people<00:01:27.750> who've<00:01:28.110> done<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.500> have

handful of others but we now have 25
years<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.229> evidence<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> thought<00:01:54.060> well

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
years of evidence and so I thought well

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.789 
years of evidence and so I thought well
since<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.110> needed<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.409> lose<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.560> little<00:01:55.710> weight

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
since I needed to lose a little weight

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.120 
since I needed to lose a little weight
for<00:01:56.040> Chelsea's<00:01:56.369> wedding<00:01:57.439> I'll<00:01:58.439> become<00:01:58.890> part

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
for Chelsea's wedding I'll become part
