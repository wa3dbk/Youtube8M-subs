00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.460 
amazing they are ten thousand four
hundred<00:01:52.770> milliamps<00:01:53.450> versus<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.960> about

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
hundred milliamps versus the about

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.300 
hundred milliamps versus the about
things<00:01:55.979> ten<00:01:56.280> twenty<00:01:56.759> lil<00:01:57.119> amps<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.560> Sony

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
things ten twenty lil amps that the Sony

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.800 
things ten twenty lil amps that the Sony
batteries<00:01:59.820> come<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.030> they<00:02:00.299> come<00:02:00.450> with<00:02:00.600> two

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
batteries come with they come with two

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.569 
batteries come with they come with two
which<00:02:01.500> will<00:02:01.619> give<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.829> about<00:02:02.070> two<00:02:02.399> hours

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
which will give you about two hours

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.789 
which will give you about two hours
worth<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:03.060> recording<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:04.020> theoretically<00:02:04.229> this

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
worth of recording so theoretically this

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.780 
worth of recording so theoretically this
being<00:02:05.100> ten

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
being ten

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.760 
being ten
and<00:02:05.880> times<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.180> size<00:02:06.480> of<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.110> Sony<00:02:07.320> battery

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
and times the size of the Sony battery

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.120 
and times the size of the Sony battery
it<00:02:08.160> should<00:02:08.670> last<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.119> about<00:02:09.509> 10<00:02:09.960> hours<00:02:10.290> for

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
it should last you about 10 hours for

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.820 
it should last you about 10 hours for
recording<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:12.120> did<00:02:12.630> some<00:02:12.750> tests<00:02:12.990> yesterday<00:02:13.530> I

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
recording I did some tests yesterday I

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.700 
recording I did some tests yesterday I
recorded<00:02:14.550> for<00:02:14.700> about<00:02:14.850> two<00:02:15.090> hours<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.780> this

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
recorded for about two hours and this

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.690 
recorded for about two hours and this
battery<00:02:17.190> pack

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
battery pack

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.470 
battery pack

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
it has different different areas for how

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.110 
it has different different areas for how
much<00:02:21.660> battery<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.230> left<00:02:22.470> on<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.340> charge<00:02:23.580> so

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
much battery is left on the charge so

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.910 
much battery is left on the charge so

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
know 25% 50 75 and 100 and I just have

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.700 
know 25% 50 75 and 100 and I just have
for<00:02:29.850> about<00:02:29.910> two<00:02:30.180> hours<00:02:30.210> on<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:31.020> just<00:02:31.200> sitting

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
for about two hours on it just sitting

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.370 
for about two hours on it just sitting
on<00:02:31.740> my<00:02:31.890> desk<00:02:32.100> suiting<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.550> wall<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.960> it

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
on my desk suiting the wall and it it

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.620 
on my desk suiting the wall and it it
was<00:02:34.560> went<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.310> three<00:02:35.730> lights<00:02:35.970> instead<00:02:36.330> of<00:02:36.480> the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
was went to three lights instead of the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.630 
was went to three lights instead of the
four<00:02:36.870> after<00:02:37.380> about<00:02:37.650> those<00:02:37.830> two<00:02:38.040> hours<00:02:38.400> so

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
four after about those two hours so

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.790 
four after about those two hours so
given<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.120> rate<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.600> should<00:02:39.900> last<00:02:40.230> about<00:02:40.500> 10

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
given that rate it should last about 10

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.400 
given that rate it should last about 10
hours<00:02:41.030> I've<00:02:42.030> used<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.510> for<00:02:42.720> some<00:02:42.870> shoots<00:02:43.110> that

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
hours I've used it for some shoots that

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.100 
hours I've used it for some shoots that
we<00:02:43.530> did<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.040> we<00:02:44.880> record<00:02:45.300> for<00:02:45.510> an<00:02:45.600> hour<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.990> that

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
we did and we record for an hour to that

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.620 
we did and we record for an hour to that
time<00:02:46.410> same<00:02:46.950> thing<00:02:47.190> about<00:02:47.400> I'd<00:02:47.610> have<00:02:47.820> about<00:02:48.060> 75%

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
time same thing about I'd have about 75%

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.320 
time same thing about I'd have about 75%
left<00:02:49.320> according<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.640> lights<00:02:50.850> on<00:02:51.150> the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
left according to the lights on the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.300 
left according to the lights on the
battery<00:02:51.600> pack<00:02:51.660> so<00:02:52.380> it's<00:02:52.560> been<00:02:52.770> awesome<00:02:53.010> having

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
battery pack so it's been awesome having

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.410 
battery pack so it's been awesome having
any<00:02:53.940> problems<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:55.410> output<00:02:55.890> on<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.430> actually

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
any problems the output on this actually

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.570 
any problems the output on this actually
has<00:02:57.660> it's<00:02:58.200> off<00:02:58.380> right<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.739> middle<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.190> you

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
has it's off right in the middle and you

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.610 
has it's off right in the middle and you
can<00:02:59.730> switch<00:02:59.940> it<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.150> seven<00:03:00.810> point<00:03:01.050> four<00:03:01.260> volts

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
can switch it to seven point four volts

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.870 
can switch it to seven point four volts
and<00:03:01.739> 12<00:03:02.040> volts<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.370> don't<00:03:02.580> have<00:03:02.670> anything

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
and 12 volts I don't have anything

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.640 
and 12 volts I don't have anything
running<00:03:03.270> at<00:03:03.540> 12<00:03:03.780> volts<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.170> would<00:03:04.380> need<00:03:04.500> it

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
running at 12 volts that I would need it

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.920 
running at 12 volts that I would need it
for<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:05.550> we<00:03:05.670> run<00:03:05.820> it<00:03:05.940> at<00:03:06.060> seven<00:03:06.420> point<00:03:06.660> four

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
for and so we run it at seven point four

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.900 
for and so we run it at seven point four
because<00:03:07.650> that's<00:03:07.920> what<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.640> a7<00:03:09.420> s<00:03:09.620> requires

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
because that's what the a7 s requires

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.970 
because that's what the a7 s requires
for<00:03:11.910> for<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:12.390> battery<00:03:12.630> input<00:03:13.080> so<00:03:13.590> it's<00:03:13.709> safe

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
for for this battery input so it's safe

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.930 
for for this battery input so it's safe
you<00:03:14.190> know<00:03:14.280> you're<00:03:14.430> running<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.790> right

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
you know you're running the right

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.900 
you know you're running the right
voltage<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.050> camera<00:03:16.670> haven't<00:03:17.670> had<00:03:17.760> any

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
voltage to the camera haven't had any

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.670 
voltage to the camera haven't had any
problems<00:03:18.239> with<00:03:18.300> it<00:03:18.660> it's<00:03:18.959> been<00:03:19.170> amazing

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
problems with it it's been amazing

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.220 
problems with it it's been amazing
so<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.670> dummy<00:03:20.850> battery<00:03:21.239> just<00:03:21.900> goes<00:03:22.110> straight

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
so the dummy battery just goes straight

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.470 
so the dummy battery just goes straight
into<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.799> bottom<00:03:23.100> of<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.310> camera<00:03:23.670> there's<00:03:24.390> a

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
into the bottom of the camera there's a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.240 
into the bottom of the camera there's a
door<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:24.780> opens<00:03:24.959> up<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.709> allows<00:03:25.920> for<00:03:26.160> the

only one thing that if you want to call

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.800 
only one thing that if you want to call
it<00:03:59.070> negative<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.459> could<00:03:59.730> but<00:04:00.090> right<00:04:00.510> now<00:04:00.660> it

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
it negative you could but right now it

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.570 
it negative you could but right now it
shows<00:04:00.989> 100%<00:04:01.709> because<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.160> is<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.310> fully

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
shows 100% because this is a fully

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
charged one if you can see it the

charged one if you can see it the
battery<00:04:06.750> indicator<00:04:07.110> now<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.739> Sony<00:04:08.160> batteries

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
battery indicator now the Sony batteries

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.300 
battery indicator now the Sony batteries
are<00:04:09.110> smart<00:04:10.110> lithium<00:04:10.590> or<00:04:10.739> something<00:04:10.980> like<00:04:11.100> that

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
are smart lithium or something like that

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.979 
are smart lithium or something like that
and<00:04:11.640> they<00:04:11.820> will<00:04:11.910> show<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.510> amount<00:04:12.810> the

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
and they will show you the amount the

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.920 
and they will show you the amount the
percentage<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.709> battery<00:04:14.579> left<00:04:14.880> and<00:04:15.269> so<00:04:15.690> far

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
percentage of battery left and so far

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.449 
percentage of battery left and so far
that<00:04:16.139> seems<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.500> be<00:04:16.530> working<00:04:16.739> pretty<00:04:17.190> well

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
that seems to be working pretty well

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.620 
that seems to be working pretty well
with<00:04:17.579> those<00:04:17.700> batteries<00:04:18.090> this

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
with those batteries this

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.660 
with those batteries this
you<00:04:18.690> have<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.200> indicators<00:04:19.680> on<00:04:19.830> here<00:04:20.160> which

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
you have the indicators on here which

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.720 
you have the indicators on here which
seem<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:20.970> work<00:04:21.239> well<00:04:21.270> I'm<00:04:22.070> pretty<00:04:23.070> safe<00:04:23.400> person

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
seem to work well I'm pretty safe person

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.820 
seem to work well I'm pretty safe person
any<00:04:24.180> time<00:04:24.360> shooting<00:04:24.840> I'm<00:04:25.020> probably<00:04:25.590> once<00:04:25.710> it

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
any time shooting I'm probably once it

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.430 
any time shooting I'm probably once it
gets<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.190> 1<00:04:26.490> 1<00:04:26.880> light<00:04:27.210> for<00:04:27.540> about<00:04:27.660> 25<00:04:28.050> percent

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
gets to 1 1 light for about 25 percent

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.260 
gets to 1 1 light for about 25 percent
I'm<00:04:28.830> probably<00:04:29.400> gonna<00:04:29.610> stop<00:04:29.820> using<00:04:30.150> this

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
I'm probably gonna stop using this

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.480 
I'm probably gonna stop using this
unless<00:04:30.600> I<00:04:30.750> have<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.290> continue<00:04:31.650> with<00:04:31.710> this<00:04:31.920> at

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
unless I have to continue with this at

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.010 
unless I have to continue with this at
that<00:04:32.730> point<00:04:32.790> I'll<00:04:33.180> probably<00:04:33.210> switch<00:04:33.690> out<00:04:33.870> and

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
that point I'll probably switch out and

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.930 
that point I'll probably switch out and
use<00:04:34.170> the<00:04:34.350> Sony<00:04:34.560> batteries<00:04:35.040> to<00:04:35.220> finish<00:04:35.640> up<00:04:35.820> the

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
use the Sony batteries to finish up the

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.070 
use the Sony batteries to finish up the
shooting<00:04:36.240> or<00:04:36.330> whatever<00:04:36.510> I<00:04:36.570> need<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.720> do<00:04:36.870> while

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
shooting or whatever I need to do while

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.400 
shooting or whatever I need to do while
this<00:04:37.230> is<00:04:37.380> charging<00:04:37.680> or<00:04:38.100> whatever<00:04:38.720> but<00:04:39.720> the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
this is charging or whatever but the

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.750 
this is charging or whatever but the
Sony<00:04:40.680> batteries<00:04:41.130> will<00:04:41.340> give<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.580> a<00:04:41.610> good

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
Sony batteries will give you a good

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.620 
Sony batteries will give you a good
indication<00:04:42.240> of<00:04:43.080> what<00:04:43.500> percentage<00:04:43.650> is<00:04:44.040> left<00:04:44.310> on

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
indication of what percentage is left on

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.690 
indication of what percentage is left on
on<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.840> battery<00:04:46.140> this<00:04:46.830> one<00:04:47.040> however<00:04:47.460> the
