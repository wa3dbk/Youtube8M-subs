00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:18.840
 so people get 8th of the final 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:25.670
 iwes de against nobody on my side 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.599
 complained times do not counter anymore 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.220
 may I be 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.949
 So I had my fight come 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.750
 together so really together 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.230
 But hard matches have commented live 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.570
 so together I am very impressed 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.460
 So what, anyway, who is already 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.500
 it's like the dove with me is yes 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.500
 clear that the action is 4000 already 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.600
 funny match from yes in any case the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.980
 we do not even stage that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.470
 seen a very special choice 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.390
 before the two operators of the right to 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.590
 start 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.869
 I'm curious what just 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.570
 confused would bring what says in 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.040
 the expert at so matthew fox against the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.450
 Cadets of ada advantages 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.310
 I would be quite spontaneous the one he 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.000
 his fox but she just does not like that 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.960
 they look really do not first before 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.310
 now yes I put everything on pid where 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.259
 i have to say i understand by kickin 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.090
 missed because I have many good reasons 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.920
 yes, I'm not saying good 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.380
 I've had that in the fight of 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.189
 group blabla c or what no idea 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.810
 definitely 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.549
 nothing comes across when your as a 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:58.140
 little pimp angel boy with wings 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:02:02.819
 really do not say a test so you can 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:07.940
 is just as fast as can be seen from 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:10.140
 women are just fit 60 peter 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.920
 krams now team is always such a 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.480
 nds character from no one anymore 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.220
 but I wanted to understand that one 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:25.010
 pigeon has taken because deaf 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:27.660
 Birds Angel is yet describes sokieba 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.030
 he never actually took it 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:38.099
 if the individual there was the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:40.650
 pokÃ©mon exactly if she had that for who 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.709
 alright alright well i understand it 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.709
 Not 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:52.109
 how about it is now 2 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:54.299
 units are scarce fact is that 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.000
 weather meets due to good means 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:04.230
 you are dead yourself 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.359
 with any directions 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.720
 hopefully I would have met now 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.069
 but now I think so too 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.349
 the opponent is much more present to me 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.099
 Just do not be angry if the door features 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:20.040
 put your own experience 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.540
 that's why now 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.019
 probably lose any suggestion 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:30.440
 is now pretty much living in Luton 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:35.010
 trust there it is okay all said 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:42.120
 the announcement of his best tastes 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:44.370
 Nobody has killed anyone yet 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.989
 to wait for the second part of this 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.469
 I am what people are there 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:55.370
 and sometimes me 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.370
 really bad 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:12.910
 not taken up that's why 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:21.010
 he wanted a little bit more 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:26.320
 attention is the favorite dance 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:31.090
 still that was it with markus 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:39.280
 commented right but there was one 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:40.660
 debate said there are actually quite 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.550
 good and I notice the frogster 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.100
 special not only who is four percent of 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.030
 Just display the whole time 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:51.270
 Give away users the gamecube 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.270
 controller uses a control for 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:01.470
 quite neutral comments can be noticed 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.660
 but that the majority of the policy so me 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.340
 think I also got told yes that 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.000
 it continues to look that way on everyone 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.000
 do not look good 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:23.700
 I see schedule but blog 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:26.900
 a factor of the great but he lived me 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:39.210
 not back i also determined departure 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:40.710
 a bit had those heavy legs 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:45.030
 Gately is not my favorite goal at all 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:52.290
 but he still has simple tips 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:54.300
 I'm good for meat, for example 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:59.370
 I thought it was great that has nothing 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:01.880
 to do the game that just free that 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.880
 is housing 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.080
 in the first fight that's still right 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:19.230
 I do not see it balanced out now 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:21.750
 not much more if that's true 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.110
 so almost what does not think the profi has 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.110
 bite 

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:30.449
 he did not think because I have to 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:30.449
 really express criticism 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.599
 too often 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.429
 apply humpe 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:58.809
 did you know that the yellow Driving schools 

00:06:45.429 --> 00:07:00.839
 is now happy without me too 

00:06:58.809 --> 00:07:00.839
 The End 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:09.549
 wait a minute then people 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:12.749
 Eighth finals continue with a sovereign 

00:07:09.549 --> 00:07:12.749
 2 0 victory against home
