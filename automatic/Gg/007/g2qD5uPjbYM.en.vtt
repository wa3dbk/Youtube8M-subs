00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.439
 the wonderful world of humans 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.319

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.140
 every avatar has a human 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.060
 and you are not an exception 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.499

 you should know their customs 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.680

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.240
 look a little different 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.380
 Although they are available in many shapes and sizes, the resemblance is 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.250
 amazing 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.810

 Your hand will greatly appreciate all the efforts you make to imitate their 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.050
 appearance 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.620
 even though it seems weird 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.300
 if the forward 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.620
 it's part of the fun 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.800
 percent humans have a 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.230
 Real problem when things are over 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.280
 be it a sandwich, a movie or something else 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.740

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.970
 It's a world that enjoys playing 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.970
 Progress 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.740
 over the centuries humans have developed a taste for food 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.220
 if you can take it home 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.310

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.770

 whatever it is that they like we have it difficult they even have to 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.170
 open the door 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.900
 two 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.079
 the human world can be a cold and lonely place 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.079
 that's why humans need to be in contact 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.890
 not that kind of contact you see humans love to talk 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.980
 and it does not matter if they know the person as if it's someone they just 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.269
 know 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.299
 you could encourage them to use video chat instant messaging today 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.249
 even to share photos 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:35.249
 it can be fun 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.839
 they can also play against friends from all over the world 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.469
 humans are very competitive 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:48.469
 this is true since the times of the troglodytes 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:52.099
 as they no longer fight for pieces of monkey meat 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.339
 now they compete for anything 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:58.339
 this behavior may seem strange to you 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.389
 do not worry right away you'll get used to it 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.689
 so they do not get into trouble let them try on one of their feet 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:09.699
 here they can compete in live contests against other humans and win 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:10.939
 human awards 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.619
 as points 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:15.619

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.229

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.229
 How proud you will be when Tucuman is the winner 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.089
