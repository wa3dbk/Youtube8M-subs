is a great way for kids to really get
used<00:03:08.939> to<00:03:09.090> hoops<00:03:09.389> just<00:03:10.290> learn<00:03:10.769> their<00:03:10.949> animals<00:03:11.310> I

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
used to hoops just learn their animals I

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.439 
used to hoops just learn their animals I
can<00:03:11.489> see<00:03:11.579> how<00:03:11.669> this<00:03:11.790> would<00:03:11.879> be<00:03:11.969> a<00:03:12.000> fun<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.329> play

can see how this would be a fun to play

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:13.879 
can see how this would be a fun to play
with<00:03:12.540> your<00:03:12.659> kids<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.260> controls<00:03:13.650> are<00:03:13.709> simple

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
with your kids the controls are simple

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.649 
with your kids the controls are simple
enough<00:03:14.069> I<00:03:14.340> think<00:03:14.370> kids<00:03:14.790> can<00:03:14.939> figure<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.359> out<00:03:15.480> as

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
enough I think kids can figure it out as

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.830 
enough I think kids can figure it out as
well<00:03:15.989> too<00:03:16.970> okay<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.030> let's<00:03:18.299> go<00:03:18.389> back<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.629> the
