 696 good friends on that occasion 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:32.140
 we are in windows 8.1 where one being 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.930
 this time we have a machine with 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.590
 which has the system 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.710
 English language English as 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.079
 Well, the machine is American 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.090
 and our entire operating system what 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.559
 we have in the English language for 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.030
 solve 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.460
 we are going to do it in a very very 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.800
 easy they go to the description of the video 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.130
 And I'll leave a link to it 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.900
 download 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.320
 a file just like this in 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.600
 expression with toco 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.589
 we have 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.299
 then we're going to change the extension to 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.540
 that is an executable for a change of 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.770
 script 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:15.370
 we put him lp and to be able to change the 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.640
 we are going to fall down says options 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.640
 of folder 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.080
 exist 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.060
 and here we will have selected the 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.070
 we will select and we will give you the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.640
 okay 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.970
 and now we are going to be able to change 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.620
 we will be able to change him 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.790
 what is the day 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.790
 when we give right button 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.300
 lp of the whole series of numbers 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.820
 efe point mls 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:05.260
 let's say in itself and here we have it as 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.810
 the language of the language then we execute 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.950
 in the case it will be Spanish obviously 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.690
 from Spain and we give you the following 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.090
 install reboots the computer and they 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.720
 it must have been cybele must 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.220
 work good if it does not work 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.740
 what we are going to do is going to be what 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.520
 next we are going to give 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:32.650
 the configuration see you here 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.650
 configuration in pc configurations 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.600
 what we're going to be in the inter-fans 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.990
 we are going to finish 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.340
 time and language region and language 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.120
 and here 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.780
 we are not going to add a language 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.780
 colors 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.879
 and we look for our language obviously in 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.139
 the case is going to be Spanish if it is 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.139
 Mexico as I have done 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.930
 let's say in Mexico symptomatically goes 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.400
 to add but here the surprise is that 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.810
 let's restart the operating system 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.400
 will continue in English so I 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.220
 I recommend better if you are from Mexico 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.260
 that come out in Spain and then they will 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.240
 work now so that they are now 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.450
 completely in Spanish or whatever 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.640
 they tried with mexico to see what 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.950
 happens in the case I have these two 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.620
 languages and good after it has 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.600
 added 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.210
 and we are going to give here in mushrooms 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.770
 the main theme and we are going to close 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.260
 session 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.890
 well that's one way the other that is 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.660
 completely the same 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.660
 let's go to Spanish control 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.310
 language 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.840
 read who tells us to add language 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.890
 then completely the same only that 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.740
 in another interface 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.360
 well then we close session or 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.500
 we restart the computer and we'll see what 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.440
 what they are and what happens 90% is changed 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.060
 of the Spanish language go there to 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.380
 that everything is changed completely and therefore 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.570
 well let's go back in a moment 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.840
 well then good after restarting 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.130
 as we can observe some things already 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.510
 we have changed steam 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.030
 in the Spanish language, not all of them 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.830
 I was commenting 90 percent since then if 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:31.040
 we are going to change the language we already have 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.040
 a written start 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.360
 to pay 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.130
 and as good although we have the 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.370
 options of the folder or what is the 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.370
 team 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.670
 we already know that it is completed 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.360
 completely in Spanish 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.360
 OK 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.170
 well this 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.740
 the biggest game we have in the 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.740
 Spanish met we commented 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.410
 a normal party 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.410
 Major in the English language 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.990
 for the keyboard layout and already 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.380
 it would be a matter of what not only 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.270
 let's configure 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.340
 exercise 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:34.380
 the rapporteur of control in him 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.520
 in Spanish 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.520
 for example here in 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.160
 keyboard layout as in the 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:45.470
 case right now we have it as a policy in 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.470
 Spain I'm from Mexico, we put it 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.310
 then an expensive solvent advisor 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:06:00.230
 and so we set it up as well as 1 day 1 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.620
 so that the language is in the language 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.620
 Spanish 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.920
 and the truth exists 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.660
 or yes it is a great help then 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.580
 friends is all for the moment if you have 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.800
 been of utility can subscribe 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.240
 give me a like and some doubt that 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.070
 have can have the comments 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.360
 I will be very aware that they have a 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.360
 excellent late until later
