any<00:02:26.140> type<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.440> liquid<00:02:26.920> or<00:02:27.040> cream<00:02:27.070> that<00:02:27.490> I'm

any type of liquid or cream that I'm

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.420 
any type of liquid or cream that I'm
using<00:02:28.030> otherwise<00:02:28.470> it'll<00:02:29.470> move<00:02:29.800> all<00:02:30.070> around<00:02:30.340> my

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.330 
using otherwise it'll move all around my
face<00:02:30.700> on<00:02:31.030> normally<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:31.840> would<00:02:32.140> use<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.650> 10-9

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
face on normally I would use the 10-9

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.890 
face on normally I would use the 10-9
punana<00:02:33.730> powder<00:02:34.060> but<00:02:34.300> I<00:02:34.330> think<00:02:34.570> that's<00:02:34.690> just<00:02:34.750> a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
punana powder but I think that's just a

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.390 
punana powder but I think that's just a
little<00:02:35.050> bit<00:02:35.230> too<00:02:35.380> light<00:02:35.650> for<00:02:35.680> what<00:02:36.010> I'm<00:02:36.100> going

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
little bit too light for what I'm going

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.740 
little bit too light for what I'm going
for<00:02:36.670> for<00:02:36.910> today<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.269> want<00:02:37.480> something<00:02:37.630> that's

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.970 
for for today so I want something that's
a<00:02:37.930> little<00:02:37.959> bit<00:02:38.230> more<00:02:38.380> tactical

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.199 

now<00:02:44.980> I'm<00:02:45.069> just<00:02:45.220> going<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:45.610> with<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.790> big<00:02:45.970> powder

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209
