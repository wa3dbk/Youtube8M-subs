00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 all salute is Yuri Okunyov and we 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.520
 continue to disassemble sony vegas and small 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.460
 domestic chips 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.429
 Today we will answer the question of how 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.500
 rotate or flip video to sony 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.240
 vegas 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.150
 we opened the sony dashboard again 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.600
 vegas uploaded the file with which we will 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.510
 work 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.970
 have a look at what we can and what we 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.970
 need to do the easiest option is 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.260
 go to the bookmark in the event button pen 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.440
 or crop click it right on the video and 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.350
 there is such a window 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.460
 thanks to him we can reduce 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.890
 increase the video inside of ours already 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.500
 the final frame but also thanks to him 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.350
 we can rotate the video if we do 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.969
 so here is our video will be 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:58.980
 vertical because it does not fit we 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:00.510
 increase the picture itself and it turns out that 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.129
 our video turned the same way 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.769
 do if you were shooting a video for example 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.990
 vertical it can be rotated and 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.750
 put on a max of just continue 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.540
 twist there and video 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.760
 we will turn over by the way good useful counter 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.200
 if you want to flip clearly and 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.290
 make a turn by 90 degrees in the 180 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.020
 when turning it is necessary to hold down the shift key 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.009
 and then he will clearly go on 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.350
 a certain step is reduced back to 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.140
 the right size and it turns out that our 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.140
 picture in the desired position in the side and 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.140
 upside down 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.630
 The second option is more complicated but sometimes 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.960
 more suitable to use a button 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.359
 track motion we click on it and see 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.679
 here is such a small panel on 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:02:00.729
 position bars we can increase 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:02.770
 shrink video by also clicking on 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.359
 central circle and appearing when 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.500
 an arrow so bent appears 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:07.500
 twist video 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.680
 in our case it covers the whole video 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.250
 track all subsequent videos even if 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:23.920
 we will put them in a row on the panel too 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.720
 will change their position here if 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.790
 talk about how to turn or 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.709
 turn the video or thanks to the buttons 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.709
 event punk rock or through track motion 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.709
 good luck
