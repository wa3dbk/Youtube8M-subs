plants develops this huge swollen base
on<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.330> which<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.600> basically<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.260> water<00:00:19.529> storage

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.609 
top great pot plant the bit at the base
will<00:00:30.179> swell<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.750> much<00:00:30.900> it'll<00:00:31.080> often<00:00:31.260> crack

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
will swell so much it'll often crack

happens this is a bigger one in the
ground<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.410> believe<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.370> or<00:00:38.399> not<00:00:38.520> they<00:00:38.640> can

ground and believe it or not they can

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.369 
ground and believe it or not they can
get<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> lot<00:00:39.149> thicker<00:00:39.510> than<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.870> at<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> base

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
get a lot thicker than this at the base

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.860 
get a lot thicker than this at the base
but<00:00:40.739> they're<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> very<00:00:41.250> curious<00:00:41.969> plant<00:00:42.510> indeed

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
but they're a very curious plant indeed

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.979 
but they're a very curious plant indeed
notice<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.620> very<00:00:43.800> swollen<00:00:44.250> base<00:00:44.899> normally<00:00:45.899> it

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
notice the very swollen base normally it

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.750 
notice the very swollen base normally it
comes<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.590> as<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> one<00:00:47.010> trunk<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.640> then

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
comes up just as the one trunk and then

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.990 
comes up just as the one trunk and then
branches<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.590> get<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.800> lovely<00:00:50.190> foliage

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
branches and you get this lovely foliage

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.569 
branches and you get this lovely foliage
does<00:00:51.600> seem<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.050> grow<00:00:52.199> okay<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.860> many<00:00:53.129> areas<00:00:53.399> of

a<00:01:04.199> lot<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.799> seed<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.220> think<00:01:05.369> there's<00:01:05.489> something

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
a lot of seed I think there's something

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.420 
a lot of seed I think there's something
like<00:01:05.760> 14<00:01:06.540> heads<00:01:06.930> here<00:01:07.260> each<00:01:07.619> head<00:01:08.040> would<00:01:08.250> have

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
like 14 heads here each head would have

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.990 
like 14 heads here each head would have
some<00:01:08.840> thousands<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.960> seeds<00:01:10.290> set<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.040> now

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
some thousands of seeds set in it now

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.039 
some thousands of seeds set in it now
this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.600> bit<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.020> mixed<00:01:13.409> up<00:01:13.909> family<00:01:15.049> when

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
this is a bit of a mixed up family when

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.170 
this is a bit of a mixed up family when
plants<00:01:16.619> are<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:16.890> mixed<00:01:17.310> up<00:01:17.430> they're<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> same

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
plants are not mixed up they're the same

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.840 
plants are not mixed up they're the same
as<00:01:18.360> people<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.930> are<00:01:19.080> mixed<00:01:19.350> up<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.610> that

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
as people that are mixed up that is that

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.120 
as people that are mixed up that is that
normally<00:01:21.450> plants<00:01:21.900> are<00:01:22.020> both<00:01:22.170> boys<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.860> girls

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
normally plants are both boys and girls

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.960 
normally plants are both boys and girls
at<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:23.759> time<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:25.229> most<00:01:25.920> flowers<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.700> fact

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
at the one time so most flowers in fact

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.480 
at the one time so most flowers in fact
are<00:01:27.150> both<00:01:27.330> boy<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.780> girl<00:01:28.049> flower<00:01:28.590> together

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
are both boy and girl flower together

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.929 
are both boy and girl flower together
we'd<00:01:30.030> regard<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:30.570> pretty<00:01:30.840> unnatural<00:01:31.939> but

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
we'd regard that as pretty unnatural but

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.420 
we'd regard that as pretty unnatural but
sometimes<00:01:33.509> plants<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.320> us<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:35.250> is

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
sometimes plants are like us and this is

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.560 
sometimes plants are like us and this is
an<00:01:35.520> example<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.090> appears<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.540> be

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
an example of one that appears to be

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.749 
an example of one that appears to be
very<00:01:36.659> much<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.110> us<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> girl<00:01:38.250> plant

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
very much like us this is a girl plant

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.690 
very much like us this is a girl plant
it<00:01:39.210> set<00:01:39.600> these<00:01:39.900> seeds<00:01:40.290> which<00:01:40.920> means<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.340> it's

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
it set these seeds which means it's it's

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.160 
it set these seeds which means it's it's
pregnant<00:01:41.909> at<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.299> moment<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.780> there's<00:01:43.140> a

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
pregnant at the moment and there's a

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.539 
pregnant at the moment and there's a
couple<00:01:43.350> more<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.710> these<00:01:43.860> around<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.250> garden

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
couple more of these around the garden

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.249 
couple more of these around the garden
that<00:01:44.790> are<00:01:44.939> boy<00:01:45.090> plants<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.689> produce<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
that are boy plants that produce the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.280 
that are boy plants that produce the
flowers<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.950> produce<00:01:47.240> pollen<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:49.140> this

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
flowers that just produce pollen so this

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.800 
flowers that just produce pollen so this
one<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> sake<00:01:49.880> conforms<00:01:50.880> rather<00:01:51.149> better<00:01:51.479> to
