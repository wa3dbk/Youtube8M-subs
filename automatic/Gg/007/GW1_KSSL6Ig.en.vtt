00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.820 
look and it really is the first look at
a<00:01:17.729> prototype<00:01:18.479> structure<00:01:19.200> spoon<00:01:19.470> or<00:01:19.590> flutter

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
a prototype structure spoon or flutter

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.219 
a prototype structure spoon or flutter
spoon<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.850> we're<00:01:21.000> working<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.810> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
starts to look a lot different than a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.080 
starts to look a lot different than a
regular<00:01:25.380> spoon<00:01:25.920> almost<00:01:26.280> has<00:01:26.430> kind<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.820> bug

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
regular spoon almost has kind of a bug

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.050 
regular spoon almost has kind of a bug
look<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:28.979> got<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> scale<00:01:29.549> pattern

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
look to it and it's got a scale pattern

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.999 
look to it and it's got a scale pattern
natural<00:01:30.509> eyes<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.770> see<00:01:31.979> that

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
natural eyes and you can see that

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.300 
natural eyes and you can see that
special<00:01:32.909> cup<00:01:33.240> design<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.590> spoon<00:01:35.009> and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
special cup design of that spoon and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.249 
special cup design of that spoon and
that's<00:01:35.939> what's<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.540> give<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.900> spoon

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
that's what's going to give that spoon

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.160 
that's what's going to give that spoon
that<00:01:37.560> very<00:01:38.189> hard<00:01:38.490> wobble<00:01:39.150> or<00:01:39.299> flutter<00:01:39.689> as<00:01:39.960> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
that very hard wobble or flutter as it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.990 
that very hard wobble or flutter as it
falls<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:41.250> then<00:01:41.430> you're<00:01:41.610> going<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.850> see

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
falls but then you're going to see

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.249 
falls but then you're going to see
something<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.390> stands<00:01:42.720> out<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.140> sore

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259

something that stands out like a sore
thumb<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.979> that's<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.060> addition<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.689> a

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
thumb and that's the addition of a

thumb and that's the addition of a
second<00:01:46.680> set<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.920> hooks<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.460> that's<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
second set of hooks and that's the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.969 
second set of hooks and that's the
solution<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> problem<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.860> know

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
solution to the problem so you know

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.980 
solution to the problem so you know
we've<00:01:50.159> got<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.640> hook<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.210> bottom<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.960> a

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
we've got a hook on the bottom like a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.810 
we've got a hook on the bottom like a
lot<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.409> traditional<00:01:52.890> flutter<00:01:53.159> spoons<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
lot of traditional flutter spoons and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.080 
lot of traditional flutter spoons and
then<00:01:54.509> we've<00:01:54.659> got<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:55.110> belly<00:01:55.890> hook<00:01:56.189> that

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
then we've got a belly hook that

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.870 
then we've got a belly hook that
actually<00:01:57.509> lays<00:01:57.810> flush<00:01:58.770> against<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.430> body<00:01:59.700> of

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
actually lays flush against the body of

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.330 
actually lays flush against the body of
the<00:01:59.939> bait<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.290> not<00:02:01.530> going<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.890> tangle

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the bait so it's not going to tangle

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.459 
the bait so it's not going to tangle
with<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.640> hook<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.149> not<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.170> be<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
with that hook it's not going to be a

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.130 
with that hook it's not going to be a
nuisance<00:02:04.829> around<00:02:05.219> cover<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:06.479> when<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.780> fish

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
nuisance around cover but when that fish

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.740
