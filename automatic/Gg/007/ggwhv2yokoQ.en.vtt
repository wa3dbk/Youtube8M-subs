00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
wasn't running right see if I have to

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.670 
wasn't running right see if I have to
choke<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.250> all<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.520> way<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.300> would<00:00:45.510> hunt<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.250 
surge the only way I could get it to run
correctly<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.239> pull<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> choke<00:00:51.989> out

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260

correctly is if I pull the choke out
about<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:53.010> much<00:00:53.449> this<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.620> how<00:00:55.620> far<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.100> have

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
about this much this is how far you have

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.069 
about this much this is how far you have
to<00:00:56.370> pull<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> choke<00:00:56.940> out<00:00:57.210> all<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.660> way<00:00:57.809> in

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
to pull the choke out all the way in

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.200
