00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.979
 so the garden 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.500
 and I took off my shirt 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:31.670
 well this video is to last for 8 years 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.860
 because it is under 8 years old that 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.620
 have more than eight years old they will ask 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.660
 why why 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.239
 but the child under 8 years old because 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.620
 obviously I do not like fights 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.160
 but I found it on my wall 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.360
 and I like it 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:56.110
 and good for children who do not know 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.610

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.650
 Well first things first your glove 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.640

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.869
 and black 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:21.409
 and you will see what color they want 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.020
 or white or black or if they want green 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.690
 green then 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.520

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.380
 how the black lies 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.380
 they are going to put their hand 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.810
 inside but inside the white 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.300
 that's how it is 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.790
 blank like this 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.790

 no longer seeing 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.010

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.250

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.780

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.030

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.220
