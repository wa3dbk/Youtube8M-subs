00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.859
 in this unit we will do the review 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.389
 on the importance of social functions 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.610
 the possible perspectives schools before 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.089
 to start our conversation 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.470
 we must revise some conceptions and 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.830
 meanings that should lead to 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.640
 education of the subjects for a 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.480
 truly citizen 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.890
 first of all, we must review the concept 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.400
 of citizen 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.520
 second citizen brand is the one who learns 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.320
 making yourself to do if a 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.030
 creator of the social world in which 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.340
 when you think in today's school in 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.590
 we realize the innumerable demands that 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.010
 will emerge from the 20th century 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.770
 the world changed society changed the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.100
 people changed the social issues are 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.309
 other so the school in the present day 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.559
 She needs to be another she needs to be 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.800
 seen differently 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.939
 We need to change our vision, we need 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.590
 reflect on the social function of the school 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.369
 it is not enough just the training 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.220
 of the student, but the formation of the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.560
 citizen to deepen our 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.360
 knowledge of these issues 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.170
 I suggest reading the book on education 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.799
 in the brandÃ£o citizen school where 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.950
 approach of the subject to learn or 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.450
 we must understand that this student 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.280
 is the subject is a citizen subject to 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.860
 deepening our knowledge 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.450
 I suggest doing the readings from the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.909
 teaching material 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.570
 highlighting the importance of this function 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.820
 social importance of the school 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.939
 facing this student while the student who 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.020
 thinks a student who feels one by one who sees 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.280
 a student who is the citizen and now let's 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.450
 talk about the different functions of the school 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:06.090
 the first function of the school is to educate 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:10.080
 formally the new generations where it must 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.120
 be to propose a civilized formation 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.260
 for the interactive interaction between 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.959
 vest actors 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.780
 I live the means of creating various knowledges 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.750
 with meanings and knowledge that 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.680
 can be shared by all 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.079
 the second social function of the school 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.239
 add the first one that should be the one of 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.720
 dialogue between all stakeholders and 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.060
 components of the school universe students 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.840
 teachers managers employees and parents 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.359
 always remembering how much the community 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.060
 can help to qualify and 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.040
 validate the objectives and projects of 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.019
 school 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.409
 the third social function of the 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.290
 school that is to articulate an education 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:58.109
 broader vision of training for the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.340
 life for the exercise of citizenship and 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:04.980
 humanization by disrupting education 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.989
 which has been offered with a view 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.239
 only for the development of 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.349
 scientific knowledge or preparation 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.560
 for the entrance exam 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.319
 the fourth function of the school institution 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.660
 nowadays is to establish partnerships 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.609
 with families once the children 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.410
 young people remain under 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.139
 school responsibility 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.190
 most of the days, weeks and years of 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.299
 Your lives 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.359
 the fifth and final function must be that of 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.900
 promote citizen education against 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:39.290
 social inequality and for inclusion and 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.699
 multiculturalism 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.790
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:47.010

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.609
 about the importance of school as a 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.310
 social space space that favor the 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:56.310
