uncertain maps which are objective based

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.340 
uncertain maps which are objective based
you<00:00:18.240> need<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.570> know<00:00:18.750> how<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:20.689> control<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.140> mat

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
you need to know how to control the mat

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.470 
you need to know how to control the mat
and<00:00:22.680> make<00:00:23.010> sure<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.430> idiots<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.300> you're

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
and make sure that idiots and you're

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.330 
and make sure that idiots and you're
mostly<00:00:24.900> your<00:00:25.109> enemy<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:25.500> sometimes<00:00:26.130> your

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
mostly your enemy but sometimes your

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.240 
mostly your enemy but sometimes your
allies<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:27.090> again<00:00:27.180> mostly<00:00:27.779> your<00:00:28.019> enemy<00:00:28.289> do

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
allies but again mostly your enemy do

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.099 
allies but again mostly your enemy do
what<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.609> need<00:00:29.789> them<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.269> which<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:30.990> this

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
what you need them to do which in this

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.299 
what you need them to do which in this
case<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.410> lose<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.390> stay<00:00:33.390> off<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.750> flag<00:00:34.309> which

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
case is lose and stay off the flag which

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.100 
case is lose and stay off the flag which
can<00:00:35.489> be<00:00:35.610> accomplished<00:00:36.059> very<00:00:36.270> easily<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.960> this

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
can be accomplished very easily on this

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.030 
can be accomplished very easily on this
particular<00:00:37.290> mode<00:00:38.300> because<00:00:39.300> there's<00:00:39.660> only<00:00:39.750> one

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
particular mode because there's only one

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.090 
particular mode because there's only one
rocket<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:42.140> it's<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> very<00:00:43.559> easily

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
rocket and it's in a very easily

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.459 
rocket and it's in a very easily
defensible<00:00:44.640> location<00:00:45.420> honestly<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.289> would

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
defensible location honestly it would

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.069 
defensible location honestly it would
have<00:00:46.559> been<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> lot<00:00:47.010> better<00:00:47.180> if<00:00:48.180> they'd<00:00:48.780> put<00:00:48.989> it

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
have been a lot better if they'd put it

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.869 
have been a lot better if they'd put it
at<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.170> top<00:00:50.149> but<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.360> know<00:00:51.920> EA<00:00:52.920> will<00:00:53.399> be<00:00:53.610> easy

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
at the top but you know EA will be easy

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.770 
at the top but you know EA will be easy
will<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.420> easy<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.730> trick<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.600> could

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
will be easy the trick here is you could

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.130 
will be easy the trick here is you could
work<00:00:58.469> here<00:00:58.890> anyway<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.609> map<00:01:00.020> there<00:01:01.020> are

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
work here anyway this map there are

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.260 
work here anyway this map there are
three<00:01:01.350> basic<00:01:01.590> areas<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.579> can<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> first

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
three basic areas you can be the first

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.299 
three basic areas you can be the first
is<00:01:03.510> right<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.899> top<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.470> rocket<00:01:04.680> which<00:01:05.100> is

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
is right on top of the rocket which is

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.520 
is right on top of the rocket which is
the<00:01:06.000> most<00:01:06.150> luck<00:01:06.479> which<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.350> most

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the most luck which is the most

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.100 
the most luck which is the most
logically<00:01:08.340> easy<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.939> explain<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:09.930> you

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
logically easy to explain because you

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.359 
logically easy to explain because you
don't<00:01:10.260> want<00:01:10.350> them<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.740> get<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.979> ergo<00:01:11.310> you

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
don't want them to get it ergo you

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.640 
don't want them to get it ergo you
should<00:01:11.700> stand<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.990> other<00:01:13.140> one<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.409> up

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
should stand on it the other one is up

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.560 
should stand on it the other one is up
here<00:01:14.070> which<00:01:14.280> gives<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> better<00:01:14.909> view<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
here which gives you a better view of

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.770 
here which gives you a better view of
the<00:01:16.049> area<00:01:16.640> in<00:01:17.640> front<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.560> left<00:01:20.780> basically

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the area in front to the left basically

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.350 
the area in front to the left basically
it<00:01:22.170> gives<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> very<00:01:22.830> wide<00:01:23.100> sweeping<00:01:23.820> area

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
it gives you a very wide sweeping area

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.210 
it gives you a very wide sweeping area
fire<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.110> cover<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.530> bridge<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
fire you can cover the bridge in the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.690 
fire you can cover the bridge in the
gully<00:01:26.460> below<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.979> if<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.310> control

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
gully below you and if you can control

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.280 
gully below you and if you can control
that<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.119> basically<00:01:30.299> you're<00:01:30.750> going<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.170> win

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that then basically you're going to win

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.230 
that then basically you're going to win
the<00:01:31.439> game<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:31.979> they<00:01:32.130> can't<00:01:32.369> really<00:01:32.880> swim

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the game because they can't really swim

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.990 
the game because they can't really swim
past<00:01:33.509> very<00:01:34.380> few<00:01:34.619> people<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.640> it's

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
past very few people do that and it's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.140 
past very few people do that and it's
not<00:01:36.210> very<00:01:36.240> effective<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:38.280> get<00:01:38.430> bastards<00:01:38.970> like

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
not very effective you get bastards like

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.690 
not very effective you get bastards like
this<00:01:39.420> who<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:39.869> try<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.979> fence<00:01:41.340> things

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
this who just try and do fence things

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.230 
this who just try and do fence things
you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.119> pick<00:01:42.329> them<00:01:42.509> off<00:01:42.689> very<00:01:42.990> easily<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
you can pick them off very easily the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.870 
you can pick them off very easily the
third<00:01:45.540> area<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.770> more<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.310> snipers

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
third area and you get more on snipers

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.249 
third area and you get more on snipers
who<00:01:48.030> try<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.299> come<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.689> snipe<00:01:48.990> which

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
who try and come up here to snipe which

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.560 
who try and come up here to snipe which
is<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> perfectly<00:01:49.799> fine<00:01:50.070> idea<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.060> as<00:01:51.270> long

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
is a perfectly fine idea and so as long

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.420 
is a perfectly fine idea and so as long
as<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.930> make<00:01:52.530> sure<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.770> check<00:01:52.799> your<00:01:53.130> zones

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
as you make sure to check your zones

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.429 
as you make sure to check your zones
which<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.060> say<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.420> areas<00:01:54.750> immediately<00:01:54.899> in

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
which is to say the areas immediately in

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.399 
which is to say the areas immediately in
front<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:55.979> left<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:57.420> third<00:01:57.689> zone<00:01:58.020> I

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
front and to the left the third zone I

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.069 
front and to the left the third zone I
will<00:01:58.770> rotate<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.430> probably<00:02:00.329> fairly<00:02:00.630> soon

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
will rotate to probably fairly soon

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.310 
will rotate to probably fairly soon
because<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.530> don't<00:02:01.649> remember<00:02:01.740> when

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
because I don't remember when

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.540 
because I don't remember when
gameplay<00:02:02.650> was<00:02:02.770> recorded<00:02:04.830> but<00:02:05.830> I'm<00:02:06.010> inclined

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
gameplay was recorded but I'm inclined

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.430 
gameplay was recorded but I'm inclined
to think<00:02:06.790> that<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.390> third<00:02:07.630> zone<00:02:07.870> is<00:02:08.110> right<00:02:08.320> in

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
to think that the third zone is right in

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.350 
to think that the third zone is right in
the<00:02:08.530> middle<00:02:08.560> of<00:02:08.890> these<00:02:09.100> right<00:02:09.369> at<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.580> apex<00:02:10.060> of

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
the middle of these right at the apex of

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.830 
the middle of these right at the apex of
the<00:02:10.450> of<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.410> fence<00:02:11.650> line<00:02:15.209> right<00:02:16.209> which<00:02:16.570> is<00:02:16.690> to

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
the of the fence line right which is to

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.380 
the of the fence line right which is to
say<00:02:16.870> right<00:02:17.290> here<00:02:17.320> you<00:02:17.830> can<00:02:18.010> cover<00:02:18.250> both<00:02:18.850> areas

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
say right here you can cover both areas

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:27.300 
say right here you can cover both areas
reasonably<00:02:20.170> well<00:02:25.320> which<00:02:26.320> is<00:02:26.350> important<00:02:26.860> for

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
reasonably well which is important for

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.880 
reasonably well which is important for
instance<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:27.730> have<00:02:27.760> this<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.270> have<00:02:28.990> if<00:02:29.740> you

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
instance you have this you have if you

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.800 
instance you have this you have if you
if<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.490> do<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.850> left<00:02:31.090> like<00:02:31.360> I'm<00:02:31.510> doing<00:02:31.780> right

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
if you do the left like I'm doing right

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.140 
if you do the left like I'm doing right
now<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.200> can<00:02:32.590> cover<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:33.130> area<00:02:33.459> to<00:02:33.610> behind<00:02:33.940> the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
now you can cover the area to behind the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.440 
now you can cover the area to behind the
fences<00:02:34.800> but<00:02:35.800> if<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:36.010> rotate<00:02:36.370> over<00:02:36.610> here<00:02:37.060> you

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
fences but if you rotate over here you

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.520 
fences but if you rotate over here you
can<00:02:37.630> cover<00:02:37.840> up<00:02:37.989> there<00:02:38.410> without<00:02:39.100> being

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
can cover up there without being

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.560 
can cover up there without being
overwhelmed<00:02:41.530> or<00:02:41.680> flanked<00:02:42.420> there's<00:02:43.420> also

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
overwhelmed or flanked there's also

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.660 
overwhelmed or flanked there's also
technically<00:02:44.260> if<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:44.950> want<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.220> divide<00:02:45.489> this

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
technically if you want to divide this

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.910 
technically if you want to divide this
into<00:02:46.030> four<00:02:46.750> zones<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:47.260> can<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.680> other<00:02:47.800> one

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
into four zones you can the other one

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.500 
into four zones you can the other one
would<00:02:48.040> be<00:02:48.160> right<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.550> front<00:02:48.580> here<00:02:49.209> which<00:02:49.390> is

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
would be right in front here which is

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.449 
would be right in front here which is
basically<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.200> same<00:02:50.440> as<00:02:50.500> up<00:02:50.890> top<00:02:51.130> that<00:02:51.430> you

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
basically the same as up top that you

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.699 
basically the same as up top that you
just<00:02:51.730> get<00:02:51.880> slightly<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.540> slightly<00:02:53.350> better

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
just get slightly a slightly better

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.430 
just get slightly a slightly better
angle<00:02:54.340> for<00:02:54.580> shooting<00:02:54.970> people<00:02:55.780> on<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.230> fence

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
angle for shooting people on the fence

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.640 
angle for shooting people on the fence
right<00:02:56.680> here<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:58.239> don't<00:02:58.870> understand<00:02:59.350> how<00:02:59.500> people

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
right here I don't understand how people

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.770 
right here I don't understand how people
are<00:03:00.070> able<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.370> blast<00:03:00.580> that<00:03:00.940> angle<00:03:01.330> i<00:03:01.480> hate<00:03:01.750> that

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
are able to blast that angle i hate that

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.050 
are able to blast that angle i hate that
angle<00:03:02.380> i<00:03:02.560> think<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.130> needs<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.459> die<00:03:06.060> sorry

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
angle i think that it needs to die sorry

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:16.140 
angle i think that it needs to die sorry
looks<00:03:09.330> anyway<00:03:13.200> some<00:03:14.200> people<00:03:14.530> also<00:03:14.769> prefer<00:03:15.580> to

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
looks anyway some people also prefer to

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.199 
looks anyway some people also prefer to
do<00:03:16.989> map<00:03:17.170> control<00:03:17.590> from<00:03:17.799> back<00:03:18.040> here<00:03:18.519> or<00:03:18.730> even

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
do map control from back here or even

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.410 
do map control from back here or even
back<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.799> normal<00:03:21.310> area<00:03:21.519> behind<00:03:22.239> the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
back to the normal area behind the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.500 
back to the normal area behind the
national<00:03:22.930> fences<00:03:23.320> like<00:03:23.730> back<00:03:24.730> into<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.239> left

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
national fences like back into the left

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.479 
national fences like back into the left
of<00:03:25.720> where<00:03:25.750> i<00:03:25.900> am<00:03:26.110> right<00:03:26.140> now<00:03:26.560> that's<00:03:27.340> a

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
of where i am right now that's a

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:28.830 
of where i am right now that's a
bullshit<00:03:27.880> idea<00:03:28.180> you're<00:03:28.390> not<00:03:28.510> going<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.720> get

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
bullshit idea you're not going to get

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.380 
bullshit idea you're not going to get
anywhere<00:03:29.049> doing<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:30.299> there's<00:03:31.299> no<00:03:31.480> point

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
anywhere doing that so there's no point

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.630 
anywhere doing that so there's no point
that<00:03:34.390> basically<00:03:34.959> sums<00:03:35.350> up<00:03:35.590> map<00:03:35.829> control<00:03:36.340> for

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
that basically sums up map control for

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.789 
that basically sums up map control for
the<00:03:36.730> Nationals<00:03:37.269> on<00:03:37.450> this<00:03:37.630> map<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:38.140> same<00:03:38.410> thing

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
the Nationals on this map the same thing

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.069 
the Nationals on this map the same thing
can<00:03:39.010> be<00:03:39.070> said<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.579> Royals<00:03:40.060> honestly<00:03:40.750> it's

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
can be said of the Royals honestly it's

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.780 
can be said of the Royals honestly it's
the<00:03:41.320> same<00:03:41.560> thing<00:03:41.590> in<00:03:41.980> reverse<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.519> only

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
the same thing in reverse the only

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.729 
the same thing in reverse the only
difference<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.299> being<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.870> do<00:03:43.989> not<00:03:44.140> have<00:03:44.440> a

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
difference is being you do not have a

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.500 
difference is being you do not have a
wide<00:03:45.010> field<00:03:45.340> of<00:03:45.579> fire<00:03:45.790> in<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.090> middle<00:03:46.329> because

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
wide field of fire in the middle because

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.300 
wide field of fire in the middle because
the<00:03:46.780> national<00:03:47.230> side<00:03:47.440> is<00:03:47.709> almost<00:03:48.040> all

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
the national side is almost all

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.140 
the national side is almost all
buildings<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:50.410> basically<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.700> have<00:03:51.850> two

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
buildings so basically you have two

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.539 
buildings so basically you have two
zones<00:03:52.570> at<00:03:52.840> that<00:03:53.019> point<00:03:53.350> you<00:03:53.470> can<00:03:53.860> sit<00:03:54.280> up<00:03:54.400> on

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
zones at that point you can sit up on

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.750 
zones at that point you can sit up on
top<00:03:54.820> of<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.120> hill<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:56.350> you<00:03:57.250> can<00:03:57.400> sit<00:03:57.579> on<00:03:57.670> the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
top of the hill and you can sit on the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.120 
top of the hill and you can sit on the
rocket<00:03:58.120> you<00:03:58.239> can<00:03:58.420> also<00:03:58.630> sit<00:03:59.560> in<00:03:59.590> that<00:03:59.860> area

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
rocket you can also sit in that area

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.789 
rocket you can also sit in that area
between<00:04:00.519> like<00:04:02.070> between<00:04:03.070> lookout<00:04:03.760> and

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
between like between lookout and

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.670 
between like between lookout and
windmill<00:04:05.799> which<00:04:06.549> I<00:04:06.880> looked<00:04:07.239> at<00:04:07.390> briefly<00:04:07.810> that

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
windmill which I looked at briefly that

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.620 
windmill which I looked at briefly that
little<00:04:08.950> area<00:04:09.190> with<00:04:09.489> like<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:09.850> one<00:04:10.030> house<00:04:10.299> and

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
little area with like the one house and

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.840 
little area with like the one house and
the<00:04:10.720> couple<00:04:11.019> trees<00:04:11.260> that's<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.400> good<00:04:12.549> area<00:04:12.820> to

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
the couple trees that's a good area to

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.030 
the couple trees that's a good area to
sit<00:04:13.150> in<00:04:13.239> that's<00:04:13.449> a<00:04:13.540> good

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
sit in that's a good

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.310 
sit in that's a good
zone<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:15.030> enemy<00:04:15.269> did<00:04:15.390> not<00:04:15.510> put<00:04:15.719> up<00:04:15.810> very<00:04:16.019> much

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
zone the enemy did not put up very much

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.990
