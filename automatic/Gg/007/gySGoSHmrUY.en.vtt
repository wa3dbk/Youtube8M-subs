00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:09.719
 hi guys hockey culture beauties are 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.000
 back to the series we're going to build and I 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:20.210
 I'm back here with our house. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.210
 modern and then it was yours here and 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.670
 now a vessel to update and this 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.470
 texture is already upgraded 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.160
 now you can lower up to 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.559
 here I started to do it 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.770
 from the bedroom 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:41.760
 This part here I'm going to finish is still 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.200
 you have to finish this part after 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.340
 Lipstick because if we were to 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.070
 continue this part that as I was going to 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.809
 get very strange and break the match 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.170
 of the victory and to be very strange even 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.840
 to make a balcony even as it were 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.879
 the fourth 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.600
 I separated a very crazy floor here that 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.070
 is the checkered floor the kitchen of 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.080
 people are and here is going to be the room will not 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.299
 have second floor here because it is very 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.220
 small for the second floor is just that 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.380
 So we'll start doing here. 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.240
 the parts because these sheets here in the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:33.200
 the house to stay a good house 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:33.200
 ecological and correct kitchen 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:55.869
 so the beautiful opposite is to give 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:59.900
 people use the strange old man 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:03.200
 then I tried mouth because it is not rich roche 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.020
 not rich now beauty 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.319
 there we can because it teaches that 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.900
 have an even worse idea that tap gives 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.540
 now it can be turned upside down 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.600
 saw the goalie for those who do not know 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.120
 I used to put it like that before 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:25.220
 now they have sent me to look for yes it is 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.560
 staying 16 hours is now totally like this 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:33.950
 Lisa did not have that bump on the floor. 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:37.370
 zin debuts but then let's put it here 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:57.110
 over the Brazilian who has the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:03:06.380
 things right here because they're doing it and they're going to do it 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:08.450
 here a refrigerator because the quiet life is 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.890
 would have put you here before and now 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:16.100
 here now ready that door is fine 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.760
 Tosca even goes this is because of the 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.959
 So it's not my fault, that's it. 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.620
 really bad texture 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:28.100
 but if you want to look beautiful 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:35.320
 because the texture of the door is beautiful is that 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.320
 The most we can do is continue 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:51.440
 it 's not staying there on top of the right stove 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:57.170
 so let's go guys to the next 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.370
 leaving the room doing is that a 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.180
 shelf 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:07.700
 So it's time to live, people close. 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:10.730
 here and blames parintins 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.730

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.190

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:21.799
 beautiful buriti hour and more the xvii until 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:26.240
 because now you are like you're the one 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.800
 sound box for galley and office labs 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.720
 on top of not getting that thing 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:45.520

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:53.930

 well it already and now before the signs here 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:13.820
 Stay well and you won the stage here. 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:17.080
 only on paper now it was not worth 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:20.150
 but then it was I ended up also 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.710

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.020
