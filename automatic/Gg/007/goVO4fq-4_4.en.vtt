you<00:00:24.269> see<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.749> and<00:00:25.099> because<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:26.249 
you see here and because of the

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:27.319 
you see here and because of the
questions<00:00:26.550> have<00:00:26.609> been<00:00:26.669> asked<00:00:26.939> because<00:00:26.999> we<00:00:27.240> do

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:27.329 
questions have been asked because we do

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.359 
questions have been asked because we do
a<00:00:27.359> quick<00:00:27.630> demonstration<00:00:27.890> to<00:00:28.890> highlight<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
a quick demonstration to highlight the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.769 
a quick demonstration to highlight the
differences<00:00:29.789> between<00:00:29.909> the<00:00:30.150> two<00:00:30.269> materials

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
differences between the two materials

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.510 
differences between the two materials
I'm<00:00:31.320> going<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.529> take<00:00:31.710> some<00:00:31.919> used<00:00:32.130> motor<00:00:32.400> oil

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
I'm going to take some used motor oil

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.450 
I'm going to take some used motor oil
and<00:00:32.970> put<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.040> bucket<00:00:35.040> that's<00:00:35.160> got<00:00:35.370> about

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and put it in a bucket that's got about

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.860 
and put it in a bucket that's got about
two<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> half<00:00:35.940> gallons<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.390> water<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.750> it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
two and a half gallons of water in it

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.390 
two and a half gallons of water in it
we're<00:00:37.260> using<00:00:37.410> used<00:00:37.680> motor<00:00:37.890> oil<00:00:37.980> because<00:00:38.370> of

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
we're using used motor oil because of

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.710 
we're using used motor oil because of
the<00:00:38.580> dark<00:00:38.760> color<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.150> going<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.330> be<00:00:39.420> easier

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
the dark color it's going to be easier

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.290 
the dark color it's going to be easier
to<00:00:39.870> see<00:00:40.020> if<00:00:40.080> during<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.760> experiment<00:00:43.190> as<00:00:44.300> you

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
to see if during this experiment as you

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.180 
to see if during this experiment as you
can<00:00:45.420> see<00:00:45.600> that's<00:00:45.720> a<00:00:45.870> pretty<00:00:46.080> nasty<00:00:46.290> mess<00:00:47.010> of

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
can see that's a pretty nasty mess of

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.770 
can see that's a pretty nasty mess of
motor<00:00:47.370> oil<00:00:47.460> there<00:00:50.360> I'm<00:00:51.360> going<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.570> go<00:00:51.660> ahead

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
motor oil there I'm going to go ahead

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.320 
motor oil there I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:52.050> pour<00:00:52.740> this<00:00:53.090> onto<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:55.940> onto<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.150> pipe

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
and pour this onto the onto the pipe

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.970 
and pour this onto the onto the pipe
propylene<00:00:57.780> here<00:00:58.080> and<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.740> I'm<00:00:58.830> going<00:00:58.920> to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
propylene here and then I'm going to

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.280 
propylene here and then I'm going to
collect<00:00:59.280> the<00:01:00.240> sample<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.720> the<00:01:00.810> water<00:01:01.020> coming

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
collect the sample of the water coming

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.470 
collect the sample of the water coming
out<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.580> jar<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:02.970> you<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.180> see<00:01:03.360> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
out in this jar so you can see the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:14.870 
out in this jar so you can see the
results

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.500 

and<00:01:15.880> one<00:01:16.000> thing<00:01:16.120> you're<00:01:16.210> going<00:01:16.330> to<00:01:16.390> notice

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
and one thing you're going to notice

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.870 
and one thing you're going to notice
right<00:01:16.750> away<00:01:16.930> is<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:18.190> water<00:01:18.400> is<00:01:18.520> just<00:01:18.700> sitting

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
right away is the water is just sitting

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.450 
right away is the water is just sitting
there<00:01:19.500> some<00:01:20.500> of<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.620> oil<00:01:20.830> is<00:01:20.950> splattered<00:01:21.340> it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
there some of the oil is splattered it

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.950 
there some of the oil is splattered it
says<00:01:21.670> absorbed<00:01:22.060> into<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.300> fabric<00:01:22.630> it's<00:01:22.780> great

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
says absorbed into the fabric it's great

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.810 
says absorbed into the fabric it's great
but<00:01:23.500> now<00:01:23.650> there's<00:01:23.860> oil<00:01:23.950> on<00:01:24.130> top<00:01:24.310> of<00:01:24.460> this<00:01:24.520> water

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
but now there's oil on top of this water

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.870 
but now there's oil on top of this water
and<00:01:25.110> because<00:01:26.110> polypropylene<00:01:26.740> is<00:01:27.220> hydrophobic

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
and because polypropylene is hydrophobic

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.770 
and because polypropylene is hydrophobic
meaning<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:29.110> is<00:01:29.350> resistant<00:01:30.190> to<00:01:30.250> water<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:31.570> it

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
meaning it is resistant to water that it

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.810 
meaning it is resistant to water that it
repels<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.560> water<00:01:32.770> and<00:01:33.070> doesn't<00:01:33.430> allow<00:01:33.700> the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
repels the water and doesn't allow the

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.900 
repels the water and doesn't allow the
water<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.240> sitting<00:01:34.570> there<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:35.229> go<00:01:35.380> through<00:01:35.680> it

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
water to sitting there to go through it

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.820 
water to sitting there to go through it
therefore<00:01:36.910> it's<00:01:37.330> going<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.540> take<00:01:37.720> an<00:01:38.290> enormous

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
therefore it's going to take an enormous

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.260 
therefore it's going to take an enormous
amount<00:01:39.070> of<00:01:39.250> time<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:39.490> effort<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.970> get<00:01:40.090> that

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
amount of time and effort to get that

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.440 
amount of time and effort to get that
water<00:01:40.540> to<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:42.490> oil<00:01:42.670> that's<00:01:42.910> in<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.180> water

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
water to that oil that's in that water

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.499 
water to that oil that's in that water
to<00:01:44.200> become<00:01:44.380> saturated<00:01:44.800> with<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:45.790> absorbed

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
to become saturated with and absorbed

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.900 
to become saturated with and absorbed
into<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:46.899> pipe<00:01:47.080> propylene<00:01:47.590> yet<00:01:48.550> this<00:01:48.700> has

to readily pass through it it'll absorb

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.570 
to readily pass through it it'll absorb
water<00:02:07.509> molecules<00:02:08.050> but<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:08.979> has<00:02:09.190> an<00:02:09.310> affinity

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
water molecules but it has an affinity

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.760 
water molecules but it has an affinity
for<00:02:09.820> oil<00:02:10.179> so<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.570> has<00:02:10.720> if<00:02:10.929> it<00:02:11.080> has<00:02:11.230> an<00:02:11.350> option<00:02:11.500> of

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
for oil so it has if it has an option of

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.740 
for oil so it has if it has an option of
holding<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.280> water<00:02:12.459> molecule<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.090> picking

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
holding the water molecule and picking

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.050 
holding the water molecule and picking
up<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:14.080> oil<00:02:14.770> molecule<00:02:15.220> it'll<00:02:15.520> release<00:02:15.880> the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
up a oil molecule it'll release the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.880 
up a oil molecule it'll release the
water<00:02:16.180> molecule<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.690> hold<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.230> oil<00:02:17.410> molecule

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
water molecule and hold the oil molecule

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.550 
water molecule and hold the oil molecule
so<00:02:18.610> makes<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:18.910> very<00:02:19.090> very<00:02:19.560> effective

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
so makes this very very effective

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.710 
so makes this very very effective

much is happening and in fact we can

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.870 
much is happening and in fact we can
leave<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:29.769> here<00:02:29.950> for<00:02:30.010> quite<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.370> while<00:02:30.610> and
