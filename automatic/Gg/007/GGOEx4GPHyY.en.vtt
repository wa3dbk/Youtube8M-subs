00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.520
 bild de monge a life of well 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.449
 interesting for us is forming 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.759

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.949
 well, first I'll show you the 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.860
 skills that use this bild and then 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.339
 play a game with her, then let's go 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.190
 over there 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:41.949
 here as primary and used the skill 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.960
 thundering fists with an acceleration 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.559
 this street makes our hits 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.809
 critics generate 15 additional spirit 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.590
 you will see that most of the 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.020
 used herein streets are geared towards 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.519
 regeneration of spirit because it is 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.699
 a bild that will consume a lot 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:04.839
 spirit because of this is the choice 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:07.320
 These streets beauty here the skill 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.830
 sharp winds with a storm 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.020
 interior 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.060
 this street makes when we are 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.850
 with a strong level 3 that the maximum level 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.649
 you regenerate three of 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.009
 second, this will help a lot 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:24.789
 we keep our spirit to the right 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.490
 and serenity is a defensive skill 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.020
 I will not give up and none of bild 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.190
 I think monk is essential for any 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.229
 bild 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.500
 always have a moment of trouble that 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.539
 You'll need it in a way. 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.849
 an explosive is well 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.090
 interesting because if you kill a 

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:45.069
 enemy marked with explosive palm 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.679
 50% of this enemy's life will be 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:51.310
 reflected on damage to nearby enemies 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:54.880
 so very powerful mobility and here 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.550
 I use a strong spirit that every 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.340
 enemy hit by this explosion is 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.410
 this street nagen regenerates 5 of spirit 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.209
 for each enemy is not that it was hit 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.959
 then it will also help in regeneration 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:10.780
 of our spirit is to others that the blow 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:12.550
 cyclone with the street in the implosion ie 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.970
 this urn will make people 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:21.219
 you can pull enemies from a distance 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.319
 distance of 34 meters a very high distance and a 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.970
 mantra of conviction here to give a 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.730
 bit of buffy 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.370
 turning beauty then would these 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.220
 The passive skills 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.830
 take the initiative to give a fairy in the 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.650
 Our armor is very interesting x aa 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.240
 Because we are going to be in touch with 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.890
 the enemies will be there in the middle 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.950
 hitting them is very interesting 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.640
 use these here not as a whole that she 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.400
 going to increase will roll your stocks 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.410
 based on its highest strength 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.690
 helps a lot too 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.900
 and there is an exalted one that will increase the 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.480
 our spirit to 250 and regenerate a 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.880
 spirit per second then these are 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.890
 skills and knew where she got into 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.920
 well balanced because we do not have 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.970
 take the United Nations as a whole and 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.610
 take the initiative that for me are the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.040
 passive skills essential to you 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.740
 maintain a good survival unless 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.420
 that you change April completely, but 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.950
 in general are the most 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.200
 important already knew it was legal 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.709
 because we do not need to touch her 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.930
 sure then those skills and 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:36.120
 Now I'll show you a little bit to 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.830
 You play beauty games. 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.060
 Good guys so I'm here on the tuna and 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.310
 You're seeing that I'm 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.610
 accumulating a lot of mobs 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.489
 around me and this is interesting 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.890
 so that the effect of the explosive form 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.989
 also hit the cyclone take in a 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.660
 large area on multiple enemies then the 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.560
 ideal would be you score multiple enemies 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.410
 with the explosive palm a two or three and 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.290
 pull them with cyclone blow skill 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.290
 which also gives 300% damage which is a 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.959
 High damage then this way you go 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.110
 is making the enemies that are 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:17.140
 marked by the explosive form explode 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.870
 and dealing damage to all enemies that 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.919
 are nearby, making it 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.840
 matt a very large group of enemies or 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.720
 this is interesting because now 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.630
 that we find enough little groups 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.240
 of enemies of mobs helps a lot 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.580
 kill them easily then beauty 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.580
 in general this was the build 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.220
 that I wanted to show 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.560
 You 're sure it's worth yours. 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.240
 give a test on her I bet 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.849
 you will like 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.439
