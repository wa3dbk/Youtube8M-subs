00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.160 
it around here on the camera you can see
that<00:01:32.310> from<00:01:32.549> almost<00:01:32.790> any<00:01:33.090> angle<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> screen<00:01:34.020> is

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
that from almost any angle the screen is

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.200 
that from almost any angle the screen is
really<00:01:34.560> really<00:01:34.829> bright<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.369> color<00:01:35.880> stone

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
really really bright and the color stone

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
really really bright and the color stone
shift<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:37.140> did<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.409> by<00:01:37.710> working

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
shift and we did that by working

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.399 
shift and we did that by working
together<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.610> process<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.540> optically<00:01:40.140> bond

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
together on a process to optically bond

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.469 
together on a process to optically bond
all<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> components<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> screen<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
all the components of the screen so the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.389 
all the components of the screen so the
gorilla<00:01:42.810> glass<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> surface<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
gorilla glass on the surface the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.510 
gorilla glass on the surface the
underlying<00:01:44.970> LCD<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.229> touch<00:01:46.560> sensor<00:01:47.040> even<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
underlying LCD the touch sensor even the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.639 
underlying LCD the touch sensor even the
electromagnetic<00:01:48.270> digitizer<00:01:49.079> for<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.470> ink

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
electromagnetic digitizer for the ink

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.710 
electromagnetic digitizer for the ink
are<00:01:49.829> all<00:01:50.250> bonded<00:01:50.759> together<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> single<00:01:51.540> unit

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
are all bonded together as a single unit

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.200 
are all bonded together as a single unit
and<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.560> process<00:01:52.829> eliminates<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.759> air<00:01:53.909> gap

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
and that process eliminates the air gap

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.300 
and that process eliminates the air gap
that's<00:01:54.479> usually<00:01:54.840> underneath<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.470> screen<00:01:55.799> so

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
that's usually underneath the screen so

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.580 
that's usually underneath the screen so
the<00:01:56.460> screen<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.909> not<00:01:56.939> only<00:01:57.270> brighter<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:58.170> uses

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
the screen is not only brighter it uses

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.649 
the screen is not only brighter it uses
twenty<00:01:59.130> percent<00:01:59.490> less<00:01:59.850> power<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.509> actually

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
twenty percent less power to actually

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.990 
twenty percent less power to actually
get<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.259> same<00:02:01.560> level<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.950> brightness<00:02:02.159> you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
get that same level of brightness you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.760 
get that same level of brightness you
can<00:02:03.149> order<00:02:03.360> these<00:02:03.570> pcs<00:02:04.049> starting<00:02:04.469> right<00:02:04.740> now
