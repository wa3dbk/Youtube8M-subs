and living the dream here is having

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.610 
and living the dream here is having
world<00:02:13.090> render<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.690> Dragon<00:02:14.050> Lords<00:02:14.290> are<00:02:14.410> gonna

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
world render and Dragon Lords are gonna

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.710 
world render and Dragon Lords are gonna
play<00:02:14.740> at<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.950> same<00:02:15.100> time<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.880> attacking<00:02:16.300> and

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
play at the same time the attacking and

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.450 
play at the same time the attacking and
then<00:02:16.840> both<00:02:17.080> getting<00:02:17.440> double<00:02:17.710> strike<00:02:17.950> yeah

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
then both getting double strike yeah

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.400 
then both getting double strike yeah
that's<00:02:18.640> pretty<00:02:18.790> sweet<00:02:18.970> yeah<00:02:19.290> although<00:02:20.290> I'm

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
that's pretty sweet yeah although I'm

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.990 
that's pretty sweet yeah although I'm
sure<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.950> space-time<00:02:21.370> continuum<00:02:21.400> would

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
sure that the space-time continuum would

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.850 
sure that the space-time continuum would
just<00:02:22.180> collapse<00:02:22.510> on<00:02:22.810> itself<00:02:23.080> yeah<00:02:23.650> i<00:02:23.680> think

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
just collapse on itself yeah i think

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.650 
just collapse on itself yeah i think
what<00:02:24.100> also<00:02:24.400> would<00:02:24.610> collapse<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.450> game

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
what also would collapse is the game

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.050 
what also would collapse is the game
state<00:02:25.960> because<00:02:26.230> your<00:02:26.350> phone<00:02:26.500> would<00:02:26.680> be<00:02:26.830> dead

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
state because your phone would be dead

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.550 
state because your phone would be dead
just<00:02:28.060> stone<00:02:28.300> dead<00:02:28.600> yeah<00:02:28.960> I<00:02:29.110> now<00:02:29.290> we<00:02:29.350> do<00:02:29.530> have

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
just stone dead yeah I now we do have

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.430 
just stone dead yeah I now we do have
two<00:02:29.920> craters<00:02:30.220> claws<00:02:30.520> just<00:02:31.510> because<00:02:31.780> they're

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
two craters claws just because they're

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.990 
two craters claws just because they're
very<00:02:32.590> good<00:02:32.740> cards<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.730> might<00:02:33.880> as<00:02:33.970> well

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
very good cards so you might as well

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.699 
very good cards so you might as well
have<00:02:34.240> some<00:02:34.480> they<00:02:35.050> don't<00:02:35.200> have<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.320> whole<00:02:35.470> lot<00:02:35.500> of

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
have some they don't have a whole lot of

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.730 
have some they don't have a whole lot of
removal<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:37.000> think<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.840> against<00:02:38.500> decks

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
removal so I think that against decks

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.650 
removal so I think that against decks
that<00:02:39.030> aren't<00:02:40.030> really<00:02:40.270> going<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.570> be

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
that aren't really going to be

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.390 
that aren't really going to be
interacting<00:02:40.840> with<00:02:41.080> us<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.290> lot<00:02:41.410> we're<00:02:42.310> just

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
interacting with us a lot we're just

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.920 
interacting with us a lot we're just
going<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:42.610> try<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:42.850> go<00:02:43.030> bigger<00:02:43.300> harder<00:02:43.810> and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
going to try and go bigger harder and

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.540 
going to try and go bigger harder and
faster<00:02:44.170> than<00:02:44.620> anything<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.010> they're<00:02:45.220> doing

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
faster than anything that they're doing

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.910 
faster than anything that they're doing
I<00:02:45.930> was<00:02:46.930> like<00:02:47.020> sounds<00:02:47.320> like<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.500> kind<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.739> deck

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
I was like sounds like the kind of deck

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.979 
I was like sounds like the kind of deck
that<00:02:48.130> punk<00:02:48.640> would<00:02:48.790> would<00:02:49.090> play<00:02:49.270> yeah

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
that punk would would play yeah

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.830

especially with Nick dose yeah as far as

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.060

the<00:02:52.989> matter<00:02:53.170> bass<00:02:53.380> goes<00:02:53.650> I'm<00:02:53.830> kind<00:02:54.040> of

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
the matter bass goes I'm kind of

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.860

surprised<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.640> not<00:02:54.730> see<00:02:54.790> just<00:02:55.300> some<00:02:55.480> number<00:02:55.660> of

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
surprised to not see just some number of

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.320 
surprised to not see just some number of
mana<00:02:56.080> confluence<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:57.610> try<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:57.880> smooth<00:02:58.150> out

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
mana confluence to try and smooth out

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.890 
mana confluence to try and smooth out
this<00:02:58.810> high<00:02:58.989> basic<00:02:59.410> count<00:02:59.650> since<00:03:00.160> I<00:03:00.750> mean<00:03:01.750> just

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
this high basic count since I mean just

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.030 
this high basic count since I mean just
doesn't<00:03:02.140> really<00:03:02.260> look<00:03:02.380> like<00:03:02.440> we<00:03:02.620> care<00:03:02.830> if<00:03:02.950> we

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
doesn't really look like we care if we

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.290 
doesn't really look like we care if we
do<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.190> couple<00:03:03.489> points<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.030> damage<00:03:04.150> to

trying to attack with Jess dragons stick
has<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.590> lot<00:03:38.739> of<00:03:38.769> ground<00:03:39.010> pounders<00:03:39.400> so<00:03:39.549> you<00:03:39.640> kind

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
has a lot of ground pounders so you kind

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.710 
has a lot of ground pounders so you kind
of<00:03:39.850> want<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.030> be<00:03:40.120> able<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.360> get<00:03:40.510> through

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
of want to be able to get through

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.509 
of want to be able to get through
something<00:03:41.049> like<00:03:41.080> that<00:03:41.320> which<00:03:41.680> is<00:03:41.709> why<00:03:42.010> we<00:03:42.400> have

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
something like that which is why we have

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.039 
something like that which is why we have
anger<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.000> gods<00:03:43.030> here<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.630> think<00:03:43.930> it's

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
anger the gods here I think it's

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.810 
anger the gods here I think it's
actually<00:03:44.170> pretty<00:03:44.470> good<00:03:44.820> unfortunately

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
actually pretty good unfortunately

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.640 
actually pretty good unfortunately
they'll<00:03:45.910> kill<00:03:46.030> our<00:03:46.120> man<00:03:46.269> of<00:03:46.299> guys<00:03:46.540> but<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:47.140> think

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
they'll kill our man of guys but I think

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.930 
they'll kill our man of guys but I think
as<00:03:47.739> long<00:03:48.010> as<00:03:48.130> we<00:03:48.250> have<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.370> board<00:03:48.549> presence

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
as long as we have a board presence

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.190 
as long as we have a board presence
outside<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.390> that<00:03:49.450> when<00:03:49.630> we<00:03:49.720> cast<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.080> we

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
outside of that when we cast that we

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.830 
outside of that when we cast that we
should<00:03:50.350> be<00:03:50.380> fine<00:03:50.620> yep<00:03:51.180> we<00:03:52.180> have<00:03:52.299> for<00:03:52.540> stoke<00:03:52.810> the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
should be fine yep we have for stoke the

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.979 
should be fine yep we have for stoke the
flames<00:03:53.700> which<00:03:54.700> does<00:03:54.940> seem<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.209> little<00:03:55.330> weird<00:03:55.570> I

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
flames which does seem a little weird I

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.810 
flames which does seem a little weird I
imagine<00:03:56.560> it's<00:03:56.709> primarily<00:03:57.130> going<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.489> be<00:03:57.580> used

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
imagine it's primarily going to be used

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.729 
imagine it's primarily going to be used
to<00:03:58.000> kill<00:03:58.239> opposing<00:03:58.690> storm<00:03:58.930> both<00:03:59.080> dragons<00:03:59.320> or

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
to kill opposing storm both dragons or

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.070 
to kill opposing storm both dragons or
thunder<00:04:00.160> break<00:04:00.310> Regents<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:01.720> can<00:04:01.840> also<00:04:01.959> use

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
thunder break Regents you can also use

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.190 
thunder break Regents you can also use
it<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:02.320> kill<00:04:02.530> something<00:04:02.799> like<00:04:03.989> mantis<00:04:04.989> rider

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
it to kill something like mantis rider

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.490 
it to kill something like mantis rider
or<00:04:05.320> rim<00:04:05.769> as<00:04:06.360> so<00:04:07.360> I<00:04:07.390> imagine<00:04:07.720> that<00:04:07.989> it's<00:04:08.140> for

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
or rim as so I imagine that it's for

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.500 
or rim as so I imagine that it's for
like<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.430> green<00:04:09.610> arrow<00:04:09.700> dragons<00:04:10.030> deck<00:04:10.239> you

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
like the green arrow dragons deck you

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.380 
like the green arrow dragons deck you
could<00:04:10.630> probably<00:04:10.840> even<00:04:10.989> use<00:04:11.200> it<00:04:11.320> against<00:04:12.390> like

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
could probably even use it against like

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.210 
could probably even use it against like
ABS<00:04:13.570> an<00:04:13.690> aggro<00:04:14.019> it<00:04:14.500> kills<00:04:14.709> everything<00:04:14.920> but

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
ABS an aggro it kills everything but

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.190 
ABS an aggro it kills everything but
siege<00:04:15.430> rhino<00:04:15.640> but<00:04:16.390> it<00:04:16.510> does<00:04:16.660> just<00:04:16.930> feel<00:04:17.169> a

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
siege rhino but it does just feel a

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.099 
siege rhino but it does just feel a
little<00:04:17.380> out<00:04:17.680> of<00:04:17.739> place<00:04:18.010> I<00:04:18.310> think<00:04:18.640> that<00:04:19.109> that's

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
little out of place I think that that's

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.240 
little out of place I think that that's
has<00:04:20.289> a<00:04:20.320> lot<00:04:20.500> of<00:04:20.530> really<00:04:20.770> cheap<00:04:20.979> green

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
has a lot of really cheap green

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.590 
has a lot of really cheap green
creatures<00:04:21.640> so<00:04:21.970> it's<00:04:22.120> hard

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
creatures so it's hard

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.390 
creatures so it's hard
yeah<00:04:22.930> it's<00:04:23.140> it<00:04:23.470> seems<00:04:23.830> like<00:04:23.980> something<00:04:24.280> like

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
yeah it's it seems like something like

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.770 
yeah it's it seems like something like
some<00:04:24.550> of<00:04:24.640> our<00:04:24.760> like<00:04:24.880> plummets<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:25.360> roasts

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
some of our like plummets and roasts

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.970 
some of our like plummets and roasts
kind<00:04:26.020> of<00:04:26.080> a<00:04:26.140> mix<00:04:26.320> of<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.530> two<00:04:26.560> would<00:04:26.800> be<00:04:26.950> a

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
kind of a mix of the two would be a

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.500 
kind of a mix of the two would be a
little<00:04:27.190> better<00:04:27.370> but<00:04:28.180> not<00:04:28.540> who<00:04:28.990> knows<00:04:29.310> yep<00:04:30.510> we

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510
