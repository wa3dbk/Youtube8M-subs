00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.680
 It's during the work on the soundtrack of "Copy Shop" 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.280
 that the idea of ​​Fast Film was born. 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.800
 We tore a lot of paper 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.400
 to produce that torn paper sound for the movie. 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.800
 And in the evening, there were all the images of "Copy Shop" on the floor, 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.000
 and suddenly, I saw a man walking on these images. 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.760
 There were things on the floor and a man walking, 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.800
 and there, I had the sudden idea of ​​making a film of it. 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.120
 That is, we take isolated images that are part of a movie, 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.000
 we bend them into objects 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.000
 and we make a new animation movie from these objects. 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.800
 In all, 1200 films were shot 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.000
 and I think we used about 400 for "Fast Film". 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.000
 We cut some pieces 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.080
 that we have recomposed as a new image. 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.720
 Since we had a lot 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.400
 material available to us, 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.760
 it was necessary to develop a system, a process 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.920
 which is on the one hand very ordered to organize all this, 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.000
 but which also leaves us a lot of freedom. 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.800
 The scene with the fall of the train was quite interesting to do. 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.600
 Just to find out what it should look like 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.800
 and how that should be done, 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.400
 it took more than six months. 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.320
 It was possible because we were working on a lot of things in parallel. 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.040
 It lasted a very long time before reaching the final solution, 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.600
 and realize it yet in time. 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.680
 In the train scene, when the train crashes, 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.680
 there is a car that is shredded by the paper. 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.880
 It was the first animation that was left as is. 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.400
 The aesthetics of the film exist only through human action. 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.120
 From the start, we absolutely wanted to do something at the animation table. 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.280
 Shooting has become more complicated. 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.760
 The more complex movements. 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.800
 Objects. 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.560
 And lastly, it has become above all a mixture 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.800
 post-production work and animation. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 By the idea, the aesthetics and the look, 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.000
 Fast Film is not feasible on a simple computer. 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.600
 It would have been too simplistic to have a digital look. 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.000
 The tremor of the animation, the structure of the paper. 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.760
 It would have been impossible to arrive 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.760
 to get it all on computer, 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.800
 and that sounds more real. 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.400
 I think the film gives free rein 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.280
 to a fairly wide latitude of interpretation. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.920
 Because we can read it in different ways. 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.400
 Good, or we watch the movies, 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.600
 we look for personal references and we observe. 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.200
 This is how a trip takes place in the history of cinema. 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.000
 Or we observe the relationship between the object 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.680
 and the film and so we follow the story. 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.600
 "Fast Film" is definitely the film of which I am 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.960
 least able to predict how it will be perceived. 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.080
 Because it's so complex that you can look everywhere 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.960
 and we see other films. 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.680
 That's why every spectator of the film 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.160
 "Fast Film" slice in its own way. 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.280
 I think it makes the movie faster than it really is. 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.200
 The more we see it, the more we perceive 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.320
 what we really wanted to express with this movie, 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.280
 what story "Fast Film" tells and 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.440
 not the movies we see in "Fast Film". 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.600
 When we look at it for the first time, 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.240
 it is super intense, there are lots of things 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.200
 which break at the same time. 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.400
 And maybe there is every time 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.400
 something new to discover, 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.880
 or else, with time, 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.360
 we have a different view on things 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.680
 and it's the film that wins.
