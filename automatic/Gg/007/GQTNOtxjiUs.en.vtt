00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.919
 hello with you sonic 91 and today I 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:12.840
 show you how to reboot the device 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:16.830
 If here such which throw out immediately 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.960
 all right well, right here when you buy 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.960
 that is, we bought a tablet here, or 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.890
 phone and immediately took it thrown 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.019
 pack with charging charging Nina 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.070
 if you get it will certainly be good 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.630
 together with all sorts of guarantees mix 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:39.629
 instructions you have a tablet let this 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:43.129
 The phone will turn off and I will not say so 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.289
 and it will not turn on you 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.660
 sometimes the sensor does not work well 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.410
 Here I have a sensor let's say it did not work 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.809
 to avoid it you can eat two 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.370
 golden buttons there is a rocker 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.460
 the volume of which I take away 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.970
 lower volume down and button 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:08.720
 turn off we keep this screenshot 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:13.380
 the main thing is not to be confused and if you keep 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.040
 top off button then we 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.740
 tablet or phone will load in 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.009
 Depending on if you have a button 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:28.860
 specifically to reboot or not so 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:41.060
 try it so i just turned it off 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:46.049
 accidentally not such a home password up to 580 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.250
 Here we hold the volume rocker on 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.850
 boost and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.850
 off button 1 2 3 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:02.770
 you see that he went out once he was 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:06.960
 turn on wait or wait yes he 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.960
 it reboots here and 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:16.570
 it's on sony xperia tablet z but if you 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:20.160
 did not recognize me now is charging 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.160
 so you need to turn it on 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:50.990
 next review will be on how to make 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:58.520
 slow-motion video I'll post to you in 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:03:03.320

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:11.710
 so booted rebooted now 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:17.860
