probably<00:01:35.700> although<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> heard<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.229> this

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
probably although I heard that this

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.020 
probably although I heard that this
trackball<00:01:37.950> actually<00:01:38.369> has<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> sleep<00:01:38.820> feature

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
one now a fact with these USB receivers

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.479 
one now a fact with these USB receivers
the<00:04:16.200> answer<00:04:16.470> is<00:04:16.560> no<00:04:16.680> you<00:04:16.739> cannot<00:04:17.130> use

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
the answer is no you cannot use

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.370 
the answer is no you cannot use
different<00:04:18.150> mice<00:04:18.330> like<00:04:18.690> for<00:04:18.930> instance<00:04:19.049> the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
different mice like for instance the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.080 
different mice like for instance the
trackball<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:20.040> if<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.489> have<00:04:20.580> another<00:04:20.790> mouse

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
trackball and if you have another mouse

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.550 
trackball and if you have another mouse
that<00:04:21.330> uses<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:21.810> receiver<00:04:22.140> you<00:04:22.290> can't<00:04:22.440> use

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
that uses that receiver you can't use

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.980 
that uses that receiver you can't use
the<00:04:22.680> same<00:04:22.860> receiver<00:04:23.160> in

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
the same receiver in

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.170 
the same receiver in
which<00:04:24.080> between<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.530> two<00:04:24.710> they<00:04:25.430> will<00:04:25.759> not<00:04:25.940> work

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
which between the two they will not work

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.400 
which between the two they will not work
I<00:04:26.419> don't<00:04:26.539> know<00:04:26.630> if<00:04:26.720> that<00:04:26.870> was<00:04:26.990> every<00:04:27.169> question

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410

don't think I'd ever have any use for

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.550 
don't think I'd ever have any use for
in-person<00:04:44.090> once<00:04:44.479> I<00:04:44.599> was<00:04:44.780> really<00:04:45.110> doing<00:04:45.349> some

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
in-person once I was really doing some

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.670 
in-person once I was really doing some
you<00:04:46.310> know<00:04:46.430> pretty<00:04:46.669> in-depth<00:04:47.660> mouse<00:04:48.319> clicking

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
you know pretty in-depth mouse clicking

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.650 
you know pretty in-depth mouse clicking
here<00:04:49.009> I<00:04:49.160> saw<00:04:49.699> have<00:04:49.789> a<00:04:49.819> tendency<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.270> do<00:04:50.419> this

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
here I saw have a tendency to do this

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.689 
here I saw have a tendency to do this
I'm<00:04:50.930> sure<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.740> idea<00:04:51.979> is<00:04:52.039> not<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.220> do<00:04:52.370> that<00:04:52.460> just

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
I'm sure the idea is not to do that just

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.189 
I'm sure the idea is not to do that just
to<00:04:52.819> keep<00:04:52.940> your<00:04:53.090> hand<00:04:53.330> staying<00:04:53.599> put<00:04:53.840> for<00:04:53.900> the

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
to keep your hand staying put for the

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.920 
to keep your hand staying put for the
whole<00:04:54.319> time<00:04:54.910> using<00:04:55.910> your<00:04:56.150> thumb<00:04:56.449> back<00:04:56.750> and

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
whole time using your thumb back and

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.420 
whole time using your thumb back and
forth<00:04:57.169> it<00:04:57.319> actually<00:04:57.650> does<00:04:57.830> feel<00:04:58.220> pretty

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
forth it actually does feel pretty

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.249 
forth it actually does feel pretty
comfortable<00:04:58.610> so<00:04:59.150> I'm<00:04:59.479> going<00:04:59.690> to<00:04:59.750> use<00:04:59.870> this<00:05:00.020> for

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.259 
comfortable so I'm going to use this for

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.589 
comfortable so I'm going to use this for
