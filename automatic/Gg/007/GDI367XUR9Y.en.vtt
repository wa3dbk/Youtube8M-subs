ahead and get started okay so i've

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.400 
ahead and get started okay so i've
downloaded<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.289> program<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.039> sent<00:00:17.310> in

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
downloaded the program that you sent in

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.370 
downloaded the program that you sent in
let's<00:00:19.410> say<00:00:19.680> oh<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.400> want<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.699> use<00:00:21.000> x2<00:00:21.960> don't

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
let's say oh you want to use x2 don't

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.720 
let's say oh you want to use x2 don't
you<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.680> think<00:00:22.920> mines<00:00:23.220> popping<00:00:23.850> up<00:00:23.939> x3<00:00:24.720> +<00:00:25.730> x3

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
you and I think mines popping up x3 + x3

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.509 
you and I think mines popping up x3 + x3
does<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.510> completely<00:00:28.230> different<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.130> next

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
does it completely different the next

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.640 
does it completely different the next
two<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:30.570> will<00:00:30.779> do<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.230> we'll<00:00:31.439> just

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
two so what we will do is we'll just

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.280 
two so what we will do is we'll just
close<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.189> out<00:00:32.430> actually<00:00:33.270> what<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:34.110> do

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
close this out actually what we can do

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.459 
close this out actually what we can do
is<00:00:34.440> we'll<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.829> launch<00:00:35.040> x2<00:00:35.670> as<00:00:35.940> well<00:00:36.390> as<00:00:36.540> x3<00:00:36.870> so

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
is we'll just launch x2 as well as x3 so

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.229 
is we'll just launch x2 as well as x3 so
I'm<00:00:37.559> going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> hold<00:00:37.920> down<00:00:38.040> control<00:00:38.370> then<00:00:39.149> I'm

here<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.349> subfloor<00:02:24.890> thickness<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.610> just

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
here to subfloor thickness and just

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.059 
here to subfloor thickness and just
increase<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.200> what<00:02:27.349> you<00:02:27.470> want<00:02:27.680> I'm<00:02:28.040> going

to say now 24 inches now I can leave it

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.039 
to say now 24 inches now I can leave it
lumber<00:02:31.489> or<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:31.790> can<00:02:32.090> make<00:02:32.269> it<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.659> solid

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.899 
keep it lumber keep it all simple click
OK<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.659> bah<00:02:39.109> boom<00:02:39.409> there<00:02:39.890> we<00:02:40.040> go<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:40.879> should

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
OK and bah boom there we go that should

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.369 
OK and bah boom there we go that should
be<00:02:41.510> it

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.960 

another<00:02:45.379> thing<00:02:45.739> we<00:02:45.950> can<00:02:46.129> do<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.519> I<00:02:46.579> think<00:02:46.819> you

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
another thing we can do and I think you

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.119 
another thing we can do and I think you
wanted<00:02:47.239> to<00:02:47.329> make<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.599> more<00:02:47.810> realistic<00:02:48.319> as<00:02:48.829> the

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
wanted to make it more realistic as the

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.339 
wanted to make it more realistic as the
floor<00:02:49.879> thickness<00:02:50.510> doesn't<00:02:50.870> look<00:02:51.019> quite<00:02:51.230> right

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
floor thickness doesn't look quite right

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.460 
floor thickness doesn't look quite right
because<00:02:52.190> it's<00:02:52.400> just<00:02:52.609> molding<00:02:53.420> flush<00:02:53.870> into<00:02:54.170> the

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
because it's just molding flush into the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.280 
because it's just molding flush into the
side<00:02:54.859> or<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.730> new<00:02:55.879> foundation<00:02:56.599> of<00:02:56.750> our<00:02:56.870> porch

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
side or the new foundation of our porch

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.770 
side or the new foundation of our porch
so<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:57.980> little<00:02:58.189> trick<00:02:58.489> I<00:02:58.609> like<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.819> use<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.540> with

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
so a little trick I like to use is with

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.319 
so a little trick I like to use is with
the<00:02:59.930> 3d<00:03:00.260> molding<00:03:00.709> so<00:03:00.889> I'll<00:03:01.069> select<00:03:01.489> inside<00:03:02.180> the

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
the 3d molding so I'll select inside the

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.170 
the 3d molding so I'll select inside the
porch<00:03:02.569> again<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.170> I'll<00:03:04.159> go<00:03:04.310> ahead<00:03:04.579> and<00:03:04.730> turn

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
porch again and I'll go ahead and turn

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.259 
porch again and I'll go ahead and turn
it<00:03:05.239> into<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.689> room<00:03:06.139> polyline<00:03:06.889> and<00:03:07.159> there's<00:03:08.090> my

it into a room polyline and there's my

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.910 
it into a room polyline and there's my
polyline<00:03:08.870> now<00:03:09.079> and<00:03:09.260> I'm<00:03:09.349> going<00:03:09.439> to<00:03:09.560> open<00:03:09.739> that

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
polyline now and I'm going to open that

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.670 
polyline now and I'm going to open that
polyline<00:03:10.609> up<00:03:10.819> and<00:03:11.060> see<00:03:11.659> the<00:03:11.840> specifications

all set good ok I'm going to convert now
my<00:03:15.439> polyline<00:03:16.010> because<00:03:16.190> it's<00:03:16.370> just<00:03:16.519> a

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:16.699 
my polyline because it's just a

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:18.220 
my polyline because it's just a
two-dimensional<00:03:17.150> item<00:03:17.780> right<00:03:17.900> now<00:03:17.959> I'm<00:03:18.139> going

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
to convert it to a 3d molding polyline

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.439 
to convert it to a 3d molding polyline
this<00:03:21.769> will<00:03:21.949> allow<00:03:22.160> me<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.370> put<00:03:22.639> my<00:03:22.819> own<00:03:22.940> special

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.890 
just need to place it in our own beam so
that's<00:05:27.560> what<00:05:27.710> I'm<00:05:27.800> going<00:05:27.920> to<00:05:27.950> go<00:05:28.130> ahead<00:05:28.250> and<00:05:28.490> do

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
that's what I'm going to go ahead and do

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.420 
that's what I'm going to go ahead and do
using<00:05:29.900> my<00:05:30.050> elevation<00:05:30.470> tool<00:05:30.860> going<00:05:31.130> to<00:05:31.250> take<00:05:31.400> a

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
using my elevation tool going to take a

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.310 
using my elevation tool going to take a
cross-section<00:05:31.850> elevation<00:05:32.780> and<00:05:32.960> why<00:05:33.110> don't<00:05:33.170> we

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
cross-section elevation and why don't we

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.140 
cross-section elevation and why don't we
get<00:05:33.470> rid<00:05:33.530> of<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:33.830> 3d<00:05:34.190> view<00:05:34.430> so<00:05:34.670> the<00:05:34.820> computer

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
get rid of the 3d view so the computer

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.140 
get rid of the 3d view so the computer
doesn't<00:05:35.330> have<00:05:35.480> to<00:05:35.570> generate<00:05:35.930> so<00:05:36.200> much<00:05:36.730> and<00:05:37.730> I'm

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
doesn't have to generate so much and I'm

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.520 
doesn't have to generate so much and I'm
going<00:05:38.300> to<00:05:38.330> zoom<00:05:38.570> in<00:05:38.750> here<00:05:38.780> and<00:05:39.140> using<00:05:39.410> my

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
going to zoom in here and using my

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.070 
going to zoom in here and using my
polyline<00:05:40.160> solid<00:05:40.730> or<00:05:40.880> primitive<00:05:41.150> tool<00:05:41.690> I'm

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
polyline solid or primitive tool I'm

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.770 
polyline solid or primitive tool I'm
going<00:05:42.230> to<00:05:42.290> kind<00:05:42.500> of<00:05:42.560> start<00:05:42.980> where<00:05:43.280> I<00:05:43.310> see<00:05:43.780> your

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
going to kind of start where I see your

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.320 
going to kind of start where I see your
last<00:05:45.080> one<00:05:45.350> left<00:05:45.620> off<00:05:45.890> and<00:05:46.400> I'll<00:05:46.760> just<00:05:46.940> bring<00:05:47.180> it

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
last one left off and I'll just bring it

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.500 
last one left off and I'll just bring it
in<00:05:47.450> and<00:05:47.750> then<00:05:48.040> I<00:05:49.040> can<00:05:49.220> zoom<00:05:49.430> way<00:05:49.700> in<00:05:49.730> using<00:05:50.330> my

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
in and then I can zoom way in using my

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.090 
in and then I can zoom way in using my
roller<00:05:50.870> on<00:05:51.080> my<00:05:51.200> mouse<00:05:51.440> I'm<00:05:51.800> just<00:05:51.919> going<00:05:52.040> to

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
roller on my mouse I'm just going to

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.880 
roller on my mouse I'm just going to
zoom<00:05:52.310> way<00:05:52.550> in<00:05:52.580> and<00:05:53.030> reposition<00:05:53.900> this<00:05:54.080> to<00:05:54.770> where

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
zoom way in and reposition this to where

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.360 
zoom way in and reposition this to where
I<00:05:54.919> think<00:05:55.220> I<00:05:55.340> needed<00:05:55.610> to<00:05:55.730> be<00:05:56.860> there<00:05:57.860> we<00:05:58.010> go

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
I think I needed to be there we go

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.130 
I think I needed to be there we go
now<00:05:58.880> I<00:05:58.910> need<00:05:59.090> to<00:05:59.120> raise<00:05:59.330> up<00:05:59.540> my<00:05:59.690> post<00:05:59.840> a<00:06:00.020> little

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
now I need to raise up my post a little

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.960 
now I need to raise up my post a little
bit<00:06:00.320> more<00:06:00.530> but<00:06:00.680> before<00:06:01.010> I<00:06:01.040> do<00:06:01.160> that<00:06:01.310> I'm<00:06:01.790> going

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
bit more but before I do that I'm going

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.690 
bit more but before I do that I'm going
to<00:06:02.030> go<00:06:02.090> ahead<00:06:02.240> and<00:06:02.450> create<00:06:02.600> my<00:06:02.810> arch<00:06:03.700> so

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
to go ahead and create my arch so

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.340 
to go ahead and create my arch so
selecting<00:06:05.270> my<00:06:05.390> polyline<00:06:05.930> I'm<00:06:06.110> going<00:06:06.290> to

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
selecting my polyline I'm going to

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.990 
selecting my polyline I'm going to
actually<00:06:06.800> let's<00:06:06.980> open<00:06:07.130> up<00:06:07.400> and<00:06:07.610> make<00:06:07.640> it<00:06:07.880> the

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
actually let's open up and make it the

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.570 
actually let's open up and make it the
thickness<00:06:08.240> of<00:06:08.570> say<00:06:09.050> six<00:06:09.380> inches<00:06:09.650> thick<00:06:09.919> so<00:06:10.430> now

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
thickness of say six inches thick so now

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.030 
thickness of say six inches thick so now
it's<00:06:10.730> six<00:06:11.060> inches<00:06:11.390> thick<00:06:11.690> and<00:06:12.050> if<00:06:12.620> I<00:06:12.680> go<00:06:12.830> to<00:06:12.860> the

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040 
it's six inches thick and if I go to the

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.100 
it's six inches thick and if I go to the
3d<00:06:13.400> view<00:06:13.430> I<00:06:13.700> can<00:06:13.820> see<00:06:14.120> it's<00:06:14.270> back<00:06:14.570> here<00:06:14.840> on<00:06:14.960> this

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
3d view I can see it's back here on this

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.500 
3d view I can see it's back here on this
wall<00:06:15.440> so<00:06:15.770> I<00:06:15.800> can<00:06:16.040> grab<00:06:16.340> it<00:06:16.370> and<00:06:16.730> bring<00:06:17.480> it

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
wall so I can grab it and bring it

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.770 
wall so I can grab it and bring it
forward<00:06:17.900> and<00:06:18.640> it<00:06:19.640> might<00:06:19.790> not<00:06:19.820> line<00:06:20.240> up<00:06:20.480> or

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
forward and it might not line up or

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.780 
forward and it might not line up or
behave<00:06:21.230> the<00:06:21.440> way<00:06:21.560> I<00:06:21.590> wish<00:06:21.919> it<00:06:22.100> to<00:06:22.280> so<00:06:22.580> I'm<00:06:22.669> just

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790 
behave the way I wish it to so I'm just

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.280 
behave the way I wish it to so I'm just
going<00:06:22.970> to<00:06:23.060> kind<00:06:23.270> of<00:06:23.300> have<00:06:23.419> to<00:06:23.540> force<00:06:23.960> it<00:06:24.140> in

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
going to kind of have to force it in

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.190 
going to kind of have to force it in
where<00:06:24.530> I<00:06:24.560> want<00:06:25.270> back<00:06:26.270> up<00:06:26.600> so<00:06:26.870> if<00:06:26.930> everything

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
where I want back up so if everything

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.010 
where I want back up so if everything
else<00:06:27.410> is<00:06:27.650> pretty<00:06:27.890> good<00:06:28.600> still<00:06:29.600> not<00:06:29.750> touching

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
else is pretty good still not touching

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.110 
else is pretty good still not touching
so<00:06:30.590> because<00:06:30.830> I<00:06:30.919> think<00:06:30.950> I<00:06:31.220> moved<00:06:31.520> it<00:06:31.760> out<00:06:31.910> of<00:06:32.030> the

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
so because I think I moved it out of the

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.230 
so because I think I moved it out of the
way<00:06:32.350> I'm<00:06:33.350> going<00:06:33.500> to<00:06:33.560> plaster<00:06:34.490> it<00:06:34.610> in<00:06:34.729> there

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
way I'm going to plaster it in there

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.030 
way I'm going to plaster it in there
now<00:06:36.240> even<00:06:36.540> grab<00:06:36.900> my<00:06:37.110> eye<00:06:37.140> drop<00:06:37.530> or<00:06:37.710> grab<00:06:37.860> the

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
now even grab my eye drop or grab the

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.070 
now even grab my eye drop or grab the
blue<00:06:38.250> and<00:06:38.430> apply<00:06:38.730> it<00:06:38.790> there<00:06:39.090> all<00:06:39.510> looks<00:06:39.810> good

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
blue and apply it there all looks good

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.220 
blue and apply it there all looks good
okay<00:06:40.740> so<00:06:41.430> now<00:06:41.670> I've<00:06:41.820> selected<00:06:42.000> this<00:06:42.450> edge<00:06:42.780> and

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230 
okay so now I've selected this edge and

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.960 
okay so now I've selected this edge and
what<00:06:43.650> I<00:06:43.680> want<00:06:43.890> to<00:06:43.950> do<00:06:44.070> is<00:06:44.220> I<00:06:44.310> want<00:06:44.520> to<00:06:44.610> now<00:06:44.700> go<00:06:44.910> to

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
my cut tool of my break line tool it's

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.920 
my cut tool of my break line tool it's
also<00:06:47.370> the<00:06:47.610> number<00:06:47.790> three<00:06:48.180> on<00:06:48.330> the<00:06:48.450> keyboards

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.290 
using my crosshairs kind of line up

using my crosshairs kind of line up
where<00:06:55.440> I<00:06:55.470> want<00:06:55.620> to<00:06:55.740> cut<00:06:55.950> it<00:06:56.100> want<00:06:56.310> to<00:06:56.370> cut<00:06:56.520> it
