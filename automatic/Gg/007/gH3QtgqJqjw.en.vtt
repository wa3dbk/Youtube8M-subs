00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.990
 physical in the one presents its 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.119
 experiments a series of experiences 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.710
 that will make you think about how physics 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.279
 can explain things that happen to your 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.939
 around 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.110
 today we propose the following situation 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.150
 because the illumination of a metal plate 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.340
 we can pull electrons out of their 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.310
 interior we use the following assembly 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.470
 to understand the effect 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.270
 in this vacuum sealed blister we have 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.910
 two metal plates separated by a 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.739
 distance a plate is facing 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.360
 a series of LEDs that emit light 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.730
 different frequencies and different 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.710
 intensities that we can control at 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.589
 light emitting electrons from a plate 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.150
 they jump into the void and from there to the other the 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.280
 two plates are connected to a 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.780
 circuit so that we can detect the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.670
 intensity of the current that returns 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.500
 the electrons to their place also 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.870
 we can change the electric potential 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.690
 which is the second plate so 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.610
 reject the electrons that arrive before 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.409
 to start we insulate the plate of light 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.110
 environment as our experiment is 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.700
 sensitive electromagnetic radiation 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.799
 the photoelectric effect was a great 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.900
 problem at the beginning of the 20th century the 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.159
 classical theory predicted that the older 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.170
 it was the intensity of the light that 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.659
 we emitted more must be the current 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.850
 produced however the reality is 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.680
 much more complex by increasing the 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.960
 intensity of light we see how it increases 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.580
 the intensity of the current but only 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.250
 for some colors of light by 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.259
 over a frequency is more to 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.289
 change the color the electrical intensity 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.090
 it also varies radically, it is clear 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.700
 increase in the frequency of light 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.469
 the electrical intensity to be able 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.810
 understand this phenomenon was needed 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.700
 accept a fact light in an entity 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.609
 continuous but it was constituted by 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.979
 discrete particles called photons the 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.270
 energy of each photon depended only 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.850
 of the frequency of light that 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.649
 characterized this is an intuitive idea 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.149
 of what happens if to a plate the 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.859
 we started to bomb with these 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.359
 energy packages many of the 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.189
 electrons that make it up will look 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:03.229
 excited reached the point that some 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.209
 the material will fall off so 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.009
 we can measure is that only one reached 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.140
 certain energy we can see that it 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.459
 produces current that is only if 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.170
 we emit light over a 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.730
 certain frequency we can 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.250
 get to pull electrons from 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.890
 material at this frequency to the limit it 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.720
 called threshold frequency we can 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.640
 increase the threshold frequency by adding 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.379
 a potential on a plate with this 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.299
 we will need a higher frequency 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.430
 so that the electrons can overcome 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.349
