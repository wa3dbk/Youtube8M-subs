00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
get this wig and you wear it on a daily

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.719 
get this wig and you wear it on a daily
basis<00:03:41.319> you<00:03:41.470> will<00:03:41.680> get<00:03:41.889> some<00:03:42.099> tangling<00:03:42.579> you

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:42.729 
basis you will get some tangling you

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.159 
basis you will get some tangling you
probably<00:03:43.060> get<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.239> little<00:03:43.419> bit<00:03:43.540> more<00:03:43.659> shedding

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
probably get a little bit more shedding

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.869 
probably get a little bit more shedding
which<00:03:44.680> I<00:03:44.829> didn't<00:03:45.010> get<00:03:45.129> over<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.340> lot<00:03:45.459> of<00:03:45.489> Shannon

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
if you comb through it then you probably

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.080 
if you comb through it then you probably
will<00:03:49.959> get<00:03:50.169> some<00:03:50.379> shedding<00:03:50.739> so<00:03:51.040> overall<00:03:51.849> this

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
will get some shedding so overall this
