along i'll start saving these which i

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.790 
along i'll start saving these which i
haven't<00:00:16.350> mentioned<00:00:16.500> before<00:00:16.920> as<00:00:18.320> demo<00:00:19.320> 1<00:00:19.590> 2<00:00:19.770> 3

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
haven't mentioned before as demo 1 2 3

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.800 
haven't mentioned before as demo 1 2 3
and<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:22.430> at<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.670> point<00:00:23.939> i<00:00:24.090> want<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.390> start

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
and so on at this point i want to start

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.769 
and so on at this point i want to start
actually<00:00:25.800> want<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:27.109> play<00:00:28.109> around<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:29.779> this

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
actually want to play around with this

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.750 
actually want to play around with this
side<00:00:31.140> which<00:00:31.439> would<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.920> i<00:00:32.189> guess<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:32.969> side

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
side which would be i guess the one side

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:44.130 
side which would be i guess the one side
for<00:00:35.760> some<00:00:35.880> reason<00:00:36.180> we're<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> little<00:00:36.480> warm<00:00:36.809> here

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.080 

let's<00:00:45.140> try<00:00:45.290> to<00:00:45.380> make<00:00:45.560> that<00:00:45.710> cool<00:00:46.100> instead

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.500 

not<00:00:51.600> cool<00:00:51.900> yet

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.390 

that's<00:00:56.140> a<00:00:56.260> little<00:00:56.350> cooler

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
that's a little cooler

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.270 
that's a little cooler
ok

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
ok

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.959 
ok
so<00:01:00.879> we<00:01:01.390> have<00:01:01.600> our<00:01:01.870> highlight<00:01:02.739> so<00:01:03.460> generally

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
so we have our highlight so generally

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.460 
so we have our highlight so generally
like<00:01:04.479> i<00:01:04.629> said<00:01:04.960> i'm<00:01:05.170> not<00:01:05.199> sure<00:01:05.560> where<00:01:05.770> that

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
like i said i'm not sure where that

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.039 
like i said i'm not sure where that
we're<00:01:08.470> with<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.740> spotlight<00:01:09.220> is<00:01:09.369> there<00:01:09.729> it<00:01:09.850> is

we're with the spotlight is there it is

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.359 
we're with the spotlight is there it is
lights<00:01:11.049> going<00:01:11.229> to<00:01:11.320> hit<00:01:11.560> about<00:01:11.979> in<00:01:12.220> this

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
lights going to hit about in this

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:19.109 
lights going to hit about in this
general<00:01:12.729> area<00:01:12.970> and<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:18.460> can<00:01:18.640> see<00:01:18.909> where<00:01:19.090> our

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
general area and you can see where our

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.380 
general area and you can see where our
eye<00:01:19.330> is<00:01:19.390> drawn<00:01:19.840> to<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.460> come<00:01:24.729> in<00:01:24.850> here<00:01:25.180> and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
eye is drawn to and come in here and

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.920 
eye is drawn to and come in here and
erase<00:01:25.840> out<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.350> parts<00:01:26.740> that

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.120 

aren't<00:01:31.650> supposed<00:01:31.980> to<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.160> lit<00:01:32.460> up<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.800> see

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
aren't supposed to be lit up so you see

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.030 
aren't supposed to be lit up so you see
here<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.760> have<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.060> visor<00:01:36.330> and<00:01:38.750> obviously<00:01:40.040> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
here we have the visor and obviously the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.710 
here we have the visor and obviously the
visor<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.610> going<00:01:41.760> to<00:01:41.820> leave<00:01:42.030> us<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.480> little

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
visor is going to leave us with a little

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.100 
visor is going to leave us with a little
cash<00:01:42.990> shadow<00:01:44.540> right<00:01:45.540> about<00:01:46.200> there<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:48.720> also

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
cash shadow right about there and also

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.340 
cash shadow right about there and also
it<00:01:49.440> drew<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:49.950> cast<00:01:50.310> shadow<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.960> right

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
it drew in the cast shadow so right

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.719 
it drew in the cast shadow so right
about<00:01:52.530> there<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:57.080> where<00:01:58.080> we're<00:01:58.320> left<00:01:58.729> also

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
about there is where we're left also

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.700 
about there is where we're left also
sketched<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.420> right<00:02:00.630> here<00:02:01.140> where<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:04.320> form

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
sketched in right here where the form

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.700 
sketched in right here where the form
actually<00:02:04.979> comes<00:02:05.490> off<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.119> glass<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:07.590> I

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
actually comes off of the glass and I

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.320 
actually comes off of the glass and I
might<00:02:07.950> try<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> stay<00:02:08.580> close<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.149> glass

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
might try to stay close to the glass

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.230 
might try to stay close to the glass
here

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.750 

and<00:02:13.390> start<00:02:13.930> with<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.230> little<00:02:14.410> cash<00:02:15.070> shadow<00:02:15.550> on

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
and start with a little cash shadow on

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.140 
and start with a little cash shadow on
this<00:02:15.970> part

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
this part

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.890 
this part
back<00:02:18.930> here<00:02:19.260> i'm<00:02:19.500> just<00:02:19.680> going<00:02:19.799> to<00:02:19.829> race<00:02:20.069> out

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
back here i'm just going to race out

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.970 
back here i'm just going to race out
worry<00:02:21.900> about<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.290> too<00:02:22.470> much<00:02:22.500> actually<00:02:24.980> come

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
worry about it too much actually come

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.280 
worry about it too much actually come
back<00:02:26.189> this<00:02:27.000> window<00:02:27.420> might<00:02:27.629> pick<00:02:27.870> up<00:02:28.019> some<00:02:28.049> of

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
back this window might pick up some of

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.630 
back this window might pick up some of
the<00:02:28.379> light<00:02:28.500> here<00:02:28.769> so<00:02:29.010> i<00:02:29.040> might<00:02:29.189> as<00:02:29.220> well<00:02:29.340> take

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
the light here so i might as well take

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.569 
the light here so i might as well take
advantage<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.829> over<00:02:31.829> spray<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.519> just

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
advantage of that over spray and just

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.300 
advantage of that over spray and just
use<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.209> as<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.450> highlight<00:02:34.220> obviously<00:02:35.220> this

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
use it as the highlight obviously this

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.220 
use it as the highlight obviously this
is<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.519> dark<00:02:35.760> vent<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.629> that<00:02:37.230> is<00:02:37.530> gone<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:39.230> i

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
is a dark vent so that is gone and i

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.949 
is a dark vent so that is gone and i
think<00:02:40.650> right<00:02:40.950> here<00:02:41.220> i'm<00:02:42.030> going<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.329> try<00:02:42.569> for<00:02:42.659> a

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
think right here i'm going to try for a

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.619 
think right here i'm going to try for a
sharper<00:02:43.530> break<00:02:43.799> that's<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.849> really<00:02:45.180> detailed

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
sharper break that's a really detailed

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.649 
sharper break that's a really detailed
area<00:02:46.409> you<00:02:47.129> go<00:02:47.250> back<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.700> path<00:02:47.909> layer<00:02:48.209> start

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
area you go back to the path layer start

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.080 
area you go back to the path layer start
a<00:02:48.750> new<00:02:48.900> path<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.620> do<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.639> same<00:02:50.849> thing<00:02:51.209> just

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
a new path and do the same thing just

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.460 
a new path and do the same thing just
trace<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.299> lines<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.810> can<00:02:54.870> still<00:02:55.230> see

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
trace the lines you can still see

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.660 
trace the lines you can still see
sketched<00:02:55.829> in<00:02:56.069> there

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:07.420 

make<00:03:00.670> sure<00:03:00.700> we<00:03:01.240> are<00:03:01.620> lined<00:03:02.620> up<00:03:02.860> here

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.170 

maybe<00:03:08.430> were<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.670> little<00:03:08.940> bit<00:03:09.209> off<00:03:09.360> there<00:03:11.180> there

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
maybe were a little bit off there there

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.259 
maybe were a little bit off there there
we<00:03:12.269> go<00:03:13.220> hit<00:03:14.220> command<00:03:14.700> click<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:17.120> just<00:03:18.120> going

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
we go hit command click and just going

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.589 
we go hit command click and just going
to<00:03:18.330> delete<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.810> out<00:03:18.959> completely<00:03:20.209> now<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.450> looks

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
to delete it out completely now it looks

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.140 
to delete it out completely now it looks
like<00:03:21.750> we<00:03:22.110> got<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.290> highlight<00:03:22.769> here<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.400> this

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
like we got a highlight here and this

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.240 
like we got a highlight here and this
part<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.720> doesn't<00:03:24.930> catch<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.410> light<00:03:25.590> you

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
part that doesn't catch the light you

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.910 
part that doesn't catch the light you
see<00:03:26.489> directly<00:03:27.000> through<00:03:27.569> to<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.140> interior<00:03:28.440> and

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
see directly through to the interior and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.589 
see directly through to the interior and
then<00:03:29.430> at<00:03:29.580> some<00:03:29.730> point<00:03:29.790> I'm<00:03:30.180> going<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.390> bring<00:03:30.540> a

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
then at some point I'm going to bring a

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.170 
then at some point I'm going to bring a
shield<00:03:31.019> here<00:03:31.319> and<00:03:32.150> some<00:03:34.489> material<00:03:35.489> indication

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
shield here and some material indication

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.640 
shield here and some material indication
so<00:03:37.019> this<00:03:37.170> edge<00:03:37.379> here<00:03:37.410> obviously<00:03:38.630> I<00:03:39.630> don't<00:03:40.290> want

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
so this edge here obviously I don't want

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.809 
so this edge here obviously I don't want
to<00:03:41.220> really<00:03:44.660> look<00:03:45.660> like<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.930> sharp<00:03:46.440> edge<00:03:46.790> when<00:03:47.790> I

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
to really look like a sharp edge when I

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.910 
to really look like a sharp edge when I
make<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.239> look<00:03:48.420> like<00:03:48.599> it's<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.200> refined<00:03:49.650> edge

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
make it look like it's a refined edge

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.199 
make it look like it's a refined edge
with<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.190> little<00:03:50.640> bit<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.970> radius<00:03:52.010> so<00:03:53.209> let's

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
with a little bit of a radius so let's

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.130 
with a little bit of a radius so let's
look<00:03:54.329> for<00:03:54.599> this<00:03:54.690> layer<00:03:54.900> there<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.380> is<00:03:57.140> also

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
look for this layer there it is also

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.880 
look for this layer there it is also
here

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.090 

I'm<00:04:02.220> going<00:04:02.520> to<00:04:02.610> erase<00:04:03.300> out<00:04:03.600> a<00:04:04.050> little<00:04:04.710> bit<00:04:04.890> of<00:04:04.950> a

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
I'm going to erase out a little bit of a

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.700 
I'm going to erase out a little bit of a
highlight<00:04:05.520> overspray<00:04:06.090> up<00:04:06.270> here

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.570 

here<00:04:11.220> we<00:04:11.310> go

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
here we go

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:19.620 
here we go
a<00:04:12.610> little<00:04:13.270> bit<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.480> little<00:04:13.750> bit<00:04:14.170> of<00:04:14.350> it<00:04:14.470> there

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.620 

almost<00:04:20.170> just<00:04:21.100> go<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:21.310> little<00:04:21.610> bit<00:04:21.850> lighter<00:04:22.090> and

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.120 

switch<00:04:25.630> back<00:04:25.870> to<00:04:25.900> my<00:04:26.050> other<00:04:26.290> brush<00:04:26.650> which<00:04:26.950> is

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
switch back to my other brush which is

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.590 
switch back to my other brush which is
which<00:04:27.430> isn't<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:27.910> airbrush<00:04:29.910> start<00:04:30.910> with<00:04:31.150> the

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
which isn't the airbrush start with the

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.770 
which isn't the airbrush start with the
highlight<00:04:32.140> to<00:04:32.500> be<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.710> edge<00:04:32.890> a<00:04:33.340> good<00:04:34.300> window

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
highlight to be the edge a good window

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.740 
highlight to be the edge a good window
or<00:04:34.960> it<00:04:35.080> rolls<00:04:35.320> over<00:04:38.820> so<00:04:39.820> theoretically

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
or it rolls over so theoretically

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.660 
or it rolls over so theoretically
there's<00:04:40.960> a<00:04:41.020> little<00:04:41.290> little<00:04:42.040> edge<00:04:42.280> rolled

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
there's a little little edge rolled

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:48.170 
there's a little little edge rolled
there<00:04:42.970> and<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:44.050> would<00:04:44.260> catch<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.560> light<00:04:45.010> and

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.850 

we<00:04:49.180> just<00:04:49.360> carefully<00:04:50.790> freehand<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:53.080> line<00:04:53.380> i'm

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
we just carefully freehand the line i'm

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.340 
we just carefully freehand the line i'm
using<00:04:54.340> it<00:04:54.430> into<00:04:54.700> a<00:04:54.730> three<00:04:55.660> here<00:04:55.930> i've<00:04:56.050> had<00:04:56.230> it

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
using it into a three here i've had it

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.040 
using it into a three here i've had it
for<00:04:56.410> a<00:04:56.590> few<00:04:56.620> years<00:04:56.830> and<00:04:57.510> have<00:04:58.510> really<00:04:58.870> gotten

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
for a few years and have really gotten

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.380 
for a few years and have really gotten
comfortable<00:04:59.350> with<00:05:01.290> making<00:05:02.290> lines<00:05:02.740> i<00:05:03.700> think

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
comfortable with making lines i think

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.020 
comfortable with making lines i think
when<00:05:04.480> i<00:05:04.510> first<00:05:04.870> started<00:05:05.050> using<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.770> Intuos<00:05:06.250> i

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
when i first started using the Intuos i

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.590 
when i first started using the Intuos i
put<00:05:07.720> a<00:05:07.750> sheet<00:05:08.110> of<00:05:08.280> tracing<00:05:09.280> paper<00:05:09.490> on<00:05:09.940> top<00:05:10.390> of

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
put a sheet of tracing paper on top of

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.030 
put a sheet of tracing paper on top of
the<00:05:10.720> into<00:05:11.020> it<00:05:11.200> so<00:05:11.350> it<00:05:11.440> didn't<00:05:11.680> seem<00:05:11.830> so

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
the into it so it didn't seem so

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.970 
the into it so it didn't seem so
slippery<00:05:12.430> and<00:05:13.350> after<00:05:14.350> a<00:05:14.380> while<00:05:14.620> I<00:05:14.680> got<00:05:14.950> used<00:05:15.310> to

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
slippery and after a while I got used to

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.640 
slippery and after a while I got used to
sketching<00:05:17.980> on<00:05:18.280> a<00:05:18.340> plastic<00:05:18.970> surface<00:05:19.650> some

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
sketching on a plastic surface some

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.050 
sketching on a plastic surface some
people<00:05:20.950> it<00:05:21.040> takes<00:05:21.160> a<00:05:21.310> little<00:05:21.460> getting<00:05:21.580> used<00:05:21.970> to

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
people it takes a little getting used to

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.860 
people it takes a little getting used to
but<00:05:22.150> it<00:05:22.540> shouldn't<00:05:23.020> be<00:05:23.080> too<00:05:23.260> hard<00:05:24.480> alright<00:05:25.480> so

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
but it shouldn't be too hard alright so

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.890 
but it shouldn't be too hard alright so
we<00:05:26.020> have<00:05:26.140> that<00:05:26.290> in<00:05:26.350> there<00:05:26.590> and<00:05:27.450> you<00:05:28.450> zoom<00:05:28.660> out

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
we have that in there and you zoom out

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.360 
we have that in there and you zoom out
you<00:05:29.700> can<00:05:30.700> see<00:05:30.880> your<00:05:31.060> highlight<00:05:32.010> it's<00:05:33.010> a<00:05:33.130> little

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
you can see your highlight it's a little

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.300 
you can see your highlight it's a little
bit<00:05:33.700> too<00:05:34.030> dark<00:05:34.500> so<00:05:35.500> I'm<00:05:35.590> going<00:05:35.770> to<00:05:35.800> come<00:05:36.040> in

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
bit too dark so I'm going to come in

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.700 
bit too dark so I'm going to come in
with<00:05:36.550> another<00:05:37.300> lighter<00:05:37.660> shade

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:50.090 

just<00:05:43.710> inside<00:05:46.640> shaded<00:05:47.640> somewhere

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.950 

so<00:05:50.640> again<00:05:50.960> my<00:05:51.960> method<00:05:52.650> is<00:05:52.920> to<00:05:54.320> build<00:05:55.320> up<00:05:55.590> slowly

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
so again my method is to build up slowly

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.890 
so again my method is to build up slowly
to<00:05:57.960> the<00:05:57.990> lightest<00:05:58.650> shade<00:05:59.420> so<00:06:00.420> I'm<00:06:00.510> not<00:06:00.630> to<00:06:00.750> go

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
to the lightest shade so I'm not to go

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:08.070 
to the lightest shade so I'm not to go
back<00:06:01.140> and<00:06:02.690> fix<00:06:03.690> things<00:06:03.930> too<00:06:04.290> much

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.219 

we<00:06:08.620> erase<00:06:08.860> that<00:06:09.099> out<00:06:09.659> Reese<00:06:10.659> off<00:06:10.900> the<00:06:11.020> cast

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
we erase that out Reese off the cast

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:14.219 
we erase that out Reese off the cast
shadow<00:06:11.439> we<00:06:12.129> got<00:06:12.310> ourselves<00:06:12.490> a<00:06:13.240> nice<00:06:13.960> little

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
shadow we got ourselves a nice little

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:18.320 
shadow we got ourselves a nice little
highlight<00:06:14.860> on<00:06:15.069> this<00:06:15.280> edge<00:06:15.520> and<00:06:16.289> it<00:06:17.289> might<00:06:17.469> just

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
highlight on this edge and it might just

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:24.689 
highlight on this edge and it might just
come<00:06:19.330> back<00:06:19.539> down<00:06:19.870> here<00:06:21.990> try<00:06:22.990> to<00:06:23.460> trail<00:06:24.460> it

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
come back down here try to trail it

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:28.110 
come back down here try to trail it
around<00:06:25.090> the<00:06:25.330> edge<00:06:25.509> a<00:06:25.780> little<00:06:25.810> bit<00:06:26.139> here<00:06:27.120> not

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
around the edge a little bit here not

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.469 
around the edge a little bit here not
that<00:06:28.330> it<00:06:28.419> would<00:06:28.509> catch<00:06:28.750> that<00:06:29.080> much<00:06:29.349> but<00:06:30.479> again

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
that it would catch that much but again

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.270 
that it would catch that much but again
that's<00:06:31.750> that's<00:06:32.080> a<00:06:32.199> really<00:06:32.439> strong<00:06:32.830> part<00:06:33.219> of

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
that's that's a really strong part of

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.149 
that's that's a really strong part of
the<00:06:33.370> design<00:06:33.580> so<00:06:34.150> I<00:06:34.449> want<00:06:34.960> people<00:06:35.319> it's<00:06:35.469> I<00:06:35.740> to<00:06:35.800> go

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:36.159 
the design so I want people it's I to go

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:41.689 
the design so I want people it's I to go
to<00:06:36.219> it<00:06:36.610> when<00:06:37.539> they<00:06:37.949> look<00:06:38.949> at<00:06:39.039> this<00:06:39.250> first<00:06:39.969> I

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
to it when they look at this first I

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:45.419 
to it when they look at this first I
might<00:06:42.699> draw<00:06:43.090> it<00:06:43.210> around
