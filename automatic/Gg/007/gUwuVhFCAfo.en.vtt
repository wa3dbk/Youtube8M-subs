I'm<00:01:50.670> sure<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.180> knew<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.509> one<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.780> coming<00:01:53.420> as

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
I'm sure you knew that one was coming as

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.420 
I'm sure you knew that one was coming as
you<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:54.750> probably<00:01:54.960> tell<00:01:55.079> by<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.380> point<00:01:55.680> my

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
you can probably tell by this point my

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.749 
you can probably tell by this point my
goal<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.090> nothing<00:01:58.020> smaller<00:01:58.530> than<00:01:58.759> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
goal is nothing smaller than the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.639 
goal is nothing smaller than the
complete<00:02:00.210> conquest<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.770> Celtic<00:02:02.310> Empire

complete conquest of the Celtic Empire
and<00:02:05.479> that<00:02:06.479> might<00:02:06.659> sound<00:02:06.869> like<00:02:07.049> an<00:02:07.229> ambitious

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and that might sound like an ambitious

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.999 
and that might sound like an ambitious
goal<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:09.140> look<00:02:10.140> how<00:02:10.349> we've<00:02:10.530> done<00:02:10.709> so

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
goal to you but look how we've done so

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.970

and that's even with having to fight the
Mongols<00:02:14.560> most<00:02:15.129> of<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.370> time<00:02:17.849> thus<00:02:18.849> helps<00:02:19.180> days

secondary railroad here might now

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.009 
secondary railroad here might now
finally<00:02:52.450> be<00:02:52.569> finished<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.690> i'm<00:02:55.810> going<00:02:55.959> to

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
connected by railroads and that won't be

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.750 
connected by railroads and that won't be
too<00:03:09.760> hard<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.120> do<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:13.769> all<00:03:14.769> these<00:03:15.099> workers<00:03:15.489> were

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
too hard to do so all these workers were

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.080 
too hard to do so all these workers were
going<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.090> be<00:03:17.019> sending<00:03:17.349> to<00:03:17.880> build<00:03:18.880> more

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
going to be sending to build more

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:28.740 
going to be sending to build more
railroads<00:03:23.760> all<00:03:24.760> right<00:03:27.269> we<00:03:28.269> also<00:03:28.450> want<00:03:28.690> to

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
railroads all right we also want to

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.559 
railroads all right we also want to
finish<00:03:28.900> this<00:03:29.079> one<00:03:29.290> up

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.589 

still<00:03:33.499> a<00:03:33.530> lot<00:03:33.680> of<00:03:33.739> work<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.159> do<00:03:34.370> so<00:03:35.269> that's<00:03:35.420> time

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
still a lot of work to do so that's time

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.349 
still a lot of work to do so that's time
to<00:03:35.780> send<00:03:36.019> at<00:03:36.950> least<00:03:37.010> some<00:03:37.370> guys<00:03:37.579> down<00:03:37.939> to<00:03:37.999> the

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
to send at least some guys down to the

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.890 
to send at least some guys down to the
main<00:03:39.200> part<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:39.680> my<00:03:39.799> Empire<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.780> work<00:03:41.780> on

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
main part of my Empire to work on

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.679 
main part of my Empire to work on
railroads<00:03:42.319> and<00:03:42.499> other<00:03:42.620> cities<00:03:43.329> all<00:03:44.329> right

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
railroads and other cities all right

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.879 
railroads and other cities all right
it's<00:03:45.019> now<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.260> AI<00:03:45.590> is<00:03:45.769> turn<00:03:47.349> again<00:03:48.349> we<00:03:48.530> see<00:03:48.739> the

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
it's now the AI is turn again we see the

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.729 
it's now the AI is turn again we see the
Germans<00:03:49.219> moving<00:03:49.609> I<00:03:49.900> just<00:03:50.900> gave<00:03:51.139> the<00:03:51.379> Korean

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
Germans moving I just gave the Korean

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.199 
Germans moving I just gave the Korean
soil<00:03:51.980> so<00:03:52.280> it'd<00:03:52.340> probably<00:03:52.519> be<00:03:52.700> a<00:03:52.790> few<00:03:52.879> more

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
soil so it'd probably be a few more

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.990 
soil so it'd probably be a few more
terms<00:03:53.450> until<00:03:53.750> they<00:03:54.159> really<00:03:55.159> have<00:03:55.340> tanks<00:03:55.730> again

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
terms until they really have tanks again

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.559 
terms until they really have tanks again
but<00:03:56.269> at<00:03:57.260> least<00:03:57.379> the<00:03:57.590> beginning<00:03:57.980> of<00:03:58.159> their

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
but at least the beginning of their

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.569 
but at least the beginning of their
fight<00:03:59.569> back<00:03:59.810> is<00:04:00.019> happening<00:04:00.439> so<00:04:01.219> you<00:04:01.310> can<00:04:01.430> see

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
fight back is happening so you can see

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.690 
fight back is happening so you can see
on<00:04:01.730> that<00:04:01.909> square<00:04:02.359> above<00:04:03.019> p<00:04:03.290> on<00:04:03.409> tongue<00:04:03.739> that's

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
on that square above p on tongue that's

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.449 
on that square above p on tongue that's
oil<00:04:05.799> that<00:04:06.799> was<00:04:06.889> probably<00:04:07.069> one<00:04:07.280> of<00:04:07.310> their

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
oil that was probably one of their

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.220 
oil that was probably one of their
sources<00:04:07.760> that<00:04:08.180> they<00:04:08.329> were<00:04:08.389> using<00:04:08.659> perhaps

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
sources that they were using perhaps

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.500 
sources that they were using perhaps
your<00:04:09.409> only<00:04:09.530> source<00:04:10.060> so<00:04:11.060> now<00:04:11.269> that<00:04:11.299> that's

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
your only source so now that that's

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.030 
your only source so now that that's
disconnected<00:04:12.079> they<00:04:12.319> have<00:04:12.439> to<00:04:12.530> rely<00:04:12.739> on<00:04:12.859> us<00:04:13.010> for

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
disconnected they have to rely on us for

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.089 
disconnected they have to rely on us for
their<00:04:13.370> oil<00:04:14.530> all<00:04:15.530> right<00:04:16.539> so<00:04:17.769> looks<00:04:18.769> like<00:04:18.859> the

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
their oil all right so looks like the

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.629 
their oil all right so looks like the
Chinese<00:04:19.459> are<00:04:19.789> under<00:04:20.120> attack<00:04:20.320> from<00:04:21.639> sounds

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
Chinese are under attack from sounds

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.659 
Chinese are under attack from sounds
there<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.270> this<00:04:23.570> helps<00:04:23.870> come<00:04:24.050> up<00:04:24.199> but<00:04:24.669> how

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
there and this helps come up but how

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.969 
there and this helps come up but how
afraid<00:04:25.970> am<00:04:26.180> I<00:04:26.270> really<00:04:26.630> about<00:04:26.810> those<00:04:27.050> guys<00:04:27.259> not

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
afraid am I really about those guys not

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.050 
afraid am I really about those guys not

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
much one comes out of lindum but I doubt

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.749 
much one comes out of lindum but I doubt
he'll<00:04:32.479> do<00:04:32.750> that<00:04:33.710> much<00:04:33.919> damage<00:04:33.949> to<00:04:34.340> really

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
he'll do that much damage to really

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.730 
he'll do that much damage to really

good thing all right back to us once
again<00:04:55.330> now<00:04:56.330> that<00:04:56.360> we're<00:04:56.720> not<00:04:56.870> fighting<00:04:57.409> the

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
again now that we're not fighting the

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.200 
again now that we're not fighting the
Mongol<00:04:57.889> anymore<00:04:58.250> I<00:04:58.430> know<00:04:58.550> I<00:04:58.639> said<00:04:58.880> our<00:04:58.970> terms

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
Mongol anymore I know I said our terms

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.730 
Mongol anymore I know I said our terms
are<00:04:59.360> getting<00:04:59.539> a<00:04:59.599> slightly<00:04:59.840> shorter<00:04:59.960> which<00:05:00.560> is

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
are getting a slightly shorter which is

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.770 
are getting a slightly shorter which is
a<00:05:00.770> good<00:05:00.949> thing<00:05:01.009> it<00:05:02.000> means<00:05:02.150> this<00:05:02.330> game<00:05:02.419> is<00:05:02.659> going

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
a good thing it means this game is going

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.230 
a good thing it means this game is going
to<00:05:02.870> move<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:03.080> little<00:05:03.229> faster<00:05:04.210> instead<00:05:05.210> of

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
to move a little faster instead of

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.760 
to move a little faster instead of
taking<00:05:05.599> ten<00:05:05.750> minutes<00:05:05.780> for<00:05:06.050> a<00:05:06.169> turn<00:05:06.320> it<00:05:06.560> might

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
taking ten minutes for a turn it might

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.760 
taking ten minutes for a turn it might
only<00:05:06.889> take<00:05:07.039> eight<00:05:08.229> so<00:05:09.229> that's<00:05:09.470> good<00:05:10.449> so<00:05:11.449> we'll

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
only take eight so that's good so we'll

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.990 
only take eight so that's good so we'll
set<00:05:12.770> these<00:05:13.009> troops<00:05:13.280> have<00:05:13.400> to<00:05:13.490> automate<00:05:13.820> that

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
set these troops have to automate that

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.800 
set these troops have to automate that
city<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:14.599> if<00:05:15.259> you<00:05:15.380> haven't<00:05:15.740> guessed<00:05:16.240> yes<00:05:17.240> that

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
city and if you haven't guessed yes that

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
is it really safe to settle cities so

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.040 
is it really safe to settle cities so
close<00:06:37.479> together<00:06:37.659> and<00:06:38.379> I<00:06:39.249> would<00:06:39.909> say<00:06:40.180> if<00:06:40.449> their

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
close together and I would say if their

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.529 
close together and I would say if their
work<00:06:41.199> or<00:06:41.409> cities<00:06:41.800> no<00:06:42.159> it<00:06:42.370> would<00:06:42.520> be<00:06:42.639> bad<00:06:42.939> but

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539 
work or cities no it would be bad but

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:45.059 
work or cities no it would be bad but
since<00:06:43.779> they're<00:06:43.990> all<00:06:44.110> the<00:06:44.199> way<00:06:44.319> out<00:06:44.349> here<00:06:44.499> it

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:45.069 
since they're all the way out here it

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:48.029 
since they're all the way out here it
doesn't<00:06:45.099> matter<00:06:45.459> too<00:06:45.639> much<00:06:45.669> besides<00:06:47.039> sometime

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 
doesn't matter too much besides sometime

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:49.439 
doesn't matter too much besides sometime
in<00:06:48.159> the<00:06:48.219> future<00:06:48.369> I<00:06:48.550> think<00:06:48.699> I<00:06:48.969> might<00:06:49.149> want<00:06:49.330> to

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449 
in the future I think I might want to

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:52.499 
in the future I think I might want to
get<00:06:49.539> a<00:06:49.599> forbidden<00:06:50.050> palace<00:06:50.259> up<00:06:50.620> here<00:06:51.330> to<00:06:52.330> try

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:52.509 
get a forbidden palace up here to try
