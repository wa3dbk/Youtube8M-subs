00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
transformation especially with our

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.190 
transformation especially with our
year-long<00:02:27.410> curriculum<00:02:28.299> it's<00:02:29.299> it's<00:02:29.660> more<00:02:29.989> than

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
year-long curriculum it's it's more than

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.220 
year-long curriculum it's it's more than
just<00:02:30.280> they<00:02:31.280> get<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.579> perform<00:02:31.940> but<00:02:32.389> it's<00:02:32.569> it's

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
just they get to perform but it's it's

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.870 
just they get to perform but it's it's
actually<00:02:33.650> going<00:02:33.829> into<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.310> art<00:02:34.489> so<00:02:34.760> that's

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
actually going into the art so that's

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.580 
actually going into the art so that's
why<00:02:35.090> we<00:02:35.239> have<00:02:35.389> a<00:02:35.419> live<00:02:35.630> musician<00:02:35.900> for<00:02:36.349> every

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590
