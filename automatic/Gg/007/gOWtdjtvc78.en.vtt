00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
goes the weasel' I got all of the steps

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.609 
goes the weasel' I got all of the steps
except<00:00:27.060> for<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.240> very<00:00:27.420> end<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.320> could<00:00:28.500> not

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
except for the very end and I could not

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.720 
except for the very end and I could not
actually<00:00:28.830> complete<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.369> Easter<00:00:29.609> egg

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
actually complete the Easter egg

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.279 
actually complete the Easter egg
probably<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.240> same<00:00:30.390> as<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:30.869> one<00:00:31.050> but

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
probably the same as in this one but

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.280 
probably the same as in this one but
figure<00:00:31.949> why<00:00:32.099> not<00:00:32.279> at<00:00:32.430> least<00:00:32.460> try<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.719> any

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
figure why not at least try and any

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.810 
figure why not at least try and any
which<00:00:34.530> way<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.950> good<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.219> know<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> step<00:00:35.670> so

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
which way it's good to know the step so

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.860 
which way it's good to know the step so
I'm<00:00:35.940> just<00:00:36.120> throwing<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.360> out<00:00:36.450> there<00:00:36.570> from

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
I'm just throwing that out there from

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.869 
I'm just throwing that out there from
the<00:00:36.930> beginning<00:00:37.250> some<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.399> stuff<00:00:38.579> might<00:00:38.760> be

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the beginning some of the stuff might be

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.060 
the beginning some of the stuff might be
different<00:00:39.210> if<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> multiplayer<00:00:40.530> but

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
different if it is a multiplayer but

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.250 
different if it is a multiplayer but
let's<00:00:41.460> go<00:00:41.579> ahead<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.879> jump<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.420> all<00:00:42.690> get

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
let's go ahead and jump in and all get

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.760 
let's go ahead and jump in and all get
started

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
started

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.319 
started
all<00:00:43.980> right<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.219> step<00:00:44.370> number<00:00:44.430> one<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.850> need<00:00:45.149> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
all right so step number one you need to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.600 
all right so step number one you need to
go<00:00:45.629> ahead<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.020> build<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.469> maxis<00:00:46.950> lynch

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
go ahead and build this maxis lynch

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.920 
go ahead and build this maxis lynch
machine<00:00:48.030> or<00:00:48.180> whatever<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.480> want<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.690> call<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
machine or whatever you want to call it

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.560 
machine or whatever you want to call it
a<00:00:49.020> noose<00:00:49.230> or<00:00:49.469> whatever<00:00:50.149> basically<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.539> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
a noose or whatever basically it is a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.930 
a noose or whatever basically it is a
machine<00:00:51.780> right<00:00:52.140> there<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:53.550> need<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.789> find

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
machine right there and you need to find

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.479 
machine right there and you need to find
the<00:00:54.120> four<00:00:54.300> parts<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.530> them<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.190> the

tutorials<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.560> how<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.680> build<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
tutorials on how to build all the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
tutorials on how to build all the
equipment<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.210> need<00:01:24.360> those<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.869> you

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
equipment if you need those but you

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.149 
equipment if you need those but you
definitely<00:01:25.470> want<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> build<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.830> turbine<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
definitely want to build a turbine and

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.730 
definitely want to build a turbine and
you<00:01:26.340> need<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.580> set<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> turbines<00:01:27.780> next<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
you need to set the turbines next to the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.100 
you need to set the turbines next to the
orbs<00:01:29.100> now<00:01:29.250> there's<00:01:29.430> four<00:01:29.700> orbs<00:01:30.150> across<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
orbs now there's four orbs across the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.420 
orbs now there's four orbs across the
map<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.470> I'll<00:01:31.560> show<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.740> guys<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.920> locations

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
map and I'll show you guys the locations

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.160 
map and I'll show you guys the locations
of<00:01:32.579> those<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.689> need<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
of those but you need to have the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.109 
of those but you need to have the
turbine<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:34.799> also<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.670> need<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.000> go

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
turbine and then also you need to go

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.910 
turbine and then also you need to go
ahead<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.600> create<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.530> subsurface

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
ahead and create the subsurface

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.980 
ahead and create the subsurface
resonator<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.090> need<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.360> put<00:01:39.540> these

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
resonator and you need to put these

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.929 
resonator and you need to put these
together<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.680> together<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.369> create<00:01:41.820> it

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
together and together they create it

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.880 
together and together they create it
like<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> little<00:01:42.750> sonic<00:01:43.049> boom<00:01:43.229> thing<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.740> they

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
like a little sonic boom thing and they

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.190 
like a little sonic boom thing and they
actually<00:01:44.159> shatter<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.579> glass<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.899> orbs

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
actually shatter the glass of the orbs

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.859 
actually shatter the glass of the orbs
now<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.649> do<00:01:46.890> not<00:01:47.130> need<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.759> get<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
now you do not need to get the the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.590 
now you do not need to get the the
Wonder<00:01:49.140> weapon<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.250> I've<00:01:50.729> verified

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
Wonder weapon to do this I've verified

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.870 
Wonder weapon to do this I've verified
this<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.290> myself<00:01:52.439> at<00:01:52.829> least<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.130> solo<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.610> don't

that I do this and I'm able to advance
in<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.969> Easter<00:02:06.180> Egg<00:02:06.299> without<00:02:06.540> doing<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.810> so

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
in the Easter Egg without doing that so

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.410 
in the Easter Egg without doing that so
hopefully<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.160> can<00:02:08.489> put<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.700> myth<00:02:08.910> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
hopefully that I can put that myth to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.690 
hopefully that I can put that myth to
the<00:02:09.450> clothes<00:02:10.349> there's<00:02:10.739> another<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.160> coming

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
the clothes there's another one coming

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.309 
the clothes there's another one coming
up<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:11.940> well<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.150> think<00:02:12.450> there's<00:02:12.569> another<00:02:12.750> weird

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319

up as well I think there's another weird
myth<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:14.159> um<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.450> was<00:02:15.480> able<00:02:15.719> to<00:02:15.780> figure

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
myth that um that I was able to figure

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
oh yeah so here here it is so this is

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.280 
oh yeah so here here it is so this is
the<00:02:23.700> first<00:02:23.909> spot<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.209> is<00:02:24.269> one<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.079> left

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
the first spot this is one to the left

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.509 
the first spot this is one to the left
of<00:02:25.409> the<00:02:25.560> church<00:02:25.799> and<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.010> want<00:02:26.189> to<00:02:26.250> put<00:02:26.370> them

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
of the church and you want to put them

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.729 
of the church and you want to put them
both<00:02:26.700> together<00:02:26.939> again<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:28.140> then<00:02:28.349> once<00:02:28.560> they

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
both together again and then once they

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.640 
both together again and then once they
go<00:02:29.129> together<00:02:29.280> they<00:02:29.730> will<00:02:30.480> blow<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.200> crystal

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
go together they will blow the crystal

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.899 
go together they will blow the crystal
up<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:31.980> then<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.189> crystal<00:02:32.549> will<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:32.730> all

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
up and then the crystal will be all

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.460 
up and then the crystal will be all
shattered<00:02:33.180> that's<00:02:33.750> when<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:33.989> know<00:02:34.079> you<00:02:34.140> you

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
shattered that's when you know you you

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.170 
shattered that's when you know you you
did<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.680> correctly<00:02:35.040> anyways<00:02:35.849> I'm<00:02:35.970> showing<00:02:36.150> you

did it correctly anyways I'm showing you
guys<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.480> direct<00:02:36.720> path<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:37.109> where<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.829> go<00:02:37.920> for

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
guys the direct path of where to go for

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.319 
guys the direct path of where to go for
the<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.519> second<00:02:38.760> one<00:02:38.879> you<00:02:38.939> can<00:02:38.970> do<00:02:39.120> these<00:02:39.299> in

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
the the second one you can do these in

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.360 
the the second one you can do these in
any<00:02:39.510> order<00:02:39.599> there's<00:02:40.079> no<00:02:40.260> specific<00:02:40.950> order<00:02:41.129> from

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
any order there's no specific order from

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.610 
any order there's no specific order from
what<00:02:41.459> I've<00:02:41.579> seen<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.810> I'm<00:02:42.989> still<00:02:43.230> able<00:02:43.349> to

is<00:02:45.209> so<00:02:45.389> low<00:02:45.510> though<00:02:45.659> you<00:02:46.170> can<00:02:46.290> see<00:02:46.379> that<00:02:46.530> one

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
is so low though you can see that one

that<00:02:46.709> one<00:02:47.069> was<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.340> only<00:02:47.489> glowing<00:02:47.879> orb<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.299> I

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
that one was the only glowing orb that I

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.210 
that one was the only glowing orb that I
well<00:02:49.049> I<00:02:49.079> guess<00:02:49.260> it's<00:02:49.409> not<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.620> only<00:02:49.769> one<00:02:49.950> that

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
well I guess it's not the only one that

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.409 
well I guess it's not the only one that
one<00:02:50.340> was<00:02:50.370> glowing<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.819> brightest<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.209> when<00:02:51.359> I

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:51.419 
one was glowing the brightest and when I

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.470 
one was glowing the brightest and when I
went<00:02:51.599> up<00:02:51.659> to<00:02:51.689> that<00:02:51.989> one<00:02:52.139> first<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.590> did<00:02:53.069> hear<00:02:53.280> a

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
went up to that one first I did hear a

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.940 
went up to that one first I did hear a
Richtofen<00:02:54.480> quote<00:02:54.780> which<00:02:55.019> is<00:02:55.049> weird<00:02:55.409> anyway

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
Richtofen quote which is weird anyway

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.190 
Richtofen quote which is weird anyway
this<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.700> next<00:02:57.030> locations<00:02:57.540> upstairs

across from the above the saloon area in
the<00:03:02.370> tunnel<00:03:02.639> area<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.120> can<00:03:03.239> see<00:03:03.419> that<00:03:03.569> one

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
the tunnel area and you can see that one

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.289 
the tunnel area and you can see that one
ended<00:03:04.319> up<00:03:04.439> breaking<00:03:04.859> right<00:03:05.099> there<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.639> this

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
ended up breaking right there and this

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.909 
ended up breaking right there and this
is<00:03:06.359> a<00:03:06.480> real<00:03:06.750> pain<00:03:06.959> in<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.079> ass<00:03:07.139> solo<00:03:07.590> because

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
you have to move the parts and to make

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.199 
you have to move the parts and to make
this<00:03:10.139> happen<00:03:10.349> twice<00:03:10.799> so<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:11.909> kind<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.120> a

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
this happen twice so it is kind of a

pain<00:03:12.359> but<00:03:12.510> destroy<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.650> fourth<00:03:14.280> quest<00:03:14.519> or

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:14.669 
pain but destroy the the fourth quest or

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:16.550 
pain but destroy the the fourth quest or
well<00:03:14.819> over<00:03:14.849> here<00:03:15.150> on<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.720> side<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
of here you can see that there's a

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.449 
of here you can see that there's a
lantern<00:03:48.479> symbol<00:03:48.870> now<00:03:49.019> with<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:50.159> perk<00:03:50.340> at

lantern symbol now with the perk at

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.969 
lantern symbol now with the perk at
least<00:03:50.609> it<00:03:50.699> shows<00:03:50.849> up<00:03:51.090> with<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.079> vulture<00:03:52.680> Park

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
least it shows up with a vulture Park

least it shows up with a vulture Park
this<00:03:53.340> is<00:03:53.489> where<00:03:53.609> it<00:03:53.669> gets<00:03:53.729> difficult<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:54.329> you

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
this is where it gets difficult so you

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.210 
this is where it gets difficult so you
needed<00:03:54.659> to<00:03:54.690> decipher<00:03:55.109> the<00:03:55.199> code<00:03:55.229> you<00:03:56.010> need<00:03:56.159> to

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
needed to decipher the code you need to

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.830 
needed to decipher the code you need to
use<00:03:56.340> three<00:03:56.639> of<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:56.939> five<00:03:57.120> names<00:03:57.389> and<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.659> mine

use three of the five names and the mine

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.830 
use three of the five names and the mine
shafts<00:03:58.139> and<00:03:58.379> basically<00:03:58.949> as<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.340> can<00:03:59.370> see<00:03:59.579> this

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
shafts and basically as you can see this

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.969 
shafts and basically as you can see this
represents<00:04:00.840> three<00:04:01.019> different<00:04:01.260> names<00:04:01.349> in<00:04:01.709> a

represents three different names in a
specific<00:04:02.189> order<00:04:02.639> you<00:04:03.479> need<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:03.659> punch<00:04:03.840> him

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
specific order you need to punch him

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.569 
specific order you need to punch him
from<00:04:04.199> top<00:04:04.409> to<00:04:04.439> bottom<00:04:04.739> in<00:04:05.220> whatever<00:04:05.430> order

the corresponding number with the ones
above<00:04:11.669> there's<00:04:12.120> only<00:04:12.269> four<00:04:12.509> of<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.689> five

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
above there's only four of the five

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.449 
above there's only four of the five
there<00:04:13.169> but<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.709> can<00:04:13.859> figure<00:04:13.979> out<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.220> fifth

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
there but you can figure out the fifth

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.909 
there but you can figure out the fifth
one<00:04:14.699> on<00:04:14.939> yourself<00:04:15.449> but<00:04:16.259> basically<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.859> don't

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
one on yourself but basically you don't

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.890 
one on yourself but basically you don't
I<00:04:17.159> mean<00:04:17.310> it's<00:04:17.759> just<00:04:17.849> process<00:04:18.359> of<00:04:18.449> elimination

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
I mean it's just process of elimination

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.569 
I mean it's just process of elimination
so<00:04:19.169> I<00:04:19.199> knew<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.919> this<00:04:20.070> one<00:04:20.280> was<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.459> first

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
so I knew that this one was the first

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.760 
so I knew that this one was the first
one<00:04:20.940> on<00:04:20.970> my<00:04:21.539> order<00:04:21.810> because<00:04:22.019> I'm<00:04:22.349> punching<00:04:22.650> it

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
one on my order because I'm punching it

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.950 
one on my order because I'm punching it
in<00:04:22.889> the<00:04:23.130> order<00:04:23.400> that<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.909> signs<00:04:24.120> appeared<00:04:24.479> on

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
in the order that the signs appeared on

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.110 
in the order that the signs appeared on
the<00:04:25.080> wall

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
the wall

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.450 
the wall
and<00:04:26.210> and<00:04:26.750> then<00:04:26.930> once<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:27.560> end<00:04:27.860> up<00:04:28.010> punching

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
and and then once you end up punching

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.790 
and and then once you end up punching
all<00:04:28.669> three<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.240> them<00:04:29.389> then<00:04:29.990> it<00:04:30.380> released<00:04:30.650> a

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
all three of them then it released a

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.500 
all three of them then it released a
little<00:04:31.040> energy<00:04:31.370> wisp<00:04:31.610> thing<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.270> have<00:04:32.389> to

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
little energy wisp thing you have to

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.670 
little energy wisp thing you have to
follow<00:04:32.690> around<00:04:33.020> this<00:04:33.080> little<00:04:33.350> energy

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
follow around this little energy

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.960 
follow around this little energy
twisting<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.280> there's<00:04:34.400> a<00:04:34.490> second<00:04:34.760> one

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
twisting and there's a second one

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.280 
twisting and there's a second one
now<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.210> haven't<00:04:35.449> verified<00:04:35.780> whether<00:04:36.110> or<00:04:36.229> not

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
now I haven't verified whether or not

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.620 
now I haven't verified whether or not
you<00:04:36.410> actually<00:04:36.740> need<00:04:36.860> gab<00:04:37.070> knuckles<00:04:37.430> or<00:04:37.669> what

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
you actually need gab knuckles or what

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.969 
you actually need gab knuckles or what
to<00:04:38.960> punch<00:04:39.169> it<00:04:39.320> maybe<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:39.590> can<00:04:39.650> use<00:04:39.800> a<00:04:39.830> regular

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
to punch it maybe you can use a regular

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.600 
to punch it maybe you can use a regular
knife<00:04:40.280> I<00:04:40.430> will<00:04:40.490> verify<00:04:41.389> that<00:04:41.570> hopefully<00:04:42.229> soon

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
knife I will verify that hopefully soon

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.010 
knife I will verify that hopefully soon
and<00:04:43.610> you<00:04:44.210> can<00:04:44.330> see<00:04:44.449> I<00:04:44.479> fast<00:04:44.750> forwarded

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
and you can see I fast forwarded

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.570 
and you can see I fast forwarded
obviously<00:04:45.380> I<00:04:45.440> change<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.740> gameplay<00:04:45.919> from

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
obviously I change the gameplay from

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.310 
obviously I change the gameplay from
this<00:04:46.729> I've<00:04:46.940> did<00:04:47.090> this<00:04:47.120> twice<00:04:47.570> and<00:04:47.900> one<00:04:48.169> time

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
this I've did this twice and one time

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.650 
this I've did this twice and one time
without<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:49.490> all<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.030> power<00:04:50.180> stuff<00:04:50.479> that

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
without the all the power stuff that

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.730 
without the all the power stuff that
everybody<00:04:50.840> said<00:04:51.139> and<00:04:51.169> then<00:04:51.350> one<00:04:51.470> time<00:04:51.620> by

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
everybody said and then one time by

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.320 
everybody said and then one time by
myself<00:04:52.210> with<00:04:53.210> with<00:04:54.020> no<00:04:54.350> no<00:04:55.190> Wonder<00:04:55.910> weapon<00:04:56.030> and

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
myself with with no no Wonder weapon and

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.960 
myself with with no no Wonder weapon and
whatnot<00:04:56.900> so<00:04:57.250> now<00:04:58.250> you<00:04:58.310> can<00:04:58.460> see<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:58.639> wisp<00:04:58.789> is

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
whatnot so now you can see the wisp is

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.189 
whatnot so now you can see the wisp is
released<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.479> then<00:04:59.570> this<00:04:59.720> is<00:04:59.870> kind<00:04:59.990> of<00:05:00.080> the

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
released and then this is kind of the

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.360 
released and then this is kind of the
end<00:05:00.320> of<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:00.500> easter<00:05:00.889> egg<00:05:00.979> that<00:05:01.010> i<00:05:01.160> have

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
end of the easter egg that i have

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.400 
end of the easter egg that i have
there's<00:05:02.300> obviously<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.780> lot<00:05:02.840> more<00:05:02.930> steps

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
there's obviously a lot more steps

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.439 
there's obviously a lot more steps
involved<00:05:04.370> with<00:05:04.490> this<00:05:04.610> but<00:05:04.850> this<00:05:04.970> is<00:05:05.120> as<00:05:05.240> far<00:05:05.270> as

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
involved with this but this is as far as

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.390 
involved with this but this is as far as
I<00:05:05.600> got<00:05:05.750> right<00:05:06.320> now<00:05:06.470> I<00:05:06.500> will<00:05:06.770> have<00:05:06.919> an<00:05:07.010> updated
