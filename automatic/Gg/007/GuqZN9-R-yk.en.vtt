of<00:01:27.720> things<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:28.080> think<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.439> world<00:01:28.829> at<00:01:29.009> war<00:01:29.280> with

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
of things I think of world at war with

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.429 
of things I think of world at war with
the<00:01:30.060> elevator<00:01:30.600> glitches<00:01:30.990> if<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.170> guys<00:01:31.320> are

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
the elevator glitches if you guys are

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.170 
the elevator glitches if you guys are
not<00:01:31.590> familiar<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.070> an<00:01:32.430> elevator

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
not familiar with that an elevator

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.179 
not familiar with that an elevator
glitch<00:01:33.420> was<00:01:33.990> when<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:34.530> was<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.650> certain<00:01:34.890> part

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
glitch was when there was a certain part

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.859 
glitch was when there was a certain part
of<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.280> map<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.000> could<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.450> crouch

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
of the map that you could like crouch

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.620 
of the map that you could like crouch
and<00:01:37.049> move<00:01:37.259> side<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.530> side<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:39.090> could<00:01:39.299> like

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
and move side to side and you could like

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.179 
and move side to side and you could like
elevate<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.200> top<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.470> buildings<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.130> you

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
elevate to the top of buildings and you

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.260 
elevate to the top of buildings and you
could<00:01:41.340> get<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.549> top<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.729> buildings<00:01:42.000> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
could get on top of buildings you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.850 
could get on top of buildings you
normally<00:01:42.600> couldn't<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.470> throw<00:01:43.680> people

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
normally couldn't in with throw people

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.800 
normally couldn't in with throw people
off<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:45.180> know<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.420> was<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> pretty

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
off and you know it was a pretty

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.350 
off and you know it was a pretty
problematic<00:01:46.079> glitch<00:01:46.820> but<00:01:47.820> my<00:01:48.000> thing<00:01:48.240> with

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
problematic glitch but my thing with

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.330 
problematic glitch but my thing with
call<00:01:48.600> duty<00:01:48.840> maps<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.619> that's<00:01:49.799> when<00:01:50.250> you

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
call duty maps is is that's when you

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.999 
call duty maps is is that's when you
can't<00:01:50.640> explore<00:01:51.180> them<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:52.380> can't<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:52.770> cool

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
can't explore them and you can't do cool

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.310 
can't explore them and you can't do cool
things<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> map<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.880> makes<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:54.990> boring

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
things on the map it makes it so boring

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.170 
things on the map it makes it so boring
and<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.710> seems<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.520> direction<00:01:56.670> modern

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and it seems like the direction modern

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.420 
and it seems like the direction modern
warfare<00:01:57.299> 3<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.990> black<00:01:58.290> ops<00:01:58.530> 2<00:01:58.710> took<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.130> maybe

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
warfare 3 and black ops 2 took and maybe

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.249 
warfare 3 and black ops 2 took and maybe
even<00:01:59.549> black<00:01:59.850> ops<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.270> well<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.170> they

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
even black ops as well is it that they

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.020 
even black ops as well is it that they
don't<00:02:01.439> want<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.860> get<00:02:02.009> into<00:02:02.250> certain<00:02:02.700> spots

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
don't want you to get into certain spots

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.760 
don't want you to get into certain spots
like<00:02:03.719> there<00:02:03.990> are<00:02:04.079> certain<00:02:04.320> parts<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.649> map

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
like there are certain parts of the map

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.020 
like there are certain parts of the map
that<00:02:04.950> would<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.130> really<00:02:05.399> cool<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.909> could

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
that would be really cool if you could

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.940 
that would be really cool if you could
get<00:02:06.149> onto<00:02:06.540> them<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.200> can't<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.710> it's

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
get onto them but you can't and it's

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.139 
get onto them but you can't and it's
just<00:02:08.129> how<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.310> games<00:02:08.550> work<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.060> you

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
just how the games work and you

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.089 
just how the games work and you
shouldn't<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.840> do<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.020> an<00:02:10.349> elevator

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
shouldn't have to do it an elevator

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.490 
shouldn't have to do it an elevator
glitch<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.580> get<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.819> them<00:02:11.940> they<00:02:12.120> should

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
glitch to get to them they should

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.470 
glitch to get to them they should
be<00:02:12.620> really<00:02:13.340> cool<00:02:13.490> parts<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:13.970> map<00:02:14.120> that

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
be really cool parts of the map that

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.770 
be really cool parts of the map that
make<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.530> game<00:02:15.710> more<00:02:15.740> interesting<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.490> fun

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
make the game more interesting and fun

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.970 
make the game more interesting and fun
though<00:02:17.780> that's<00:02:18.110> just<00:02:18.290> my<00:02:18.380> thoughts<00:02:18.620> as<00:02:18.740> far<00:02:18.890> as

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
though that's just my thoughts as far as

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.800 
though that's just my thoughts as far as
it<00:02:19.070> goes<00:02:19.160> for<00:02:19.490> like<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.790> maps<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.180> stuff<00:02:20.270> now

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
it goes for like the maps and stuff now

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.390 
it goes for like the maps and stuff now
in<00:02:20.930> terms<00:02:21.050> of<00:02:21.200> gameplay<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.740> remember<00:02:22.250> one<00:02:22.370> of

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
in terms of gameplay I remember one of

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.340 
in terms of gameplay I remember one of
the<00:02:22.520> most<00:02:22.700> fun<00:02:22.970> things<00:02:23.270> was<00:02:23.870> from<00:02:24.080> modern

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
the most fun things was from modern

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.440 
the most fun things was from modern
warfare<00:02:24.530> 2<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.280> know<00:02:25.340> I'm<00:02:26.000> probably<00:02:26.240> gonna

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
warfare 2 and I know I'm probably gonna

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.450 
warfare 2 and I know I'm probably gonna
get<00:02:26.600> bashed<00:02:26.780> for<00:02:27.080> this<00:02:27.200> but<00:02:27.500> these<00:02:27.890> lobbies

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
get bashed for this but these lobbies

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.120 
get bashed for this but these lobbies
were<00:02:28.610> fun<00:02:28.970> regardless<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:30.140> how<00:02:30.260> much<00:02:30.500> they

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
were fun regardless of how much they

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.949 
were fun regardless of how much they
were<00:02:31.190> annoying<00:02:31.520> if<00:02:32.300> you<00:02:32.510> were<00:02:32.600> on<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.780> bad

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
were annoying if you were on the bad

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.270 
were annoying if you were on the bad
side<00:02:32.990> but<00:02:33.380> if<00:02:33.440> you're<00:02:33.530> on<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.650> good<00:02:33.830> side<00:02:33.860> it

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
side but if you're on the good side it

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.370 
side but if you're on the good side it
was<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.430> good<00:02:34.700> fun<00:02:35.030> game<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.570> these<00:02:36.110> were<00:02:36.290> the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
was a good fun game and these were the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.380 
was a good fun game and these were the
lobbies<00:02:36.709> with<00:02:36.920> unlimited<00:02:37.310> ammo<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.180> modern

lobbies with unlimited ammo and modern

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.580 
lobbies with unlimited ammo and modern

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
ac-130 s all that shit it was just so

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.250 
ac-130 s all that shit it was just so
much<00:02:42.740> fun<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.970> know<00:02:44.060> we're<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.870> were<00:02:45.080> either

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
much fun you know we're you were either

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.870 
much fun you know we're you were either
having<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.680> really<00:02:45.860> bad<00:02:46.010> game<00:02:46.430> or<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.730> really

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
having a really bad game or a really

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.270 
having a really bad game or a really
good<00:02:47.150> game<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.510> especially<00:02:48.290> those<00:02:48.590> 18<00:02:49.070> men

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
good game and especially those 18 men

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.040 
good game and especially those 18 men

trapping<00:02:51.320> was<00:02:51.560> ridiculous<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.250> know<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.610> but

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
trapping was ridiculous I know that but

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.240 
trapping was ridiculous I know that but
those<00:02:53.540> games<00:02:53.840> were<00:02:54.050> actually<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.560> lot<00:02:54.800> of<00:02:54.920> fun<00:02:55.040> I

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
those games were actually a lot of fun I

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.100 
those games were actually a lot of fun I
liked<00:02:55.580> those<00:02:55.820> problems<00:02:56.239> in<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.480> game<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.810> it

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
liked those problems in the game and it

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.650 
liked those problems in the game and it
made<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.680> lot<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:57.980> fun<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:59.239> know<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.390> know

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
made it a lot of fun and you know I know

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.880 
made it a lot of fun and you know I know
they're<00:02:59.900> doing<00:03:00.080> their<00:03:00.200> best<00:03:00.320> to<00:03:00.470> try<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.680> make

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
they're doing their best to try to make

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.710 
they're doing their best to try to make
it<00:03:00.920> more<00:03:01.250> fair<00:03:01.610> more<00:03:01.880> competitive<00:03:02.690> more

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
it more fair more competitive more

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.650 
it more fair more competitive more
skill-based<00:03:03.440> but<00:03:04.430> just<00:03:05.060> think<00:03:05.120> about<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.630> for

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
skill-based but just think about it for

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
skill-based but just think about it for
a<00:03:05.870> second<00:03:06.170> if<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.290> take<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.500> different

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
a second if you take a different

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.740 
a second if you take a different
approach<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.489> game<00:03:07.520> may<00:03:07.970> be<00:03:08.000> having<00:03:08.570> more

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
approach to the game may be having more

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.750 
approach to the game may be having more
problems<00:03:08.930> can<00:03:09.410> actually<00:03:09.770> make<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.250> game<00:03:10.430> fun

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
problems can actually make the game fun

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.650 
problems can actually make the game fun
I<00:03:11.000> don't<00:03:11.690> know<00:03:11.950> in<00:03:12.950> terms<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.430> maps<00:03:13.730> you<00:03:14.239> know<00:03:14.390> I

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
I don't know in terms of maps you know I

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.600 
I don't know in terms of maps you know I
think<00:03:15.350> being<00:03:15.620> able<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:15.920> explore<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.430> maps

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
think being able to explore the maps

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.670 
think being able to explore the maps
more<00:03:16.880> and<00:03:17.120> get<00:03:17.239> some<00:03:17.360> more<00:03:17.450> spots<00:03:17.840> makes<00:03:18.530> the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
more and get some more spots makes the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.650 
more and get some more spots makes the
game<00:03:18.799> a<00:03:18.860> lot<00:03:19.040> better<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.549> in<00:03:20.360> terms<00:03:20.480> of

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
game a lot better and in terms of

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.449 
game a lot better and in terms of
gameplay<00:03:20.900> if<00:03:21.290> it's<00:03:21.500> more<00:03:21.620> chaotic<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:22.220> think

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
gameplay if it's more chaotic I think

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.100 
gameplay if it's more chaotic I think
it's<00:03:22.580> more<00:03:22.640> fun<00:03:22.970> for<00:03:23.390> example<00:03:23.750> i<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:23.840> this

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
it's more fun for example i have this

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.259 
it's more fun for example i have this
map<00:03:24.440> idea<00:03:24.830> it<00:03:25.160> can<00:03:25.280> be<00:03:25.430> for<00:03:25.610> any<00:03:25.760> call<00:03:26.000> of<00:03:26.090> duty

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
map idea it can be for any call of duty

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.390 
map idea it can be for any call of duty
game<00:03:26.420> where<00:03:27.049> literally<00:03:27.410> it's<00:03:27.680> just<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:28.040> flat

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
game where literally it's just a flat

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.880 
game where literally it's just a flat
piece<00:03:28.880> of<00:03:28.940> land<00:03:29.120> no<00:03:29.810> cover<00:03:30.080> no<00:03:30.320> buildings<00:03:30.799> no

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
piece of land no cover no buildings no

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.850 
piece of land no cover no buildings no
spots<00:03:31.340> nothing<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.239> each<00:03:33.019> team<00:03:33.380> spots<00:03:33.709> on

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
spots nothing and each team spots on

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.890 
spots nothing and each team spots on
opposite<00:03:34.220> sides<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.760> just<00:03:34.970> go<00:03:35.150> crazy<00:03:35.570> you

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
opposite sides and you just go crazy you

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.289 
opposite sides and you just go crazy you
just<00:03:36.110> it<00:03:36.830> would<00:03:37.040> just<00:03:37.160> be<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.340> really<00:03:37.700> small<00:03:38.030> map

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
just it would just be a really small map

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.630 
just it would just be a really small map
chaotic<00:03:39.140> gameplay<00:03:39.709> everything<00:03:40.190> I<00:03:40.310> think<00:03:40.549> it

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
chaotic gameplay everything I think it

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.390 
chaotic gameplay everything I think it
would<00:03:40.730> be<00:03:40.820> a<00:03:40.850> ton<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.090> fun<00:03:41.360> but<00:03:42.079> I<00:03:42.470> just<00:03:43.250> don't

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
would be a ton of fun but I just don't

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.590 
would be a ton of fun but I just don't
