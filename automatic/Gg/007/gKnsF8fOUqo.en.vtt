00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.600 
i recorded this from theater mode that
wasn't<00:00:13.679> what<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.799> was<00:00:13.980> like<00:00:14.219> when<00:00:14.400> i<00:00:14.460> was

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
wasn't what it was like when i was

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.670 
wasn't what it was like when i was
actually<00:00:14.790> playing<00:00:15.269> but<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.049> kind<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.320> fixes

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
actually playing but it kind of fixes

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.050 
actually playing but it kind of fixes
itself<00:00:16.980> after<00:00:17.220> get<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> second<00:00:17.940> kill

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
itself after get the second kill

itself after get the second kill
unlocked<00:00:18.449> my<00:00:18.600> first<00:00:18.840> perk<00:00:19.080> I'm<00:00:19.560> not<00:00:19.710> sure<00:00:19.770> it's

like<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.289> said<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.529> get<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> double<00:00:26.010> mom<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.400> this

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
like I said I get a double mom in this

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.070 
like I said I get a double mom in this
game<00:00:26.699> play<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.000> was<00:00:27.150> actually<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.510> triple

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
game play this was actually a triple

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.080 
game play this was actually a triple
Moab<00:00:28.230> fail<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.130> was<00:00:29.490> playing<00:00:29.730> ground<00:00:30.029> war

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
Moab fail and I was playing ground war

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.279 
Moab fail and I was playing ground war
domination<00:00:30.300> that's<00:00:30.840> something<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.230> normally

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
domination that's something I normally

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.959 
domination that's something I normally
don't<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.250> I'm<00:00:32.340> starting<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.669> play<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.940> a

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
don't do but I'm starting to play it a

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.130 
don't do but I'm starting to play it a
little<00:00:33.120> bit<00:00:33.329> more<00:00:33.450> often<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:33.989> it's

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
little bit more often and it's

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.569 
little bit more often and it's
definitely<00:00:34.410> really<00:00:34.770> good<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.399> for

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
definitely really good for going for

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.280 
definitely really good for going for
those<00:00:35.730> high<00:00:36.239> scoring<00:00:36.570> game<00:00:36.660> plays<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.140> don't

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
those high scoring game plays I don't

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.319 
those high scoring game plays I don't
know<00:00:37.350> when<00:00:37.469> 6v6<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.219> just<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.670> much<00:00:38.820> more<00:00:38.879> slow

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
know when 6v6 is just so much more slow

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.090 
know when 6v6 is just so much more slow
paced<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.870> know<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.590> only<00:00:40.800> difference

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
paced and I know the only difference

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.790 
paced and I know the only difference
between<00:00:41.219> ground<00:00:41.820> war<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.360> 66<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.350> obviously

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
between ground war and 66 is obviously

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.770 
between ground war and 66 is obviously
just<00:00:43.920> three<00:00:44.250> more<00:00:44.370> people<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.750> just

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
just three more people but that just

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.330 
just three more people but that just
seems<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.289> make<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> difference<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:47.039> makes<00:00:47.190> it

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
seems to make the difference it makes it

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.770 
seems to make the difference it makes it
so<00:00:47.520> much<00:00:47.579> more<00:00:47.700> fast<00:00:48.149> paced<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.690> action

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
so much more fast paced and action

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.840 
so much more fast paced and action
packed<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> thing<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.579> but

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
packed that's the thing that I like but

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.520 
packed that's the thing that I like but
it's<00:00:51.059> also<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.329> lot<00:00:51.570> easier<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.989> get<00:00:52.110> killed<00:00:52.350> yet

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
it's also a lot easier to get killed yet

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.860 
it's also a lot easier to get killed yet
to<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.710> put<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:52.980> top<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.370> your<00:00:53.489> game<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.969> you

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
to be put on top of your game and you

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.910 
to be put on top of your game and you
know<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.079> definitely<00:00:55.170> helps<00:00:55.620> when<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.860> have

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
know it definitely helps when you have

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.650 
know it definitely helps when you have
UAVs<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> year<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:56.879> actually<00:00:57.180> pointing

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
UAVs in the year I was actually pointing

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.240 
UAVs in the year I was actually pointing
with<00:00:57.780> exquisite<00:00:58.260> during<00:00:58.649> one<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.859> his<00:00:59.010> live

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
with exquisite during one of his live

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.340 
with exquisite during one of his live
streams<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.850> game<00:01:00.059> play<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.510> that's<00:01:01.170> why

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
streams in this game play and that's why

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.049 
streams in this game play and that's why
you<00:01:01.410> guys<00:01:01.620> are<00:01:01.859> seeing<00:01:02.070> support<00:01:02.609> all<00:01:02.730> over<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you guys are seeing support all over the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.670 
you guys are seeing support all over the
map<00:01:03.210> he<00:01:03.420> had<00:01:03.510> support<00:01:03.840> runners<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.409> I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
map he had support runners because I

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.560 
map he had support runners because I
think<00:01:04.920> he<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.670> 100<00:01:06.210> gunstreak

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
think he was going for a 100 gunstreak

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.850 
think he was going for a 100 gunstreak
and<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.900> was<00:01:07.020> actually<00:01:07.380> supposed<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.740> be

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and I was actually supposed to be

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.710 
and I was actually supposed to be
running<00:01:07.979> support<00:01:08.430> as<00:01:08.520> well<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:08.909> man<00:01:09.479> these

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
running support as well but man these

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.240 
running support as well but man these
kids<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:10.110> were<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.470> bad<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.100> really

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
kids they were so bad and I just really

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.190 
kids they were so bad and I just really
had<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> gameplay<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.720> ended<00:01:13.110> up

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
had to get a gameplay so I ended up

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.179 
had to get a gameplay so I ended up
getting<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.740> thought<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:13.979> was<00:01:14.040> pretty

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
getting this I thought it was pretty

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.120 
getting this I thought it was pretty
good<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:15.180> believe<00:01:15.540> he<00:01:15.720> actually<00:01:15.869> got<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> 77

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
on all specialists after that as well

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.590 
on all specialists after that as well
but<00:02:46.980> yeah<00:02:47.520> like<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.820> said<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.030> only<00:02:48.210> picked<00:02:48.450> up

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
but yeah like I said I only picked up

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.090 
but yeah like I said I only picked up
one<00:02:48.900> ballistic<00:02:49.320> vest<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:49.620> this<00:02:49.740> game<00:02:49.890> but<00:02:50.040> I

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
one ballistic vest in this game but I

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.220 
one ballistic vest in this game but I
thought<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.400> was<00:02:50.490> really<00:02:50.670> impressive

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
thought that was really impressive

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.420 
thought that was really impressive
obviously<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.260> did<00:02:52.440> have<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.710> UAV<00:02:53.100> going

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
obviously I did have the UAV going

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.310 
obviously I did have the UAV going
24seven<00:02:54.240> which<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.600> really<00:02:54.900> helpful<00:02:55.140> I

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
24seven which is really helpful I

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.780 
24seven which is really helpful I
definitely<00:02:55.590> think<00:02:55.770> i<00:02:55.890> could<00:02:56.070> get<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.190> triple<00:02:56.640> if

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
definitely think i could get a triple if

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.450 
definitely think i could get a triple if
not<00:02:57.030> quad<00:02:57.360> Moab<00:02:57.570> easily<00:02:58.380> if<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:59.040> had<00:02:59.160> support

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
not quad Moab easily if I had support

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.100 
not quad Moab easily if I had support
runners<00:02:59.700> like<00:02:59.820> this<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:00.720> know<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.960> guys

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
runners like this and you know the guys

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.290 
runners like this and you know the guys
that<00:03:01.320> he<00:03:01.500> had<00:03:01.710> right<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.190> this<00:03:02.400> game<00:03:02.580> play<00:03:02.850> they

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
that he had right in this game play they

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.610 
that he had right in this game play they
really<00:03:03.600> knew<00:03:03.720> what<00:03:03.810> they<00:03:03.960> were<00:03:04.050> doing<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.440> mean

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
really knew what they were doing I mean

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.140 
really knew what they were doing I mean
they<00:03:04.740> pretty<00:03:04.890> much<00:03:04.980> held<00:03:05.340> down<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.490> spawn<00:03:05.880> and

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
they pretty much held down the spawn and

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.820 
they pretty much held down the spawn and
you<00:03:06.570> know<00:03:06.660> occasionally<00:03:07.140> they<00:03:07.320> flipped<00:03:07.620> sure

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
you know occasionally they flipped sure

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.620 
you know occasionally they flipped sure
there's<00:03:08.130> mistakes<00:03:08.580> gonna<00:03:09.000> be<00:03:09.120> made<00:03:09.330> but

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
there's mistakes gonna be made but

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.690 
there's mistakes gonna be made but
pretty<00:03:10.350> much<00:03:10.380> they<00:03:10.620> were<00:03:10.710> all<00:03:10.860> held<00:03:11.130> down<00:03:11.400> into

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
pretty much they were all held down into

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.400 
pretty much they were all held down into
one<00:03:11.970> area<00:03:12.120> which<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.570> really<00:03:12.870> nice<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.110> makes

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
one area which is really nice and makes

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.840 
one area which is really nice and makes
it<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.620> lot<00:03:13.770> easier<00:03:13.830> i<00:03:14.310> don't<00:03:14.460> know<00:03:14.550> if<00:03:14.670> i<00:03:14.730> ever

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
it a lot easier i don't know if i ever

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.490 
it a lot easier i don't know if i ever
had<00:03:15.060> support<00:03:15.480> runners<00:03:15.720> i<00:03:15.840> don't<00:03:15.990> like<00:03:16.290> that

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
had support runners i don't like that

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.530 
had support runners i don't like that
idea<00:03:16.680> but<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:17.580> definitely<00:03:17.790> would<00:03:18.090> be<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.270> lot

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
idea but it definitely would be a lot

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.120 
idea but it definitely would be a lot
easier<00:03:18.570> for<00:03:18.959> going<00:03:19.260> for<00:03:19.410> gameplays<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:19.800> i<00:03:19.980> can

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
easier for going for gameplays and i can

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.100 
easier for going for gameplays and i can
understand<00:03:20.580> why<00:03:20.730> guys<00:03:21.060> like<00:03:21.120> exquisite<00:03:21.870> j

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110

vacuum<00:06:19.580> kind<00:06:19.820> of<00:06:19.910> system<00:06:20.210> instead<00:06:20.480> of<00:06:20.540> using

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
vacuum kind of system instead of using

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.090 
vacuum kind of system instead of using

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
like a propeller where it just pushes

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.920 
like a propeller where it just pushes
the<00:06:22.370> water<00:06:22.400> kind<00:06:23.180> of<00:06:23.240> like<00:06:23.390> proposed<00:06:23.780> you

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
the water kind of like proposed you

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.660 
the water kind of like proposed you
through<00:06:24.110> the<00:06:24.230> water<00:06:24.440> with<00:06:24.530> a<00:06:24.710> vacuum<00:06:25.220> sort<00:06:25.580> of

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670 
through the water with a vacuum sort of

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
through the water with a vacuum sort of
thing<00:06:25.820> so<00:06:26.000> that<00:06:26.030> was<00:06:26.210> pretty<00:06:26.330> cool<00:06:26.420> but

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
thing so that was pretty cool but

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.390 
thing so that was pretty cool but
they're<00:06:26.840> like<00:06:26.960> five<00:06:27.470> grand<00:06:27.860> it's<00:06:28.040> definitely

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
they're like five grand it's definitely

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.770 
they're like five grand it's definitely

video that's always a really good day

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:01.249 
video that's always a really good day
for<00:06:58.769> me<00:06:58.949> and<00:06:59.279> I<00:07:00.029> can<00:07:00.419> kind<00:07:00.599> of<00:07:00.659> judge<00:07:00.989> how<00:07:01.229> well

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:01.259 
for me and I can kind of judge how well

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:02.989 
for me and I can kind of judge how well
the<00:07:01.649> video<00:07:01.889> was<00:07:02.159> based<00:07:02.459> on<00:07:02.579> the<00:07:02.639> amount<00:07:02.849> of

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:02.999 
the video was based on the amount of

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:04.489 
the video was based on the amount of
likes<00:07:03.209> not<00:07:03.449> necessarily<00:07:04.079> the<00:07:04.229> amount<00:07:04.409> of

00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:04.499 
likes not necessarily the amount of

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:06.979 
likes not necessarily the amount of
views<00:07:04.649> so<00:07:05.009> I<00:07:05.249> mean<00:07:05.819> it<00:07:05.969> takes<00:07:06.119> like<00:07:06.360> one<00:07:06.569> second

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:06.989 
views so I mean it takes like one second

views so I mean it takes like one second
