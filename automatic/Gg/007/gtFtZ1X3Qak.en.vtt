 the 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.020

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.730
 backstage of the leader so today I 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.270
 you presented a brioche dough 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.580
 we need 450 g of vincent flour from 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.090
 is a pinch of salt 65 grams of 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.130
 sugar 20 g yeast 100 g butter 2 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.860
 eggs there is one for the dough annuitants 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.900
 and we will keep it for the other the yellow 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.980
 for gilding in utensils 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:36.399
 we need a mixer drummer with 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.490
 a hook a horn and a spatula in 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:46.300
 silicone will incorporate into the flour 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:49.030
 our sugar a pinch of salt in agreement 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.860
 for the milk in a saucepan do 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:57.280
 really warm over low heat and we're going 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.610
 put our measure in the milk it takes 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.640
 that milk does not exceed 35 degrees 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:08.500
 then for the yeast to act 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.960
 so we incorporate it into the flour and we 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.750
 stir and during that time what are we going 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:19.540
 do we will cut into small pieces 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:21.340
 the butter one breaks the frontier a 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.290
 report that in the dough 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.690
 once the offer is good it is necessary 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.900
 speak in the impact we will incorporate the 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.240
 piece of butter if it sticks a little 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.820
 little we can incorporate a little bit 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:41.340
 flour with a horn 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:45.369
 we'll take off the paw from the container 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.430
 are well homogeneous mold so we're going to 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:52.240
 let work in a room 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.240
 relatively hot and we are going humidified 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.460
 a towel to raise the thrust 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.909
 of this paste must let rest the 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.520
 dough 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.619
 about a good hour after an hour 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.790
 at room temperature is the best 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.060
 in the refrigerator 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.829
 so our paw doubled in volume 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.530
 so we'll put it on the time of 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:13.599
 average work cramping would have a whole 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.410
 little bit of flour for patrick glue 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:21.590
 we will go some 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.590
 a coupe in four 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.790

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:48.300
 little balls or to position them 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.980
 in the mold it's a little bit on a 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.970
 plate 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.980
