checking<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.189> and<00:04:08.400> four<00:04:08.849> of<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.090> mainframe

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
checking it and four of the mainframe

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.390 
checking it and four of the mainframe
members<00:04:10.109> where<00:04:10.319> they<00:04:10.620> forgot<00:04:10.919> to<00:04:11.069> tighten<00:04:11.250> the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.819 
members where they forgot to tighten the
bolts<00:04:11.729> down<00:04:11.879> all<00:04:12.720> four<00:04:13.109> of<00:04:13.139> the<00:04:13.259> frame<00:04:13.500> members

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
bolts down all four of the frame members

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.279 
bolts down all four of the frame members
were<00:04:13.979> loose<00:04:14.189> and<00:04:14.689> that<00:04:15.689> so<00:04:15.930> just<00:04:16.109> because

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
were loose and that so just because

need to be looking at it we're going to

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.930 
need to be looking at it we're going to
look<00:04:22.019> at<00:04:22.139> the<00:04:22.289> coupling<00:04:22.710> devices<00:04:23.070> is<00:04:23.520> this

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
look at the coupling devices is this

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.850 
look at the coupling devices is this
system<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.630> way<00:04:24.779> it's<00:04:24.960> supposed<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.500> be<00:04:25.710> are
