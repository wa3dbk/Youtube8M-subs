00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:20.770 

what<00:02:09.250> he<00:02:09.399> said

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.810 

now<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.380> have<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.800> dump<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.730> car<00:02:22.940> into<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.330> sea

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
now I have to dump the car into the sea

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.750 
now I have to dump the car into the sea
which<00:02:26.140> released<00:02:27.140> on<00:02:27.290> LCS<00:02:27.830> was<00:02:28.070> actually<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.460> bit

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
which released on LCS was actually a bit

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.160 
which released on LCS was actually a bit
easier<00:02:29.120> because<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.450> could<00:02:29.600> jump<00:02:29.810> out<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.050> a

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
easier because you could jump out of a

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.560 
easier because you could jump out of a
moving<00:02:30.200> vehicle<00:02:30.530> whereas<00:02:31.400> now<00:02:31.730> we<00:02:32.270> have<00:02:32.420> to

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
moving vehicle whereas now we have to

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.100 
moving vehicle whereas now we have to
actually<00:02:33.520> carefully<00:02:34.520> push<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.360> car<00:02:35.750> into<00:02:35.990> the

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
actually carefully push the car into the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.060 
actually carefully push the car into the
water<00:02:36.550> so<00:02:37.930> yeah<00:02:38.930> basically<00:02:39.200> just<00:02:39.530> push<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:39.950> in

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
water so yeah basically just push it in

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:47.980 
water so yeah basically just push it in
anywhere<00:02:40.459> let's<00:02:41.390> go<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.870> coastline<00:02:46.990> maybe

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
anywhere let's go to the coastline maybe

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.110 
anywhere let's go to the coastline maybe
you<00:02:48.170> can<00:02:48.320> push<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.650> up<00:02:48.770> here<00:02:51.700> okay<00:02:52.700> well<00:02:52.880> no<00:02:53.000> I'm

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
you can push it up here okay well no I'm

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.880 
you can push it up here okay well no I'm
gonna<00:02:53.239> take<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.810> somewhere<00:02:54.140> else<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.500> think<00:02:54.560> it

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
gonna take it somewhere else I think it

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.070 
gonna take it somewhere else I think it
doesn't<00:02:55.220> seem<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.520> work

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.860 

let's<00:03:01.590> try<00:03:01.860> again<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:02.310> way

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:22.260 

Pittsville

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.420 

this<00:03:22.930> is<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.230> better<00:03:23.470> place<00:03:23.680> because<00:03:23.800> it's<00:03:24.340> a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
this is a better place because it's a

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.080 
this is a better place because it's a
flat<00:03:24.610> surface<00:03:25.030> there's<00:03:25.510> no<00:03:25.690> one<00:03:25.930> it's<00:03:26.320> no

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
flat surface there's no one it's no

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.670
