00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
putting the iphone on so it's a bit of a

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.620 
putting the iphone on so it's a bit of a
different<00:04:47.800> logo<00:04:47.979> but<00:04:48.370> also<00:04:48.940> i<00:04:49.120> was<00:04:49.330> able<00:04:49.479> to

noticeable I just noticed it now

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.379 
noticeable I just noticed it now
actually<00:05:11.620> by<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.430> way<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.729> case<00:05:12.909> has<00:05:13.120> a<00:05:13.150> nice

actually by the way the case has a nice
glossy<00:05:14.050> finish<00:05:14.380> to<00:05:14.590> it<00:05:14.620> arm<00:05:14.979> which<00:05:15.940> looks

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
glossy finish to it arm which looks

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.089 
glossy finish to it arm which looks
great<00:05:16.780> and<00:05:17.020> I<00:05:17.320> don't<00:05:17.470> think<00:05:17.620> scratches<00:05:18.009> are

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
great and I don't think scratches are

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.379 
great and I don't think scratches are
going<00:05:18.220> to<00:05:18.280> show<00:05:18.430> up<00:05:18.550> too<00:05:18.699> much<00:05:18.849> on<00:05:19.060> this<00:05:19.150> thing

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
going to show up too much on this thing

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.230 
going to show up too much on this thing
either<00:05:19.599> considering<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.349> fact<00:05:20.590> of<00:05:20.740> how<00:05:20.889> clear

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
either considering the fact of how clear

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.700 
either considering the fact of how clear
clean<00:05:22.240> it<00:05:22.389> looks<00:05:22.539> but<00:05:22.780> you<00:05:22.960> know<00:05:23.080> we'll<00:05:23.380> see<00:05:23.590> in

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
clean it looks but you know we'll see in

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.950 
clean it looks but you know we'll see in
time<00:05:23.909> and<00:05:24.909> it<00:05:25.000> does<00:05:25.150> stick<00:05:25.360> up<00:05:25.479> enough<00:05:25.750> from

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
time and it does stick up enough from

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.930 
time and it does stick up enough from
the<00:05:26.020> camera<00:05:26.620> and<00:05:26.860> all<00:05:26.979> the<00:05:27.099> buttons<00:05:27.400> around<00:05:27.550> it

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
the camera and all the buttons around it

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.490 
the camera and all the buttons around it
to<00:05:28.479> the<00:05:28.570> point<00:05:28.780> where<00:05:28.870> wouldn't<00:05:29.110> be<00:05:29.169> scratched

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
to the point where wouldn't be scratched

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.920 
to the point where wouldn't be scratched
and<00:05:29.770> for<00:05:30.250> those<00:05:30.340> of<00:05:30.400> you<00:05:30.789> over<00:05:31.389> protectors

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
and for those of you over protectors

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.080 
and for those of you over protectors
that<00:05:31.960> are<00:05:32.199> wondering<00:05:32.620> there<00:05:33.370> is<00:05:33.490> a<00:05:33.520> lip<00:05:33.880> that

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
that are wondering there is a lip that

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.790 
that are wondering there is a lip that
comes<00:05:34.330> up<00:05:34.509> from<00:05:34.539> both<00:05:34.900> sides<00:05:35.199> of<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:35.440> iphone

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
comes up from both sides of the iphone

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.850 
comes up from both sides of the iphone
so<00:05:36.070> if<00:05:36.250> it<00:05:36.370> falls<00:05:36.610> down<00:05:36.759> you<00:05:37.659> know<00:05:37.780> when<00:05:38.740> it

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
so if it falls down you know when it

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.100 
so if it falls down you know when it
falls<00:05:39.070> it's<00:05:39.400> going<00:05:39.580> to<00:05:39.639> be<00:05:39.820> on<00:05:40.630> the<00:05:40.750> bumpers

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
falls it's going to be on the bumpers

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.749 
falls it's going to be on the bumpers
and<00:05:41.289> not<00:05:41.380> on<00:05:41.530> the<00:05:41.590> phone<00:05:41.740> so<00:05:42.070> it<00:05:42.370> should

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 
and not on the phone so it should

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.909 
and not on the phone so it should
decrease<00:05:43.539> the<00:05:43.750> chance<00:05:44.020> of<00:05:44.199> it<00:05:44.349> cracking<00:05:44.800> as

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
decrease the chance of it cracking as

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.980 
decrease the chance of it cracking as
well<00:05:45.099> so<00:05:45.430> overall<00:05:45.789> I<00:05:45.820> gotta<00:05:46.210> say<00:05:46.419> uncommon<00:05:46.900> you

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
well so overall I gotta say uncommon you

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.689 
well so overall I gotta say uncommon you
