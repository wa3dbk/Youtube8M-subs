00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 welcome to the new pvp gameplay 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.940
 and we play our word that became 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.309
 developed from zero in the here too 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.250
 the conversation is based on the idea of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.800
 minecraft is also here with mts 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.210
 I'm not a schlawiner and the more accurate 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.460
 explanations and everything is there after that 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.980
 intro and concrete that with it well 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.980
 no matter premium so in comfort 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.470
 the whole is not just exposed and it is one 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.970
 completely new pvp game principle it works 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.100
 because there are three different teams 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.050
 here and gangs I am there in the team 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.730
 someone is fighting each other there 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.120
 just the team that I alone now 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.790
 am 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.190
 the team love is really for people 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.200
 and the team-gold are the other 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.770
 people are thinking something we are one 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.030
 team 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.890
 oh my god and you can just here 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.350
 similar to boxes he will find then 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.390
 However, as here now 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.100
 better sword is made of stone a bow 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.930
 Arrows will be added and a leather shell 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.450
 i am team diamond that means we 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.800
 you should all stay together 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.890
 it also in my team christoph that 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.430
 they have where you are you are my sex 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.100
 affair 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.690
 So yes I would say there's later 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.390
 Hold still other items so the things 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.710
 but continue with level principle 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.030
 just like a shop and the like 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.290
 but we can not access now 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.190
 but there are not three here 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.020
 different varieties detective and 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.940
 innocence just just this 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.930
 three teams the complete same chance 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.660
 have with everything 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.170
 It's about being a team 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.820
 turns off opposing teams and as 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.530
 own team survives the problem at the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.480
 whole is when you live as a team 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.770
 the whole team loses its life 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.530
 from and that means when everyone lives away 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.060
 have lost the entire team and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.980
 is thrown out of the game 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.560
 that means you should play with each other 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.960
 take care of each other and thus on 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.460
 it does not have to be the whole game 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.890
 fly out because if you die the animal 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.800
 then notice at the very end as well 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.030
 also very big who died last 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.170
 is and then we just stuck to it 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.739
 really many displays on it 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.660
 videos hopefully that would be with a few 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.860
 people killed even more / b and here 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.530
 can buy things poison bombs or things 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.629
 creepers weiler - the sma body parts 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.680
 and this much like the trader a lot 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.250
 want to try because a monster 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.190
 to save 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:31.230
 not exactly the same with you but not yes 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.909
 there are still 33 percent chance 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.689
 that are the power 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:39.790
 so if it's even a bit 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:45.939
 better christoph dies does not think 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:48.250
 already i'm not best in 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.549
 the Juda daily a harm the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:56.189
 cheating mode no that just has 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:58.299
 Quiet is it true that kicked yes 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:01.329
 my ducks outside for stalker gets 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.859
 but that's how we think so here 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.209
 man does in the beginning but just with me 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.189
 A response protection sees the whole thing 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.720
 makes sure you do not get hit 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.939
 can be that it helps but also 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.340
 very much at the beginning when someone next to 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.169
 to kill a little bit which is fine with me 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:20.139
 I've noticed in the board 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:25.090
 My picture is about me 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:26.169
 have that good can directly win that 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.030
 whole is still in the closed 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.709
 alpha you can buy the al fakih 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.590
 Christof give me the link certain 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.049
 takes place in the video description and 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.980
 can over there then just yourself 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.980
 games to have fun 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.690
 that's you again 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.049
 teamlab is already out me that she then 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:51.010
 also on the cape bet the bet and well 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:53.049
 the wm still five lives the opponents knows 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.769
 that they give me we have ok there 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:59.079
 they also only have five 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:04.209
 live and how did we have to 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:05.639
 Effort here is a kevin too 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.470
 Team gold also lives three 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:10.090
 I buy now even the poison bomb the 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:16.030
 make sure that the opponents somehow 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:18.639
 dehydrated or something like that must be so funny 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.019
 But they meet directly four times 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.370
 Illuminate alone that's actually 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.620
 the game could be the gameplay 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.990
 actually that one runs around together 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.659
 and what the whole team never dies like that 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.349
 is also common that the soloists 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:35.599
 I also do not know capitalists 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:37.909
 die and you have very little opportunities as 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:41.779
 one over the lask no no 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:42.979
 Laske I said yes won and so 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:45.049
 then comes a great fireworks and 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.610
 you won and you can do it all 

00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:48.349
 playing himself the mine al fakih buys 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.839
 first or wait until the open beta 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:54.559
 or alpha there is more specific details yet 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:55.610
 always like the description and then 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:59.139
 See you next time again 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.139
 until then and protect
