00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.560
 when I was a girl a big part of me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.009
 summer was and from the beach and take advantage 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.290
 to throw me what a lizard in the sand 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.180
 to have the most intense tan possible 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.400
 obviously 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.990
 have a hat or wearing little 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.060
 blocker and seriously things have 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.710
 changed a lot with time we are 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.290
 more aware of the damage that the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.270
 sun and the sun is much stronger makes 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.700
 already several years that I got used to 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.680
 smear me of blocker but also 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.360
 to resort to a fundamental accessory 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.210
 that I can not lower the summer that is 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.010
 have a good beach hat then 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.410
 what materials are usually look 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.490
 We have natural straw materials 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.400
 we also have raffia like this 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.580
 the breed is a straw very flexible and very 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.720
 cool that lets you can also 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.780
 find with these very finite tissues 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.630
 that is also this thick fabric 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.100
 allows the air to pass then but 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.680
 the fact that the fabric is thinner 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.640
 which also makes the sun 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.640
 penetrate a little more 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.840
 tissues are not here quite subtle 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.180
 will not allow the years to pass 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.100
 pass the means or larios of appointments 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.380
 uncomfortable with enough perspiration and 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.440
 all this is a this is a very hat 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.720
 light and very cool because the idea is 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.030
 Do not squeeze that is not over 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.800
 heat value that does not tighten you 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:55.300
 feel comfortable or that you are not thinking 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:57.010
 from what the air comes and it flies behind 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.680
 not because many of these models 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.630
 we have to adapt to the size of the 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.270
 head 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.080
 I decided to start my hat tour by 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.790
 intimate 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.229
 and they really gave me all the advice 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.590
 I need to choose a good 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.540
 hat know how to take care of it and take it 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.460
 very stylish for example this one 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.160
 natural straw 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.760
 then I have those from toyo that are like 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.760
 these here 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.499
 a super cute texture 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.240
 with which everything allows you to save everything 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.560
 your look what is the coolest material 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.050
 the raffia 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.390
 when I tell you that actually the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.550
 materials is the quality is more than anything 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:45.950
 the natural diet straw the toyo each 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.950
 who has each has its advantages 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.990
 also a walk around the fair 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.050
 handicrafts 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.030
 the Inca market and there they have many 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.730
 hats also of different styles 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.569
 almost all handmade 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.200
 It is the coolest material possible for 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.330
 wear a hat or several piles 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.890
 in portal campaigns and sapone 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.890
 problematization look 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.770
 it fits me 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.710
 in this 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.400
 in the head is almost a little more than 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.400
 all the evil 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.569
 now hats are at all times what 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.980
 you can be on the beach that is 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.600
 fundamental but you can also use it 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.459
 on the day when you have to walk by 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.520
 the city ​​out there you have a hat 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.670
 as as more city dweller with one more wing 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.850
 short and it looks cute and like it 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.850
 takes care 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.390
 the water in the corner 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.050
 does not have flexibility like before 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.620
 If you feel super light, you can 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.360
 fold the chickens pack it into 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.950
 they serve to be able to take to great ways 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.450
 and it can be to remove it with clear and 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.700
 It was show because we were walking 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.260
 through the streets of miraflores 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.640
 and I'm going to that in the posts of the 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.200
 corners you can also find a 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.209
 pile of hat models 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.900

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.880
