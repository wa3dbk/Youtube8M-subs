00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.270 
today I like this I love this idea I
think<00:02:57.840> it's<00:02:57.960> really<00:02:58.110> cool<00:02:58.380> if<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.830> works<00:02:59.040> as

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
think it's really cool if it works as

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.920 
think it's really cool if it works as
promised<00:02:59.730> I<00:02:59.940> think<00:03:00.270> this<00:03:00.360> has<00:03:00.570> a<00:03:00.600> lot<00:03:00.870> of

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
promised I think this has a lot of

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.570 
promised I think this has a lot of
potential<00:03:01.230> oh<00:03:01.500> yeah<00:03:01.830> guys<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.190> can<00:03:02.340> be<00:03:02.430> by

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
potential oh yeah guys you can be by

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.580 
potential oh yeah guys you can be by
yourself<00:03:02.810> stranded<00:03:03.810> on<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.110> mountain<00:03:04.170> and

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
yourself stranded on the mountain and

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.230 
yourself stranded on the mountain and
this<00:03:05.070> drone<00:03:05.460> could<00:03:05.610> be<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.790> last<00:03:06.000> thing<00:03:06.180> that

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
this drone could be the last thing that

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.420 
this drone could be the last thing that
you<00:03:06.360> send<00:03:06.600> out<00:03:06.660> for<00:03:06.840> help<00:03:06.960> and<00:03:07.230> then<00:03:07.950> they'll

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
you send out for help and then they'll

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.580 
you send out for help and then they'll
buy<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.700> rights<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:09.420> movie<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.930> buy<00:03:10.320> your

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
slowly dying in the mountains alone I

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.270 
slowly dying in the mountains alone I
hope<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.410> doesn't<00:03:19.680> happen<00:03:19.710> I<00:03:20.010> hope<00:03:20.220> not

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
hope that doesn't happen I hope not

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.920 
hope that doesn't happen I hope not
either<00:03:20.580> up<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:21.000> does<00:03:21.120> not<00:03:21.240> have<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:21.510> but<00:03:21.750> a

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
either up that does not have you but a

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.170 
either up that does not have you but a
lot<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.230> really<00:03:22.470> practical<00:03:22.890> applications<00:03:23.670> for

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
lot of really practical applications for

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.150 
lot of really practical applications for
example<00:03:24.570> if<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:24.960> were<00:03:25.140> pretending<00:03:25.740> if<00:03:26.040> you're

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
example if you were pretending if you're

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.590 
example if you were pretending if you're
acting<00:03:26.400> in<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.790> movie<00:03:26.910> where<00:03:27.210> you<00:03:27.240> were<00:03:27.390> dying

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
acting in a movie where you were dying

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.730 
acting in a movie where you were dying
in<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.780> mountains<00:03:28.110> this<00:03:28.230> would<00:03:28.410> be<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.530> great

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
in the mountains this would be a great

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.960 
in the mountains this would be a great
point<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.160> view<00:03:29.280> shot<00:03:29.490> that<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:29.790> could<00:03:29.940> use

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
point of view shot that you could use

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.240 
point of view shot that you could use
and<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.020> would<00:03:31.110> be<00:03:31.200> inexpensive<00:03:31.800> for<00:03:31.950> student

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
and it would be inexpensive for student

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.480 
and it would be inexpensive for student
filmmakers<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.390> say<00:03:34.230> yes<00:03:34.560> on<00:03:34.890> air<00:03:35.040> dog<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.340> say

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
filmmakers so I say yes on air dog I say

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.370 
filmmakers so I say yes on air dog I say

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
it's pretty cool it's it's one of those

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.610 
it's pretty cool it's it's one of those
things<00:03:39.240> that's<00:03:39.450> going<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.900> happen<00:03:40.020> yeah<00:03:40.440> I

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
things that's going to happen yeah I

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.260 
things that's going to happen yeah I
really<00:03:40.860> like<00:03:41.010> whether<00:03:41.550> we<00:03:41.700> back<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:42.030> or<00:03:42.120> not

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
really like whether we back it or not

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.760 
really like whether we back it or not
this<00:03:42.540> will<00:03:42.810> happen<00:03:42.959> this<00:03:43.260> is<00:03:43.410> what<00:03:43.560> saying

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
this will happen this is what saying

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.410 
this will happen this is what saying
this<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.190> thing<00:03:44.340> now<00:03:44.550> and<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.090> I

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
this is the thing now and and I

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.360 
this is the thing now and and I
definitely<00:03:45.750> think<00:03:46.200> for<00:03:46.770> sure<00:03:46.800> if<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.220> have

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
definitely think for sure if you have

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.710 
definitely think for sure if you have
the<00:03:47.490> cash<00:03:47.640> but<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:48.060> can't<00:03:48.300> afford<00:03:48.540> a

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
the cash but you can't afford a

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.210 
the cash but you can't afford a
full-time<00:03:48.900> videographer<00:03:49.650> that's<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:49.920> great

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
full-time videographer that's a great

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.320 
full-time videographer that's a great
investment<00:03:50.700> in<00:03:50.970> your<00:03:51.120> production<00:03:51.540> repertoire
