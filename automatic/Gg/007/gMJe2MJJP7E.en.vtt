the top
raise<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.430> stretch<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.540> arms<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:13.590> really

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
raise up stretch the arms it's really

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.010 
raise up stretch the arms it's really
the<00:01:14.760> Pips<00:01:15.030> turning<00:01:15.390> at<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> very<00:01:15.750> end<00:01:15.900> that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
the Pips turning at the very end that

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.230 
the Pips turning at the very end that
doesn't<00:01:16.170> okay<00:01:17.090> traditionally<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.210> would

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
doesn't okay traditionally we would

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.179 
doesn't okay traditionally we would
again<00:01:18.990> place<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.259> Jo<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> ground<00:01:19.979> and

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
again place the Jo in the ground and

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.679 
again place the Jo in the ground and
then<00:01:20.280> walk<00:01:20.490> through<00:01:20.729> her<00:01:20.909> walk<00:01:21.119> away<00:01:23.330> okay

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
then walk through her walk away okay

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:39.429 
then walk through her walk away okay
so<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> test<00:01:25.790> nice<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.030> clean

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.380 

next<00:01:40.439> would<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.649> an<00:01:40.830> aura<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:41.970> one<00:01:42.240> was

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
next would be an aura so that one was

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.050 
next would be an aura so that one was
very<00:01:42.570> direct<00:01:42.899> okay<00:01:43.560> maybe<00:01:44.220> we<00:01:44.460> come<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.000> we

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
very direct okay maybe we come in and we

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.620 
very direct okay maybe we come in and we
can't<00:01:45.360> push<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:46.649> tank<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.130> cut<00:01:47.340> down<00:01:47.630> then

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
can't push the tank on cut down then

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.480 
can't push the tank on cut down then
reenter<00:01:49.549> okay<00:01:53.869> so<00:01:54.869> as<00:01:54.990> he<00:01:55.140> comes<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.649> get<00:01:56.460> to

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
reenter okay so as he comes in get to

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.399 
reenter okay so as he comes in get to
the<00:01:56.640> outside<00:01:57.000> maybe<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.600> can't<00:01:57.899> go<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.200> way

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
the outside maybe I can't go this way

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.510 
the outside maybe I can't go this way
talking<00:01:59.399> twist<00:01:59.700> when<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.659> find<00:02:00.930> space

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
talking twist when you find space

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.700 
talking twist when you find space
against<00:02:02.520> stretch<00:02:06.170> again<00:02:07.170> if<00:02:07.289> he's<00:02:07.440> doing<00:02:07.649> a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
against stretch again if he's doing a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.949 
against stretch again if he's doing a
regular<00:02:07.860> punch<00:02:08.660> technique<00:02:09.660> would<00:02:09.780> look<00:02:09.929> very

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
regular punch technique would look very

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.699 
regular punch technique would look very
similar<00:02:10.200> nice<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.280> easy<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.959> through<00:02:12.959> okay

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
similar nice and easy and through okay

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.030 
similar nice and easy and through okay
it's<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.519> exact<00:02:14.850> same<00:02:14.880> technique<00:02:15.540> even<00:02:16.040> with

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
it's the exact same technique even with

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.520 
it's the exact same technique even with
the<00:02:17.160> ski<00:02:17.340> let's<00:02:17.489> do<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.640> other<00:02:17.700> side<00:02:18.530> same

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
the ski let's do the other side same

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.209 
the ski let's do the other side same
thing<00:02:19.560> we're<00:02:19.950> gonna<00:02:20.040> get<00:02:20.280> off<00:02:20.700> line<00:02:21.530> turn<00:02:23.209> okay
