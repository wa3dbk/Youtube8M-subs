00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
all sorts of weird jumps right now it's

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.009 
all sorts of weird jumps right now it's
shaking<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.510> little<00:00:18.600> bit<00:00:22.279> but<00:00:23.539> it<00:00:24.539> just<00:00:24.810> went

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
shaking a little bit but it just went

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.359 
shaking a little bit but it just went
into<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.320> that's<00:00:25.529> reduced<00:00:25.890> engine<00:00:26.189> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
into this that's reduced engine and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.450 
into this that's reduced engine and
engine<00:00:27.090> power<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.480> reduced<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.460> stability

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
engine power is reduced and stability

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.089 
engine power is reduced and stability
track<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.210> off<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.380> traction<00:00:31.740> control

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
track is off and so is traction control

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.330 
track is off and so is traction control
and<00:00:32.969> everything<00:00:33.570> else<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.230> normal<00:00:34.559> but

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
and everything else is going normal but

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.240 
and everything else is going normal but
I<00:00:35.370> can't<00:00:35.520> go<00:00:35.910> over<00:00:36.210> about<00:00:36.559> 30<00:00:37.559> miles<00:00:37.890> an<00:00:38.100> hour

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
I can't go over about 30 miles an hour

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.670 
I can't go over about 30 miles an hour
and<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.750> put<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.050> manual<00:00:40.230> because

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and I have to put it in manual because

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.560 
and I have to put it in manual because
otherwise<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.190> doesn't<00:00:41.640> do<00:00:41.910> anything<00:00:42.390> really

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
otherwise it doesn't do anything really

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.930 
otherwise it doesn't do anything really
it<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:44.010> goes<00:00:44.070> even<00:00:44.489> slower<00:00:44.730> because

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
it just it goes even slower because

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.690 
it just it goes even slower because
he'll<00:00:45.420> move<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.899> 1<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.469> manual<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.190> it'll<00:00:47.550> move

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
he'll move in 1 in manual and it'll move

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.490 
he'll move in 1 in manual and it'll move
in<00:00:47.879> -<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.239> manual<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.930> that's<00:00:49.020> all<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> higher

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
in - in manual and that's all the higher

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.799 
in - in manual and that's all the higher
it<00:00:49.680> will<00:00:49.800> go<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.579> go<00:00:50.760> move<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.239> 3<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.750> goes

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
it will go if I go move it to 3 it goes

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.040 
it will go if I go move it to 3 it goes
back<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.440> 1<00:00:53.010> again

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
back to 1 again

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.720 
back to 1 again
so<00:00:55.050> I've<00:00:55.289> heard<00:00:55.500> few<00:00:56.160> people<00:00:56.280> who've<00:00:56.489> had<00:00:56.579> this

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.150 

my<00:02:04.210> brain

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.979 

we<00:02:08.160> brought<00:02:08.429> him<00:02:08.580> first<00:02:08.880> see<00:02:09.149> what<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.539> last

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
we brought him first see what just last

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.130 
we brought him first see what just last
time<00:02:10.170> through<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.530> first<00:02:10.860> stalled<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.520> out

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
time through the first stalled it out

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:21.940 
time through the first stalled it out
let's<00:02:13.140> try<00:02:13.349> it<00:02:13.470> here<00:02:17.239> we<00:02:18.239> go<00:02:18.390> still<00:02:19.349> weird

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
let's try it here we go still weird

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.400 
let's try it here we go still weird
nope<00:02:22.950> just<00:02:23.130> made<00:02:23.519> at<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.760> time

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
nope just made at that time

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.680 
nope just made at that time
let's<00:02:25.410> stop<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.890> put<00:02:26.300> forward<00:02:28.519> it's<00:02:29.519> fine

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
let's stop and put forward it's fine

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:42.009 
let's stop and put forward it's fine
back<00:02:32.320> into<00:02:32.560> reverse

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:52.420 

it's<00:02:43.019> very<00:02:43.230> unusual<00:02:44.299> just<00:02:45.299> click

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.890 

it's<00:02:53.430> like<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:53.879> almost<00:02:54.300> like<00:02:54.420> it's<00:02:54.569> clutched

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
it's like so almost like it's clutched

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.930 
it's like so almost like it's clutched
because<00:02:55.830> if<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.099> throw<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.370> in<00:02:56.489> first<00:02:56.790> it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
because if I throw it in first it

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.949 
because if I throw it in first it
immediately<00:02:57.180> let<00:02:57.390> go

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
immediately let go

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.390 
immediately let go
throws<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:59.069> off<00:02:59.220> really<00:02:59.549> bad<00:03:01.099> sometimes<00:03:02.099> it

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
throws it off really bad sometimes it

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.890 
throws it off really bad sometimes it
seems<00:03:02.610> like<00:03:02.760> it's<00:03:02.909> fighting<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.420> brakes<00:03:03.629> a

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
seems like it's fighting the brakes a

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.800 
seems like it's fighting the brakes a
little<00:03:04.019> bit<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:05.750> don't<00:03:06.750> know<00:03:06.900> it's<00:03:07.530> weird

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.560 
little bit I don't know it's weird
