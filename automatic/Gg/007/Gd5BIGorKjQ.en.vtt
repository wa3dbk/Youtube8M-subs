00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:04.020
 I talked about the subject of punishment 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.700
 lights for this we need 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.029
 ethics 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.449
 in those cases like 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:13.779
 efe 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.879
 four months 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.879
 let's take an extreme 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.089
 17 min 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.089
 we are at the base 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.470
 subsequently 20 centimeters 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.490
 the former couple 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.280
 the 40 centers 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.090
 the boxes the 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.090
 if you dare others 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.170
 explained that we are going to do a cadastral board we need a space of 405 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.380
 meters long 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.860
 5 meters minute 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.310
 and is that in this case 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.060
 after that macri 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.060
 ee we also need paintings we are going to use 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.580
 I think that on the night of the same Friday nothing more was specified by the father 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.540
 we have placed 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.260
 they made me reinvent myself 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.530
 after more 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.530
 present and future 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.079
 this month close 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.099
 we are going to aspire this vote 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:39.829
 It is important 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.829
 and here where the group is marked in this case 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.970
 here we have two worlds so we have to finish what they would be 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.779
 of the veto are 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:51.889
 we mark it blue 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.429
 then here we follow our outer line 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:57.429
 and we mark what would be the 1st 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.469
 later 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:08.679
 after dialing 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:15.709
 we mark I think it would be 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.719
 on 6 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.719
 subsequently 7 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.769
 as we already finished the mayor 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.669
 the wire 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.669
 let's get out of aki min 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.209
 two other boxes of amazon 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.209
 cholesterol 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.749
 of the country higuita points 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.879
 in 2007 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.389
 this does it 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:18.779
 we had already marked it before but 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.639
 a lot have been proven 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.639
 phyllis bennis 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:28.279
 let's repeat this same principle from the other side 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.259
 two 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:57.689
 as 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:00.689
 we go back to 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.539
 fraudulent marks that markel squares later 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:29.249
 I say what I enso 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.090
 we always have to be careful with the bookmark 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.129
 at the meeting 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.800
 with everybody 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.860
 yes
