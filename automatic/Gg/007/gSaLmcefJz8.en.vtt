00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:06.689
 why why landmarks 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:08.999
 story begins 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:10.399
 it's no 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:13.809
 through our association 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.859
 that of the bread oven and the hoof museum 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.720
 so from a small village near here 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.970
 on the arrival of two-year-olds 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.350
 museum that talks about deadlines and popular traditions so that the public 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.819
 want to come back to a museum 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:32.220
 they have to be alive cruyff to animations 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.270
 % and its animations 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.930
 for me I wanted to do them at the beginning 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.170
 because I'm good 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.170
 I have been interested for a long time in the history of food 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.460
 and wild edible plants 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.460
 p they are not enough to make the museum live 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.860
 by not doing animations evoked she has an opinion 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.410
 traditional 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.970
 the everyday of yesteryear in a small rural village and so I did the 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.740
 cooking at the cre 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.170
 to show visitors that 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.170
 in a fireplace makes a lot more 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.080
 grills% and so I do it 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.700
 I'm donuts you want to be silenced 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.640
 and then one day 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.030
 I remembered an old grand aunt to me I'm barely going 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.820
 known 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.890
 I ate some nettle soup 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.150
 and who rubs on nettles 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.430
 to eliminate on a track and I told myself 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.620
 we stole it 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.229
 the curiosity of visitors we will make them soup with nettles 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.330

 little worrying who says he likes 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.620

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.839
 big firms 

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:38.789
