00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.140
 you may have heard that the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.750
 necessity is the mother of inventions and a 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.570
 machine to peel cassava cassava is 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.820
 just an example of this truth 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.460
 technology has been demonstrated 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.900
 farmers in the south of santa catarina 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.720
 a few months ago 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.449
 the success was great and the equipment 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.830
 continues to draw the attention of those who handle 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.900
 with this activity 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.539
 so let's review this matter and 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.550
 show the novelty to those who have not yet 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.520
 know technology when it comes to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.660
 increase yield and productivity 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.540
 always welcome 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.629
 it further facilitates and humanizes 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.230
 harder work still better 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.469
 this further helps to avoid 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.280
 problems of an activity then is everything 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.910
 good 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.390
 because that's all this machine 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.489
 manioc pineapple peeler promises to 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.979
 machine presentation attracted 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.619
 cassava producers and beneficiaries 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.659
 of several municipalities in the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.830
 experimental station of the epagri of 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.689
 urussanga on the south coast of the state 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.420
 divided into groups received the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.500
 explanations of technicians and inventor and 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:26.700
 manufacturer on the equipment and 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.420
 it is clear the demonstration of the operation 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.530
 depending on the root the machine removes all 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.400
 or up to 90% in the house with an electric motor 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.820
 of 2 hp it can shell out about 500 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.729
 roots per hour which gives between 2000 and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.149
 2500 pounds in eight hours 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.930
 and this by nozzle which may be more than 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.850
 thousand always operated with three people 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.170
 this idea arose from a request 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.890
 of my sound which is a difficulty to 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.710
 I took the cassava away and then 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.450
 to find out if I had this machine like me 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.400
 I talked to other machine models 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.750
 I solved 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.210
 get in there almost two years ago 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.000
 we come to that point we are today 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.330
 it all came from an idea of ​​the 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.460
 cassava producer and the principle of 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.720
 operation of this machine is 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.370
 She has the razors to the 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.520
 annual feed 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.860
 there are razors that are adjustable 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.050
 according to the thickness of the bark the cassava 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.980
 itself does not matter in the thick but if not 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.070
 fulfilled 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.550
 is this she peels normal 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.020
 who deals with the processing of cassava 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.840
 is well aware of the difficulties of 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.860
 yield on the shell to work 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.860
 with scale problems with manpower up 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.000
 with labor justice with health and 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.590
 welfare of employees or the family 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.380
 aspects always considered very 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.090
 important in the company's operating 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.830
 agricultural research and rural extension 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.710
 from santa catarina 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.940
 the research work of epagri as 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.010
 jockey purposes 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.810
 she has such a view of the whole chain 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.180
 is organized with a vision of the whole 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.640
 productive chain and within this chain 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.400
 we focus on those bottlenecks those 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.650
 technological garments that make it difficult or 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.510
 business activity of whom 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.500
 want to undertake is in this type of 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.360
 activity 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.390
 then in the case of cassava one of the great 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.430
 barriers is the stripping of these industries 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.860
 our agro-industries today that are 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.540
 working with aipim offering aip in the 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.450
 have as main bottleneck 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.580
 the production work 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.230
 roots and select the best esdi 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.020
 know better to come out with this 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.810
 work in the processing part 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.210
 main bottleneck is a peeling were 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.630
 various presentations throughout the 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.820
 day and after each the opinions 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.540
 always alike 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.850
 I've been here for 20 years in this field and 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.070
 I listen to you, we have to find a machine. 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.370
 and man now he is to be congratulated for 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.280
 to achieve - the first step that he 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.470
 found it is at 50 percent that today 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.630
 that you can actually take the 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.760
 hand the allowance of 50% and I think that is already a 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.799
 great step and also because the 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.410
 difficulty left all this matter 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.680
 ready 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.350
 it has a labor cost and with 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.300
 this equipment reduces labor 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.060
 thus leaving the facility 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.770
 farmer to put the small producer 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.460
 place on your product within the 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.040
 Marketplace 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.410
 Look, I first liked it. 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.710
 because that makes it much easier, right? 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:46.250
 hand labor is wanting that one two 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.100
 parent than 67 people for a day right to 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.550
 I think it's going to be the future help. 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.660
 enough because we farmers 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.900
 mainly family farming 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.350
 We are talking about the father's mother but the bell 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.380
 the cost it is all very sacrificed and 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.330
 they are often going to leave here or 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.850
 sit there and things will come out more 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.880
 difficult because the workforce is 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:15.320
 zhu sacrificed pácoa get the rears in 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.870
 tip of the knife working well ben ali the 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.770
 couple another little help to take 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.030
 two hundred pounds on the day leave ready 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.560
 it's not easy 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:32.650
 and that this way will you with 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.650
 a help from them take well 1 2 thousand kilos
