00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.579
 hello everyone's it's bibi 26 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.989
 via x is good for my channel and 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.769
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:34.720
 new tutorial on minecraft is safe 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:37.960
 the craft of the crossbow more precisely 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.589
 for the server visited imaginary 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.960
 kraft 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.089
 so that's what you'll need in jade 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.850
 steel which are in 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:49.480
 clashes where I am or finally what I 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.760
 want to believe and so you have to 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.180
 harvest with pickaxe here 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:00.309
 simply he often finds himself on 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:02.019
 the upper walls so aaa and yyt this 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.199
 Berth by 4 it must be done 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.050
 wildlife like do it so so then 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.820
 spend in the natural world there is 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.500
 ours have seen diamonds it will us 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.020
 need diamond too for the craft 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:20.470
 crossbow 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:25.630
 here is the diamond and we return to the 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:30.640
 surface return to our little 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.229
 hut here is where we will find everything 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.750
 that we need for kraft and our 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.530
 small crossbow 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:42.220
 so we're going to need 3 of the thread after 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.569
 of steel stick and a diamond of which I 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.970
 will explain to you for the sticks 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.520
 dassier it will just have to 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.000
 miner's leather to dassier then we 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.649
 let's cook quietly 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.319
 while we are recovering from 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:01.030
 century or flint to English ben what he 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.470
 ya I believe one in eight chance of the 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.590
 recover at sea but here I have a 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.770
 pickaxe enchanted fortune 3 is a Belgian 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.379
 to come and therefore necessarily I 160 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:16.120
 chances of water 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:19.360
 so here is our currency 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.269
 dassier cooked and we will be able 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.920
 make sticks so we take us 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.310
 do like the fears of wood and 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.200
 we are steel concrete beings so 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.830
 now let's move on to the craft of 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.950
 crossbow 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.500
 as promised so we will do the 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.440
 narc pattern with sticks or a 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.940
 triangle as you want we will 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.690
 put son like that so always 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.120
 like an arc 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.709
 except that for better position of our there 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.430
 dead and here it gives us our share 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.920
 whale so of course I do not have 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.030
 of chaos so I could not pulled 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.430
 finally the beaches of lara baladi sport 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.440
 favorite so we will make it to you 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.769
 who will we need flint 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.329
 steel and more again so 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.569
 we are going exactly like 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:06.849
 arrows and except that we replace 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.690
 not in steel stick in the middle 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.540
 we have 16 crossbow tiles so 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.079
 here we are going to change our material 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.750
 we will see the peculiarities of 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.340
 this of this new weapon 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.380
 so she can without singing like you 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.019
 can see him doing so we're going 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.790
 try in a championship and I'm going 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.510
 put me in game to donations to do this 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.130
 yeah so the first at level 30 of 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.489
 power three Flemish what is 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.400
 really not bad there the second 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.639
 power 3 just would like to have 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.329
 A flame 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:49.780
 yes if hadj to that one we will say 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.940
 that we will take the flame here 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.370
 we take our carola we will do 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.349
 some shooting tests so I'm recovering 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.859
 in zero mode game because it will not be 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.790
 not easy because there was so for the 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.500
 feathers I forgot to specify 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.370
 it's the chickens you kill 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.930
 the options and you get to go over 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.209
 far 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:14.819
 sorry everyone here it's true 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.919
 you get ads and new 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.630
 on the wise because it's good the 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.690
 raw chicken cooked 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.210
 finally how do we want what so voila 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.979
 all every red cube will represent 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:31.650
 says m so between here and there there is 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.270
 ten cubes or said m here and there we 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.500
 let's really get to the pixel 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.530
 close so you see 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.180
 this is the black series to the pixel 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.300
 and with a speed 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.380
 frankly amazing 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.949
 so we are going to put ourselves now 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.530
 at 20 cubic and we'll be able to pull 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.570
 like pixel by pixel almost it's 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.400
 instantaneous 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.680
 incredible we will also be able to 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.169
 draws 30 cubes with one more time 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.650
 really surprising speed but we 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.750
 let's have to pull slightly lightened the 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.090
 shift 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.039
 we will go a little further 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.110
 so she's going to need three four blocks 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.110
 story doubled on my little mountain 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:18.810
 here and we will try to shoot 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.630
 so there I do not know he must have well 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.800
 40 blog almost so I do not know I 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.750
 little graphic bugs 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.669
 so I hope my paintings are not going 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.190
 disappear like that but well here I am 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.229
 lightly touched perfectly so you 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.849
 see from cardinals who is going 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.740
 have to pull in much cubes 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.599
 on it so what is really not 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.030
 a lot 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:41.610
 after you have to be good shooter must be good 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.860
 know how to calculate I saw all the 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:48.389
 paintings was reduced to ashes and not 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.979
 a single checkered task missed his 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.009
 goal since it's a fair weapon 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.240
 overpowered so then was 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.990
 interested in fighting 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.800
 what is it just she 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.870
 is overpowered 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.470
 so as I 've already told many 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.479
 times she is extremely fast even from 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:10.259
 far so what is perfect to do 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.500
 rather discreet shots is still pretty 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:12.930
 far 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.940
 so here I speak for pvp has of course 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.350
 you 're not going to have fun having fun 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:21.450
 to make a small in discrete on their life 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:24.330
 because if you are a little disturbed and that's it 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.740
 ok ok well listen it's a week or 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.600
 well good about yourself servers 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.760
 imaginary kraft pass a good 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.650
 day subscribe to my channel puts a 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.960
 little like because I think it's okay 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:37.880
 bring labor courts 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.880
 and here you go hi everyone
