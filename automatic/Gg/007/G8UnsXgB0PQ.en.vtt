 Malaga 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.870
 santa catarina mita in the municipalities with more interesting history 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.210
 it is not for less the history that keeps this party 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.890
 because its origins go back to the 11th and 12th centuries of our era 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.090
 when they did their first years 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.620
 the writer josé mile y vidaurre in his work historia del america 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.190
 compiles the monographic essay of santa catarina mita 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.210
 the also writer adalberto flores 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.210
 because this region was chosen to 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.710
 according to history the first ethnic groups and reach this region by 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.330
 some Toltec Pipil tribes and little else 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.730
 originally from the central plateau of mexico 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.730
 who because of war emigrated to Guatemalan lands 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.770
 the researcher and humanist ricardo castañeda paganini deepens even more 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.140
 in research on the migration of these 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.650
 what leads me to write well as effective also look at the details 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.110
 of the event 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.409
 who ran with better luck to live together like the one in guatemala 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.940
 Because the Pipiles and the two decades did not get a good relationship 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.030
 with june 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.110
 This situation forced the Toltec textiles little more looked for to find a 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.720
 uninhabited area where to install them create an exodus of these 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.430
 tribes for all the samples 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.720
 going through escuintla where they did not stop their step 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.429
 continuing its displacement 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.819
 looking at what we know today as Saturday 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.879
 without first having passed through a copy 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.500
 that is how they were established along the south coast of Guatemala 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:22.989
 this makes us suppose that after the displacement the kingdom 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.089
 and Mictlán was founded in the nineteenth century 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:29.509
 for the pipiles and toltecas in the area coespo cup atescatempa the progress 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.169
 all a Zionist and santa catarina mita parties loving rain shower 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.629
 nuns unemployment 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.189
 one of the main reasons they found in that area to found the 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.009
 King did not enter was the upright vegetation 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.139
 as well as its climate and a lot of shed team 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:52.299
 the kingdom of mictlan was one of the greatest powerful important telluric 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.079
 that is why he did not escape to the fight for the conquest of part of the stars 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:00.419
 there are no exact data of the date of the conquest of this sector 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.889
 although we do know what date in 1530 so the house 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.009
 for captains hernando de chávez 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:09.069
 but of mali 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.349
 the origin of wealth was not an easy thing to be 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.519
 previously the people of panza cúpte had submitted 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.429
 but upon arriving in these lands they met with an army of 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:25.019
 increments that took long battles defending his kingdom which caused 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.189
 bloody clashes 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.819
 After the conquest of the Mictlán, Pedro Moroz was given the command 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.790
 the head of the military forces but not before Captain Ivan Chaves had 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.829
 the privilege to give the name of santa catarina mita to this agency 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.679
 these according to story tells I can give your daughter three inmates 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:45.149
 whom he had called Qatari 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:48.799
 in my memory of the virgin of santa catarina the half for being the king not 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.389
 they enter before conquest 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.459
 from that time santa catarina mita has been conceived as a forum of 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.709
 presidents 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.709
 it can be reflected in their traditions
