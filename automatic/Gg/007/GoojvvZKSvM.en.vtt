00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.970
 also come to common through the 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.610
 music at this time we are going to learn 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:15.820
 another song that consists of four 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:19.720
 chords and consists of the tail of the 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.420
 my youngest and be older and this song is 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.060
 play in this way 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.980
 we locate the whole position of the king and 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.170
 we do with the right hands we are going to 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.170
 make 2 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.820
 it's the same as what we did in class 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.649
 previous the same the same rodeo that if 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.930
 I put your eyes now we are 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.620
 doing with this song then we 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.620
 we dedicate in the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.170
 less 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.800
 my minor 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.149
 it's a little similar to my older but 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.180
 simply what we are going to do is 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.090
 limit if we are transporting these 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.570
 two fingers from here 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.970
 the number 25 finger of the third number two 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.920
 and number two on the rope number 4 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.229
 of trance number 2 nothing else is what 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.710
 we do simply and finally we play 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.710
 in the sun 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.960
 yes 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.720
 net 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.080
 the greatest 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.080
 and less 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.799
 and be older 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.040
 and again the song is repeated with the 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.780
 same always harmonious very well to these 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.810
 heights I also learned to play the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.680
 song another song using four 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.570
