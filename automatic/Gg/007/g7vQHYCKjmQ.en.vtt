00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:11.469
 - sinn's work always has me 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.000
 interested because we made 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.830
 industrial tours during my 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.480
 model in pulp and paper I made 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.410
 also internships my first internship at 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.210
 earth we are from elsewhere 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.720
 and 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.009
 the pipes machine the machine alone 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.380
 I felt good in there 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.009
 I think it smells good the zone of 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.009
 by the parties 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.620
 where we work less every day 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.840
 it is to look among the rollers to 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.820
 inspecting us to go see do some 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.340
 tests on the optical tests of 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.890
 physical tests of tasto on 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.220
 paper properties the impression of 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.900
 porosity totally one looks purse the 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.640
 built and bang 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.800
 for our client because we have 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.730
 standards to respect for each serious 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.730
 each of the clients 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.280
 the two types of paper on which I 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.379
 works it's the papers the paper to 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.450
 naked to us it's a compromise grade 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.010
 the white pages the yellow pages of 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.390
 directory 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.670
 I also work on paper for 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.410
 circulars because it's us 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.240
 will have our paper sold here for 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.600
 to make advertising inserts 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.300
 the chips will arrive within 2.10 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.940
 on fixed indexes and 1,200 in rotation and 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.770
 by the rotation the mechanical force we go 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.140
 break the chips we will separate the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.090
 fibers and so weak are going to be recovered 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.009
 in the basket the continuing education at 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.720
 CEGEP of three rivers was introduced to 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.650
 take away paper a training of three 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.170
 years at college level 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.670
 are we going to learn that's all 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.560
 all the information concerning 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.970
 the evaluation of the material that enters 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.680
 in factories how to evaluate these 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.910
 Contents 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.350
 what processes are used to 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.320
 transform the raw material a 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.149
 parent or cardboard paper we do not have the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.619
 operation of the processes and then 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.070
 finally, but the evaluation of 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.110
 products 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.580
 the assessment of the little cartons the 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.660
 transformation of these doping products 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.550
 the printing process 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.819
 but as long as the facts are separated 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.170
 mechanically we can observe them as 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.149
 papermaking could be the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.440
 describe a little more in three stages the 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.520
 first step it would be first of all 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.920
 take a raw material 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.450
 then to turn into talks either by a 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.730
 chemical action to release the targets 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.040
 either by a mechanical action in a 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.660
 second step would be all 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.010
 changes that will be made to this 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.840
 partisan circus we will be born in 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.550
 the appart a purpose to make a paper with 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.230
 very special properties the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.730
 making a sheet by hand 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.010
 it's the same as on a machine with 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.689
 paper with big salaries 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.459
 then the third most important 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.470
 it's the transformation of a part into 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.819
 liquid transform that by being solid 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.819
 which is a paper or a cardboard 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.700
 there is the taste it is the machine what a beautiful 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.330
 wet noises but what the 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.380
 wood fiber comes with water 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.990
 mainly 99% of the mi6 could not 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.970
 is moment then the fish but lol it 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.080
 pose in the prince to eliminate the 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.380
 mildest 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.370
 then it goes in the dryers the past 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.370
 it's a long time we are made loop 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.850
 it's not a job that goes 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.190
 every day it's different 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.750
 different problems to solve 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.270
 I'm also working on the calibration 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.040
 equipment that makes it possible to read 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.950
 paper properties continuously on the 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.690
 machine we call that a scoop 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.310
 that's very interesting too it's 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.380
 important to make sure that this device 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.330
 it's good because that's what will 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.830
 to believe what we are 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.270
 still shocked me I look at you and the 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.490
 constancy the crate to always arrive 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.600
 not received the consciousness tests on 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.540
 ventured the 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.210
 we also see 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.620
 the reader Nabeul 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.930
 this is what serves us as standards 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.030
 sexy lab reading I give a 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.440
 misreading is well the device has to 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.670
 be calibrated in a way that is 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.790
 robben who at that moment all the 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.030
 continuous readouts to be able to be will be 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.280
 not necessarily bullet and quality 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.980
 we will be looking for our students 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.780
 it is first of all a good knowledge 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.580
 scientist we have training in 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.970
 chemistry and physics of mathematics 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.430
 there is the logical aspect also finally 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.080
 I believe it is the need for concrete 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.000
 it is a major asset 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.460
 we see the complete actions that we do 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.080
 on a product those who are attracted by 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.690
 concrete things and many of the 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.920
 abstract scientific knowledge 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.670
 generally performed very well in a 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.670
 post as m 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.440
 it was still working 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.690
 with a team it may be necessary 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.270
 the crazy people like to participate or that 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:46.650
 you love her more than teamwork 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:48.300
 help the workers the prospects 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.160
 it's really great 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.620
 can count on four puffs 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.300
 different the one that is the most 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.620
 popular because MPs are 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.300
 huge for the next few years it's 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.940
 the cooperation of equipment 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.310
 processes the second outlet 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.050
 interesting his representatives we're going 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.050
 work not for a potter but 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.340
 work for suppliers or 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.720
 third job function is the 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.940
 technicians who worked in the 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.710
 laboratories to evaluate properties 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.540
 papers or cartons and finally 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.340
 an interesting outlet also 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.930
 completely different is working 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.400
 in research centers at 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.990
 develop new methods of 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.030
 scene especially develop new ones 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.130
 analyzed products of the papers of 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.369
 competitors to optimize the 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.339
 production of a factory 

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:33.809
 of years I'm going to have a very big challenge 

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:36.269
 we have a new paper machine that is 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:38.129
 under construction with a paper type 

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:39.349
 we do not manufacture here present our prices 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.909
 coated paper 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.709
 so we will see game but I like a lot 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.719
 quality tests to do or shares 

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:47.219
 of this machine we a lot of 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:50.789
 settings just above on 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:53.509
 musiquemag against I have at 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.509
 conference board
