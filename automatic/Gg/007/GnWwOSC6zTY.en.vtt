00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
familiar with the dorian scale you would

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.700 
familiar with the dorian scale you would
want<00:00:43.610> to<00:00:43.730> start<00:00:43.850> this<00:00:44.540> particular<00:00:44.870> D<00:00:45.410> flat

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710

Dorian scale on the sixth fret on the
sixth<00:00:48.500> string<00:00:48.559> and<00:00:48.949> you<00:00:49.040> want<00:00:49.309> to<00:00:49.400> play<00:00:49.519> one

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
sixth string and you want to play one

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.759 
sixth string and you want to play one
three<00:00:50.480> four<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:51.650> that's<00:00:51.769> six<00:00:52.100> eight<00:00:52.970> and<00:00:53.239> nine

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
three four so that's six eight and nine

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.530 
three four so that's six eight and nine
then<00:00:54.769> you'd<00:00:55.280> want<00:00:55.309> to<00:00:55.640> put<00:00:55.970> the<00:00:56.089> fifth<00:00:56.330> string

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
then you'd want to put the fifth string

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.799 
then you'd want to put the fifth string
and<00:00:56.809> do<00:00:56.900> six<00:00:58.150> same<00:00:59.150> thing<00:00:59.390> on<00:00:59.480> the<00:00:59.570> fourth

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809

third string six and nine on the second
string<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:05.649> then<00:01:06.649> the<00:01:06.710> same<00:01:06.920> thing<00:01:07.130> on<00:01:07.250> the

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
string and then the same thing on the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.130 
string and then the same thing on the
first<00:01:07.460> string<00:01:07.759> it's<00:01:08.300> at<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.509> scale<00:01:08.750> of<00:01:08.780> human

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
first string it's at the scale of human

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:20.050 
first string it's at the scale of human
being<00:01:17.560> and<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:18.649> also<00:01:18.800> can<00:01:19.100> find<00:01:19.369> this<00:01:19.820> shape

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
with exercises for the shape in the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.859 
with exercises for the shape in the
scale<00:01:22.789> section<00:01:23.180> at<00:01:23.300> practice<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.780> guitar

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
scale section at practice the guitar

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:31.359 
scale section at practice the guitar
calm<00:01:24.789> this<00:01:25.789> is<00:01:26.149> a<00:01:28.869> minor<00:01:29.869> scale<00:01:30.259> over<00:01:30.950> the

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
calm this is a minor scale over the

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.859 
calm this is a minor scale over the
natural<00:01:31.549> sixth<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.960> natural<00:01:33.350> minor<00:01:33.500> scale

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
natural sixth the natural minor scale

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.950 
natural sixth the natural minor scale
flat<00:01:35.869> six

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.999 

so<00:01:39.960> there's<00:01:40.140> really<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.500> difference<00:01:40.860> between

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
so there's really the difference between

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.800 
so there's really the difference between
the<00:01:41.280> Dorian<00:01:41.640> mode<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.240> natural<00:01:42.600> minor

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the Dorian mode and the natural minor

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.920 
the Dorian mode and the natural minor
scale<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:44.750> this<00:01:45.750> particular<00:01:46.079> lick<00:01:46.530> starts

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
scale and this particular lick starts

00:01:47.930 --> 00:02:20.699 
scale and this particular lick starts
sixth<00:01:48.930> fret<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.740> second<00:01:50.039> string

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.339 

and<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.939> can<00:02:22.090> see<00:02:22.269> in<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.629> way<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:25.349> keep

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
and you can see in this way I keep

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.449 
and you can see in this way I keep
making<00:02:26.439> a<00:02:26.680> big<00:02:26.859> deal<00:02:26.980> about<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.250> G<00:02:29.459> that's

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
making a big deal about that G that's

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.840 
making a big deal about that G that's
the<00:02:30.579> sixth<00:02:30.849> degree<00:02:30.969> in<00:02:31.180> this<00:02:31.299> key

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.340 

and<00:02:36.850> then<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.450> last<00:02:37.660> two<00:02:37.870> measures<00:02:37.990> of<00:02:38.170> the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
and then the last two measures of the

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:52.410 
and then the last two measures of the
phrase<00:02:38.590> goes

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.730 

if<00:02:53.420> those<00:02:53.570> are<00:02:53.720> all<00:02:53.810> 16th<00:02:54.140> note<00:02:54.290> triplets<00:02:54.320> at

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
if those are all 16th note triplets at

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:07.330 
if those are all 16th note triplets at
the<00:02:54.830> very<00:02:54.980> end<00:02:59.740> so<00:03:05.680> that's<00:03:06.680> really<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:07.010> key<00:03:07.100> to

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
the very end so that's really the key to

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:21.100 
the very end so that's really the key to
the<00:03:07.700> Dorian<00:03:08.090> mode<00:03:19.300> about<00:03:20.300> that<00:03:20.540> knowing<00:03:20.990> your

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
the Dorian mode about that knowing your

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.800 
the Dorian mode about that knowing your
phrasing<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:21.740> if<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:22.880> choose<00:03:23.270> to<00:03:23.300> practice

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
phrasing and if you choose to practice

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.180 
phrasing and if you choose to practice
this<00:03:23.930> for<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.200> backing<00:03:24.500> track<00:03:24.680> you're<00:03:24.830> really

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
this for the backing track you're really

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:34.060 
this for the backing track you're really
gonna<00:03:25.310> hear<00:03:32.200> when<00:03:33.200> you<00:03:33.290> go<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.500> play<00:03:33.710> it's<00:03:34.040> a

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
gonna hear when you go to play it's a

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.890 
gonna hear when you go to play it's a
really<00:03:34.580> really<00:03:34.820> unique<00:03:34.970> sound<00:03:35.420> here's<00:03:35.750> the

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
really really unique sound here's the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:57.970 
really really unique sound here's the
phrase<00:03:36.170> at<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.500> slower<00:03:36.800> tempo

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.080 

and<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.099> ending<00:03:59.400> part<00:03:59.610> is<00:03:59.730> probably<00:03:59.849> the

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
and that ending part is probably the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:08.600 
and that ending part is probably the
trickiest<00:04:06.860> I'm<00:04:07.860> doing<00:04:08.129> there<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.310> I'm<00:04:08.430> only

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
trickiest I'm doing there is I'm only

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.729 
trickiest I'm doing there is I'm only
picking<00:04:08.879> when<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.209> get<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.510> new<00:04:09.720> string<00:04:10.049> so

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
picking when I get to a new string so

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.259 
picking when I get to a new string so
the<00:04:11.010> very<00:04:11.190> first<00:04:11.459> note<00:04:11.579> on<00:04:11.640> each<00:04:11.819> string<00:04:12.120> is

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
the very first note on each string is

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.729 
the very first note on each string is
the<00:04:12.420> only<00:04:12.690> note<00:04:12.840> that's<00:04:13.019> picked<00:04:15.500> I'm<00:04:16.500> not

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
the only note that's picked I'm not

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.430
