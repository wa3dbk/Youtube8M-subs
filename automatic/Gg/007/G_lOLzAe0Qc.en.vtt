 yellow parallelepiped i 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.690
 I think we do something a hundred years ago that hurts 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.380
 something like that has already drawn a theme 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.660

 capital is modern 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:13.800

 signature toilet is not working I became 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.790

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:37.780
