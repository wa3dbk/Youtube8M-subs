this hose that runs up enough to go

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.350 
this hose that runs up enough to go
inside<00:01:13.920> weather<00:01:14.220> where<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> fuel<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.090> sitting

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
inside weather where the fuel is sitting

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.780 
inside weather where the fuel is sitting
out<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.750> got<00:01:15.840> my<00:01:15.900> mush<00:01:16.470> stuff<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:16.890> okay<00:01:17.070> so
