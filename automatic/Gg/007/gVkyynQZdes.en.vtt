00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
I'm sure a lot of you guys know what I'm

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.150 
I'm sure a lot of you guys know what I'm
talking<00:00:51.570> about<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.170> I'm<00:00:52.230> not<00:00:52.379> gonna<00:00:52.500> spoil<00:00:52.860> it

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
talking about but I'm not gonna spoil it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.709 
talking about but I'm not gonna spoil it
and<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.910> doesn't<00:00:54.120> look<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.480> game<00:00:54.690> is

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
and it doesn't look like the game is

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.020 
and it doesn't look like the game is
that<00:00:55.379> long<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.039> i<00:00:56.070> may<00:00:56.340> consider<00:00:56.699> doing<00:00:56.910> that

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that long so i may consider doing that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.630 
that long so i may consider doing that
before<00:00:57.890> transformers<00:00:58.890> fall<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.190> Cybertron

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640

before transformers fall of Cybertron
and<00:00:59.820> then<00:01:00.090> maybe<00:01:00.570> some<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.170> would<00:01:01.289> go<00:01:01.410> into

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
and then maybe some of it would go into

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.770 
and then maybe some of it would go into
the<00:01:02.340> transformers<00:01:02.879> fall<00:01:03.059> Cybertron<00:01:03.570> but

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
sure on what my thoughts are exactly on

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.649 
sure on what my thoughts are exactly on
it<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.340> could<00:02:02.399> handle<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.000> three<00:02:03.210> games<00:02:03.420> I

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
it if I could handle the three games I

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.929 
it if I could handle the three games I
will<00:02:03.960> definitely<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.469> but<00:02:05.280> I'm<00:02:05.520> thinking

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
will definitely do that but I'm thinking

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.300 
will definitely do that but I'm thinking
about<00:02:06.119> doing<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:07.020> one<00:02:07.350> game<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> older

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
about doing this one game it's the older

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.949 
about doing this one game it's the older
game<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:09.239> know<00:02:09.300> some<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.690> are<00:02:09.810> probably

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
game and I know some of you are probably

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.780

actually<00:02:15.340> no<00:02:15.579> one<00:02:15.730> has<00:02:15.879> ever<00:02:16.060> done<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.569> let's

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
actually no one has ever done a let's

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.550 
actually no one has ever done a let's
play<00:02:17.129> honest<00:02:18.129> on<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:19.030> YouTube<00:02:19.750> world<00:02:20.230> I

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
play honest on the YouTube world I

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.929 
play honest on the YouTube world I
actually<00:02:20.769> did<00:02:21.040> some<00:02:21.159> research<00:02:21.340> well<00:02:21.790> there

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
actually did some research well there

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.089 
actually did some research well there
was<00:02:22.090> kind<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:22.719> one<00:02:22.900> but<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.260> was<00:02:23.379> done<00:02:23.560> with<00:02:23.799> a

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
was kind of one but it was done with a

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.580 
was kind of one but it was done with a
very<00:02:24.760> old<00:02:25.000> like<00:02:25.209> standard<00:02:25.629> definition<00:02:26.140> camera

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
very old like standard definition camera

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.740 
very old like standard definition camera
so<00:02:27.099> I<00:02:27.129> don't<00:02:27.459> consider<00:02:27.849> that<00:02:27.969> really<00:02:28.359> counting

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
so I don't consider that really counting

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.759 
so I don't consider that really counting
too<00:02:28.900> much<00:02:29.109> but<00:02:29.879> that<00:02:30.879> is<00:02:31.209> kind<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.629> my<00:02:32.170> channel

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
too much but that is kind of my channel

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.030 
too much but that is kind of my channel
update<00:02:33.220> i<00:02:33.250> guess<00:02:33.609> thus<00:02:33.970> far<00:02:34.329> so<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.620> just<00:02:35.859> want

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
update i guess thus far so I just want

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.940 
update i guess thus far so I just want
to<00:02:36.099> let<00:02:36.159> you<00:02:36.340> guys<00:02:36.579> know<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.780> there<00:02:38.260> are<00:02:38.439> two

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
games planned for the future and three

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.309 
games planned for the future and three
games<00:02:42.609> if<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:42.909> include<00:02:43.359> fall<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.870> Cybertron

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
in the count but it should probably be

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.429 
in the count but it should probably be
included<00:02:49.389> for<00:02:49.420> like<00:02:49.659> four<00:02:49.989> different<00:02:50.109> games
