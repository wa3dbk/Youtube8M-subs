00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 return your fears to a new video 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.839
 good seems to be that they come to light or 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.910
 the achievements of assassin's come to light 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.950
 creed rock good achievements trophies and others 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.540
 but well we could say that they are 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.400
 which are achievements because they put a 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.949
 score you put it is a trophy of 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.270
 bronze silver or gold and good the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.640
 trophies for the you have the description 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.279
 translated into Spanish and so on 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.869
 put to read it because I see it a little 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.460
 subnormal and really stupid because 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.500
 I do not want to reveal anything of the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.179
 story and then you tell me son of 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.920
 bitch I can not pass the video and more 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.210
 fucked up the whole story that in many 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.149
 Sometimes that's why you put it on me and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.500
 It does not fucking do it, I guess it does not 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.660
 does not fucking so grace so poor to see in 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.590
 the story so as I say for the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.590
 Decision trains directly 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.470
 in the game in those exceptional stretches 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.540
 producing achievements and so on 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.580
 Well basically I'll summarize 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.160
 quite also the list in many of 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.050
 they are completing sequences and 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.120
 others and complete them one hundred percent 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.860
 as more difficult trophies or more achievements 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.129
 difficult we could say complete everything 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.160
 and a little more there are no typical ones 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.920
 are quite similar we could say or 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.210
 there are not enough with the boat and others 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.940
 that also has to be said that there 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.790
 enough that are with boats and all this 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.659
 and as I say the other half we could 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.609
 say that this is 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.130
 is that complete sequences and 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:24.289
 complete it one hundred percent challenge two 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.399
 missions and all this when you have 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.979
 pretty well explained in the 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.539
 description and good you know this game 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.640
 will come out in November and has a pint 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.829
 also quite pretty good we will see 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.149
 to see if if if then it is that 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.799
 create them is register they always have 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.289
 good looking and then later we take 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.179
 disappointment is quite huge not in 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.890
 Sometimes it's me at least and another 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.840
 because what they like directly 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.399
 but I really want to see you 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.340
 something new something totally different 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.590
 something revolutionary and we will see to see with 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.459
 a community that seems like it can be 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.709
 well but with the east with the with the 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.539
 robbery do not know I do yes that at least in 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:03.100
 story yes it's going to be totally 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.900
 different not being able to handle one 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.400
 Yes a Templar to be 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.200
 different so good nothing else 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.970
 I leave you guys as I say the achievements in 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.970
