now<00:00:00.149> here's<00:00:00.329> something<00:00:00.630> that<00:00:00.930> you<00:00:01.020> just<00:00:01.260> don't

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
now here's something that you just don't

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.999 
now here's something that you just don't
see<00:00:01.620> every<00:00:01.979> day<00:00:03.020> I'll<00:00:04.020> talk<00:00:04.259> about<00:00:04.290> it<00:00:04.740> more<00:00:04.980> in

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
see every day I'll talk about it more in

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.000 
see every day I'll talk about it more in
just<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.460> minute<00:00:05.660> back<00:00:06.660> in<00:00:06.839> 1984<00:00:07.680> when<00:00:07.980> the

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
just a minute back in 1984 when the

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.160 
just a minute back in 1984 when the
original<00:00:08.280> Macintosh<00:00:08.700> came<00:00:09.389> out<00:00:09.599> from<00:00:09.840> Apple

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
original Macintosh came out from Apple

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.610 
original Macintosh came out from Apple
Computer<00:00:11.059> it<00:00:12.059> was<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> desktop<00:00:12.900> computer<00:00:13.139> and

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
Computer it was a desktop computer and

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.589 
Computer it was a desktop computer and
that<00:00:13.710> was<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.130> had<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.549> carrying<00:00:14.969> handle<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
that was it had a carrying handle in the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.300 
that was it had a carrying handle in the
top<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.139> could<00:00:16.350> take<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.770> with<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.160> at

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
top so you could take it with you at

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.769 
top so you could take it with you at
least<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:17.730> theory<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.359> wasn't<00:00:18.660> very

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
least in theory but it wasn't very

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.170 
least in theory but it wasn't very
portable<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.590> pretty<00:00:20.310> soon<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.760> number<00:00:20.939> of

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
portable and pretty soon a number of

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.870 
portable and pretty soon a number of
companies<00:00:21.539> both<00:00:21.930> legally<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.680> not<00:00:22.880> stepped

companies both legally and not stepped
in<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.300> produce<00:00:24.830> Macintosh<00:00:25.830> portable

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.319 
well eventually in the late 1980s Apple
finally<00:00:31.050> answered<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.859> call<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.759> Macintosh

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
finally answered the call for Macintosh

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.139 
finally answered the call for Macintosh
portable<00:00:33.829> now<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> lot<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.280> people<00:00:35.640> think<00:00:35.910> that

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
portable now a lot of people think that

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.510 
portable now a lot of people think that
the<00:00:36.420> first<00:00:36.809> Macintosh<00:00:37.350> portable<00:00:37.890> machines

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the first Macintosh portable machines

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.330 
the first Macintosh portable machines
were<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.180> PowerBook<00:00:39.809> series<00:00:40.350> such<00:00:41.070> as<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the black-and-white displays but that's

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.180 
the black-and-white displays but that's
not<00:00:46.559> quite<00:00:46.829> true

there<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:48.270> an<00:00:48.719> apple<00:00:49.260> produced<00:00:49.789> Macintosh

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
there was an apple produced Macintosh

there was an apple produced Macintosh
portable<00:00:51.120> made<00:00:52.079> before<00:00:52.710> those<00:00:52.890> machines<00:00:53.370> and

portable made before those machines and

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.650 
portable made before those machines and
it<00:00:54.329> was<00:00:54.510> called<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.620> Macintosh<00:00:56.250> portable

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
it was called the Macintosh portable

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.779 
it was called the Macintosh portable
these<00:00:57.660> aren't<00:00:58.050> exactly<00:00:58.710> impossible<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.550> find

but neither are they common and this was

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.789 
but neither are they common and this was
a<00:01:02.520> lucky<00:01:02.910> find<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> newspaper<00:01:04.019> classified

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
a lucky find and a newspaper classified

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
there for several days I called him up

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.000 
there for several days I called him up
thinking<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.409> would<00:01:10.470> probably<00:01:10.830> already

I<00:01:28.290> don't<00:01:28.860> think<00:01:29.070> there's<00:01:29.250> anything<00:01:29.460> that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
I don't think there's anything that

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.969 
I don't think there's anything that

the hardware is there the system unit is

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.679 
the hardware is there the system unit is
complete<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.799> great<00:01:35.040> condition<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.600> the

complete and in great condition but the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.749 
complete and in great condition but the
problem<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.259> these<00:01:37.470> machines<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.549> have<00:01:38.729> a

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
problem is these machines have to have a

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.499 
problem is these machines have to have a
functional<00:01:39.509> battery<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.170> order<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.920> boot<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
functional battery in order to boot and

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.030 
functional battery in order to boot and
that's<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.600> bit<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.930> problem<00:01:43.170> because<00:01:43.740> as

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
that's a bit of a problem because as

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.950 
that's a bit of a problem because as
you'll<00:01:44.220> see<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.700> battery<00:01:45.000> that's<00:01:45.240> used<00:01:45.570> is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
you'll see the battery that's used is

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.350 
you'll see the battery that's used is
rather<00:01:46.530> unique<00:01:46.799> let's<00:01:47.790> go<00:01:47.939> ahead<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.329> open

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
rather unique let's go ahead and open

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.069 
rather unique let's go ahead and open
the<00:01:48.659> case<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:48.899> have<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> look<00:01:49.560> all<00:01:50.310> right

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
the case and have a look all right

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.200 
the case and have a look all right
that's<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.170> case<00:01:52.380> unzipped<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.189> there<00:01:54.090> the

remanufactured by its previous owner and
the<00:05:16.030> only<00:05:16.180> problem<00:05:16.419> with<00:05:16.720> that<00:05:16.780> is<00:05:16.960> the

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
the only problem with that is the

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.279 
the only problem with that is the
company<00:05:17.620> that<00:05:17.700> remanufactured<00:05:18.700> it<00:05:19.169> did<00:05:20.169> not

company that remanufactured it did not

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:22.200 
company that remanufactured it did not
remanufacture<00:05:21.220> it<00:05:21.340> with<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.580> same<00:05:21.820> chemistry

remanufacture it with the same chemistry
I<00:05:22.630> believe<00:05:23.260> that<00:05:23.500> I<00:05:23.590> was<00:05:23.710> told<00:05:23.950> they<00:05:24.160> put<00:05:24.400> my

however<00:05:54.190> I've<00:05:54.310> a<00:05:54.340> great<00:05:54.610> deal<00:05:54.880> of<00:05:55.030> confidence

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
however I've a great deal of confidence

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.659 
however I've a great deal of confidence
that<00:05:55.750> if<00:05:55.870> I<00:05:56.020> did<00:05:56.289> it<00:05:56.800> would<00:05:57.010> probably<00:05:57.039> work

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
that if I did it would probably work

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.850 
that if I did it would probably work
fine<00:05:57.970> because<00:05:58.630> otherwise<00:05:59.169> it's<00:05:59.470> in<00:05:59.620> a<00:05:59.650> very

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
fine because otherwise it's in a very

fine because otherwise it's in a very

repaired in this machine or I'll find a

way to rig around it and I'll get this

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.800 
way to rig around it and I'll get this
thing<00:06:33.190> up<00:06:33.340> and<00:06:33.460> running<00:06:33.550> and<00:06:33.940> see<00:06:34.540> what<00:06:34.720> it

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
thing up and running and see what it

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.780 
thing up and running and see what it
does<00:06:35.020> because<00:06:35.530> to<00:06:35.680> be<00:06:35.800> perfectly<00:06:35.830> honest<00:06:36.640> I've

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
does because to be perfectly honest I've

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.270 
does because to be perfectly honest I've
never<00:06:36.900> even<00:06:37.900> so<00:06:38.110> much<00:06:38.290> has<00:06:38.470> tried<00:06:38.740> to<00:06:38.890> operate

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
never even so much has tried to operate

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.390 
never even so much has tried to operate
it<00:06:39.550> which<00:06:40.300> is<00:06:40.450> probably<00:06:40.650> unfortunate<00:06:41.650> I'll

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
it which is probably unfortunate I'll

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.010 
it which is probably unfortunate I'll
imagine<00:06:42.670> that<00:06:43.030> it's<00:06:43.150> going<00:06:43.390> to<00:06:43.480> be<00:06:43.600> something

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
imagine that it's going to be something

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.110 
imagine that it's going to be something
like<00:06:44.140> the<00:06:44.320> old<00:06:44.410> forgotten<00:06:44.710> grain<00:06:45.220> truck<00:06:45.550> you

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
like the old forgotten grain truck you

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.580 
like the old forgotten grain truck you
know<00:06:46.240> I<00:06:46.270> probably<00:06:46.600> will<00:06:46.960> get<00:06:47.200> it<00:06:47.290> running

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
know I probably will get it running

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.360 
know I probably will get it running
someday<00:06:48.070> but<00:06:48.790> I<00:06:48.820> don't<00:06:49.120> know<00:06:49.270> when<00:06:49.570> so<00:06:50.370> don't

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
someday but I don't know when so don't

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.280 
someday but I don't know when so don't
hold<00:06:51.520> your<00:06:51.760> breath<00:06:51.940> in<00:06:52.150> anticipation<00:06:52.419> but
