concluding<00:00:16.750> speculation<00:00:17.949> started<00:00:18.949> to

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
concluding speculation started to

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160 
concluding speculation started to
increase<00:00:19.609> that<00:00:20.359> you<00:00:20.420> were<00:00:20.779> going<00:00:20.960> to<00:00:20.990> be

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
increase that you were going to be

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.350 
increase that you were going to be
making<00:00:21.380> the<00:00:21.650> move<00:00:21.859> to<00:00:21.970> NASCAR<00:00:22.970> and<00:00:23.090> I<00:00:23.150> guess

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
making the move to NASCAR and I guess

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.450 
making the move to NASCAR and I guess
Chip<00:00:23.690> Ganassi<00:00:23.720> had<00:00:24.470> been<00:00:24.890> talking<00:00:25.250> to<00:00:25.369> you

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
Chip Ganassi had been talking to you

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.859 
Chip Ganassi had been talking to you
about<00:00:25.550> it<00:00:25.850> over<00:00:25.940> the<00:00:26.090> past<00:00:26.360> several<00:00:26.690> years

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
about it over the past several years

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.439 
about it over the past several years
when<00:00:27.770> did<00:00:27.980> you<00:00:28.130> start<00:00:28.460> really<00:00:29.030> giving<00:00:29.360> a

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
when did you start really giving a

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.689 
when did you start really giving a
consideration<00:00:29.990> I<00:00:30.610> talked<00:00:31.610> about<00:00:33.399> I've<00:00:34.399> looked

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
consideration I talked about I've looked

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.119 
consideration I talked about I've looked
into<00:00:34.879> coming<00:00:35.510> over<00:00:35.780> probably<00:00:36.530> two<00:00:36.710> years<00:00:36.739> ago

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
into coming over probably two years ago

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.280 
into coming over probably two years ago
I'd<00:00:37.609> start<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:38.060> make<00:00:38.149> some<00:00:38.329> inquiries<00:00:38.720> because

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
I'd start to make some inquiries because

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.069 
I'd start to make some inquiries because
I'd<00:00:39.410> been<00:00:39.649> to<00:00:40.010> following<00:00:40.520> the<00:00:40.640> sport<00:00:41.079> closer

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
I'd been to following the sport closer

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.470 
I'd been to following the sport closer
than<00:00:43.010> each<00:00:43.399> week<00:00:43.700> I<00:00:43.820> guess<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:44.180> just<00:00:44.239> getting

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
than each week I guess and just getting

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.510 
than each week I guess and just getting
more<00:00:44.630> and<00:00:44.720> more<00:00:44.780> into<00:00:45.020> it<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:45.559> you<00:00:46.370> know<00:00:46.399> it

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
more and more into it and you know it

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.040 
more and more into it and you know it
started<00:00:47.300> to<00:00:47.390> become<00:00:47.510> something<00:00:47.840> I<00:00:47.930> was

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
started to become something I was

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.350 
started to become something I was
interested<00:00:48.079> in<00:00:48.620> so<00:00:48.829> I<00:00:49.100> really<00:00:49.970> start<00:00:50.180> to<00:00:50.270> make

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
interested in so I really start to make

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.560 
interested in so I really start to make
serious<00:00:50.750> inquiries<00:00:51.050> probably<00:00:51.410> two<00:00:51.559> years<00:00:51.590> ago

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
serious inquiries probably two years ago

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.000 
serious inquiries probably two years ago
but<00:00:53.570> again<00:00:53.809> I<00:00:53.899> still<00:00:54.079> had<00:00:54.200> that<00:00:54.290> burnin<00:00:54.710> sort

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
but again I still had that burnin sort

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.080 
but again I still had that burnin sort
of<00:00:55.070> desire<00:00:55.399> to<00:00:55.640> win<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.880> Indy<00:00:56.090> 500<00:00:56.829> and<00:00:58.090> then

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
of desire to win the Indy 500 and then

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.850 
of desire to win the Indy 500 and then
chip<00:00:59.300> and<00:00:59.450> I<00:00:59.510> start<00:00:59.750> talking<00:01:00.170> I<00:01:00.350> guess<00:01:00.590> a<00:01:00.710> year

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
chip and I start talking I guess a year

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.530 
chip and I start talking I guess a year
and<00:01:00.980> a<00:01:01.010> half<00:01:01.040> ago<00:01:01.160> about<00:01:01.940> seriously<00:01:02.390> doing

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
and a half ago about seriously doing

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.109

something<00:01:03.020> and<00:01:03.250> I'm<00:01:04.250> glad<00:01:04.430> it<00:01:04.670> didn't<00:01:04.909> work

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
something and I'm glad it didn't work

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.429 
something and I'm glad it didn't work

than to put it that way how did their

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.609 
than to put it that way how did their
offers<00:01:25.150> compared<00:01:26.150> to<00:01:26.479> that<00:01:27.080> of<00:01:27.140> chip

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
offers compared to that of chip

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.399 
offers compared to that of chip
Ganassi's<00:01:28.159> will<00:01:28.909> chip<00:01:29.210> in<00:01:29.390> typical<00:01:30.170> tip

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
Ganassi's will chip in typical tip

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.219 
Ganassi's will chip in typical tip
fashion<00:01:30.799> was<00:01:30.890> like<00:01:31.040> hey<00:01:31.189> I've<00:01:31.549> got<00:01:31.700> this<00:01:31.820> idea

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
fashion was like hey I've got this idea

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.730 
fashion was like hey I've got this idea
let's<00:01:33.229> do<00:01:33.409> it<00:01:33.909> and<00:01:35.049> you<00:01:36.049> know<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.170> lot<00:01:36.409> I<00:01:36.590> think

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
let's do it and you know a lot I think

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.969 
let's do it and you know a lot I think
that<00:01:37.040> some<00:01:37.159> other<00:01:37.189> guys<00:01:37.549> were<00:01:37.700> maybe<00:01:37.820> more

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
that some other guys were maybe more

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.870 
that some other guys were maybe more
conservative<00:01:39.979> in<00:01:40.070> their<00:01:40.159> approach<00:01:40.490> for<00:01:40.729> chip

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
conservative in their approach for chip

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.140 
conservative in their approach for chip

was the decision actually made um trying
to<00:02:28.400> think<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:31.930> don't<00:02:32.930> know<00:02:32.989> what<00:02:33.050> have<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.319> look

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
to think I don't know what have to look

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.990 
to think I don't know what have to look
at<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.560> calendar<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:34.220> tell<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.519> exact<00:02:34.790> date

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
I mean at the time though the media

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.500 
I mean at the time though the media
speculation<00:02:39.410> was<00:02:40.130> pretty<00:02:40.910> much<00:02:41.090> right<00:02:41.360> on<00:02:41.390> the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
speculation was pretty much right on the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.830 
speculation was pretty much right on the
pretty<00:02:42.319> much<00:02:42.730> how<00:02:43.730> much<00:02:43.880> tension<00:02:44.239> did<00:02:44.660> that

pretty much how much tension did that

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.860 
pretty much how much tension did that

respond to that well we'll see what

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.000 
respond to that well we'll see what
happens<00:03:26.060> in<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.480> year<00:03:26.690> in<00:03:26.810> there<00:03:26.989> and<00:03:27.200> the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
happens in the year in there and the

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.470 
happens in the year in there and the
future<00:03:28.370> we'll<00:03:28.519> see<00:03:28.640> what<00:03:28.730> happens<00:03:28.790> next<00:03:29.120> year

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.530 
future we'll see what happens next year
and<00:03:29.600> from<00:03:29.720> then<00:03:29.930> on<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:31.370> think<00:03:32.120> it's<00:03:32.420> a

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
and from then on and I think it's a

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.910 
and from then on and I think it's a
fairly<00:03:33.170> ill<00:03:33.319> informed<00:03:34.390> opinion<00:03:35.799> why<00:03:36.799> do<00:03:36.859> you

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
fairly ill informed opinion why do you

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.530 
fairly ill informed opinion why do you
think<00:03:37.040> he<00:03:37.220> said<00:03:37.250> it<00:03:38.620> no<00:03:39.620> idea<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.970> said<00:03:41.239> you're

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
think he said it no idea you said you're

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.710 
think he said it no idea you said you're
too<00:03:41.840> late<00:03:42.680> season<00:03:43.010> flips<00:03:43.760> played<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.510> minor

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
too late season flips played a minor

and<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.770> was<00:04:10.890> always<00:04:11.100> kind<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.370> question

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
and that was always kind of a question

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.190 
and that was always kind of a question
mark<00:04:11.850> for<00:04:12.090> me<00:04:12.240> and<00:04:12.420> then<00:04:12.510> when<00:04:12.690> those<00:04:12.870> flips

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
mark for me and then when those flips

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.130 
mark for me and then when those flips
happen<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:13.650> just<00:04:13.680> thought<00:04:14.210> you<00:04:15.210> know<00:04:15.330> it's<00:04:15.870> just

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
happen I just thought you know it's just

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.170 
happen I just thought you know it's just
it<00:04:16.290> was<00:04:16.380> just<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.620> factor<00:04:17.040> and<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.850> just<00:04:18.030> thought

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
it was just a factor and it just thought

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.890 
it was just a factor and it just thought
I<00:04:18.209> really<00:04:19.010> want<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.850> continue<00:04:21.360> that<00:04:21.600> type

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
I really want to to continue that type

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.740 
I really want to to continue that type
of<00:04:22.550> racing<00:04:23.550> on<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.850> one<00:04:23.970> a<00:04:24.000> nap<00:04:24.180> mal<00:04:24.420> tracks

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
of racing on the one a nap mal tracks

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.140 
of racing on the one a nap mal tracks
and<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.890> know<00:04:25.980> the<00:04:26.100> answer<00:04:26.340> was<00:04:26.460> probably<00:04:26.880> not

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
and you know the answer was probably not

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.080 
and you know the answer was probably not
so<00:04:28.010> you<00:04:29.010> know<00:04:29.070> I<00:04:29.130> was<00:04:29.250> going<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.490> do<00:04:29.580> something

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
so you know I was going to do something

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.710 
so you know I was going to do something
else<00:04:30.290> in<00:04:31.290> a<00:04:31.470> weight<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:31.860> luckily<00:04:32.690> you<00:04:33.690> know

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
else in a weight and luckily you know

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.450 
else in a weight and luckily you know
the<00:04:33.870> NASCAR<00:04:34.290> option<00:04:34.560> opened<00:04:34.860> up<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:35.250> and

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
the NASCAR option opened up and and

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.840 
the NASCAR option opened up and and
pretty<00:04:36.270> stoked<00:04:36.570> about<00:04:36.660> it
