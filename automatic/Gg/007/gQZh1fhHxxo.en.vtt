00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
things I got from there so basically the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.270 
things I got from there so basically the
claim<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.690> product<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.710> fights<00:00:41.010> acne

claim of the product is it fights acne

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.330 
claim of the product is it fights acne
and<00:00:41.730> brightens<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.629> skin<00:00:42.660> not<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.500> lot<00:00:43.770> not<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
and brightens the skin not a lot not a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.250 
and brightens the skin not a lot not a
lot<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.610> products<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.390> market<00:00:45.510> those

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
lot of products in the market those

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.150 
lot of products in the market those
diets<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.920> my<00:00:47.070> opinion<00:00:47.550> because<00:00:48.289> it's<00:00:49.289> hard<00:00:49.860> to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
diets in my opinion because it's hard to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.450 
diets in my opinion because it's hard to
balance<00:00:50.340> both<00:00:50.879> things<00:00:51.500> because<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.250> have

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
balance both things because if you have

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.840 
balance both things because if you have
acne<00:00:53.760> skin<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.750> oily<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.500> course<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.699> do

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
acne skin or oily of course and you do

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.420 
acne skin or oily of course and you do
need<00:00:57.000> towels<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> cast<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.430> eliminate

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
need towels to the cast is to eliminate

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.260 
need towels to the cast is to eliminate
the<00:01:00.090> pimples<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.530> brighten<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.430> I

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
shocked when I noticed in a couple of

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.620 
shocked when I noticed in a couple of
days<00:04:45.480> I<00:04:45.780> think<00:04:46.020> it<00:04:46.470> was<00:04:46.650> like<00:04:46.830> about<00:04:47.270> five<00:04:48.270> days

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
was a bit brighter than usual because I

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.750 
was a bit brighter than usual because I
did<00:04:54.300> not<00:04:54.480> wear<00:04:54.690> any<00:04:54.900> makeup<00:04:55.380> that<00:04:56.190> specific
