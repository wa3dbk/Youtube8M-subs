three-point oh so today I'm going to
talk<00:00:29.670> about<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.000> grid<00:00:30.439> basically<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
talk about the grid basically the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.620 
talk about the grid basically the
greatest<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.130> new<00:00:32.250> concept<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:33.090> headway

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
greatest a new concept in headway

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.380 
greatest a new concept in headway
three-point<00:00:34.079> oh<00:00:34.200> where<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.579> use<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.850> grid

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
three-point oh where you can use a grid

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.010 
three-point oh where you can use a grid
approach<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.469> create<00:00:38.460> layouts<00:00:38.850> within<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.780> web

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
approach to create layouts within a web

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.209 
approach to create layouts within a web
site<00:00:40.290> okay<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.579> what<00:00:42.090> do<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.239> mean<00:00:42.450> by<00:00:42.510> that

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
site okay so what do I mean by that

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.500 
site okay so what do I mean by that
basically<00:00:44.219> when<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.399> log<00:00:44.730> into<00:00:44.969> your<00:00:45.149> visual

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
basically when you log into your visual

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.799 
basically when you log into your visual
editor<00:00:45.660> you'll<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.890> grid<00:00:47.399> mode<00:00:47.809> by

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
editor you'll be in the grid mode by

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.880 
editor you'll be in the grid mode by
default<00:00:49.010> okay<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.420> see<00:00:51.890> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
default okay and as you can see the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.529 
default okay and as you can see the
website<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.969> here<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.390> isn't

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
website that we have here this isn't

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.479 
website that we have here this isn't
really<00:00:54.809> what<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.379> website<00:00:55.530> looks<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.070> we're

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
really what the website looks like we're

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.549 
really what the website looks like we're
going<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.670> put<00:00:56.789> content<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.539> here<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.140> second

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
going to put content in here in a second

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.740 
going to put content in here in a second
but<00:00:59.250> what<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.609> have<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.270> system

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
but what you have is you have a system

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.939 
but what you have is you have a system
of<00:01:01.100> columns<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.430> gutters<00:01:03.030> ok<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> column

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
of columns and gutters ok so the column

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.429 
of columns and gutters ok so the column
is<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.339> gray<00:01:05.729> thing<00:01:06.510> right<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.170> gutter

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
is the gray thing right here the gutter

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.350 
is the gray thing right here the gutter
is<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.860> space<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.340> between<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.729> columns<00:01:09.090> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
is the space in between the columns and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.830 
is the space in between the columns and
you<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.409> set<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.400> column<00:01:11.820> width<00:01:12.060> okay<00:01:12.630> now

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
you can set the column width okay now

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.240 
you can set the column width okay now
again<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.320> has<00:01:13.500> nothing<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:14.010> with<00:01:14.130> what

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
again this has nothing to do with what

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.100 
again this has nothing to do with what
the<00:01:14.400> site<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.700> going<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.060> look<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.330> it's

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the site is going to look like it's

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.510 
the site is going to look like it's
basically<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:17.450> grid<00:01:18.450> type<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.080> layout<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.400> you

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
basically a grid type of layout for you

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.690 
basically a grid type of layout for you
to<00:01:20.729> put<00:01:21.060> your<00:01:21.330> blocks<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.200> content<00:01:22.710> into<00:01:23.159> ok

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
to put your blocks of content into ok

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.830 
to put your blocks of content into ok
and<00:01:23.820> you'll<00:01:23.909> see<00:01:24.090> what<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.240> mean<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.750> a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
and you'll see what I mean in just a

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.980 
and you'll see what I mean in just a
second<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:26.009> column<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.509> know<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.840> you

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
second so column with you know if you

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.109 
second so column with you know if you
kind<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.409> make<00:01:28.590> these<00:01:28.770> wider<00:01:29.040> obviously<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
kind of make these wider obviously the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.859 
kind of make these wider obviously the
gray<00:01:30.390> columns<00:01:31.079> get<00:01:31.350> wider<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.729> set<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
gray columns get wider you can set the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.130 
gray columns get wider you can set the
width<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.799> gutter<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.430> more<00:01:35.790> narrow<00:01:36.150> ok

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
width in the gutter to be more narrow ok

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.230 
width in the gutter to be more narrow ok
so<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.470> see<00:01:37.680> how<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.860> white<00:01:38.610> space<00:01:38.850> in

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
so you see how the white space in

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.850 
so you see how the white space in
between<00:01:39.360> these<00:01:39.659> gutters<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.470> gotten

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
between these gutters have gotten

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.580 
between these gutters have gotten
narrower<00:01:41.340> all<00:01:42.030> right<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.659> content<00:01:43.200> blocks

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
narrower all right the content blocks

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.289 
narrower all right the content blocks
that<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.070> dragged<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.549> here<00:01:44.579> you'll<00:01:44.970> see<00:01:45.030> this

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
that we dragged in here you'll see this

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.980 
that we dragged in here you'll see this
in<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.540> second<00:01:45.960> basically<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:46.950> will<00:01:47.070> snap<00:01:47.430> two

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
in a second basically it will snap two

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.179 
in a second basically it will snap two
columns<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.320> why<00:01:49.470> we're<00:01:49.740> kind<00:01:50.159> of

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
columns that's why we're kind of

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.670 
columns that's why we're kind of
configuring<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.119> specific<00:01:51.329> way<00:01:51.680> and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
configuring this in a specific way and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.090 
configuring this in a specific way and
depending<00:01:53.549> upon<00:01:53.790> how<00:01:54.360> wide<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.680> set<00:01:55.950> your

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
depending upon how wide you set your

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.969 
depending upon how wide you set your
columns<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.939> your<00:01:57.360> gutters<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.530> will<00:01:58.680> end<00:01:58.860> up

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
columns and your gutters you will end up

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.580 
columns and your gutters you will end up
with<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.219> total<00:01:59.520> width<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.509> website<00:02:00.990> ok

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
with the total width of the website ok

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.609 
with the total width of the website ok
so<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.009> case<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.399> 830<00:02:03.210> 4<00:02:03.450> pixels<00:02:03.810> that's<00:02:04.530> a

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
so in this case is 830 4 pixels that's a

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.020 
so in this case is 830 4 pixels that's a
little<00:02:04.710> bit<00:02:04.950> too<00:02:05.130> narrow<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.549> I'm<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:05.909> going

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
little bit too narrow so I'm just going

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.210 
little bit too narrow so I'm just going
to<00:02:06.119> spread<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.079> out<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.229> little<00:02:07.500> bit<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.099> end

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
to spread it out a little bit and we end

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.550 
to spread it out a little bit and we end
up<00:02:08.340> at<00:02:08.429> 951<00:02:09.179> all<00:02:09.840> right<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.170> for

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
up at 951 all right just for

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.990 
up at 951 all right just for
demonstration<00:02:10.770> purposes<00:02:11.520> I'll<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:11.849> leave

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
demonstration purposes I'll just leave

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.760 
demonstration purposes I'll just leave
it<00:02:12.120> at<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.239> just<00:02:12.900> know<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.290> have<00:02:13.530> a

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
it at that just know that you have a

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.160 
it at that just know that you have a
total<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.310> twenty<00:02:15.000> four<00:02:15.210> columns<00:02:15.780> going

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
total of twenty four columns going

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.300 
total of twenty four columns going
across<00:02:16.610> with<00:02:17.610> obviously<00:02:18.260> 23<00:02:19.260> gutters<00:02:20.040> in

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
across with obviously 23 gutters in

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.890 
across with obviously 23 gutters in
between<00:02:20.640> these<00:02:20.850> all<00:02:21.330> right<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:21.810> do

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
between these all right so you can do

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.780 
between these all right so you can do
the<00:02:21.990> math<00:02:22.170> now<00:02:22.770> what<00:02:23.280> do<00:02:23.340> we<00:02:23.430> do<00:02:23.550> with<00:02:23.640> this

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
the math now what do we do with this

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.330 
the math now what do we do with this
blank<00:02:24.180> sheet<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.510> paper<00:02:24.720> all<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.860> do<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.040> you

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
blank sheet of paper all you do is you

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.060 
blank sheet of paper all you do is you
take<00:02:26.370> your<00:02:26.550> mouse<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.360> just<00:02:27.540> simply<00:02:28.070> drag

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
take your mouse and you just simply drag

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.260 
take your mouse and you just simply drag
across<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.970> columns<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:31.760> then<00:02:32.760> as<00:02:32.910> soon<00:02:33.090> as

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
across the columns and then as soon as

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.050 
across the columns and then as soon as
you<00:02:33.390> deselect<00:02:34.110> on<00:02:34.410> your<00:02:34.560> mouse<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:35.100> box<00:02:35.790> will

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
you deselect on your mouse a box will

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.720 
you deselect on your mouse a box will
come<00:02:36.240> up<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:37.290> allows<00:02:37.710> you<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.040> choose<00:02:38.340> what

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
come up that allows you to choose what

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.090 
come up that allows you to choose what
type<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.030> content<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.960> want<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.230> put<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.650> that

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
type of content you want to put in that

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.190 
type of content you want to put in that
block<00:02:41.520> ok<00:02:42.270> so<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.660> case<00:02:42.840> we're<00:02:43.020> going<00:02:43.140> to

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
block ok so in this case we're going to

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.930 
block ok so in this case we're going to
just<00:02:43.350> pick<00:02:43.530> header<00:02:45.170> ok<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.380> then<00:02:47.100> we're<00:02:47.730> going

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
just pick header ok and then we're going

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.540 
just pick header ok and then we're going
to<00:02:48.620> create<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.800> next<00:02:49.950> block<00:02:50.130> I'm<00:02:50.340> going<00:02:50.490> to

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
to create the next block I'm going to

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.750 
to create the next block I'm going to
pull<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:51.030> block<00:02:51.270> right<00:02:51.600> here<00:02:52.430> ok<00:02:53.430> I'm<00:02:53.550> going<00:02:53.700> to

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
pull a block right here ok I'm going to

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.860 
pull a block right here ok I'm going to
let<00:02:53.970> go<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:55.230> will<00:02:55.290> say<00:02:56.180> navigation<00:02:58.310> ok<00:02:59.310> I

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
let go and I will say navigation ok I

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.420 
let go and I will say navigation ok I
can<00:03:00.870> have<00:03:01.020> my<00:03:01.140> navigation<00:03:01.650> right<00:03:01.770> here<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.100> can

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
can have my navigation right here I can

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.040 
can have my navigation right here I can
also<00:03:02.610> drag<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.150> put<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.510> navigation

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
also drag and put a navigation

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.720 
also drag and put a navigation
underneath<00:03:04.500> here<00:03:04.770> all<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.040> way<00:03:05.070> across<00:03:05.250> if<00:03:05.610> I

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
underneath here all the way across if I

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.150 
underneath here all the way across if I
wanted<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.180> or<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.510> could<00:03:07.380> put<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> navigation

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
wanted to or I could put the navigation

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.220 
wanted to or I could put the navigation
across<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.760> top<00:03:08.970> I'm<00:03:09.420> going<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.600> add<00:03:09.720> two

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
across the top I'm going to add two

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.920 
across the top I'm going to add two
blocks<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.220> content<00:03:11.700> underneath<00:03:12.120> here<00:03:12.360> that

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
blocks of content underneath here that

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.020 
blocks of content underneath here that
are<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.380> same<00:03:13.620> width<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.280> great<00:03:15.000> thing

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
are the same width and the great thing

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.330 
are the same width and the great thing
about<00:03:15.210> knowing<00:03:15.720> how<00:03:15.900> many<00:03:15.960> columns<00:03:16.920> are

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
about knowing how many columns are

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.310 
about knowing how many columns are
across<00:03:17.580> here<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.090> know<00:03:18.180> we<00:03:18.300> have<00:03:18.390> 24<00:03:18.810> crosses

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
across here you know we have 24 crosses

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.870 
across here you know we have 24 crosses
that<00:03:19.380> we<00:03:19.500> could<00:03:19.650> basically<00:03:19.800> do<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.220> math<00:03:20.490> so

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
that we could basically do the math so

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.660 
that we could basically do the math so
we<00:03:21.000> could<00:03:21.150> say<00:03:21.360> okay<00:03:22.080> great<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.530> want<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.220> drag

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
we could say okay great I want to drag

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.180 
we could say okay great I want to drag
this<00:03:23.850> all<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.209> way<00:03:24.240> across<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.870> I'll<00:03:25.500> go<00:03:25.740> 12

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
this all the way across and I'll go 12

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.770 
this all the way across and I'll go 12
columns<00:03:26.730> ok<00:03:27.920> we<00:03:28.920> simply<00:03:29.340> deselect<00:03:29.910> i'm<00:03:30.570> going

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
columns ok we simply deselect i'm going

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.390 
columns ok we simply deselect i'm going
to<00:03:30.840> pick<00:03:31.140> content<00:03:32.000> ok<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.680> we<00:03:34.680> can<00:03:35.100> i'm<00:03:35.370> going

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
to pick content ok and we can i'm going

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.210 
to pick content ok and we can i'm going
to<00:03:35.520> drag<00:03:35.670> this<00:03:35.730> down<00:03:35.880> a<00:03:36.030> little<00:03:36.120> bit<00:03:36.420> more<00:03:37.220> make

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
to drag this down a little bit more make

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.010 
to drag this down a little bit more make
sure<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.550> we<00:03:38.610> have<00:03:38.700> 12<00:03:39.060> 1<00:03:39.600> 2<00:03:40.110> 3<00:03:40.470> 4<00:03:40.740> 5<00:03:41.520> 6<00:03:41.970> 7<00:03:42.600> 8<00:03:42.810> 9

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
sure that we have 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.460 
sure that we have 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10<00:03:43.650> 11<00:03:44.250> 12<00:03:44.670> ok<00:03:45.570> that's<00:03:45.750> not<00:03:45.840> right<00:03:46.110> so<00:03:46.380> i'm<00:03:46.440> just

going to drag it back one like that ok

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.010 
going to drag it back one like that ok
then<00:03:50.100> we<00:03:50.370> have<00:03:50.490> another<00:03:50.520> box<00:03:51.120> right<00:03:51.420> here<00:03:51.450> i'm

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
then we have another box right here i'm

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.420
