turned<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.260> icon<00:00:46.620> labels<00:00:47.010> off<00:00:47.250> because<00:00:47.550> I

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
turned the icon labels off because I

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.729 
turned the icon labels off because I
think<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.910> makes<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.300> cleaner<00:00:48.660> look<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
think it makes it a cleaner look on the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.470 
think it makes it a cleaner look on the
home<00:00:49.920> screen<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.430> that's<00:00:50.700> your<00:00:50.940> choice<00:00:51.180> right

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
home screen so that's your choice right

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.970 
home screen so that's your choice right

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
need to change in the drawer but we'll

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.729 
need to change in the drawer but we'll
leave<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:54.719> now<00:00:54.899> because<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.379> doc<00:00:55.590> is

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
leave that for now because the doc is

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.950 
leave that for now because the doc is
more<00:00:55.920> important<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.300> home<00:00:57.510> screen<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
may be a different procedure but this is

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.490 
may be a different procedure but this is
how<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:08.970> do<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.239> on<00:02:09.330> paranoid<00:02:09.690> android<00:02:10.110> now

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
how you do it on paranoid android now

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.900 
how you do it on paranoid android now
this<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.800> where<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.069> need<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.280> dive<00:02:11.489> into<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
this is where you need to dive into the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.580 
this is where you need to dive into the
draw<00:02:12.120> because<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.660> need<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.840> make<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.110> drawer

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
draw because you need to make the drawer

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.930 
draw because you need to make the drawer
little<00:02:13.739> bit<00:02:13.830> transparent<00:02:14.069> otherwise<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.910> just

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
little bit transparent otherwise it just

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.759 
little bit transparent otherwise it just
looks<00:02:15.269> stupid<00:02:15.510> with<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> transparent<00:02:16.260> navbar

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
looks stupid with a transparent navbar

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.259 
looks stupid with a transparent navbar
so<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:16.980> can<00:02:17.099> see<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.250> set<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.700> about<00:02:17.819> there

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
so you can see I set it to about there

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.930 
so you can see I set it to about there
and<00:02:18.510> if<00:02:19.319> we<00:02:19.440> go<00:02:19.590> back<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.129> dive<00:02:20.370> into<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.819> app

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
and if we go back and dive into the app

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.940 
and if we go back and dive into the app
drawer<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.360> can<00:02:21.390> see<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:22.050> looks<00:02:22.530> fine<00:02:22.769> it

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
drawer you can see it looks fine it

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.320 
drawer you can see it looks fine it
doesn't<00:02:23.010> look<00:02:23.280> at<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.459> place<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:24.000> flows

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
doesn't look at a place it flows

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.880 
doesn't look at a place it flows
properly<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:25.080> that's<00:02:25.319> how<00:02:25.470> it's<00:02:25.620> meant<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.860> be

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
properly and that's how it's meant to be

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.220 
properly and that's how it's meant to be
so<00:02:26.220> make<00:02:26.489> sure<00:02:26.519> you<00:02:26.849> make<00:02:27.030> your<00:02:27.390> draw<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> little

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
so make sure you make your draw a little

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.690 
so make sure you make your draw a little
bit<00:02:28.470> transparent<00:02:28.709> otherwise<00:02:29.430> it'll<00:02:29.640> just

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
bit transparent otherwise it'll just

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.580 
bit transparent otherwise it'll just
look<00:02:29.910> stupid<00:02:30.180> with<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.510> transparent<00:02:31.049> navbar<00:02:31.410> a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
look stupid with a transparent navbar a

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.470 
look stupid with a transparent navbar a
case<00:02:32.129> of<00:02:32.310> moving<00:02:32.549> on<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.790> some<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.150> widgets

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
case of moving on to some of the widgets

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.660 
case of moving on to some of the widgets
now<00:02:33.690> we'll<00:02:33.959> start<00:02:34.170> off<00:02:34.290> with<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.530> uccw<00:02:35.129> widget

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
now we'll start off with the uccw widget

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.220 
now we'll start off with the uccw widget
so<00:02:35.849> you<00:02:35.910> do<00:02:36.090> need<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.269> download<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:36.959> install

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.830 
so you do need to download and install
the<00:02:37.290> uccw<00:02:37.980> app<00:02:38.430> first<00:02:38.790> then<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.480> need<00:02:39.750> to

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
the uccw app first then you need to

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.020 
the uccw app first then you need to
download<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.620> widgets<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.099> either<00:02:41.310> uccw
