00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
what it was when it was raw that is

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870 
what it was when it was raw that is
because<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.260> little<00:01:10.439> vinegar<00:01:11.130> acts<00:01:11.610> like

because of the little vinegar acts like

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.820 
because of the little vinegar acts like
a<00:01:11.909> bleaching<00:01:12.210> agent<00:01:12.420> whenever<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.500> cook<00:01:13.680> a

dish like a gratin always use a
flameproof<00:01:16.439> dish<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.540> not<00:01:18.689> only

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
flameproof dish like this so it not only

sauce to get stuck at the bottom so be

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.160 
sauce to get stuck at the bottom so be
little<00:01:33.869> bit<00:01:33.990> generous<00:01:34.350> with<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> butter<00:01:37.280> okay

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
little bit generous with the butter okay

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.800 
little bit generous with the butter okay
this<00:01:40.830> is<00:01:40.890> perfectly<00:01:41.280> cooked<00:01:41.490> there<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> bit

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
this is perfectly cooked there is a bit

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.960 
this is perfectly cooked there is a bit
of<00:01:42.960> continuous<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.070> cooked<00:01:44.580> well<00:01:44.759> and

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
it's not matching at all

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.810 
it's not matching at all
because<00:01:46.830> we're<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.220> cook<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.549> little

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
because we're going to cook it little

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.510

enjoyed today's session of learning how
to<00:05:28.740> make<00:05:29.039> this<00:05:29.280> algorithm<00:05:29.789> you<00:05:29.969> can<00:05:30.270> use<00:05:30.749> meats

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
to make this algorithm you can use meats

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.129 
to make this algorithm you can use meats
chicken<00:05:31.919> or<00:05:32.490> anything<00:05:32.909> to<00:05:33.629> make<00:05:33.779> this<00:05:33.960> a

chicken or anything to make this a

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.929 
chicken or anything to make this a
gratin<00:05:34.409> and<00:05:34.830> in<00:05:35.039> fact<00:05:35.249> you<00:05:35.400> can<00:05:35.520> also<00:05:35.639> use<00:05:35.909> a
