00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
just let's how you take it out you see

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.880 
just let's how you take it out you see
this<00:01:42.970> is<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.240> old<00:01:44.460> original<00:01:45.460> oxygen<00:01:46.180> sensor

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
this is the old original oxygen sensor

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.520 
this is the old original oxygen sensor
see<00:01:47.890> how<00:01:48.010> you<00:01:48.070> can<00:01:48.400> see<00:01:48.550> how<00:01:48.700> it's<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:51.460> see<00:01:51.670> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
see how you can see how it's you see the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.450 
see how you can see how it's you see the
different<00:01:53.530> color<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.460> sensor<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:57.369> this

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
different color and the sensor and this

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.290 
different color and the sensor and this
is<00:01:57.640> original

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
is original

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.260 
is original
let's<00:01:58.630> see<00:01:59.040> has<00:02:00.040> an<00:02:00.190> original<00:02:00.430> Honda<00:02:01.030> part

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
let's see has an original Honda part

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.440 
let's see has an original Honda part
number<00:02:01.570> on<00:02:01.660> it<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:06.399> should<00:02:06.610> be<00:02:06.729> replaced

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
number on it this should be replaced

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.529 
number on it this should be replaced
anywhere<00:02:08.380> between<00:02:08.530> 50<00:02:09.130> or<00:02:09.399> 100,000<00:02:10.060> miles

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
anywhere between 50 or 100,000 miles

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.260 
anywhere between 50 or 100,000 miles
that's<00:02:11.230> original<00:02:11.920> so<00:02:12.370> this<00:02:12.520> has<00:02:12.670> about<00:02:12.880> over

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
that's original so this has about over

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:28.290 
that's original so this has about over
160,000<00:02:14.110> miles<00:02:14.230> on<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.850> which<00:02:15.850> is<00:02:16.000> good

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.790 

this<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.080> ripple<00:02:29.380> this<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.680> the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
this is the ripple this is the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:41.399 
this is the ripple this is the
replacement

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.979 

what<00:02:42.409> you<00:02:42.500> want<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.709> do<00:02:42.829> is<00:02:42.920> match<00:02:43.129> it<00:02:43.370> up<00:02:43.989> match

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
what you want to do is match it up match

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.199 
what you want to do is match it up match
it<00:02:45.170> up<00:02:45.230> before<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.620> put<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.920> on<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:47.090> it<00:02:47.180> looks

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
it up before you put it on and it looks

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.059 
it up before you put it on and it looks
like<00:02:47.569> it's<00:02:48.010> almost<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.340> same<00:02:50.620> well<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.799> wire

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
like it's almost the same well the wire

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.280 
like it's almost the same well the wire
harness<00:02:52.549> the<00:02:52.730> connections<00:02:53.390> make<00:02:53.989> sure<00:02:54.170> the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
harness the connections make sure the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.830 
harness the connections make sure the
connector<00:02:54.739> is<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.370> same<00:02:55.730> as<00:02:55.939> it<00:02:56.150> looks<00:02:56.689> the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
connector is the same as it looks the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.660 
connector is the same as it looks the
same<00:02:57.049> as<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.950> same<00:02:58.159> number<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.459> pins<00:03:00.670> days

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
same as the same number of pins days

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.080 
same as the same number of pins days
basically<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:02.599> is<00:03:02.780> this<00:03:03.079> looks<00:03:03.349> like<00:03:04.090> the

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
basically this is this looks like the

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.960 
basically this is this looks like the
original<00:03:05.150> replacement<00:03:06.049> for<00:03:06.140> this<00:03:06.260> vehicle

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
original replacement for this vehicle

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.970 
original replacement for this vehicle
well<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.090> notice<00:03:08.269> is<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:08.810> new<00:03:08.959> sensor<00:03:09.500> comes

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
well you notice is the new sensor comes

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.720 
well you notice is the new sensor comes
with<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.900> anti-seize<00:03:11.900> compound<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:13.700> the

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
with the anti-seize compound on the

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.250 
with the anti-seize compound on the
threads<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.159> makes<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.489> easier<00:03:16.849> to<00:03:17.260> to

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
threads and it makes it easier to to

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.589 
threads and it makes it easier to to
install<00:03:19.099> and<00:03:19.340> remove<00:03:19.459> later<00:03:19.849> on<00:03:22.540> what<00:03:23.540> you

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
install and remove later on what you

this on hand tight and then just snug it
up<00:03:29.480> with<00:03:29.659> the<00:03:29.780> wrench
