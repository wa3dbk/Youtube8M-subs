00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.710
 typhi like that participate in these 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:46.019
 tisf then there on the first 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.559
 proposition that will you be so on the 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.889
 google page 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.399
 the first site proposal you have there 

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:55.289
 so go click on it 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.609
 there you will fall on this page that 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.989
 feel I will put you the link of the site 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:02.999
 in the description and then there and then 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.659
 there so to have minecraft it takes 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:08.549
 put download the length so me 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.300
 I will not do it because I have them 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.740
 already done but otherwise it'll put you 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.840
 that to you download it down there as 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.420
 as if you download anything 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.250
 as an image so after when you 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.140
 have it download you open you 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.720
 file in the download you go 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.380
 to have it accentuated 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.430
 that's the launcher be made as 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.620
 you want to either you open it 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.550
 directly or you send it to the 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:39.120
 the office I sent to the Office ai 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.760
 so ok in itself you open it and then there 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.360
 in fact to play it will have to java 32 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.460
 bits but normally if you have not 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.800
 they will make you download everything 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.510
 so on that there is no problem they 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.470
 ask if we want to download javols 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.110
 64 bits 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.910
 so I put it 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:02.300
 not necessarily and then the way 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.310
 there to play so that's their job 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.630
 to play the mannequins they will you 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:12.850
 ask for a pseudo scan so I 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.850
 will put for example minecraft tutor 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.920
 kraft here is my card and so here I am 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.870
 do not know how to write 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.890
 minecraft tutorial minecraft for example 7 7 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.450
 So that's going to be my nickname 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.239
 otherwise you put the nickname that you 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.180
 want and then that's going to make you 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.700
 updates but me as I leave 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.890
 not the first time I throw and bg 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.900
 not to do the update 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.540
 so after you're going to have all this 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.690
 it's minecraft 1.7 cu 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.239
 version so to check if your 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.980
 nickname and well you can see if it 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.850
 are not somebody declines use 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.060
 already this nickname you go on fun 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.769
 so fear the first to courcy and then 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.870
 there if you're lucky that 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:12.620
 person this your nickname vf slash 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.630
 roar regis register eur then to 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.200
 password so it will be me 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.880
 for example 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:24.830
 tutoz minecraft 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:28.519
 so rather all rather short 7 7 7 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.070
 here and then they say ok you 've been 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:35.330
 registered melon to connect you must 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:38.510
 do slash login and then there tutor 7.7 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.840
 this way there ok so here I am 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.620
 plant 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.260
 here and then there you go you go 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.360
 fall on this server so it's a 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.200
 very nice minecraft server where there is 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.030
 mini games and everything and then there is 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.840
 so that's good you have minecraft 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.709
 for free so you got minecraft 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:04.030
 free and 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:07.150
 and without viruses and then against 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.900
 necessarily as it is a throw minecraft 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.189
 minecraft crack it goes there is going to be 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.030
 some disadvantages 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:18.430
 for example you can not choose 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.070
 yours version as on minecraft 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.389
 buy but you can not 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.509
 necessarily buy go on the servers 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:31.000
 which are forbidden to crack but good 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.580
 otherwise it does not matter you have your 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.729
 minecraft so with the single player mode and 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.370
 multiplayer also with the shortcuts of 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:43.680
 servers no less there I find that 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:46.000
 it's very good that it's a hit 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.919
 that it's a very good lunch hours and 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.849
 then here you have got minecraft 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:55.539
 for free and without the Russians so 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:58.330
 I hope you have enjoyed this tutorial 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:01.509

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.440

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:07.900
