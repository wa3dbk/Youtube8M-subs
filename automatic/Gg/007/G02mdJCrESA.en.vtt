00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
could have a free start and wanted him

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.190

to<00:03:14.190> play<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.459> big<00:03:14.700> inning<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.389> but<00:03:15.959> they're<00:03:16.079> not

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
to play a big inning and but they're not

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
to play a big inning and but they're not
playing<00:03:16.500> away<00:03:16.650> from<00:03:16.769> his<00:03:17.100> body<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.880> just

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
playing away from his body and just

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.800 
playing away from his body and just
played<00:03:20.220> on<00:03:20.459> over<00:03:20.970> here<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.389> if<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.660> just

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
played on over here and if you just

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.080 
played on over here and if you just
watched<00:03:22.109> it<00:03:22.380> closely<00:03:22.739> that<00:03:23.100> is<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.880> body

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
watched it closely that is that and body

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.479 
watched it closely that is that and body
are<00:03:24.299> far<00:03:24.569> away<00:03:24.780> from<00:03:24.930> each<00:03:25.290> other<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.310> think

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
are far away from each other so I think

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.099 
are far away from each other so I think
if<00:03:26.609> you're<00:03:26.790> doing<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.239> against<00:03:27.750> quality

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
if you're doing that against quality

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.710 
if you're doing that against quality
boulders<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:28.500> are<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.239> course<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.569> was

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
boulders you are and of course that was

time it as well but I think he kept a
good<00:04:40.340> line<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:41.060> when<00:04:41.630> they<00:04:41.750> kept<00:04:41.930> the

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
good line and when they kept the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:51.460 
good line and when they kept the
pressure<00:04:42.260> and<00:04:49.480> there<00:04:50.480> was<00:04:50.570> brief<00:04:50.900> resistance

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
pressure and there was brief resistance

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.820
