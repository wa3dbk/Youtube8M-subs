00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.930

 us as we as he africa virus on 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.730
 windows 7 can install in the second 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.929
 Part then we remove the permanent 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.859
 wersehzeige of avira the link of 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.779
 that I'm here either 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.810
 Enter or you can in the video 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.760
 description needs to look in any case 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.859
 you can then choose free download here 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.660
 and do not let that confuse you here 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.270
 click the little left button 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.800
 about the free nothing was that 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.020
 costs and below in the browser albring 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.750
 or Krogmann here everyday to keep on 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.930
 then we get two mb file that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.289
 came then run 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.700
 run again here and then go 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.469
 the installation is already going on here 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.649
 hire additional language in my 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.649
 case german and your own download 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.840
 then start now so if the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.309
 download is completed then starts 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.309
 the actual installation only 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.420
 and I will be custom here 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.750
 from we put the end user 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.350
 can hold license agreement like that 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.350
 leave set 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.040
 Here you can now just that through 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.510
 the custom thing from it 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.440
 So I'm looking for example 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:41.430
 in the browser protection out and on 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.430
 further to this further 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.340
 copied the files and he has the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.580
 Of course we will do this from here 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.960
 toolbar both hook out or 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.280
 or you can directly on 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.290
 of course , that's natural too 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:07.170
 handy and then ok here and here 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.170
 then keep it up 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.800
 which can be left on for the medium 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.510
 normal user so that's just 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.610
 so set how many false alarms 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.380
 So it sounds like that now 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.630
 but simplifies this detection 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.250
 tries programs because of their 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.320
 to rate behavior and it works 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.850
 Often also times simply wrong 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.620
 for normal user recognition levels 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.000
 All other users know the medium 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.860
 already have something to stop 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.650
 every second one can still be here 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.800
 choose to lure it 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.580
 Good program and play came out 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.580
 actually let 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.980
 normal city ​​is also first in 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.340
 order and now take the first time 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.870
 Out 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.940
 you do not need to look at them 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.680
 quick check and then he finished 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.220
 put 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.600
 at least that's the virus scanner 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.270
 is installed we also below 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.050
 the case schalkes unfolded and now 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.930
 we come to the second part and that to the 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:13.630
 Remove advertising for open 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.890
 Start menu and give a local local 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.060
 Security policy is what we are 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.430
 you need to get there too 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.019
 system control and administration out though 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.530
 with windows 7 quite simply also over the 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.100
 search 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.740
 if that has opened then go 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.319
 here on software guidelines 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.599
 restricts 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.980
 and if you give it the first time 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.560
 there is no directive therefore we do 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.819
 right click on it and go on 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.159
 new guidelines for software 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.349
 create restrictions here 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:42.319
 additional rules here again 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:45.859
 right click in and if here new path 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:48.049
 rule out so and now we can here 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.620
 search the path there how are we going 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:54.139
 now in the installation directory of 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.739
 avira to music creatures no that is 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.349
 not it 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.389
 then there is such a program mix 68 there 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.609
 is avira antivir desktop that that 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:07.969
 have installed abroad and here 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:09.889
 is there av motive there it is that is that 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:12.079
 window is under this pop up itself 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:15.650
 in the opened advertising simply fades in 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.419
 Select here and not allowed 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.380
 put that means windows blocks the 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:25.789
 execution and he got it 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.880
 Name advertising of amira then 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:30.650
 confirm with ok 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.400
 and now the program can be 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.400
 stop executing
