yeah<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.930> might<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.290> but<00:01:58.530> Christian<00:01:59.250> Bale<00:01:59.430> is

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
not going to be Batman

not going to be Batman
okay<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.140> think<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.950> possible<00:02:02.460> either<00:02:02.640> way

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
okay I think it's possible either way

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.039 
okay I think it's possible either way
but<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.119> think<00:02:03.360> there<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.659> at<00:02:03.780> least<00:02:03.960> a

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
but I think there is a at least a

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.679 
but I think there is a at least a
possibility<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:05.250> he<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.790> such<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> big<00:02:06.390> money

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
possibility that he is such a big money

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.020 
possibility that he is such a big money
draw<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.429> Batman<00:02:08.700> from<00:02:08.910> the

thing's<00:02:59.370> gonna<00:02:59.489> be<00:02:59.610> structured<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.090> might<00:03:00.239> be

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
thing's gonna be structured it might be

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.930 
thing's gonna be structured it might be
90%<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:01.349> it<00:03:01.500> focuses<00:03:02.069> on<00:03:02.190> Superman<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.910> Batman

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
90% of it focuses on Superman and Batman

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.910 
90% of it focuses on Superman and Batman
is<00:03:03.299> just<00:03:03.480> like<00:03:03.629> 10%<00:03:03.959> doesn't<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.590> I'll<00:03:04.769> be

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920
