00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.670 

all<00:00:01.650> yo<00:00:01.829> Minecrafters<00:00:02.460> this<00:00:02.760> is<00:00:02.909> wood<00:00:03.179> again<00:00:03.680> I

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
all yo Minecrafters this is wood again I

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.590 
all yo Minecrafters this is wood again I
want<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.400> show<00:00:05.640> you<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.850> little<00:00:06.060> improvement

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
want to show you a little improvement

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.470 
want to show you a little improvement
I've<00:00:07.140> made<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:08.010> tree<00:00:08.700> farm<00:00:09.000> design<00:00:09.450> and

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
I've made on the tree farm design and

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.850 
I've made on the tree farm design and
usually<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.630> used<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:13.019> be<00:00:13.139> all<00:00:13.259> clogged<00:00:13.650> up

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
usually it used to be all clogged up

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.090 
usually it used to be all clogged up
with<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.219> system<00:00:14.639> here<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.540> detector<00:00:16.139> now

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
with the system here the detector now

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.109 
with the system here the detector now
you<00:00:17.699> can<00:00:17.910> just<00:00:19.520> enter<00:00:20.520> three<00:00:20.970> air<00:00:22.939> let's<00:00:23.939> start

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
you can just enter three air let's start

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.340 
you can just enter three air let's start
it<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:25.740> there<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.250> go

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.850 

so<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> trick<00:00:32.670> here<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.590> the<00:00:34.590> clock

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
so the trick here is that the the clock

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.320 
so the trick here is that the the clock
and<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.220> system<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.880> at<00:00:36.150> the<00:00:36.330> fourth<00:00:36.660> block<00:00:37.190> so

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
and the system is at the fourth block so

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.150 
and the system is at the fourth block so
with<00:00:39.330> this<00:00:39.540> setup<00:00:39.810> i<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.230> add<00:00:40.440> trees<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.130> are

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
with this setup i can add trees that are

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.310 
with this setup i can add trees that are
five<00:00:41.670> or<00:00:41.970> four<00:00:42.540> high<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.520> if<00:00:44.910> i<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:45.630> a<00:00:45.660> poor

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
five or four high so if i get a poor

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.720 
five or four high so if i get a poor
high<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:48.620> when<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.890> tree<00:00:50.400> grows<00:00:50.670> in

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
high like this when the tree grows in

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.940 
high like this when the tree grows in
there<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> block<00:00:51.450> here<00:00:51.780> everything<00:00:52.620> will<00:00:52.770> get

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
there the block here everything will get

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:03.369 
there the block here everything will get
pushed<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:59.570> the<00:01:00.570> green<00:01:01.080> wool<00:01:01.410> there<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.070> only

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
pushed so the green wool there is only

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.810 
pushed so the green wool there is only
superficial<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.670> decoration

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
superficial it's just for decoration

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.810 
superficial it's just for decoration
just<00:01:06.480> show<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:07.110> add<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> wall<00:01:07.620> and<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
just show you can add a wall and the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.740 
just show you can add a wall and the
line<00:01:09.000> air<00:01:09.270> obviously<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.930> where<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.290> trees<00:01:10.620> go

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
line air obviously is where the trees go

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.740 
line air obviously is where the trees go
get<00:01:12.750> pushed<00:01:13.050> and<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:14.040> piston<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.700> behind<00:01:15.120> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
get pushed and the piston are behind the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.800 
get pushed and the piston are behind the
red<00:01:16.560> wool<00:01:16.800> ear<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:18.030> any<00:01:18.360> design

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
red wool ear so you can have any design

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.570 
red wool ear so you can have any design
you<00:01:18.840> want<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.560> fit<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:19.979> with<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.310> wall

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
you want you can fit it with your wall

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.100 
you want you can fit it with your wall
and<00:01:21.409> these<00:01:22.409> are<00:01:22.740> range<00:01:23.010> will<00:01:23.310> air<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.110> you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and these are range will air and you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.080 
and these are range will air and you
could<00:01:25.320> put<00:01:25.560> glass<00:01:25.890> here<00:01:26.220> because<00:01:27.000> sometimes

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
could put glass here because sometimes

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.690 
could put glass here because sometimes
leaves<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.360> will<00:01:30.780> grow<00:01:31.049> there<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:34.700> behind

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
leaves with will grow there and behind

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.600 
leaves with will grow there and behind
here<00:01:35.939> we<00:01:36.149> have<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:37.530> wiring<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.159> connects

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
here we have the wiring that connects

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.319 
here we have the wiring that connects
the<00:01:38.820> six<00:01:39.210> Pistons<00:01:39.890> it's<00:01:40.890> only<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.789> wire<00:01:42.030> that

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
the six Pistons it's only one wire that

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.039 
the six Pistons it's only one wire that
connects<00:01:42.659> them<00:01:42.780> all<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:44.539> here<00:01:45.539> is<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.869> wire

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
connects them all and here is the wire

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.469 
connects them all and here is the wire
that<00:01:46.380> connects<00:01:46.979> all<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.490> piston<00:01:47.939> when<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
that connects all the piston when the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.539 
that connects all the piston when the
tree<00:01:48.780> grows<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.380> complete<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.979> circuit<00:01:52.549> we

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
tree grows to complete the circuit we

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.080 
tree grows to complete the circuit we
have<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> clock<00:01:54.180> here<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:55.079> two<00:01:56.090> repeaters

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
have the clock here it's two repeaters

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.630 
have the clock here it's two repeaters
in<00:01:57.659> Reverse<00:01:59.119> at<00:02:00.119> full<00:02:00.509> tick<00:02:01.189> with<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.340> block

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
in Reverse at full tick with the block

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.060 
in Reverse at full tick with the block
air<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.179> the<00:02:03.299> dust<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.929> to<00:02:04.140> dust<00:02:04.170> ear<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.950> it

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
air in the dust and to dust ear and it

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.950 
air in the dust and to dust ear and it
does<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.490> connects<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.299> tree<00:02:06.659> when<00:02:06.840> it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
does that connects to the tree when it

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.830 
does that connects to the tree when it
grows

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.620 

so<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.050> switch<00:02:12.350> when<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.160> start<00:02:13.520> it<00:02:13.670> it's

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
so the switch when you start it it's

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.460 
so the switch when you start it it's
like<00:02:14.990> it<00:02:15.140> light<00:02:15.380> up<00:02:15.410> this<00:02:15.800> dust<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:17.030> it's

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
like it light up this dust and it's

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.470 
like it light up this dust and it's
going<00:02:18.470> into<00:02:18.830> this<00:02:19.310> monostable<00:02:19.880> circuits

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
going into this monostable circuits

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.560 
going into this monostable circuits
sending<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.960> pulse<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:21.590> line<00:02:21.830> and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
sending a pulse to this line and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.470 
sending a pulse to this line and
activating<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.720> clock<00:02:25.750> also<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:28.280> closes<00:02:29.210> this

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
activating the clock also it closes this

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.020 
activating the clock also it closes this
torch<00:02:29.930> which<00:02:30.710> activate<00:02:31.250> this<00:02:31.460> one<00:02:31.790> and

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
torch which activate this one and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.200 
torch which activate this one and
activate<00:02:32.600> this<00:02:32.750> distance<00:02:33.760> which<00:02:34.760> put<00:02:35.090> in

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
activate this distance which put in

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.210 
activate this distance which put in
place<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:35.750> block<00:02:36.110> that<00:02:36.680> completes<00:02:37.130> the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
place this block that completes the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.090 
place this block that completes the
circuit<00:02:37.760> for<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.300> clock<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:39.320> when<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:39.740> switch

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
circuit for the clock so when you switch

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.570 
circuit for the clock so when you switch
off<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:40.730> piston<00:02:41.270> gets<00:02:41.950> retracted<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.400> this

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
off this piston gets retracted and this

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.740 
off this piston gets retracted and this
blocks<00:02:43.880> remove<00:02:44.300> so<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.170> clock<00:02:45.410> stopped<00:02:45.710> and

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
blocks remove so the clock stopped and

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.380 
blocks remove so the clock stopped and
from<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:47.990> side<00:02:48.350> of<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.740> clock<00:02:49.240> we<00:02:50.240> have<00:02:50.360> a

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
from this side of the clock we have a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.470 
from this side of the clock we have a
torch<00:02:50.810> here<00:02:51.340> let's<00:02:52.340> send<00:02:52.610> this<00:02:52.730> signal<00:02:53.030> down

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
torch here let's send this signal down

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.020 
torch here let's send this signal down
and<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:57.020> our<00:02:57.260> redstone<00:02:58.220> torch<00:02:58.490> here<00:02:58.820> our

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
and to our redstone torch here our

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.770 
and to our redstone torch here our
indicator<00:02:59.720> light<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.730> when<00:03:02.120> it's<00:03:02.270> flashing<00:03:02.510> it

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
indicator light so when it's flashing it

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.800 
indicator light so when it's flashing it
means<00:03:02.990> that<00:03:03.170> it's<00:03:03.410> on<00:03:04.270> when<00:03:05.270> it's<00:03:05.420> off<00:03:05.630> it

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
means that it's on when it's off it

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.040 
means that it's on when it's off it
means<00:03:06.020> it's<00:03:06.230> off<00:03:06.880> if<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:08.180> leave<00:03:08.480> your<00:03:08.750> world

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
means it's off if you leave your world

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:16.240 
means it's off if you leave your world
and<00:03:09.820> while<00:03:10.820> it's<00:03:11.000> flashing<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:15.500> will<00:03:15.740> stay<00:03:16.040> on

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
and while it's flashing it will stay on

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.020 
and while it's flashing it will stay on
so<00:03:16.640> on<00:03:17.620> doesn't<00:03:18.620> mean<00:03:18.860> it<00:03:19.010> works<00:03:19.310> it<00:03:19.700> doesn't

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
so on doesn't mean it works it doesn't

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.590 
so on doesn't mean it works it doesn't
mean<00:03:20.330> it's<00:03:20.450> off<00:03:20.740> just<00:03:21.740> mean<00:03:21.950> it's<00:03:22.160> broken<00:03:22.600> so

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
mean it's off just mean it's broken so

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.780 
mean it's off just mean it's broken so
when<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.350> flashes<00:03:24.860> it<00:03:25.010> sound<00:03:25.250> so<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:25.490> need<00:03:25.670> to

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
when it flashes it sound so you need to

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.850 
when it flashes it sound so you need to
close<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.270> you<00:03:26.720> can<00:03:26.990> just<00:03:27.170> restart<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.770> and

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
close it you can just restart it and

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.150 
close it you can just restart it and
everything<00:03:28.280> works<00:03:28.460> fine<00:03:28.700> again<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.920> if<00:03:30.920> you

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
everything works fine again and if you

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.860 
everything works fine again and if you
leave<00:03:32.030> your<00:03:32.210> world<00:03:32.420> when<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:33.190> light<00:03:34.190> is<00:03:34.220> out

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
leave your world when the light is out

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.610 
leave your world when the light is out
the<00:03:35.870> switch<00:03:36.590> is<00:03:36.620> still<00:03:36.920> on<00:03:37.330> off<00:03:38.350> still<00:03:39.350> means

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
the switch is still on off still means

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.710 
the switch is still on off still means
it's<00:03:39.860> off<00:03:40.100> but<00:03:40.550> in<00:03:40.850> this<00:03:41.000> case<00:03:41.210> it's<00:03:41.450> broken

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
it's off but in this case it's broken

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.290 
it's off but in this case it's broken
but<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:42.740> switch<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.100> light<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.610> it<00:03:43.700> stays

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
but you switch the light and it stays

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.800 
but you switch the light and it stays
off<00:03:44.630> so<00:03:45.260> it's<00:03:46.190> still<00:03:46.520> off<00:03:46.760> switch<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.630> light

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
off so it's still off switch the light

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.270 
off so it's still off switch the light
in<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.050> switch<00:03:48.380> and

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
in the switch and

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.720 
in the switch and
it's<00:03:49.790> on<00:03:50.030> again<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:52.370> that's<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:54.340> not<00:03:55.340> too

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
it's on again so that's it not too

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.840 
it's on again so that's it not too
complex<00:03:56.360> wiring<00:03:56.690> I<00:03:57.200> put<00:03:57.740> it<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.100> most<00:03:58.340> compact

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
complex wiring I put it the most compact

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.110 
complex wiring I put it the most compact
I<00:03:59.090> could<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:02.780> glass<00:04:03.770> ear<00:04:04.100> is<00:04:04.280> only<00:04:04.459> there<00:04:04.790> so

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
I could the glass ear is only there so

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.280 
I could the glass ear is only there so
that<00:04:05.150> leaves<00:04:05.690> one<00:04:06.020> grow<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.750> yeah<00:04:08.959> just<00:04:09.200> a

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
that leaves one grow so yeah just a

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.090 
that leaves one grow so yeah just a
monostable<00:04:09.620> circuit<00:04:10.280> o'clock<00:04:10.790> in<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.209> piston

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
monostable circuit o'clock in the piston

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.039 
monostable circuit o'clock in the piston
basically<00:04:13.100> that's<00:04:13.340> it<00:04:13.520> and<00:04:13.790> on<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:15.440> fourth

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
basically that's it and on the fourth

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.650 
basically that's it and on the fourth
tree<00:04:18.049> block<00:04:19.450> so<00:04:20.450> nothing<00:04:21.139> will<00:04:21.320> grow<00:04:21.560> the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
tree block so nothing will grow the

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.230 
tree block so nothing will grow the
block<00:04:23.660> is<00:04:23.840> there<00:04:24.290> and<00:04:24.620> I<00:04:25.280> mean<00:04:25.669> the<00:04:25.850> distant

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
block is there and I mean the distant

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.650 
block is there and I mean the distant
won't<00:04:26.419> push<00:04:26.660> until<00:04:26.890> there's<00:04:27.890> a<00:04:28.010> block<00:04:28.310> here<00:04:31.660> so

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
won't push until there's a block here so

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.930 
won't push until there's a block here so
that's<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:33.050> hope<00:04:33.740> you<00:04:33.919> enjoyed<00:04:34.220> thanks<00:04:34.820> for
