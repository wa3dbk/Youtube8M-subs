00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.480 

hello<00:00:00.510> guys<00:00:00.719> calculator<00:00:01.380> here<00:00:01.650> today<00:00:02.310> I<00:00:02.340> want

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
hello guys calculator here today I want

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.100 
hello guys calculator here today I want
to<00:00:02.550> show<00:00:02.639> you<00:00:02.730> guys<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:02.909> new<00:00:03.240> feature<00:00:03.480> in<00:00:03.600> ICBM

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
to show you guys a new feature in ICBM

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.349 
to show you guys a new feature in ICBM
and<00:00:04.319> that<00:00:04.560> is<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:05.009> laser<00:00:05.220> turret<00:00:05.670> so<00:00:06.210> the

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
and that is the laser turret so the

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:07.909 
and that is the laser turret so the
laser<00:00:06.480> turns<00:00:06.779> basically<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.259> turret<00:00:07.710> that

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
laser turns basically a turret that

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.500 
laser turns basically a turret that
doesn't<00:00:08.250> use<00:00:08.400> any<00:00:08.610> bullets<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.179> just<00:00:09.389> use

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
doesn't use any bullets it just use

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.100 
doesn't use any bullets it just use
energy<00:00:09.750> which<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.710> why<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.040> uses<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> pretty

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
energy which is why it uses a pretty

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.140 
energy which is why it uses a pretty
good<00:00:13.110> amount<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.349> energy<00:00:13.469> here<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.969> laser

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
good amount of energy here and the laser

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.090 
good amount of energy here and the laser
turret<00:00:15.389> basically<00:00:15.809> just<00:00:16.170> as<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.740> can<00:00:16.890> guess

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
turret basically just as you can guess

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:35.090 
turret basically just as you can guess
zaps<00:00:21.230> just<00:00:22.230> turn<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.619> sound<00:00:22.880> to<00:00:23.880> 1%<00:00:33.350> so<00:00:34.350> these

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
zaps just turn the sound to 1% so these

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.740 
zaps just turn the sound to 1% so these
things<00:00:35.399> are<00:00:35.579> pretty<00:00:35.700> useful<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.210> people<00:00:36.600> who

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
things are pretty useful for people who

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.869 
things are pretty useful for people who
don't<00:00:36.870> want<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.050> waste<00:00:37.230> bullets<00:00:37.579> but<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.700> takes

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
don't want to waste bullets but it takes

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.729 
don't want to waste bullets but it takes
quite<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.149> lot<00:00:39.300> energy<00:00:39.450> compared<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.590> gun

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
quite a lot energy compared to the gun

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.500 
quite a lot energy compared to the gun
turret<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.879> also<00:00:42.270> has<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> low<00:00:42.809> health<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:44.510> it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
turret and also has a low health and it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.029 
turret and also has a low health and it
has<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> shorter<00:00:46.170> range<00:00:46.379> compared<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.829> gun

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
has a shorter range compared to gun

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.020 
has a shorter range compared to gun
turrets<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.489> there<00:00:47.700> are<00:00:47.760> some<00:00:47.879> disadvantages

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
turrets so there are some disadvantages

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.850 
turrets so there are some disadvantages
of<00:00:48.570> using<00:00:48.719> laser<00:00:49.079> turret<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.530> there<00:00:49.710> are<00:00:49.770> also

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
of using laser turret and there are also

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.240 
of using laser turret and there are also
some<00:00:50.250> advantages<00:00:50.969> such<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:51.980> infinite<00:00:52.980> bullet

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
some advantages such as infinite bullet

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.310 
some advantages such as infinite bullet
pretty<00:00:54.239> much<00:00:55.370> another<00:00:56.370> feature<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.480> laser

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
pretty much another feature of the laser

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.049 
pretty much another feature of the laser
is<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.920> moves<00:00:59.160> faster<00:00:59.670> than<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> gun

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
is that it moves faster than the gun

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.110 
is that it moves faster than the gun
turret<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:01.079> good<00:01:01.260> for<00:01:01.289> small<00:01:02.280> places<00:01:02.940> or

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
turret so it's good for small places or

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.440 
turret so it's good for small places or
a<00:01:03.180> close-range<00:01:03.719> attacks<00:01:05.030> another<00:01:06.030> feature<00:01:06.330> I

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
a close-range attacks another feature I

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.200 
a close-range attacks another feature I
want<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.600> show<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.840> guys<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.170> ICBM<00:01:08.060> sentry<00:01:09.060> is

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
want to show you guys in ICBM sentry is

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.480 
want to show you guys in ICBM sentry is
that<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.049> AE<00:01:10.590> turrets<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:11.280> will

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that the the the AE turrets now will

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.210 
that the the the AE turrets now will
shoot<00:01:11.729> down<00:01:11.760> withers<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.920> supposedly<00:01:13.920> end

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
shoot down withers and supposedly end

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.810 
shoot down withers and supposedly end
dragons<00:01:14.700> also<00:01:15.470> basically<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.070> turret<00:01:17.580> now

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
dragons also basically the a turret now

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.210 
dragons also basically the a turret now
I<00:01:17.850> increase<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.630> speed<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.040> health

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
I increase the speed and the health

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.530 
I increase the speed and the health
actually<00:01:20.640> increase<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> health<00:01:21.330> of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
actually increase the health of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.350 
actually increase the health of
everything<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.320> little<00:01:22.409> bit<00:01:22.560> more<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.180> made<00:01:24.180> it

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
everything a little bit more and made it

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.330 
everything a little bit more and made it
as<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.080> can<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.470> very<00:01:25.650> fast<00:01:26.009> actually

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
as you can see it's very fast actually

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.340 
as you can see it's very fast actually
made<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.210> lot<00:01:27.390> better<00:01:27.630> at<00:01:27.840> shooting<00:01:28.200> down

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
made it a lot better at shooting down

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.039 
made it a lot better at shooting down
missiles<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.070> if<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.460> try<00:01:29.939> out<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> missile<00:01:30.509> here

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
missiles so if we try out a missile here

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.330 
missiles so if we try out a missile here
shoot-down<00:01:32.950> also<00:01:33.430> very<00:01:34.000> accurately<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
shoot-down also very accurately the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.499 
shoot-down also very accurately the
chance<00:01:36.670> of<00:01:36.880> missing<00:01:37.119> is<00:01:37.360> not<00:01:38.460> very<00:01:39.460> not<00:01:40.299> very

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
chance of missing is not very not very

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.370 
chance of missing is not very not very
high<00:01:41.380> I'd<00:01:41.649> say<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:43.119> this<00:01:43.659> thing<00:01:43.899> does<00:01:44.170> take

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
high I'd say but this thing does take

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.649 
high I'd say but this thing does take
some<00:01:44.500> time<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.830> rotate<00:01:44.979> over<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:45.850> having<00:01:46.360> more

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
some time to rotate over so having more

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.660 
some time to rotate over so having more
aid<00:01:46.810> terms<00:01:47.110> will<00:01:47.289> guarantee<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.009> better

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
aid terms will guarantee you a better

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.910 
aid terms will guarantee you a better
chance<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.180> protecting<00:01:49.330> your<00:01:49.840> place<00:01:50.590> from

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
chance of protecting your place from

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.399 
chance of protecting your place from
missiles<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:51.789> in<00:01:52.600> addition<00:01:52.990> it<00:01:53.170> will<00:01:53.259> shoot

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
missiles and in addition it will shoot

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.700 
missiles and in addition it will shoot
down<00:01:53.470> as<00:01:53.830> I<00:01:53.860> said<00:01:54.220> err<00:01:55.149> mobs<00:01:55.539> so<00:01:55.990> let's<00:01:56.470> say<00:01:56.590> we

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
down as I said err mobs so let's say we

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:09.399 
down as I said err mobs so let's say we
have<00:01:56.799> a<00:01:56.830> wizard

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:12.160 

tracking

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
tracking

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.390 
tracking
and<00:02:12.260> they'll<00:02:13.099> also<00:02:13.280> take<00:02:13.670> damage

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:29.080 

I<00:02:17.430> better<00:02:17.730> start<00:02:18.120> checking<00:02:19.400> thank<00:02:20.400> you

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.179 

Oh<00:02:29.950> No

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 
Oh No

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.819 
Oh No
and<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.819> a<00:02:31.849> is<00:02:32.030> hurt<00:02:32.209> broke<00:02:32.689> so<00:02:32.989> as<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.590> seem

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
and the a is hurt broke so as you seem

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.709 
and the a is hurt broke so as you seem
to<00:02:33.859> take<00:02:34.099> out<00:02:34.219> whether<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.700> need<00:02:34.879> morphine<00:02:35.269> to

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:35.719 
to take out whether you need morphine to

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.720 
to take out whether you need morphine to
aid<00:02:35.930> tourists<00:02:36.379> but<00:02:36.920> also<00:02:37.129> as<00:02:37.489> you<00:02:37.579> can<00:02:37.639> see

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730
