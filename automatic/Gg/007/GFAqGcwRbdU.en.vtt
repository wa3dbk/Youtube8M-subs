also showed a silhouette of Cortana

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.359 
also showed a silhouette of Cortana
interesting<00:02:00.570> yeah<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.320> sounds<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.680> she

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
interesting yeah so it sounds like she

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.160

or something like her

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.590 
or something like her
maybe<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.490> mimic<00:02:05.820> or<00:02:06.150> you<00:02:06.299> know<00:02:06.420> she's

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
maybe it's a mimic or you know she's

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.940 
maybe it's a mimic or you know she's
been<00:02:06.689> assimilated<00:02:06.960> by<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.350> by<00:02:07.530> something<00:02:07.740> else

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
been assimilated by it by something else

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.740 
been assimilated by it by something else
will<00:02:08.550> play<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> part<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> story<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.450> when

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
will play a part in the story and when

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.510 
will play a part in the story and when
Master<00:02:10.020> Chief's<00:02:10.229> saw<00:02:10.440> her<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:11.190> could<00:02:11.310> kind<00:02:11.459> of

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
Master Chief's saw her you could kind of

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.620 
Master Chief's saw her you could kind of
tell<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.790> was<00:02:11.880> that<00:02:12.000> moment<00:02:12.150> when<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> two

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
tell it was that moment when the two

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.660 
tell it was that moment when the two
characters<00:02:13.020> were<00:02:13.200> at<00:02:13.440> least<00:02:13.620> he<00:02:13.830> felt<00:02:14.160> that

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
characters were at least he felt that

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.520 
characters were at least he felt that
connection<00:02:14.970> right<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.140> always<00:02:16.260> sort<00:02:16.500> of

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
connection right that it always sort of

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.080 
connection right that it always sort of
takes<00:02:16.739> him<00:02:16.890> out<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.190> adventure<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:17.940> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
takes him out of the adventure of the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.970 
takes him out of the adventure of the
mission<00:02:18.330> at<00:02:18.420> hand<00:02:18.450> he's<00:02:19.230> very<00:02:19.380> focused<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.800> her

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
mission at hand he's very focused on her

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.860 
mission at hand he's very focused on her
so<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.520> think<00:02:20.700> it's<00:02:20.910> still<00:02:21.090> Master<00:02:21.390> Chief<00:02:21.569> story

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
so I think it's still Master Chief story

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.690 
so I think it's still Master Chief story
but<00:02:22.560> there's<00:02:22.709> definitely<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:23.130> lot<00:02:23.280> more<00:02:23.340> going

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
but there's definitely a lot more going

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.270 
but there's definitely a lot more going
on<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.239> that's<00:02:24.330> not<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.600> only<00:02:24.690> thing

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
on and that's not the only thing

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.680 
on and that's not the only thing
