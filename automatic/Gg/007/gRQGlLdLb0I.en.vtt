00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.669 
China is low so that our planes are more
competitive<00:02:07.630> but<00:02:08.630> as<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:09.019> the<00:02:09.140> question<00:02:09.170> of

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
competitive but as to the question of

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.259 
competitive but as to the question of
how<00:02:09.830> much<00:02:10.069> lower<00:02:10.369> than<00:02:10.580> Western<00:02:11.000> counterparts

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
how much lower than Western counterparts

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.780 
how much lower than Western counterparts
I<00:02:11.900> think<00:02:12.470> that<00:02:12.709> is<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.010> sensitive<00:02:13.610> question

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
I think that is a sensitive question

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.160 
I think that is a sensitive question
that's<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.510> good<00:02:14.660> takeoff<00:02:15.500> coming<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:17.750> far<00:02:17.959> the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
that's a good takeoff coming so far the

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
largest c9 I think already has 400
