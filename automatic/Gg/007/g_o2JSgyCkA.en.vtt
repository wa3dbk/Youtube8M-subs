 11 roberto rosemary moon 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:12.230
 people laugh but you have to have a clear example 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.230
 do not quote simply kammermusik with something more chord 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.390
 as 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.510
 I know that not everyone likes the song that was before possible 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.730
 now it costs more 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.030
 i efe 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.489
 I'm fine 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.749
 something that had not made any video yet something that tomorrow is 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.909
 lending everyone is making videos of my field let people 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.040
 Galician geologist wines everyone is asking me and every 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.750
 of other things how it was 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.750
 for certain pretensions that it gives 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.790
 however 500 is happening little by little because it is that really 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.270
 we are preparing all the people we are in difficulties of all in 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.240
 At the same hour 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.540
 i right now what 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.829
 p we have started a school adds 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.960
 curro shot our mind is 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.960
 it's costing but I promise then Aztec 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.870
 one part is almost stopped 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.410
 it is shortly I am going to denounce these two parts and the pique 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.650
 efe jad this year a game simply 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.650
 this goes in no way 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.420
 still 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.510
 we saw 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.860
 monkeys 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.340
 impunity has now been the seed 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.340
 I suppose it will be what you want so that this one created a world 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.730
 so is 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.230
 typical knowledge user creates 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.270
 a world with the guides 6 6 6 6 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.640
 can 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.550
 Really 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.460
 another person that you put 16 15 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.160
 against it the same world 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
 God knows where the hell I am there are trees 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.500
 this ship say is that I either 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.140
 the game very much improper weapon that 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.260
 do not suffer a little huh 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
 to explain everything a little a lot of people were telling me 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.650
 I thought that they have known to prevent deteriorations I do not understand I do not want that 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.599
 will play that you know why why 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.779
 Bush's support was crap and son-in-law 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:20.009
 not really in regards to going into shock 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:22.979
 it's much better to play once determined 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:25.639
 there was the first thing we found that 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.909
 it's not up to date either, you could hear the sic 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.009
 ilana I'm just going to 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.909
 fox shortly after 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.909
 or that you understand, you will see 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.519
 is really commenting on a challenge 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.009
 like it or not 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:51.699
 what this new adhesion I am, what do I know a little bit and rediscovering 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:52.169
 today 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.009
 of you told me a little bit about 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:59.359
 that you know he could discover without the big boston river pooles 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.219
 consecutive actor showed 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.120
 I know it's a panama lie in kraft 0 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.689
 for giving an example 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.159
 I'm the same carmona 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.240
 I saw the first thing that 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.959
 Israel that at the beginning 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.229
 burke 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:15.969
 the hours or more amounts 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.430
 welfare results a river 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.869
 I would say it is a lake or 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:22.869
 we have 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:26.289
 seen that something has fallen from above 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.189
 the current test 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.049
 the paca 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.029
 it's one thing that caught my attention are budgets things that 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:36.419
 is floating in the air is honestly hooked to nowhere 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:37.939
 except that it bursts me 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:40.239
 since before I was fine in the game 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.329
 and now it just is not not 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.259
 it's something that bothers me a bit but it has 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.109
 one can understand from what 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.109
 they are look, they will go arranging 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:54.159
 it ensures 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.909
 an ax to go a little faster 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.909
 paying to see how 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:03.549
 and see how he told me 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.549
 with a little less montepeque the vehicle would cause 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.809
 like mushrooms 

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:12.879
 I had played like that just in a world the island is better 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.120
 this complaint of what I am sure is the supa and volvo 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.249
 the typical of eresma ofra hotels that 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:23.509
 you have to survive without class nor am I quite simple 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.620
 If someone wants to play it free to do it 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.150
 the Australian who spent a lot 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.199
 I do not think that you are counting 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.059
 of everything less expensive 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:36.919
 of rating 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.110
 I do not care how many pampas were able to pick up the areas 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:46.460
 two 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.659
 I prefer not to enter 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:53.479
 that it is worth mentioning that they still do not have the executioner colt management of nadal which is 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.419
 this we are clear but 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.289
 I do not think it's the same 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.249
 no way 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:05.610
 continue a little bit of that 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.229
 its coal derivatives but 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.539
 I did not accept to go so well up 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.169
 against in another site 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.599
 pure website 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:17.279
 while and what I was worried about stopped araque 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.800
 if he died apart that the planned chivas is united 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.490
 a common program before with we are on the rise 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.559
 after juan josé estrada since 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.849
 before they are solís in betanzos we were abandoned 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.930
 i 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.300
 a false alarm happened 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.550
 I passed flag is to die and we did not decorate the statut saying 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.050
 I hope it's a shit 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.720
 so we've seen right now it's fixed it's a lot because I never 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.580
 it seems that 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.580
 they were a point of 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.690
 as I eat with you
