cardboard<00:01:48.280> all<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:48.820> kind<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.119> stuff

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
cardboard all that kind of stuff

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:50.819 
cardboard all that kind of stuff
anything<00:01:49.780> that's<00:01:49.929> going<00:01:50.049> to<00:01:50.109> break<00:01:50.200> down<00:01:50.530> easy

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
anything that's going to break down easy

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.190 
anything that's going to break down easy
but<00:01:51.130> try<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.520> do<00:01:51.609> it<00:01:51.729> in<00:01:51.850> layers<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.749> that's

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
but try and do it in layers and that's

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.260 
but try and do it in layers and that's
easier<00:01:53.649> for<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.890> worms<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.399> insects<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:55.090> get

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
easier for the worms and insects to get

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.929 
easier for the worms and insects to get
into<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:55.630> bin<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:56.499> actually<00:01:56.890> truth<00:01:57.189> you<00:01:57.490> two

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
into the bin to actually truth you two

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.239 
into the bin to actually truth you two
through<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:58.689> turn<00:01:59.259> it<00:01:59.409> into<00:01:59.530> compost<00:01:59.979> if

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:00.249 
through and turn it into compost if

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.999 
through and turn it into compost if
you've<00:02:00.399> got<00:02:00.640> great<00:02:00.850> big<00:02:01.179> layers<00:02:01.630> of<00:02:02.109> grass

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
you've got great big layers of grass

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.380 
you've got great big layers of grass
cuttings<00:02:03.460> or<00:02:03.609> something<00:02:03.939> like<00:02:04.030> that<00:02:04.090> in<00:02:04.299> the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
cuttings or something like that in the

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.630 
cuttings or something like that in the
pile<00:02:04.600> it's<00:02:05.380> just<00:02:05.590> too<00:02:05.740> hard<00:02:05.950> for<00:02:06.069> them<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.399> do

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
pile it's just too hard for them to do

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.530 
pile it's just too hard for them to do
it<00:02:06.789> now<00:02:07.689> today<00:02:08.460> you<00:02:09.460> can<00:02:09.640> see<00:02:09.820> here<00:02:10.090> now<00:02:10.390> I'll

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.810 
getting a whole heap of old vinyl which
i've<00:02:46.720> used<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.080> another<00:02:47.320> compost<00:02:47.800> heap<00:02:48.580> that

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
i've used it another compost heap that

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.640 
i've used it another compost heap that
i'll<00:02:48.910> show<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.210> so<00:02:49.900> i'm<00:02:49.990> going<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.260> use<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.440> bit

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
i'll show you so i'm going to use a bit

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.260 
i'll show you so i'm going to use a bit
of<00:02:50.740> that<00:02:50.860> too<00:02:50.920> for<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.460> bottom<00:02:51.700> of<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:51.880> the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
of that too for the bottom of this the

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.060 
of that too for the bottom of this the
main<00:02:52.450> thing<00:02:52.480> i<00:02:52.990> think<00:02:53.200> with<00:02:55.020> compost<00:02:56.020> bins<00:02:56.350> if

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
main thing i think with compost bins if

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.890 
main thing i think with compost bins if
you're<00:02:57.280> using<00:02:57.460> a<00:02:57.640> lot<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.820> garden<00:02:58.270> waste<00:02:58.450> gum

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
you're using a lot of garden waste gum

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.650 
you're using a lot of garden waste gum
kitchen<00:02:59.860> waste<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.370> scraps<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.240> things<00:03:01.510> like

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
kitchen waste and scraps and things like

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.250 
kitchen waste and scraps and things like
that<00:03:01.770> don't<00:03:02.770> add<00:03:03.040> meat<00:03:03.370> chicken<00:03:04.270> bones<00:03:04.510> fat

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
that don't add meat chicken bones fat

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.480 
that don't add meat chicken bones fat
all<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.770> kind<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.070> stuff<00:03:06.130> that<00:03:06.460> just

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
all that kind of stuff that just

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.720 
all that kind of stuff that just
attracts<00:03:06.970> mice<00:03:07.270> so<00:03:08.050> leave<00:03:08.260> them<00:03:08.290> out<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.830> try

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
attracts mice so leave them out and try

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.970 
attracts mice so leave them out and try
and<00:03:09.850> have<00:03:09.970> it<00:03:10.090> on<00:03:10.300> a<00:03:10.330> stable<00:03:10.660> base<00:03:11.050> something

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
and have it on a stable base something

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.250 
and have it on a stable base something
nice<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.400> firm<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:13.270> you<00:03:13.360> do<00:03:13.540> keep<00:03:13.780> things<00:03:14.080> like

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
the lid on and all I use as a brick easy

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.719 
the lid on and all I use as a brick easy
and<00:05:07.290> then<00:05:07.410> just<00:05:07.650> put<00:05:07.919> your<00:05:08.010> kitchen<00:05:08.340> waste<00:05:08.490> in

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
there build it up once it's full like I

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.730 
there build it up once it's full like I
said<00:05:11.340> alternate<00:05:12.150> to<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.389> other<00:05:12.510> one<00:05:14.660> simple

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
said alternate to the other one simple

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.710 
said alternate to the other one simple
now<00:05:16.740> that's<00:05:16.950> just<00:05:17.010> a<00:05:17.190> compost<00:05:17.580> bin<00:05:17.700> so<00:05:18.360> compost

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
now that's just a compost bin so compost

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.380 
now that's just a compost bin so compost
bins<00:05:18.990> like<00:05:19.770> this<00:05:19.979> one<00:05:20.190> I'm<00:05:20.880> pretty<00:05:21.120> cheap

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
bins like this one I'm pretty cheap

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.900 
bins like this one I'm pretty cheap
pretty<00:05:22.169> easy<00:05:22.350> to<00:05:22.560> use<00:05:22.770> and<00:05:23.010> everyone

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
pretty easy to use and everyone
