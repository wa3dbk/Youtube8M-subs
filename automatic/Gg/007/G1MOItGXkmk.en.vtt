00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:07.460
 I will not be able to have tea 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.040
 but I know that purple fans will 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.290
 and that if bender the ninjas do not come 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.810
 purple do not miss it because the 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.370
 sequence has no waste 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.660
 there are like two factions of girls 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.550
 confronted 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.310
 but this is the day I played camouflage 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.010
 ninja in class did not attend 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.590
 so the action starts the ground 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.080
 It is strewn with ninja bombs 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.090
 the deaths are going to see that they are from a 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.720
 appalling realism 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.720
 you see 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.670
 well this one dies in an acrobatic way 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.790
 well the one in front that scared dead 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.550
 because he has not touched anything 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.550
 it is drying and also of succumbing 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.010
 and someone my favorite where I was 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.010
 death here then I'm going 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.900
 well a little too when he gives the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.730
 win said 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.650
 it has been a massacre 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.140
 ninja escabechina but missing the ninja 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.770
 most powerful is the purple ninja that 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.770
 will appear now 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.720
 well it 's a very powerful ninja very 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.720
 proud as you can see with his face 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.360
 here is the worst enemy of iniap 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.790
 now online 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.530
 ocher prepared because the battle is going to 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.130
 be apotheosical and go 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.469
 I think they were not so far 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.930
 the supernatural forces of these two 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.149
 girls are very balanced so much is 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.380
 so by putting together your two powerful 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.990
 palms then the powder clear talcum powder 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.170
 of the friction to which the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.119
 land in those that good the ninja 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.189
 purple la cee a key ring that 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.460
 long here and we start with the arches 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:00.520
 ninja stars haha do not take effect 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.590
 ninja firecrackers to see how 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.689
 the ninja quietly dodges them 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.060
 pure is not going to surprise you with that 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:11.290
 also it has a resource about nunchucks 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.180
 that are not conventional because they throw 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.760
 rockets are a chaccus rocket launcher 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.430
 ninja this here puzzles him a little 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.890
 the ninja ocher eye care behind 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.010
 millions of the block good the ninja or 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.290
 they believe it does not give truce and it brings out a side that in 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.319
 finish 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.870
 strip heat for a site that pulls a lot of fire 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.090
 ninja with this did not count the ninja 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.900
 Purple has completely broken his tactic 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.950
 but he will try to counteract as he can 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.329
 first as then nothing 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.030
 taking an absurd leap that leads to 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:45.600
 nowhere and now with a 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.900
 here I love my mother extinguisher 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.850
 deployment of means that time you or if 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.400
 you climax 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.830
 now we just have to go try to run away 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.190
 flying but gets stuck in a 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:04.100
 farce and rubbing with friction because it 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.100
 catches fire and burns and dies 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.810
 nothing can love his fellow lynch 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.810
 make a fucking mother barbecue 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.280
 and how to finish the movie so
