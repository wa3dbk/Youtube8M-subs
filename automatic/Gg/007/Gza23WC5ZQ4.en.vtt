00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.550
 will find him to become the first calf to 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.990
 base of tron ​​so finally I'm going to te 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.030
 take the difference between a 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.800
 old did but a drone so that's 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.869
 a question we often ask ourselves is 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.000
 actually a drone is completely 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.170
 autonomous 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.850
 so we just have to go back 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.500
 coordinates and evs accomplish his mission 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.939
 when canuts needed him 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.980
 to be controlled we wanted to know 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.110
 now we talked about the arrival 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.090
 of a phantom 3 we would have liked 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.760
 know more then own funds roofs 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.149
 happens now that the outputs of 8 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.280
 April 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.930
 it is available in two versions one 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.870
 professional version a version 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.829
 advanced both versions have in common 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.500
 a new camera stabilizer 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.590
 they have a camera they shrunk 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.230
 the field of view to 94% to avoid from 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.449
 10am on the picture and finally they have a 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.609
 stabilizer that is extremely 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.159
 effective and that allows you to use the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.490
 drone even inside 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.340
 our ferney guys without danger 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.450
 for people who are above all 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.280
 the difference between the drone 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.409
 professional and a big advance and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.399
 the biggest professional camera and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.359
 that you do not have much more 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:25.859
 someone's performance and that of the 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:27.630
 dance and a camera that fitted 1920 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.539
 pixels or on the caravans they are 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.099
 already a commune of the ain but how 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.049
 will that convince 

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:37.530
 professionals to switch to drones 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.750
 diwan al 2005 to human rights there 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.569
 believe that they are already ready to fly on 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.629

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:48.209
 schedule by the ex will go out tomorrow their 

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:51.179
 next drones and 2 had often 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.099
 was precisely the picture the two places 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.110
 serve so it looked a lot like 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:58.289
 drones get you up when you 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.170
 think this roic following where the virus but there 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.420
 now the drone that we saw I 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.569
 looked on which he calls his only 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.310
 have increased his sound already looks like 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:12.599
 to a much simpler a drone 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.519
 gets a loan with the rita stolen and that 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.739
 does not look like a ghost that's 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.410
 a lot of things and it looks like the 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.660
 critical but that's really what we 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.489
 notice a lot right now what 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.799
 people say that together that a 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.950
