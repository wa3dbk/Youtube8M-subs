capsules<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.180> fit<00:00:45.870> or<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.129> get<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
capsules or fit or you can get the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.819 
capsules or fit or you can get the
liquid<00:00:47.820> they<00:00:48.180> do<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.600> vitamin<00:00:49.110> E<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
liquid they do have vitamin E just the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.660 
liquid they do have vitamin E just the
liquid<00:00:50.190> they<00:00:50.399> don't<00:00:50.840> but<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.020> prefer<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.039> gels

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
liquid they don't but I prefer the gels

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.959
