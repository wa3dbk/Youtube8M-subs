the 125 CC cart though makes it easier
now<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> event<00:00:30.779> setups<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.980> makes<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.340> a

now in the event setups this makes it a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.770 
now in the event setups this makes it a
little<00:00:32.460> easier<00:00:32.640> if<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:32.969> like<00:00:33.149> rolling<00:00:33.510> start

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
little easier if you like rolling start

number<00:00:37.559> opponents<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.579> 0<00:00:38.969> because<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.600> need

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
number opponents to 0 because you need

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
to complete this without collisions and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.400 
to complete this without collisions and
other<00:00:41.579> cars<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:42.120> cause<00:00:42.329> collisions<00:00:42.750> now<00:00:43.260> this

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
other cars can cause collisions now this

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.590 
other cars can cause collisions now this
is<00:00:43.559> cockpit<00:00:44.040> view<00:00:44.340> where<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.360> see<00:00:45.480> the

steering wheel so I'm kind of cycling
the<00:00:47.610> room<00:00:47.850> here<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.690> make<00:00:48.870> sure<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.379> this

so you can see just the steering wheel
here<00:00:57.360> now<00:00:57.809> with<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.989> rolling<00:00:58.230> start<00:00:58.500> we're

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
here now with the rolling start we're

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.279 
here now with the rolling start we're
gonna<00:00:58.949> approach<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.760> start<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.750> lap<00:01:00.960> 1

there's only one lap but we're gonna hit
the<00:01:03.989> starting<00:01:04.409> gate<00:01:05.070> here<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.549> before<00:01:06.330> we

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the starting gate here and before we

and we need to drive this entire thing

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.499 
and we need to drive this entire thing
in<00:01:10.830> Reverse<00:01:12.680> now<00:01:13.680> when<00:01:13.860> you're<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.509> Reverse

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
in Reverse now when you're in Reverse

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.960 
in Reverse now when you're in Reverse
here<00:01:16.380> you're<00:01:16.500> gonna<00:01:16.619> hit<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.830> l2<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:17.759> in

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
here you're gonna hit a l2 to go in

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.609 
here you're gonna hit a l2 to go in
Reverse<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.540> if<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.750> hold<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.140> triangle

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
Reverse but if you hold the triangle

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.109 
Reverse but if you hold the triangle
button<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.189> change<00:01:20.430> your<00:01:20.549> view<00:01:20.759> to

the triangle button from the duration of
this<00:01:25.049> entire<00:01:25.439> race<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.100> then<00:01:26.729> hit<00:01:26.939> l2<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:28.229> go

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
this entire race and then hit l2 to go

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.640 
this entire race and then hit l2 to go
in<00:01:29.130> Reverse<00:01:29.520> r2<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.390> obviously<00:01:31.140> your

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
in Reverse r2 is obviously your

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.609 
in Reverse r2 is obviously your
accelerate<00:01:32.130> forward<00:01:32.420> l2<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.409> put

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
accelerate forward l2 is going to put

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.560 
accelerate forward l2 is going to put
you<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:35.009> reverse<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:36.210> hold<00:01:36.450> that

triangle button and just be careful you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.810 
triangle button and just be careful you
can't<00:01:40.110> hit<00:01:40.530> anything<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.250> can't<00:01:41.490> hit<00:01:41.640> any

will<00:01:53.340> actually<00:01:53.670> slow<00:01:53.939> down<00:01:53.970> pretty<00:01:54.600> quickly

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
will actually slow down pretty quickly

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.080 
will actually slow down pretty quickly
allowing<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.340> kind<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.579> navigate

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
allowing you to just kind of navigate

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.679 
allowing you to just kind of navigate
this<00:01:57.360> as<00:01:58.259> slow<00:01:58.979> as<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.280> need<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.759> go<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.180> kind<00:02:00.630> of

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
this as slow as you need to go I kind of

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.660 
this as slow as you need to go I kind of
do<00:02:00.899> most<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.439> at<00:02:01.829> full<00:02:02.130> speed<00:02:02.460> just

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
do most of this at full speed just

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.450 
do most of this at full speed just
because<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.840> don't<00:02:04.020> go<00:02:04.170> any<00:02:04.439> faster<00:02:04.799> than<00:02:04.979> 33

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
because you don't go any faster than 33

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.010 
because you don't go any faster than 33
miles<00:02:05.670> per<00:02:05.909> hour

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
miles per hour

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.050 
miles per hour
now<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.650> reason<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.039> chose<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.520> cart<00:02:08.849> is

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
now the reason I chose the cart is

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.339 
now the reason I chose the cart is
because<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:09.840> got<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.989> very<00:02:10.229> small

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
because it's got a very small

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.530 
because it's got a very small
form-factor<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.489> you're<00:02:11.640> less<00:02:11.790> likely<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.270> hit

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
form-factor so you're less likely to hit

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.229 
form-factor so you're less likely to hit
anything<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:14.220> also<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:14.790> easier<00:02:15.180> to

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
anything and it also is easier to

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.970 
anything and it also is easier to
maneuver<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.900> found<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.770> be<00:02:16.800> a

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
maneuver so I found this just to be a

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.940 
maneuver so I found this just to be a
the<00:02:17.370> best<00:02:17.610> combination<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:19.050> navigate<00:02:19.709> this

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
the best combination to navigate this

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.690 
the best combination to navigate this
course<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.580> didn't<00:02:21.390> hit<00:02:21.540> any<00:02:21.750> brakes<00:02:22.519> if<00:02:23.519> you

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
course I didn't hit any brakes if you

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.790 
course I didn't hit any brakes if you
have<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.120> slow<00:02:24.540> down<00:02:24.569> just<00:02:25.019> letting<00:02:25.319> go<00:02:25.500> the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
have to slow down just letting go the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.000 
have to slow down just letting go the
reverse<00:02:25.920> button<00:02:26.400> usually<00:02:26.849> does<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.300> trick

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.160 

so<00:02:33.550> that's<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.879> guys<00:02:33.909> just<00:02:34.450> drive<00:02:34.690> around<00:02:34.840> this

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
so that's it guys just drive around this

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.530 
so that's it guys just drive around this
an<00:02:35.560> entire<00:02:35.860> lap<00:02:36.159> on<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.459> azure<00:02:36.819> circuit<00:02:37.390> in

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
an entire lap on the azure circuit in

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.559 
an entire lap on the azure circuit in
Reverse<00:02:37.989> and<00:02:38.500> cockpit<00:02:38.799> view<00:02:39.569> without

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
Reverse and cockpit view without

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.960 
Reverse and cockpit view without
colliding<00:02:40.989> into<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.620> single<00:02:42.069> thing<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.519> you

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
colliding into a single thing and you

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.050 
colliding into a single thing and you
will<00:02:43.090> earn<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.720> reversing<00:02:44.440> or<00:02:44.830> set<00:02:45.069> trophy<00:02:45.519> so

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
will earn the reversing or set trophy so

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.250 
will earn the reversing or set trophy so
