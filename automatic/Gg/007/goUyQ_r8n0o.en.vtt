00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.750
 our elegance program lost here 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.150
 we are with our expert josé lópez 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.169
 very good jose 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.300
 tell us what you're bringing us today what are we going 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.309
 to talk then let's talk about the 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.800
 masculine attire that is the costume that 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.780
 accompanies us from the beginning of the 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.089
 20 years and that reaches three days 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.199
 really with a few modifications yes 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.640
 that it is true that several types and 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.140
 then down to at least 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.329
 must explain well let's meet 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.769
 what types of suits do we have not talking about 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.870
 of gentlemen how to find out is always 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.850
 something good let's start which one 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.739
 we start if we are going to see the first thing that 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.840
 we have to explain is that really the 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.190
 suit in these last 100 years the 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.930
 society has not suffered many 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.940
 modifications really the 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.009
 modifications that have been has been 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.730
 especially in tissue issues before 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.740
 they were heavier 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.270
 It is also true that in almost nobody 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.050
 heating in his house the offices were 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.880
 much colder 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.520
 Then the costumes were much more 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.720
 sheltered today what has happened is 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.630
 that those tissues have been made 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.060
 lighter lighter which is where 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.190
 we really found that development of 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.870
 what is the suit 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.730
 really in the market the first thing that 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.810
 I think we should do maybe it's 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.580
 define what is the clear suit that looks 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.440
 but but many times it is not that 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.410
 It is exactly the suit pine is a 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.450
 garment where his two pieces or 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.310
 three pieces are always cut with the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.930
 same tissue this seems very obvious 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.700
 As we have said before, it is not so much 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.130
 because really before the gentleman what 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.310
 that he used was to dress the cha 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.930
 it was the tailcoat or the frock coat and they were never 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.820
 same color everything has changed 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.100
 changed to the mud colors the chalet 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.630
 for example it was a color what was 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.770
 they sang from another however now 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.330
 when we talk about suit everyone 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.520
 knows perfectly that it is a garment 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.440
 where everyone wears emo we have 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.960
 talked about three pieces that three pieces 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.729
 they are the fundamentals in a suit but 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.619
 if you are asking me now is 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.480
 because you know that today really 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.240
 here they start a suit think of two 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.580
 pieces that was clear of American and 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.440
 the trousers 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.210
 but before there was also the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.170
 vest that the vest is a garment that 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.110
 has disappeared over time 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.850
 precisely because it would be for shelter and 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.580
 nowadays all the sites are more 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.570
 warm and it is no longer required that is what 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.760
 What also happens with the issue of 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.810
 grammages on the theme of costumes today in 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.640
 day we can find the market 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.590
 different types really 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.110
 structurally they have not varied we can 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.800
 find I think we can even 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.000
 distinguish according to the type as it closes 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.800
 closing according to the closing of the American 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.290
 because really structurally nobody 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.420
 so much variation we're going to see that it 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.850
 snipped, taking advantage of the fact that we are here and 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.860
 We have several pieces of clothing that we have 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.430
 here we have a suit for example two 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.959
 buttons that closes what is online what 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.270
 we can find with a single button with 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.920
 two buttons and with three buttons that would be 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.030
 a series of costume class that we can 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.320
 find today in the market 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.760
 when we carry for the time of 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.160
 interrupt jose when we take the 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.620
 three buttons we closed the three not that 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.640
 it's also something that people do not know 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.200
 normally the jackets that carry a 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.360
 only button is fastened we go to the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.310
 buttons the jackets that carry two 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.989
 buttons only know salt from above 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.450
 and when it has three buttons you know not 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.770
 only the middle one is very 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.720
 three button jacket that wear what 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.250
 they call the false button 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.070
 to give a little look that they carry 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.440
 three buttons the other series of suits that 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.970
 we can find that they are obviously 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.160
 much more elegant but nowadays 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.390
 they are in disuse except with some 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.620
 very special garment such as the 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.360
 blazer that crossed suit and where also 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.920
 if you notice we can find them with two 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.630
 buttons four buttons including six 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.120
 buttons but always only 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.129
 fasten 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:04:00.450
 in this case always above 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:04:00.450
 leave only for convenience only 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.180
 it's like they told you structurally 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.360
 the suits the variation that has suffered 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.310
 in the last 80 or 90 years it is 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.140
 Pretty little is a theme of fabrics 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.120
 because everyone is still keeping 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.770
 for example the pockets that can 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.680
 vary to pocket in this case inclined 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.970
 or it can be a straight pocket some of 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.739
 they carry what we call a match 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.570
 in the hand action appear what they are 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:30.440
 the buttonholes with improvements of 34 buttons and 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.600
 the main trousers is what 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.820
 we can really find as a change 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.200
 special is that many of them carry 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.570
 what they call back this in this case 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.260
 I would not take it, see the banks go 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.030
 no turn in the turn is supposed to be 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.400
 supposes that it was done more than anything 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.900
 to avoid staining for 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.730
 power to make it a little bit more 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.180
 comfortable also as fashion trend of 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:56.690
 agreement if it remains more curiously was the 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.430
 grandfather of eduardo seventh who put it 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.860
 fashionable that we all feel one of the 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:05.180
 great icons of the style of the 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.380
 male is then in the relationship 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.720
 dedicated that we see the costumes 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.280
 basically we do a review of the costumes 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.010
 that having them in the I would differentiate 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.840
 according to how the American closes even 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.120
 which closes for example was only one 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.919
 line that we can find from one of 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.110
 two or three buttons that are the ones 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.520
 let's say they are accepted within the 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.219
 protocol one or two or three buttons 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.900
 close online 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:28.490
 a class out there that higher and then 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.080
 we have those who are crossed while 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.940
 that crossed that always looks 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.620
 much more formal 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.990
 and well we can find them with 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.990
 different types of crossed buttons and 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.430
 the rest of the things the truth that they have 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.660
 there were great variations yes that is 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.330
 true that we can find maybe that 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.370
 have the flaps a little wider 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.050
 a little narrower 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.910
 we can also find in some 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.199
 given time as I told you that I have 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.600
 by present sites for example large 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.830
 inclined and straight but locally the 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.380
 structure of the suit has been maintained 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.380
 during this time basically one of 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.389
 the clothes that I believe that today 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.710
 someone who has some event 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.260
 something always has to have its 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.419
 wardrobe to the minimum that is a pallet suit 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.370
 of at least dark color 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.740
 can not miss good because we are going to leave 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.030
 there the thing we already know the types of 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.169
 suits that we have the kind of suits 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.240
 that we can find in the market and 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.710
 can give me a preview of what's next 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.940
 let's see if I think that as we 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.979
 we are talking about the theme of costumes 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.930
 people will want to know exactly when 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:29.669
 wear a suit if you wear it well or 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.260
 how you should wear it true 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.660
 that 's what I put by the majority 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.300
 good idea so review that fit as 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.460
 It must impeccable with a suit and in addition 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.650
 It will be quite fun because as 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.560
 we will explain that series of errors and 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.570
 theatrical horrors' and mistakes that 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.370
 we commit and without knowing or realizing it 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.720
 not because we do not here then and 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.580
 you know about to be the next program 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.750
 we talk about mistakes and horrors 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.750
 in the costumes more and more 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.320
 do not
