now<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.219> said<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.879> sample

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
now like I said this is just a sample

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.299 
now like I said this is just a sample
diet<00:01:03.559> obviously<00:01:04.559> none<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.979> are<00:01:05.100> going<00:01:05.220> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
have this same exact guy okay so if you

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.090 
have this same exact guy okay so if you
look<00:01:08.430> here<00:01:08.670> 25<00:01:09.570> grams<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.049> protein<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.830> four

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
look here 25 grams of protein is in four

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.609 
look here 25 grams of protein is in four
ounces<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.210> need<00:01:12.390> 50<00:01:12.840> grams<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.350> protein

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
ounces so we need 50 grams of protein

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.940 
ounces so we need 50 grams of protein
per<00:01:14.450> meal<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.020> all<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.170> had<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.409> do<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.770> weigh

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
per meal so all we had to do is weigh

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.050 
per meal so all we had to do is weigh
out<00:01:17.189> eight<00:01:18.060> ounces<00:01:18.600> four<00:01:19.439> ounces<00:01:19.830> 25<00:01:20.729> grams<00:01:20.970> of

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
out eight ounces four ounces 25 grams of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.030 
out eight ounces four ounces 25 grams of
protein<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.570> more<00:01:21.930> ounces<00:01:22.200> 25<00:01:22.680> grams<00:01:22.950> of

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
protein for more ounces 25 grams of

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.160 
protein for more ounces 25 grams of
protein<00:01:23.189> equals<00:01:23.640> 50<00:01:23.880> grams<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.210> protein<00:01:24.390> so

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
protein equals 50 grams of protein so

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.510 
protein equals 50 grams of protein so
all<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.500> they<00:01:25.650> come<00:01:25.799> over<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:26.100> my<00:01:26.250> scale
