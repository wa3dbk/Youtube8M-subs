00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
police chief and that what kind of

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.639 
police chief and that what kind of
responsibility<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.809> brings<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.500> what

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
responsibility that brings and what

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.920 
responsibility that brings and what
level<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.160> control<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.510> brings<00:01:03.719> was

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
level of control that that brings was

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.899 
level of control that that brings was
also<00:01:04.290> why<00:01:04.500> she<00:01:04.739> probably<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.159> valedictorian

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
also why she probably is valedictorian

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.910 
also why she probably is valedictorian
and<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.810> carving<00:01:07.200> out<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.470> kind<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.740> path

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
and it's carving out that kind of path

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.399 
and it's carving out that kind of path
for<00:01:08.189> her<00:01:08.280> life<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.689> think<00:01:10.020> her<00:01:10.140> attraction

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
for her life and I think her attraction

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.960 
for her life and I think her attraction
to<00:01:10.560> Peter<00:01:10.830> comes<00:01:11.159> through<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> fact<00:01:11.880> that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
to Peter comes through the fact that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.149 
to Peter comes through the fact that
he's<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.390> know<00:01:12.420> second<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.049> his<00:01:13.170> class<00:01:13.229> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
he's you know second in his class and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.219 
he's you know second in his class and
he's<00:01:14.880> really<00:01:15.060> intelligent<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.750> he<00:01:15.869> displays

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
he's really intelligent and he displays

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.200 
he's really intelligent and he displays
some<00:01:16.439> kind<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.799> heroic<00:01:16.950> qualities<00:01:17.369> earlier<00:01:18.000> on

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
some kind of heroic qualities earlier on

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.359 
some kind of heroic qualities earlier on
which<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.720> obviously<00:01:19.380> her<00:01:19.530> father<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> hero

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
which is obviously her father is a hero

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.140 
which is obviously her father is a hero
so<00:01:20.820> she<00:01:20.880> looks<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:23.159> yeah<00:01:23.790> so

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
so she looks for that and and yeah so

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.240 
so she looks for that and and yeah so
she<00:01:24.210> does<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> lot<00:01:25.320> going<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.830> her<00:01:26.100> own
