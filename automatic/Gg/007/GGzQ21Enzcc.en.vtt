into<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.000> ground<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:34.619> reason<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.979> did<00:01:35.159> that

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
into the ground the reason I did that

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.780 
into the ground the reason I did that
once<00:01:35.939> again<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.990> strength<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:38.640> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
once again is for strength and as you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.590 
once again is for strength and as you
can<00:01:38.909> see<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.390> not<00:01:39.659> moving<00:01:39.990> anywhere<00:01:41.600> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
can see it's not moving anywhere the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
I took the garden hose and I just

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.680 
I took the garden hose and I just
watered<00:02:33.950> in<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.310> soil<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.360> would<00:02:35.480> be

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
watered in the soil so that it would be

I<00:02:43.100> did<00:02:43.340> was<00:02:44.209> I<00:02:44.480> bought<00:02:44.750> had<00:02:45.640> but<00:02:47.080> some<00:02:48.080> 2<00:02:48.410> by<00:02:48.680> 8

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
I did was I bought had but some 2 by 8

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:57.009 
I did was I bought had but some 2 by 8
boards<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.920> 2<00:02:52.099> by<00:02:52.250> 8<00:02:52.430> 4<00:02:52.849> 2<00:02:53.840> by<00:02:54.319> 8<00:02:54.849> boards<00:02:56.019> are

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
boards the 2 by 8 4 2 by 8 boards are

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.039 
boards the 2 by 8 4 2 by 8 boards are
going<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.500> be<00:02:57.590> what<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.580> PVC<00:02:59.120> pipe<00:02:59.420> is<00:02:59.750> going

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
going to be what the PVC pipe is going

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.320 
going to be what the PVC pipe is going
to<00:03:00.410> be<00:03:00.730> secure<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.790> for<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:02.569> greenhouse<00:03:04.330> the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
to be secure to for this greenhouse the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.170 
to be secure to for this greenhouse the
first<00:03:05.569> thing<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:05.840> did<00:03:06.140> was<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.250> went<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.609> the<00:03:07.820> back

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
first thing I did was I went to the back

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.800 
first thing I did was I went to the back
which<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.950> lowest<00:03:10.310> point<00:03:10.549> in<00:03:10.910> the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
which is the lowest point in the

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.069 
which is the lowest point in the
greenhouse<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.820> made<00:03:14.420> sure<00:03:14.630> that<00:03:14.900> this

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
greenhouse and I made sure that this

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.220 
greenhouse and I made sure that this
board<00:03:15.410> was<00:03:15.620> level<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:17.239> reason<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.630> start<00:03:17.989> with

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
board was level the reason I start with

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.979 
board was level the reason I start with
the<00:03:18.319> lowest<00:03:18.530> spot<00:03:19.010> is<00:03:19.280> because<00:03:19.910> you<00:03:20.299> want<00:03:20.510> this

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
the lowest spot is because you want this

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.680 
the lowest spot is because you want this
to<00:03:21.560> be<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:22.069> level<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:23.030> all<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.510> other

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
to be the level that all the other

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.229 
to be the level that all the other
boards<00:03:24.170> are<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:24.709> in<00:03:25.340> order<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:25.819> get<00:03:25.940> all<00:03:26.120> the

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
boards are and in order to get all the

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.970 
boards are and in order to get all the
other<00:03:26.420> boards<00:03:26.930> level<00:03:27.410> with<00:03:27.530> each<00:03:27.650> other

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
other boards level with each other

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.940 
other boards level with each other
you're<00:03:28.400> going<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.850> have<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.150> remove<00:03:29.450> some<00:03:29.950> soil

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
you're going to have to remove some soil

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.699 
you're going to have to remove some soil
and<00:03:31.250> which<00:03:31.819> I<00:03:31.940> did<00:03:32.120> along<00:03:32.420> these<00:03:32.870> boards<00:03:33.590> right

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
and which I did along these boards right

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.240 
and which I did along these boards right
here<00:03:34.069> and<00:03:34.720> of<00:03:35.720> course<00:03:35.780> this<00:03:36.410> one<00:03:36.650> which<00:03:36.859> is<00:03:36.889> at

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
here and of course this one which is at

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.270 
here and of course this one which is at
the<00:03:37.370> highest<00:03:37.579> point<00:03:38.200> I<00:03:39.200> just<00:03:39.319> dug<00:03:39.709> down<00:03:39.950> a

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
the highest point I just dug down a

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.020 
the highest point I just dug down a
couple<00:03:40.670> of<00:03:41.049> less<00:03:42.049> than<00:03:42.079> half<00:03:42.350> an<00:03:42.709> inch<00:03:42.889> just<00:03:43.790> to

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
couple of less than half an inch just to

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.509 
couple of less than half an inch just to
get<00:03:44.209> this<00:03:44.630> board<00:03:45.049> level<00:03:45.680> with<00:03:45.889> the<00:03:46.069> backboard

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
get this board level with the backboard

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.470 
get this board level with the backboard
and<00:03:46.819> even<00:03:47.690> less<00:03:47.959> for<00:03:48.500> these<00:03:48.709> side<00:03:49.010> boards<00:03:49.549> to

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
and even less for these side boards to

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.759 
and even less for these side boards to
be<00:03:50.690> leveled<00:03:51.079> with<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.530> back<00:03:51.709> board<00:03:51.980> um<00:03:53.769> the

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
be leveled with the back board um the

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.830 
be leveled with the back board um the
next<00:03:54.920> thing<00:03:55.280> you<00:03:55.850> do<00:03:56.030> is<00:03:56.239> you<00:03:56.510> want<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.720> make

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
screws I use for two-inch long screws

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.340 
screws I use for two-inch long screws
they're<00:04:04.100> going<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.310> give<00:04:04.459> you<00:04:04.609> a<00:04:04.880> real<00:04:05.350> strong

sure everything is level

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.050 
sure everything is level
the<00:04:13.230> things<00:04:13.500> aren't<00:04:13.770> leveled<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.610> your

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
the things aren't leveled that your

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.390 
the things aren't leveled that your
greenhouse<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:16.290> not<00:04:16.470> going<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.680> work<00:04:16.859> out<00:04:17.040> and

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
greenhouse is not going to work out and

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.949 
greenhouse is not going to work out and
you're<00:04:18.090> gonna<00:04:18.209> have<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.420> start<00:04:18.780> all<00:04:18.930> over

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
you're gonna have to start all over

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.050 
you're gonna have to start all over
again<00:04:19.320> which<00:04:20.220> nobody<00:04:20.489> really<00:04:20.940> wants<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.269> do

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
again which nobody really wants to do

a<00:04:34.110> PVC<00:04:34.590> pipe<00:04:34.830> frame<00:04:35.790> and<00:04:36.180> then<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:38.220> secure<00:04:39.210> them

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
a PVC pipe frame and then to secure them

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.230
