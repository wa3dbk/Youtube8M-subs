00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.360 

all<00:00:00.810> right<00:00:00.930> right<00:00:01.110> here<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.469> solar<00:00:01.920> engine

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
all right right here is a solar engine

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.670 
all right right here is a solar engine
I've<00:00:02.490> been<00:00:02.700> working<00:00:03.060> with<00:00:03.090> and<00:00:03.600> we're<00:00:04.350> just

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
I've been working with and we're just

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.010 
I've been working with and we're just
about<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:04.950> trigger<00:00:05.460> you<00:00:06.420> can<00:00:06.600> see<00:00:06.899> it

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
about to trigger you can see it

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
about to trigger you can see it
twitching<00:00:07.470> if<00:00:08.240> you<00:00:09.240> count<00:00:09.570> that<00:00:10.040> let's

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
twitching if you count that let's

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.310 
twitching if you count that let's
believe<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.910> triggers<00:00:12.599> around<00:00:12.809> three<00:00:13.019> volts

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
believe it triggers around three volts

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.700 
believe it triggers around three volts
I'm<00:00:13.410> gonna<00:00:13.530> check<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.860> voltage<00:00:14.009> real<00:00:14.400> quick

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
I'm gonna check the voltage real quick

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:25.370 
I'm gonna check the voltage real quick
alright<00:00:17.539> 3.03<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:19.140> rising<00:00:23.119> and<00:00:24.230> maybe<00:00:25.230> a

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
alright 3.03 and rising and maybe a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.140 
alright 3.03 and rising and maybe a
couple<00:00:25.560> more<00:00:25.740> seconds<00:00:26.160> it'll<00:00:26.340> turn<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:26.609> here

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
couple more seconds it'll turn on here

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.819 
couple more seconds it'll turn on here
there<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:28.320> go<00:00:30.560> see<00:00:33.140> it<00:00:34.140> monitor<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> voltage

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
there we go see it monitor the voltage

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.500 
there we go see it monitor the voltage
here<00:00:35.489> as<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:36.050> discharges<00:00:38.870> we're<00:00:39.870> at<00:00:40.940> 2.2<00:00:41.940> going

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
here as it discharges we're at 2.2 going

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.330 
here as it discharges we're at 2.2 going
down<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.260> down<00:00:45.379> what<00:00:46.379> I've<00:00:46.500> seen<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.980> far<00:00:47.010> it

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
down and down what I've seen so far it

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:57.130 
down and down what I've seen so far it
drains<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.059> about<00:00:48.239> 1.2<00:00:49.219> volts

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.560 

so<00:00:58.140> right<00:00:59.130> here<00:00:59.400> like<00:00:59.790> I<00:00:59.880> said<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.240> a<00:01:00.330> solar

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
so right here like I said it's a solar

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.780 
so right here like I said it's a solar
engine<00:01:00.990> and<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.650> particular<00:01:02.220> type<00:01:02.490> is<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
engine and the particular type is a

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.270 
engine and the particular type is a
flashing<00:01:03.720> LED<00:01:04.260> solar<00:01:05.250> engine<00:01:05.840> we<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
flashing LED solar engine we have the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.990 
flashing LED solar engine we have the
flashing<00:01:08.280> LED<00:01:08.580> right<00:01:08.880> there<00:01:10.430> two<00:01:11.430> capacitors

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
flashing LED right there two capacitors

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.690 
flashing LED right there two capacitors
with<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> solar<00:01:13.770> panel<00:01:14.400> charges

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
with the that the solar panel charges

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.100 
with the that the solar panel charges
these<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.300> to<00:01:15.510> its<00:01:15.690> some<00:01:15.930> voltage<00:01:18.080> which<00:01:19.080> is

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
these up to its some voltage which is

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.470 
these up to its some voltage which is
determined<00:01:19.740> by<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:19.950> resistor<00:01:20.700> right<00:01:21.120> here

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
determined by this resistor right here

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.210 
determined by this resistor right here
and<00:01:22.550> these<00:01:23.550> are<00:01:23.670> these<00:01:24.270> capacitors<00:01:24.840> are<00:01:25.220> 2.7

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
and these are these capacitors are 2.7

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.270 
and these are these capacitors are 2.7
10<00:01:27.060> farad<00:01:27.540> capacitors<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.740> they're<00:01:29.100> just

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
10 farad capacitors and they're just

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.270 
10 farad capacitors and they're just
wired<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.700> series<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:31.680> panel<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> six<00:01:33.000> volt

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
wired in series the panel is a six volt

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.680 
wired in series the panel is a six volt
30<00:01:35.280> milliamp<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.150> think<00:01:36.410> panel<00:01:38.690> two

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
30 milliamp I think panel two

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.200 
30 milliamp I think panel two
transistors<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.700> like<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.790> said<00:01:41.970> there's<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
transistors and like I said there's a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.780 
transistors and like I said there's a
resistor<00:01:42.690> and<00:01:42.960> then<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.130> your<00:01:44.280> motor

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
resistor and then you have your motor

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.130 
resistor and then you have your motor
and<00:01:46.850> basically<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.000> circuit<00:01:48.390> works<00:01:48.570> as<00:01:48.780> this

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and basically the circuit works as this

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.820 
and basically the circuit works as this
panel<00:01:49.530> charges<00:01:49.950> these<00:01:50.420> capacitors<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.840> once

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
panel charges these capacitors and once

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.650 
panel charges these capacitors and once
these<00:01:52.950> capacitors<00:01:53.430> reach<00:01:53.729> around<00:01:54.420> three

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
these capacitors reach around three

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.440 
these capacitors reach around three
volts<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.080> my<00:01:55.200> particular<00:01:55.380> case<00:01:56.180> you<00:01:57.180> got

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
volts in my particular case you got

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.859 
volts in my particular case you got
enough<00:01:58.410> voltage<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.190> led<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.600> blink

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
enough voltage for the led to to blink

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.710 
enough voltage for the led to to blink
or<00:02:01.080> flash<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.710> then<00:02:01.979> will<00:02:02.429> allow<00:02:02.850> current<00:02:03.509> to

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
or flash and then will allow current to

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.990 
or flash and then will allow current to
travel<00:02:04.170> through<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.560> transistors<00:02:05.220> which

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
travel through the transistors which

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.320 
travel through the transistors which
will<00:02:06.179> then<00:02:06.330> in<00:02:06.479> turn<00:02:06.509> switch<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.350> motor

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
will then in turn switch on the motor

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.930 
will then in turn switch on the motor
so<00:02:09.330> I'll<00:02:09.600> post<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.929> schematic<00:02:10.520> very<00:02:11.520> fun<00:02:11.790> to

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
so I'll post a schematic very fun to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.860 
so I'll post a schematic very fun to
work<00:02:12.060> with

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
work with

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.380 
work with
I<00:02:12.900> plan<00:02:13.530> on<00:02:13.560> maybe<00:02:14.100> building<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.700> be<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.240> beam<00:02:15.540> bot

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
I plan on maybe building a be a beam bot

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.730 
I plan on maybe building a be a beam bot
which<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.540> usually<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.050> application<00:02:19.560> for

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
which is usually the application for

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.940 
which is usually the application for
these<00:02:19.860> solar<00:02:20.069> engines<00:02:21.530> recharge<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.740> again

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
these solar engines recharge and again

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.559 
these solar engines recharge and again
it's<00:02:23.130> around<00:02:23.490> almost<00:02:23.700> two<00:02:24.060> volts<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:26.569> very

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
it's around almost two volts so very

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.970 
it's around almost two volts so very
interesting<00:02:28.970> yep
