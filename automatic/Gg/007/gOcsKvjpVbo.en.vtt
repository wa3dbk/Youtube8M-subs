now Curtis here from ask the pool guy
answering<00:00:28.750> a<00:00:28.840> question<00:00:28.990> that<00:00:29.439> we<00:00:29.529> received<00:00:30.010> on

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
answering a question that we received on

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.140 
answering a question that we received on
her<00:00:30.610> blog

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150

well<00:00:31.360> the<00:00:31.450> question<00:00:31.810> is<00:00:31.960> how<00:00:32.259> do<00:00:32.320> I<00:00:32.470> know<00:00:32.590> when

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
well the question is how do I know when

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.380 
well the question is how do I know when
it's<00:00:33.130> time<00:00:33.400> to<00:00:33.580> change<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:34.000> sound<00:00:34.210> of<00:00:34.300> the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
it's time to change the sound of the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.979 
it's time to change the sound of the
filter<00:00:35.400> easiest<00:00:36.400> way<00:00:36.580> to<00:00:36.820> find<00:00:37.330> out<00:00:37.570> that<00:00:37.750> out

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
filter easiest way to find out that out

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.130 
filter easiest way to find out that out
is<00:00:38.260> if<00:00:39.010> you're<00:00:39.970> having<00:00:40.269> issues<00:00:40.420> with<00:00:40.660> the

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
is if you're having issues with the

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.750 
is if you're having issues with the
water<00:00:41.320> not<00:00:41.559> staying<00:00:41.830> clear<00:00:42.010> water<00:00:42.250> clarity<00:00:42.670> is

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
water not staying clear water clarity is

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.210 
water not staying clear water clarity is
everything<00:00:43.150> what<00:00:43.809> happens<00:00:44.230> is<00:00:44.379> as<00:00:44.559> the<00:00:44.890> sand

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
everything what happens is as the sand

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.160 
everything what happens is as the sand
which<00:00:45.489> the<00:00:45.970> water<00:00:46.150> travels<00:00:46.449> down<00:00:46.690> to<00:00:46.720> the<00:00:46.960> sand

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
which the water travels down to the sand

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.930 
which the water travels down to the sand
as<00:00:47.320> the<00:00:47.350> debris<00:00:47.710> gets<00:00:47.920> trapped<00:00:48.190> in<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.489> sand

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
as the debris gets trapped in the sand

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.030 
as the debris gets trapped in the sand
it<00:00:49.390> gets<00:00:49.600> trapped<00:00:49.809> in<00:00:50.019> layers<00:00:50.230> and<00:00:50.500> each<00:00:50.830> time

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
it gets trapped in layers and each time

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.680 
it gets trapped in layers and each time
you<00:00:51.070> backwash<00:00:51.580> out<00:00:51.850> you're<00:00:52.150> getting<00:00:52.420> a<00:00:52.480> lot<00:00:52.600> of

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
you backwash out you're getting a lot of

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.060 
you backwash out you're getting a lot of
the<00:00:52.780> surface<00:00:52.960> debris<00:00:53.440> out<00:00:53.589> but<00:00:53.920> not

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
the surface debris out but not

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.680 
the surface debris out but not
necessarily<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.790> layers<00:00:55.180> of<00:00:55.390> debris<00:00:55.540> that

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
necessarily the layers of debris that

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.750 
necessarily the layers of debris that
are<00:00:55.900> further<00:00:56.110> down<00:00:56.320> so<00:00:56.980> what<00:00:57.100> happens<00:00:57.489> is<00:00:57.640> the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
are further down so what happens is the

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.850 
are further down so what happens is the
filter<00:00:58.090> plugs<00:00:58.360> up<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.809> as<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.440> water<00:00:59.620> comes

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
filter plugs up and as the water comes

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.889 
filter plugs up and as the water comes
into<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.100> filter<00:01:00.399> it<00:01:00.579> tends<00:01:00.850> to<00:01:01.120> go<00:01:01.540> around

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
into the filter it tends to go around

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.660 
into the filter it tends to go around
the<00:01:02.050> edges<00:01:02.410> that's<00:01:02.500> called<00:01:02.770> channeling<00:01:03.219> where

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
the edges that's called channeling where

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.859 
the edges that's called channeling where
it'll<00:01:04.000> lead<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.149> the<00:01:04.300> create<00:01:04.539> channels

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
it'll lead to the create channels

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.389 
it'll lead to the create channels
through<00:01:05.020> the<00:01:05.110> sand<00:01:05.350> or<00:01:05.560> it'll<00:01:05.800> go<00:01:05.920> down<00:01:06.100> to<00:01:06.310> the

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
through the sand or it'll go down to the

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.400 
through the sand or it'll go down to the
edge<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:06.910> back<00:01:07.270> out<00:01:07.479> and<00:01:07.720> never<00:01:07.990> get<00:01:08.170> filtered

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
edge and back out and never get filtered

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.650 
edge and back out and never get filtered
so<00:01:09.160> first<00:01:09.430> off<00:01:09.640> would<00:01:09.789> be<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:10.149> your<00:01:10.509> water

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
so first off would be is your water

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.109 
so first off would be is your water
Claire<00:01:11.020> Claire<00:01:11.680> tea<00:01:11.830> not<00:01:12.220> good<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.700> you<00:01:12.880> can't

clarifiers<00:01:16.119> doesn't<00:01:16.539> seem<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:16.869> help<00:01:17.020> that

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
clarifiers doesn't seem to help that

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.260 
clarifiers doesn't seem to help that
type<00:01:18.070> of<00:01:18.220> things<00:01:18.369> happening<00:01:18.789> and<00:01:19.090> for

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
thing that you could do if that's not an

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.279 
thing that you could do if that's not an
issue<00:01:24.700> but<00:01:24.940> you're<00:01:25.090> still<00:01:25.330> concerned<00:01:25.810> would

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
issue but you're still concerned would

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.070 
issue but you're still concerned would
be<00:01:27.060> disassemble<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.090> filter<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:28.630> take<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:28.810> look

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
be disassemble a filter and take a look

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.779 
be disassemble a filter and take a look
at<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.289> sand<00:01:29.500> for<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.649> better<00:01:29.860> sand<00:01:30.160> and<00:01:30.369> if

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
at the sand for the better sand and if

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.580 
at the sand for the better sand and if
it<00:01:31.030> looks<00:01:31.240> like<00:01:31.390> it's<00:01:31.630> solid<00:01:31.810> across<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.380> top

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
it looks like it's solid across the top

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.710 
it looks like it's solid across the top
and<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:32.920> edges<00:01:33.340> are<00:01:33.459> rounded<00:01:33.670> down<00:01:34.090> when<00:01:34.630> you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
and the edges are rounded down when you

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.540 
and the edges are rounded down when you
look<00:01:34.929> into<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.410> tank<00:01:35.649> on<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:35.950> edges<00:01:36.399> you'll

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
look into the tank on the edges you'll

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.669 
look into the tank on the edges you'll
see<00:01:36.759> it<00:01:36.849> rounded<00:01:37.209> down<00:01:37.330> that'll<00:01:38.200> tell<00:01:38.500> you

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
see it rounded down that'll tell you

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.290 
see it rounded down that'll tell you
that<00:01:38.950> it's<00:01:39.190> certainly<00:01:39.520> time<00:01:39.819> to<00:01:39.970> change<00:01:40.149> the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
that it's certainly time to change the

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.150 
that it's certainly time to change the
sand<00:01:40.539> because<00:01:40.990> you've<00:01:41.200> got<00:01:41.380> this<00:01:41.709> channeling

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
sand because you've got this channeling

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.300 
sand because you've got this channeling
issue<00:01:42.340> and<00:01:42.670> channeling<00:01:43.599> is<00:01:44.190> literally<00:01:45.190> the

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
issue and channeling is literally the

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.980 
issue and channeling is literally the
water<00:01:45.490> is<00:01:45.640> traveling<00:01:45.849> through<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.420> filter

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
water is traveling through the filter

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.180 
water is traveling through the filter
without<00:01:47.259> going<00:01:47.500> through<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.740> sand<00:01:47.979> and<00:01:48.160> just

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
without going through the sand and just

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.580 
without going through the sand and just
returning<00:01:49.000> back<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.300> the<00:01:49.360> pool<00:01:49.590> another

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
returning back to the pool another

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.620 
returning back to the pool another
possibility<00:01:51.069> would<00:01:51.459> be<00:01:51.520> if<00:01:51.910> you're<00:01:52.330> vacuuming

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
possibility would be if you're vacuuming

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.540 
possibility would be if you're vacuuming
and<00:01:53.080> you're<00:01:53.319> getting<00:01:53.470> debris<00:01:53.920> shooting<00:01:54.340> back

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
and you're getting debris shooting back

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.630 
and you're getting debris shooting back
up<00:01:55.500> back<00:01:56.500> into<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:56.950> pool<00:01:57.130> you're<00:01:57.310> getting<00:01:57.580> a

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
up back into the pool you're getting a

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.370 
up back into the pool you're getting a

something's<00:01:59.770> wrong<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.160> filter<00:02:00.459> and<00:02:00.610> the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
something's wrong the filter and the

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.190 
something's wrong the filter and the
water<00:02:00.910> is<00:02:01.030> not<00:02:01.090> traveling<00:02:01.569> through<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.929> sand

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
water is not traveling through the sand

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.889 
water is not traveling through the sand
so<00:02:02.709> any<00:02:02.890> one<00:02:03.039> of<00:02:03.099> those<00:02:03.220> three<00:02:03.399> scenarios

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
so any one of those three scenarios

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.570 
so any one of those three scenarios
almost<00:02:04.899> guaranteed<00:02:05.349> the<00:02:05.800> sand<00:02:06.039> changes<00:02:06.459> in

almost guaranteed the sand changes in

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.430 
almost guaranteed the sand changes in

you could certainly scoop the surface of

the sand off and replace that but if

you're into the filter you're better off
it's<00:02:14.200> far<00:02:14.440> more<00:02:14.470> efficient<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.760> just<00:02:15.940> replace

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.010 
questions we get this one all the time
