00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
filming today I of course couldn't have

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.679 
filming today I of course couldn't have
been<00:00:28.130> that<00:00:28.160> close<00:00:28.609> to<00:00:28.789> the<00:00:28.880> mirror<00:00:29.060> cuz<00:00:29.329> the

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
been that close to the mirror cuz the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:30.790 
been that close to the mirror cuz the
camera<00:00:29.990> wouldn't<00:00:30.169> have<00:00:30.259> been<00:00:30.380> able<00:00:30.470> to<00:00:30.589> get<00:00:30.769> a

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
camera wouldn't have been able to get a

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.470 
camera wouldn't have been able to get a
shot<00:00:30.859> so<00:00:31.550> I<00:00:31.579> did<00:00:31.759> have<00:00:31.880> to<00:00:31.939> get<00:00:32.150> a<00:00:32.180> do<00:00:32.329> it<00:00:32.449> a

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
shot so I did have to get a do it a

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.810 
shot so I did have to get a do it a
little<00:00:32.599> bit<00:00:32.780> further<00:00:33.050> away<00:00:33.289> so<00:00:34.160> it<00:00:34.550> probably

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
little bit further away so it probably

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.660 
little bit further away so it probably
doesn't<00:00:35.239> look<00:00:35.480> perfect<00:00:35.719> but<00:00:36.469> just<00:00:37.070> excuse<00:00:37.520> it

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
doesn't look perfect but just excuse it

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.310

then I like to just go ahead and start
drawing<00:02:03.290> a<00:02:03.680> line<00:02:04.100> from<00:02:04.550> where<00:02:04.790> my<00:02:05.000> inner

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
drawing a line from where my inner

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.109

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
and then once you have that line you can

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.960 
and then once you have that line you can
actually<00:02:21.660> start<00:02:22.230> doing<00:02:22.290> your<00:02:22.740> wing<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:23.610> if<00:02:23.880> you

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
have long eyelashes like me I like to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.620 
have long eyelashes like me I like to
just<00:02:25.920> move<00:02:26.160> my<00:02:26.370> lashes<00:02:26.640> out<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.150> way<00:02:27.270> so<00:02:27.330> that

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
just move my lashes out the way so that

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.570 
just move my lashes out the way so that
it<00:02:27.720> can<00:02:27.810> actually<00:02:27.840> see<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.710> like<00:02:28.890> my<00:02:29.070> lid<00:02:29.310> and

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
it can actually see you like my lid and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
then I'm going to go ahead and from that

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.910 
then I'm going to go ahead and from that
outer<00:02:32.490> corner<00:02:32.610> just<00:02:33.540> draw<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:34.080> line<00:02:34.440> up<00:02:34.680> where

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
outer corner just draw a line up where

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.320 
outer corner just draw a line up where
it's<00:02:35.100> going<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.460> work<00:02:35.580> my<00:02:35.730> brow<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:38.300> then<00:02:39.300> I

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
it's going to work my brow and then I

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.720 
it's going to work my brow and then I
like<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.720> take<00:02:39.930> another<00:02:40.140> dip<00:02:40.740> in<00:02:41.070> but<00:02:41.490> then<00:02:41.640> I

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
like to take another dip in but then I

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.400 
like to take another dip in but then I
like<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.030> clean<00:02:42.240> it<00:02:42.330> off<00:02:42.480> again<00:02:42.900> then<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.290> go

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
like to clean it off again then I go

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.900 
like to clean it off again then I go
ahead<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.710> start<00:02:43.890> from<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.280> middle<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.730> my

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
ahead and start from the middle of my

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.720

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
ahead and I start to curve outwards so I

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:03.620 
ahead and I start to curve outwards so I
can<00:02:53.520> meet<00:02:53.730> with<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.120> wing<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:02.270> then<00:03:03.270> I<00:03:03.300> go

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
can meet with that wing and then I go

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:11.880 
can meet with that wing and then I go
ahead<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.140> fill<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.740> in

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.550

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
and then what I like to do is finish it

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.330 
and then what I like to do is finish it
off<00:03:15.650> in<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.920> inner<00:03:16.069> corner<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:21.040> then<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.190> can

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.070 

then<00:03:37.300> you're<00:03:37.450> going<00:03:37.599> to<00:03:37.690> be<00:03:37.810> left<00:03:37.989> with

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
then you're going to be left with

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.350 
then you're going to be left with
something<00:03:38.500> like<00:03:38.709> that<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.220> obviously<00:03:39.730> did<00:03:40.180> a

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
something like that I obviously did a

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.660 
something like that I obviously did a
thick<00:03:40.750> wings<00:03:41.170> liner<00:03:41.500> just<00:03:42.129> because<00:03:42.370> sometimes

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
thick wings liner just because sometimes

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.400 
thick wings liner just because sometimes
I<00:03:42.760> really<00:03:42.910> like<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.209> do<00:03:43.300> it<00:03:43.390> thick<00:03:43.660> if<00:03:43.959> you

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
I really like to do it thick if you

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.290 
I really like to do it thick if you
don't<00:03:44.680> want<00:03:44.830> to<00:03:44.920> do<00:03:45.010> your<00:03:45.190> liner<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:45.879> thick

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
don't want to do your liner so thick

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.960 
don't want to do your liner so thick
then<00:03:46.720> you<00:03:46.750> would<00:03:47.200> make<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.620> shorter<00:03:48.069> line<00:03:48.370> that

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
then you would make a shorter line that

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.500 
then you would make a shorter line that
way<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.150> don't<00:03:49.330> have<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.629> do<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:49.780> as<00:03:50.019> thick
