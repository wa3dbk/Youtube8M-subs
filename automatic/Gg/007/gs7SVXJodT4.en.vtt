00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
really nice locking mechanism on here

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.110 
really nice locking mechanism on here
it's<00:05:15.060> got<00:05:15.180> like<00:05:15.270> a<00:05:15.330> tube<00:05:15.630> to<00:05:16.080> button<00:05:17.030> that<00:05:18.030> you

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
it's got like a tube to button that you

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.270 
it's got like a tube to button that you
push<00:05:18.390> and<00:05:18.780> it<00:05:19.200> locks<00:05:19.440> on<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:20.100> and<00:05:20.880> i<00:05:21.840> think<00:05:22.830> i

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
push and it locks on and and i think i

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.640 
push and it locks on and and i think i
think<00:05:24.150> that<00:05:25.020> the<00:05:25.410> outside<00:05:26.130> ring<00:05:26.850> on<00:05:27.060> that<00:05:27.650> that

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
think that the outside ring on that that

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.710 
think that the outside ring on that that
may<00:05:28.860> actually<00:05:29.100> be<00:05:29.400> metal<00:05:29.910> maybe<00:05:30.180> not<00:05:30.450> maybe

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
may actually be metal maybe not maybe

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.300 
may actually be metal maybe not maybe
it's<00:05:30.960> plastic

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
it's plastic

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.550 
it's plastic
but<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.000> fact<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.360> it<00:05:33.540> almost<00:05:33.720> looks<00:05:33.990> metal

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
but the fact that it almost looks metal

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.680 
but the fact that it almost looks metal
and<00:05:34.710> almost<00:05:35.310> feels<00:05:35.580> metal<00:05:36.000> tells<00:05:36.240> you<00:05:36.450> how

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
and almost feels metal tells you how

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.160 
and almost feels metal tells you how
well-made<00:05:37.320> it<00:05:38.070> is<00:05:38.220> how<00:05:38.430> nicely<00:05:38.990> put<00:05:39.990> together

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
well-made it is how nicely put together

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.290 
well-made it is how nicely put together
how<00:05:40.620> Eisley<00:05:40.980> machined<00:05:41.400> it<00:05:41.550> is<00:05:42.350> it's<00:05:43.350> a<00:05:44.300> really

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
how Eisley machined it is it's a really

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.330 
how Eisley machined it is it's a really
it<00:05:45.420> probably<00:05:45.960> one<00:05:46.080> of<00:05:46.110> the<00:05:46.230> nicest<00:05:46.350> lens<00:05:46.920> hoods

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
favorable this is a constant f28 lens so

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.170 
favorable this is a constant f28 lens so
that<00:06:01.410> means<00:06:01.800> that<00:06:02.010> even<00:06:02.430> from<00:06:02.700> 12<00:06:02.970> meter

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
that means that even from 12 meter

millimeters<00:06:05.790> you've<00:06:06.390> got<00:06:06.630> f28<00:06:07.320> constant

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
millimeters you've got f28 constant

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.230 
millimeters you've got f28 constant
aperture<00:06:08.190> which<00:06:08.520> is<00:06:08.670> a<00:06:08.700> huge<00:06:09.060> advantage

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
aperture which is a huge advantage

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.450
