 perfectly identifiable pupils 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.950
 go out on the street to go in 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.750
 another building at their course of 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.530
 science as is frequently the case 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.960
 in London 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.910
 summer and winter the codes are very 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.620
 strict but that's the summer dress 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.000
 various uniform and juppÃ© sticking them

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.750
 winter 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.270
 this is my prefect badge if another 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.580
 pupil behaves badly i can tell him 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.200
 why are you doing this eventually 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.549
 if he continues to give him a 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.549
 warning or call to order 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.020
 if English students plebiscite 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.860
 the uniform those from abroad are 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.079
 less convinced me I do not really like 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.880
 not that I just spain and we did not 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.409
 of uniform there is really 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.689
 uncomfortable I do not like 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.179
 in this very classy school the price of 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.789
 the complete uniform is about 350 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.630
 euros for its director this label 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.520
 English is not negotiable 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.590
 it puts everyone on the same level all 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.569
 the students are alike and it's a 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.789
 good preparation for their adult life 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:01.030
 they understand that their appearance is 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.159
 important and will help them succeed then 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.920
 that a negligent attitude will lead them 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.270
 not far away but in some 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.519
 most popular districts of london 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.650
 like here impossible for parents 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.780
 modest to finance uniforms at this 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.910
 price result of specialty stores 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.340
 of uniforms at broken prices is developing 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.900
 more and more this shop at the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.690
 euros for a set 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.660
 in these conditions these modest parents 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.549
 even see benefits to uniforms 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.109
 is explosive and wellington 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.609
 it's better because if my daughter 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.379
 could choose she would not claim 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.970
 clothes of fashionable brands like 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:41.019
 nike shoes that are a lot 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.579
 more dear the prime minister david 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.620
 cameron recalled that he wanted a 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.389
 firm policy of uniforms in the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.190
 country and that there were 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:50.340
 financial resources for parents in the
