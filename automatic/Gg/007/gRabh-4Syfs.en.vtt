and<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:05.190> go<00:03:06.030> for<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.209> pink<00:03:06.450> on<00:03:06.540> all<00:03:06.690> tech<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.110> kill

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
and I go for the pink on all tech I kill

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.800 
and I go for the pink on all tech I kill
myself<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:08.100> kill<00:03:08.280> him<00:03:08.459> but<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:09.239> was<00:03:09.360> really<00:03:09.540> it

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
myself to kill him but it was really it

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.930 
myself to kill him but it was really it
was<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.020> last<00:03:10.290> ignite<00:03:10.770> text<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:11.370> I'm<00:03:11.610> not<00:03:11.820> sure

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
was the last ignite text so I'm not sure

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.400 
was the last ignite text so I'm not sure
that<00:03:11.970> was<00:03:12.180> worth<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.360> either<00:03:12.510> but<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.050> think

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
that was worth it either but I think

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.410 
that was worth it either but I think

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
it was really given us problems because

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.520 
it was really given us problems because
we<00:04:28.330> were<00:04:28.419> not<00:04:28.449> really<00:04:28.810> able<00:04:28.960> to<00:04:29.110> get<00:04:29.289> placed

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
we were not really able to get placed

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.860 
we were not really able to get placed
onto<00:04:29.680> him<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:29.979> tried<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.250> lot<00:04:30.550> silver<00:04:31.449> was<00:04:31.659> able

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
onto him I tried a lot silver was able

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.540 
onto him I tried a lot silver was able
to<00:04:31.990> get<00:04:32.110> some<00:04:32.349> kind<00:04:32.530> of<00:04:32.560> gangs<00:04:32.710> in<00:04:32.889> so<00:04:33.340> we<00:04:33.460> had

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
to get some kind of gangs in so we had

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.129 
to get some kind of gangs in so we had
like<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:33.819> TV<00:04:34.060> tube<00:04:34.210> potential<00:04:34.599> top<00:04:34.810> but<00:04:34.990> we

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
like the TV tube potential top but we

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.839 
like the TV tube potential top but we
never<00:04:35.259> really<00:04:35.530> focused<00:04:35.860> anyone<00:04:36.099> down<00:04:36.250> so

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
never really focused anyone down so

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.939 
never really focused anyone down so
there<00:04:37.000> was<00:04:37.120> no<00:04:37.240> scaling<00:04:37.539> for<00:04:37.780> an<00:04:37.840> act<00:04:37.990> in<00:04:38.139> which

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
there was no scaling for an act in which

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.439 
there was no scaling for an act in which
we<00:04:39.129> should<00:04:39.219> have<00:04:39.370> had<00:04:39.520> during<00:04:39.699> mid<00:04:39.909> game<00:04:40.060> where

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
we should have had during mid game where

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.360 
we should have had during mid game where
you<00:04:40.569> could<00:04:40.719> have<00:04:40.810> like<00:04:41.020> trash<00:04:41.889> Kazakhs

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
you could have like trash Kazakhs

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.179 
you could have like trash Kazakhs
basically<00:04:42.699> but<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.360> never<00:04:43.479> happened<00:04:43.650> so<00:04:44.650> we

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:45.189 
basically but that never happened so we

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:46.860 
basically but that never happened so we
just<00:04:45.370> wasted<00:04:45.789> our<00:04:45.879> potential<00:04:46.330> early<00:04:46.479> game<00:04:46.659> and

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
just wasted our potential early game and

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.629 
just wasted our potential early game and

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
cloud not the cloud nine that looks to

cloud not the cloud nine that looks to
be<00:05:36.159> actually<00:05:36.279> struggling<00:05:36.729> right<00:05:37.060> now<00:05:37.090> after

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
be actually struggling right now after

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.499 
be actually struggling right now after
seeing<00:05:38.139> especially<00:05:38.379> the<00:05:38.800> last<00:05:39.009> game<00:05:39.430> with<00:05:40.330> the

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
seeing especially the last game with the

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.180 
seeing especially the last game with the
mix<00:05:40.930> ups<00:05:41.110> with<00:05:41.289> shotcalling<00:05:41.650> what<00:05:41.979> are<00:05:42.099> your

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
mix ups with shotcalling what are your

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.550 
mix ups with shotcalling what are your
takes<00:05:42.430> on<00:05:42.639> cloud<00:05:43.360> nine<00:05:43.599> coming<00:05:43.990> back<00:05:44.199> from<00:05:44.409> All

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
takes on cloud nine coming back from All

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.159 
takes on cloud nine coming back from All
Stars<00:05:44.830> I<00:05:45.819> just<00:05:46.240> think<00:05:46.330> they<00:05:46.479> took<00:05:46.659> a<00:05:46.870> break

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
Stars I just think they took a break

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.079 
Stars I just think they took a break
after<00:05:47.379> all<00:05:47.740> stars<00:05:48.009> and<00:05:48.279> so<00:05:48.550> they<00:05:48.669> only<00:05:48.789> had<00:05:49.060> I

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:49.089 
after all stars and so they only had I

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:51.119 
after all stars and so they only had I
think<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:49.479> practice<00:05:49.839> is<00:05:49.960> not<00:05:50.289> that<00:05:50.409> much<00:05:50.469> at

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:51.129 
think the practice is not that much at

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:52.980 
think the practice is not that much at
least<00:05:51.190> not<00:05:51.430> as<00:05:51.669> much<00:05:51.699> as<00:05:51.849> other<00:05:52.060> teams<00:05:52.360> and<00:05:52.599> I

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
least not as much as other teams and I

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.779 
least not as much as other teams and I
feel<00:05:53.139> like<00:05:53.169> they<00:05:53.589> should<00:05:53.860> have<00:05:54.400> maybe<00:05:54.550> use

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
feel like they should have maybe use

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.430 
feel like they should have maybe use
more<00:05:54.940> time<00:05:55.120> going<00:05:55.419> are<00:05:55.690> practicing<00:05:56.169> for<00:05:56.349> the

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
more time going are practicing for the

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.329 
more time going are practicing for the
super<00:05:56.650> weak<00:05:56.800> and<00:05:56.919> that's<00:05:57.039> why<00:05:57.129> they're<00:05:57.310> not

00:05:57.329 --> 00:05:57.339 
super weak and that's why they're not

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:59.700 
super weak and that's why they're not
looking<00:05:57.669> as<00:05:57.819> strong<00:05:58.029> but<00:05:58.379> c9<00:05:59.379> is<00:05:59.469> always<00:05:59.680> a

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
looking as strong but c9 is always a

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.619 
looking as strong but c9 is always a
team<00:05:59.919> that<00:06:00.099> if<00:06:00.190> they<00:06:00.430> lose<00:06:00.580> one<00:06:00.789> game<00:06:00.819> they

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:01.629 
team that if they lose one game they

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:02.909 
team that if they lose one game they
just<00:06:01.810> step<00:06:01.960> it<00:06:02.080> up<00:06:02.139> they<00:06:02.259> focus<00:06:02.589> only<00:06:02.770> on

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
just step it up they focus only on

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.559 
just step it up they focus only on
League<00:06:03.190> they<00:06:03.430> just<00:06:03.639> become<00:06:04.060> back<00:06:04.240> to<00:06:04.389> being

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
League they just become back to being

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:05.670 
League they just become back to being
the<00:06:04.629> powerhouse<00:06:05.050> and<00:06:05.080> I<00:06:05.289> think<00:06:05.469> that's<00:06:05.589> what

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
the powerhouse and I think that's what

team where you going to finish like
right<00:06:27.370> now<00:06:27.520> we're<00:06:27.879> still<00:06:28.569> struggling<00:06:28.900> to

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
right now we're still struggling to

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.050 
right now we're still struggling to
adapt<00:06:29.770> to<00:06:29.889> one<00:06:30.039> another<00:06:30.279> it's<00:06:30.490> obvious<00:06:30.819> like

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
adapt to one another it's obvious like

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.999 
adapt to one another it's obvious like
just<00:06:31.389> coming<00:06:31.629> coming<00:06:32.020> in<00:06:32.139> you<00:06:32.289> come<00:06:32.770> into<00:06:32.919> a

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:33.009 
just coming coming in you come into a

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:34.860 
just coming coming in you come into a
SES<00:06:33.759> again<00:06:34.000> like<00:06:34.180> it<00:06:34.330> and<00:06:34.419> we<00:06:34.509> used<00:06:34.690> to<00:06:34.779> the

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
SES again like it and we used to the

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.620 
SES again like it and we used to the
schedule<00:06:34.959> again<00:06:35.409> we<00:06:36.339> would<00:06:36.430> finish<00:06:36.610> like<00:06:36.880> in

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
schedule again we would finish like in

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.870 
schedule again we would finish like in
my<00:06:37.779> opinion<00:06:37.990> fourth<00:06:38.889> or<00:06:39.009> fifth

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
my opinion fourth or fifth

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.000 
my opinion fourth or fifth
as<00:06:39.970> the<00:06:40.120> season<00:06:40.330> progresses<00:06:40.630> however<00:06:41.010> we'll

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
as the season progresses however we'll

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.130 
as the season progresses however we'll
get<00:06:42.190> together<00:06:42.670> even<00:06:43.030> better<00:06:43.210> and<00:06:43.480> really<00:06:43.900> try

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
get together even better and really try

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.350 
get together even better and really try
to<00:06:44.170> focus<00:06:44.260> on<00:06:44.950> getting<00:06:45.670> better<00:06:45.820> as

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
to focus on getting better as

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.720 
to focus on getting better as
individuals<00:06:46.840> and<00:06:46.960> then<00:06:47.110> focuses<00:06:47.650> focus<00:06:48.580> to

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.730 
individuals and then focuses focus to

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.310 
individuals and then focuses focus to
get<00:06:48.880> better<00:06:49.030> as<00:06:49.180> a<00:06:49.270> team<00:06:49.300> and<00:06:49.900> if<00:06:50.020> that<00:06:50.050> happens

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
get better as a team and if that happens

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.770 
get better as a team and if that happens
I<00:06:50.800> think<00:06:51.100> we<00:06:51.220> could<00:06:51.370> we<00:06:51.700> should<00:06:51.940> finish<00:06:52.180> top

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
I think we could we should finish top

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.080 
I think we could we should finish top
two<00:06:52.990> and<00:06:53.200> really<00:06:53.950> get<00:06:54.130> our<00:06:54.250> words<00:06:54.460> words

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
two and really get our words words

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.600 
two and really get our words words
placement<00:06:55.570> your<00:06:56.260> exit<00:06:56.440> habit<00:06:56.650> you<00:06:56.740> I<00:06:57.190> will

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
placement your exit habit you I will

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.610 
placement your exit habit you I will
also<00:06:57.640> say<00:06:57.910> third<00:06:58.390> or<00:06:58.540> fourth<00:06:58.720> place<00:06:58.930> we<00:06:59.440> have

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
also say third or fourth place we have

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.990 
also say third or fourth place we have
Dignitas<00:07:00.100> coming<00:07:00.370> up<00:07:00.460> looking<00:07:00.670> really<00:07:00.730> strong

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
Dignitas coming up looking really strong

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.850 
Dignitas coming up looking really strong
lmq<00:07:01.570> also<00:07:01.840> looking<00:07:02.080> really<00:07:02.230> strong<00:07:02.320> going<00:07:02.620> 40

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860 
lmq also looking really strong going 40

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.770 
lmq also looking really strong going 40
so<00:07:03.490> I<00:07:03.520> think<00:07:03.610> if<00:07:03.850> we<00:07:03.970> were<00:07:04.090> going<00:07:04.480> to<00:07:04.540> be<00:07:04.630> at<00:07:04.720> the

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
so I think if we were going to be at the

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.000 
so I think if we were going to be at the
strength<00:07:04.960> we<00:07:05.080> are<00:07:05.170> now<00:07:05.350> we<00:07:05.410> would<00:07:05.620> probably<00:07:05.770> be

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
strength we are now we would probably be

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.520 
strength we are now we would probably be
fourth<00:07:06.610> place<00:07:06.820> I<00:07:06.970> would<00:07:07.090> say<00:07:07.240> but<00:07:08.110> we're

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 
fourth place I would say but we're

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:09.960 
fourth place I would say but we're
really<00:07:08.680> aiming<00:07:08.830> to<00:07:09.070> get<00:07:09.160> that<00:07:09.280> top<00:07:09.460> two<00:07:09.670> and

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:09.970 
really aiming to get that top two and

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.370 
really aiming to get that top two and
with<00:07:10.210> the<00:07:10.330> new<00:07:10.360> team<00:07:10.660> we<00:07:10.900> have<00:07:10.930> a<00:07:11.050> lot<00:07:11.230> more

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380 
with the new team we have a lot more

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.160 
with the new team we have a lot more
planning<00:07:12.130> going<00:07:12.250> into<00:07:12.490> games<00:07:12.700> and<00:07:13.060> I<00:07:13.540> think<00:07:14.080> we

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.170 
planning going into games and I think we

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.480 
planning going into games and I think we
just<00:07:14.200> look<00:07:14.470> we're<00:07:14.950> gonna<00:07:15.010> look<00:07:15.220> stronger

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
just look we're gonna look stronger

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.040 
just look we're gonna look stronger
overall<00:07:15.790> as<00:07:16.000> we<00:07:16.180> progress<00:07:16.450> with<00:07:16.690> the<00:07:16.780> season
