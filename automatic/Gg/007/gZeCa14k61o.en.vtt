element in this and the way that was

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.520 
element in this and the way that was
presented<00:05:57.030> in<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.419> film<00:05:57.659> not<00:05:57.960> really<00:05:58.260> sure<00:05:58.500> if

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530

most<00:05:59.430> people<00:05:59.820> are<00:05:59.880> going<00:06:00.000> to<00:06:00.090> buy<00:06:00.210> into<00:06:00.479> that

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
most people are going to buy into that

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.050 
most people are going to buy into that
even<00:06:01.949> though<00:06:02.039> it<00:06:02.130> is<00:06:02.190> part<00:06:02.490> of<00:06:02.580> the<00:06:02.760> video<00:06:03.000> game
