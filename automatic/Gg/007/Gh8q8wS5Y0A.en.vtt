it's a saloon timepieces I'll show you
in<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.490> second<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:02.939> got<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.210> same<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:04.439> dead

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
in a second it's got the same like dead

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.190 
in a second it's got the same like dead
animal<00:02:05.520> skull<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.240> got<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> same<00:02:06.689> exact

pictures that are in um buried right
here<00:02:09.629> on<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.899> clock<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.200> so

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
here on the clock is so

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.170 
here on the clock is so
timepiece<00:02:11.330> like<00:02:12.220> like<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.400> same<00:02:13.640> like<00:02:14.060> the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
timepiece like like the same like the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.630 
timepiece like like the same like the
clocks<00:02:14.450> do<00:02:14.660> in<00:02:14.900> on<00:02:15.050> buried<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:16.190> one

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
clocks do in on buried and that one

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.910 
clocks do in on buried and that one
picture<00:02:16.850> is<00:02:17.000> not<00:02:17.150> buried<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.630> guy<00:02:17.720> with<00:02:17.870> the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
picture is not buried the guy with the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
the instrument but the same old table

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.930 
the instrument but the same old table
that's<00:02:21.020> in<00:02:21.170> buried<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.770> look<00:02:22.040> at<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:22.370> this

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
that's in buried and look at this this

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.900 
that's in buried and look at this this
piano<00:02:23.330> that<00:02:23.660> is<00:02:23.810> also<00:02:23.990> in<00:02:24.380> buried<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.490> I<00:02:25.520> just

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
piano that is also in buried so I just

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.100 
piano that is also in buried so I just
think<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.210> interesting<00:02:26.360> how<00:02:26.810> they<00:02:26.930> put

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
think it's interesting how they put

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.530 
think it's interesting how they put
these<00:02:27.230> little<00:02:27.460> you<00:02:28.460> know<00:02:28.580> little<00:02:28.610> clues<00:02:29.300> in

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
these little you know little clues in

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.720 
these little you know little clues in
there<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:29.960> then<00:02:30.350> we<00:02:30.800> head<00:02:31.010> back<00:02:31.190> over<00:02:31.430> here

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
there and then we head back over here

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.180 
there and then we head back over here
and<00:02:31.970> we<00:02:32.180> see<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:33.290> this<00:02:34.060> poster<00:02:35.060> here<00:02:35.240> says

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
and we see that this poster here says

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.310 
and we see that this poster here says
space<00:02:37.190> monsters<00:02:37.790> on<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.570> moon<00:02:38.750> or<00:02:39.050> something

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
space monsters on the moon or something

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.190 
space monsters on the moon or something
and<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:41.000> was<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:41.600> I<00:02:41.630> well<00:02:42.020> I<00:02:42.050> think

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
and that that was that so I well I think

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.200 
and that that was that so I well I think
that<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.800> I<00:02:42.830> think<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.580> that<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.180> know

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
that is I think that that is you know

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.630 
that is I think that that is you know
moon<00:02:44.690> from<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.080> last<00:02:45.260> game<00:02:45.380> from<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.100> black<00:02:46.460> ops

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
moon from the last game from a black ops

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.610 
moon from the last game from a black ops
1<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:47.600> see<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:47.900> one<00:02:48.050> up<00:02:48.140> here<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.440> says

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
the space monsters from the moon too so

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.970 
the space monsters from the moon too so
is<00:02:52.130> that<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.520> you<00:02:53.120> know<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.240> little<00:02:53.480> hint<00:02:54.200> towards

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
is that a you know a little hint towards

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.940 
is that a you know a little hint towards
us<00:02:55.700> maybe<00:02:56.510> getting<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.020> last<00:02:57.230> map<00:02:57.500> pack<00:02:57.740> on

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
us maybe getting the last map pack on

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.300 
us maybe getting the last map pack on
the<00:02:57.980> moon<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.670> don't<00:02:59.450> know<00:02:59.570> um<00:03:00.290> let<00:03:01.130> me<00:03:01.160> know

what you guys think I already put a
couple<00:03:02.690> theories<00:03:02.930> out<00:03:03.140> about<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.560> moon<00:03:03.740> and

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
couple theories out about the moon and

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.770 
couple theories out about the moon and
whatever<00:03:04.340> but<00:03:04.430> this<00:03:04.730> is<00:03:04.910> kind<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.150> just<00:03:05.209> it's

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
whatever but this is kind of just it's

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.970 
whatever but this is kind of just it's
not<00:03:05.870> really<00:03:06.050> confirming<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.620> but<00:03:06.740> it's<00:03:06.860> giving

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
not really confirming it but it's giving

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.220 
not really confirming it but it's giving
it<00:03:07.250> way<00:03:07.459> more<00:03:07.490> you<00:03:08.450> no<00:03:08.570> reason<00:03:08.990> to<00:03:09.080> believe

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
it way more you no reason to believe

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.900 
it way more you no reason to believe
that<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:10.070> it's<00:03:10.220> actually<00:03:10.370> going<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.670> be<00:03:10.700> on

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
that that it's actually going to be on

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.730 
that that it's actually going to be on
the<00:03:11.060> moon<00:03:11.240> so<00:03:11.870> let<00:03:12.200> me<00:03:12.260> know<00:03:12.350> what<00:03:12.470> you<00:03:12.590> guys
