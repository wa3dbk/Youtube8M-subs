case okay well first of all these are
her<00:00:33.239> models<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.770> can<00:00:34.950> see<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.520> her<00:00:35.820> case

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
her models and you can see that her case

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.770 
her models and you can see that her case
is<00:00:36.360> class<00:00:36.690> 2<00:00:36.960> Division<00:00:37.920> 2<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.570> she<00:00:39.570> has<00:00:39.750> a

is class 2 Division 2 and she has a
cross<00:00:40.320> bite<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.550> right<00:00:41.730> side<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.540> here<00:00:42.870> we

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
cross bite of the right side so here we

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.130 
cross bite of the right side so here we
will<00:00:43.200> use<00:00:43.230> an<00:00:43.620> upper<00:00:43.980> expander<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.510> expand

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
will use an upper expander to expand

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.090 
will use an upper expander to expand
your<00:00:46.289> upper<00:00:46.590> arch<00:00:46.770> okay<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:49.530> one<00:00:49.710> thing<00:00:49.920> we

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
your upper arch okay and one thing we

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.760 
your upper arch okay and one thing we
can<00:00:50.340> do<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.390> result<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.199> using<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
can do as a result of using the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.459 
can do as a result of using the
telescope<00:00:53.719> along<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> apple<00:00:55.289> core

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
telescope along with the apple core

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.150 
telescope along with the apple core
screws<00:00:56.030> we<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.379> hook<00:00:58.379> everything<00:00:58.680> up<00:00:58.949> today

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
screws we can hook everything up today

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.939 
screws we can hook everything up today
hook<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> telescopes<00:01:00.390> up<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.680> don't<00:01:01.829> have

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
hook the telescopes up and we don't have

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.660 
hook the telescopes up and we don't have
to<00:01:02.190> expand<00:01:02.699> first<00:01:03.470> with<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> very<00:01:05.040> limited

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
to expand first with the very limited

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.690 
to expand first with the very limited
movement<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.049> rod<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.619> tube<00:01:08.130> type<00:01:08.189> herps

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
movement of the rod and tube type herps

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.120 
movement of the rod and tube type herps
the<00:01:09.060> old<00:01:09.210> style<00:01:09.540> without<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.869> telescope<00:01:10.229> we

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the old style without the telescope we

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.940 
the old style without the telescope we
always<00:01:11.430> had<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.640> expand<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.659> upper<00:01:12.950> because

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
always had to expand the upper because

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.030 
always had to expand the upper because
we<00:01:14.100> didn't<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.580> good<00:01:14.909> lateral<00:01:15.180> movement

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
we didn't have the good lateral movement

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.289 
we didn't have the good lateral movement
another<00:01:17.040> thing<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.490> will<00:01:17.640> point<00:01:17.670> out<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.030> you

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
another thing I will point out to you

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.609 
another thing I will point out to you
and<00:01:18.390> you'll<00:01:18.509> see<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.930> will<00:01:19.229> become<00:01:19.470> what

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
and you'll see this will become what

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.310 
and you'll see this will become what
evident<00:01:20.009> when<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.310> let<00:01:20.520> Macpherson<00:01:21.299> back<00:01:21.509> is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
evident when we let Macpherson back is

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.080 
evident when we let Macpherson back is
that<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.799> now<00:01:23.040> converted<00:01:23.340> her<00:01:23.820> from

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that we have now converted her from

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.719 
that we have now converted her from
class<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.750> Division<00:01:25.290> two<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> class<00:01:26.520> two

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
class to Division two to a class two

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.289 
class to Division two to a class two
Division<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.560> few<00:01:28.740> weeks<00:01:29.299> that

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
Division one in just a few weeks that

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.149 
Division one in just a few weeks that
makes<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.750> seating<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.290> appliance<00:01:31.799> so

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
makes the seating of this appliance so

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.460 
makes the seating of this appliance so
much<00:01:32.310> easier<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:32.990> when<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.079> take<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
much easier so when I take the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.920 
much easier so when I take the
impressions<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.220> place<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.210> upper<00:01:36.360> brackets

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
impressions I place the upper brackets

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.450 
impressions I place the upper brackets
and<00:01:37.140> align<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.340> upper<00:01:38.400> incisors<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.340> think

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
and align the upper incisors so I think

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.020 
and align the upper incisors so I think
we're<00:01:41.759> ready

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
we're ready

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.980

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.730 
that's the way you have the best range
of<00:02:16.880> motion<00:02:19.090> she's<00:02:20.090> screwing<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.570> in<00:02:20.750> just

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
of motion she's screwing it in just

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.920 
of motion she's screwing it in just
really<00:02:22.640> tight<00:02:22.960> don't<00:02:24.010> overturn<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.160> shortly

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
really tight don't overturn it shortly

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.470 
really tight don't overturn it shortly
she'll<00:02:27.190> work<00:02:28.190> out<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.610> allen<00:02:28.880> wrench<00:02:28.910> okay<00:02:29.360> we

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
she'll work out the allen wrench okay we

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.660 
she'll work out the allen wrench okay we
go<00:02:29.570> got<00:02:30.050> that<00:02:30.290> side<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.520> now<00:02:31.730> we'll<00:02:32.030> do<00:02:32.270> the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
go got that side and now we'll do the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.220 
go got that side and now we'll do the
now<00:02:34.670> Amy<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:36.070> screwing<00:02:37.070> in<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:38.180> left<00:02:38.720> side

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.660 

again<00:02:42.230> it's<00:02:42.380> very<00:02:42.590> simple<00:02:42.980> procedure<00:02:43.160> we're

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
again it's very simple procedure we're

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.370 
again it's very simple procedure we're
trying<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.060> do<00:02:44.180> this<00:02:44.360> sitting<00:02:44.750> up<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.140> that<00:02:45.290> we

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
trying to do this sitting up so that we

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.750 
trying to do this sitting up so that we
can<00:02:45.530> get<00:02:45.680> better<00:02:45.890> pictures<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.550> course

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
can get better pictures of course

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.530 
can get better pictures of course
normally<00:02:47.390> mcpherson<00:02:48.230> would<00:02:48.350> be<00:02:48.470> reclined<00:02:48.950> the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
normally mcpherson would be reclined the

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.990 
normally mcpherson would be reclined the
procedure<00:02:50.540> comes<00:02:50.690> even<00:02:51.020> faster<00:02:51.440> than<00:02:51.470> this

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
procedure comes even faster than this

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.060 
procedure comes even faster than this
you<00:02:53.000> will<00:02:53.180> notice<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:54.110> dental<00:02:54.650> midline

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
you will notice that the dental midline

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.280 
you will notice that the dental midline
on<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.640> lure<00:02:55.850> is<00:02:56.120> off<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.690> right<00:02:56.930> a

millimeter to a millimeter and a half
that<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.530> cause<00:03:00.739> of<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:01.190> first<00:03:02.060> bicuspid

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
that is the cause of the first bicuspid

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.460 
that is the cause of the first bicuspid
number<00:03:03.800> 28<00:03:04.519> being<00:03:04.850> somewhat<00:03:05.209> blocked<00:03:05.480> out<00:03:05.720> as

number 28 being somewhat blocked out as
I<00:03:06.500> pointed<00:03:06.860> out<00:03:06.980> we<00:03:07.190> had<00:03:07.760> space<00:03:08.030> maintainer<00:03:08.570> in

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
I pointed out we had space maintainer in

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.970 
I pointed out we had space maintainer in
there<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.200> hold<00:03:09.320> things

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
there to hold things

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.310 
there to hold things

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.900 
close a few times for us you can see
that<00:03:15.260> range<00:03:15.500> of<00:03:15.709> motion<00:03:15.769> now<00:03:16.400> go<00:03:16.700> back<00:03:16.880> and

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
that range of motion now go back and

range of motion we have about 40 degrees
that's<00:03:27.140> compared<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:28.370> 16<00:03:28.820> degrees<00:03:29.180> we<00:03:29.450> had

that's compared to the 16 degrees we had

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.110 
that's compared to the 16 degrees we had
with<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.900> rod<00:03:30.080> into<00:03:30.320> book<00:03:30.650> lines<00:03:30.940> I'll<00:03:31.940> also

with the rod into book lines I'll also
point<00:03:32.510> out<00:03:32.720> these<00:03:33.620> sit<00:03:34.489> further<00:03:34.730> back<00:03:34.910> on<00:03:35.090> the

lower in the mouth in the first and
second<00:03:37.910> bicuspid<00:03:38.209> area<00:03:38.720> they<00:03:39.260> hardly<00:03:39.500> show<00:03:39.709> it

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
second bicuspid area they hardly show it

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.800 
second bicuspid area they hardly show it
all<00:03:40.010> they're<00:03:40.250> practically<00:03:40.640> invisible<00:03:40.970> and

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
all they're practically invisible and

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.300 
all they're practically invisible and
I'll<00:03:41.959> have<00:03:42.140> patients<00:03:42.560> even<00:03:42.680> compare<00:03:43.160> that

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
I'll have patients even compare that

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.000 
I'll have patients even compare that
with<00:03:43.580> one<00:03:43.760> another<00:03:44.030> at<00:03:44.180> school<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:45.350> realize

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
with one another at school and realize

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.070 
with one another at school and realize
that<00:03:46.340> this<00:03:46.519> looks<00:03:46.850> so<00:03:47.000> much<00:03:47.120> better<00:03:47.390> because

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
that this looks so much better because

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.459 
that this looks so much better because
it's<00:03:48.470> further<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.890> back<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.310> mouth
