00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hi everyone guys and welcome this 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.940
 I have no video in which to show how 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.360
 set your microphone microphone 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.780
 of unique portable computer headsets 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.970
 external microphone for stationary computers 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.150
 any mic because usually 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.150
 you may hear the sound, etc. 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.119
 anything else can feel bad 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.679
 for some strange reason then for 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.920
 First let 's go to start and write 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.520
 audio after an audio script 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.649
 click here on audio and it will appear 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.399
 This screen let his 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.160
 registration and everyone will appear here 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.910
 the microphones we have included in the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.480
 computer 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.820
 if there are also microphones that do not appear 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.730
 you have not connected click here and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.440
 you have to put both the pro esponte 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.590
 I recommend however to connect 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.890
 microphone for anyway you will be in the moment 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.119
 what operation to do this we click 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.210
 right-click properties on the microphone 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:15.799
 and then we will open this other screen 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:19.439
 what we have to do we have to go on 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:22.680
 let's go to levels and how you see there 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.170
 There are 22 strips, let 's say there is the first one 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.610
 strip where the regulator is 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.310
 microphone sound and then there was the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.770
 preamplification as you see the bar 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.970
 microphone always moves according to the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.090
 power of my voice 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.090
 the microphone complication instead the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.970
 we can adjust ourselves and you have to put it 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.790
 a 0 of b is so all his in 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.340
 background will be eliminated in part 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.079
 because your voice will improve by 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.530
 quality so even if you do n't have a 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.270
 good microphone anyway thanks to this 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.729
 to the preamp to 0 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.280
 you will have a good quality a decent one 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.310
 quality then we go over 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.649
 improvements and we must put them all 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.399
 the cues on these things like that 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.530
 we will cancel the compensation of c 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.140
 and here is the description of the cancellation 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.260
 with preface of it makes us work the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.720
 input signal at the right level is there 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.420
 in practice if these things do 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.610
 improve microphone whose suppression of 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.530
 noise to reduce static noise 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.230
 background during recording 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.620
 so for example type of sounds that 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.040
 they do such a thing I am not 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.500
 good at making silt and then eliminating echo 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.000
 acoustic to reduce the echo caused by 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.920
 speaking speakers of an athenaeum 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.829
 registration for example if we are 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.569
 talking to a friend of ours on sky that 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.060
 we are recording a video without that 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.799
 we wear headphones and video not 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.190
 you will hear the voice of yours very much 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.190
 friend 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:03.290
 nothing then the last thing was here from 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:06.439
 set at 4000 44.100 and nothing because 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.209
 then all the steps the objects here 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.159
 when you have to click on properties 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.200
 you must click on the property of 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.449
 microphone that you entered ad 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.209
 example I am using the 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:19.010
 soyuz and my deep songs don't know 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.169
 because it is not recognized however 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.810
 however I use it with this one 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:27.590
 screen here microphone realtek high 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:31.099
 definition audio and for example you used 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.530
 the headphone microphone and turtle 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.080
 beach 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.870
 you will see here for example microphone with 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.160
 written below with the gray writing more 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.360
 clear turtle beach audio defines a 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.190
 something like that 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.000
 and you must do the same by passing on it 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.520
 clicking on properties and then doing 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.340
 all these steps that must be said before 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.980
 so this was all I hope the bosses 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.640
 and the microphones during conversations 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.650
 this is still better 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.100
 let's say process improves quality 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.330
 of the microphone but let's say if you have a 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.650
 big microphone there is no pretense 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.010
 a lot for example if you have a computer 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.350
 of the 80s for example and you have a 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.570
 integrated microphone because maybe you have 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.970
 a laptop definitely not the quality 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.040
 it will be good because it is not a microphone of 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.460
 last generation like that of the three 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.410
 computer and I advise you anyway 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.600
 example if you want this not microphone 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.130
 and headphones to take headphones 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.289
 with built-in microphone 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:42.800
 maybe it's easier to set up for you 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.570
 and even cheaper I don't know and ad 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.260
 example to the bonus sensors 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:51.080
 I find myself pretty well anyway I hope 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.300
 that there was thought the tutorial video 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.879
 lasted about five minutes 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.220
 I'll wait for you at the next tutorial or at least 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:04.220
 I'm waiting for the next tutorial 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.220
 I will only do so and greet you bye bye
