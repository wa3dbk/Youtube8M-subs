00:00:03.387 --> 00:00:08.409
Twenty years ago when you asked
what is quality a grower will

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:13.620
[Carlos Crisosto, UC Davis Cooperative Extension Specialist] tell you quality is that I can
produce 4,000 boxes on my land.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.340
[Carlos Crisosto, UC Davis Cooperative Extension Specialist] Big size.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.220
They were not thinking about.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.380
If I produce these 4,000 boxes for

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.880
example, how much of that is
really going to be consumed?

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.010
What will happen with the fruit?

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.830
&gt;&gt; [Mike Thurlow, Owner of Mountain View Fruit Sales] I don't think there was
an emphasis on taste 20 years ago.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.017
[Mike Thurlow, Owner of Mountain View Fruit Sales] I think it was more just production, and

00:00:33.017 --> 00:00:39.322
then probably ten years ago the emphasis
started switching more to taste.

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:41.041
And, and now our tagline for

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:45.130
summer ripe is we, we're called
the ultimate eating experience.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.260
So for us, it's all about taste.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.850
Twenty years ago we picked fruit on
a color chip, which was a USDA color chip.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.400
And you let it, it was like a paint chip,
and you put it up against the fruit, and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.350
you'd pick as green
as you possibly could.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.170
You would hydracool it.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.640
You would pack it as
quick as you could and

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.310
if everything went right you'd
actually ship it out that day.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.480
Well, basically everything that we were
doing was exactly opposite of how it

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.180
should have been done.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.850
The conditioning process has
helped immensely with taste.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.660
&gt;&gt; So the preconditioning program
is letting the fruit ripen.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.640
before the food go all the way to
the storage and to the consumer houses.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.040
One of the advantage of these processes
is that the fruit is going to be,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.960
is tasting better and consistently
the peaches when the person go

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.380
through the market are going
to be tasting better.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.080
&gt;&gt; To this day,
when you walk in the conditioning room it,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.690
it will take you aback
when you walk in there and

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.710
it's all natural, there's no ethylene,
there's no gases.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.850
It's 100%, we're just, we're finishing
what Mother Nature started.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.490
We have enjoyed our partnership with UC
Davis they're a big part of our success.

00:01:55.594 --> 00:02:03.280
We started using Dr.
Crisostos's research in 1996.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.640
And I think our first commercial
shipments went out in â€™97.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.330
And to this day that customer that
received the first shipments is still one

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.540
of our biggest customers.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.083
And they've actually gone from
80 stores to over 300 stores so

00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:22.637
it's gonna, it's been a nice,
a steady, consistent ride.
