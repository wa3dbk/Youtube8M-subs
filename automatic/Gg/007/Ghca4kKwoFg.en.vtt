the wall and plug this cord into that

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.050 
the wall and plug this cord into that
but<00:04:40.530> but<00:04:41.130> I<00:04:41.190> said<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.430> heck<00:04:41.580> with<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.820> there's

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
but but I said the heck with it there's

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.400 
but but I said the heck with it there's
no<00:04:42.180> point<00:04:42.389> doing<00:04:42.539> that<00:04:42.750> well<00:04:42.960> hopefully<00:04:43.169> this

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
no point doing that well hopefully this

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.260 
no point doing that well hopefully this
thing<00:04:43.440> only<00:04:44.430> need<00:04:44.700> it<00:04:44.789> through<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.030> summer

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
thing only need it through the summer

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.719 
thing only need it through the summer
and<00:04:45.360> will<00:04:45.510> be<00:04:45.630> done<00:04:46.220> so<00:04:47.220> basically<00:04:47.520> we<00:04:47.700> just

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
and will be done so basically we just

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.400 
and will be done so basically we just
plug<00:04:48.150> it<00:04:48.270> in<00:04:48.450> and<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:49.470> starts<00:04:49.800> going<00:04:50.099> and<00:04:51.410> just

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
plug it in and it starts going and just

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.779 
plug it in and it starts going and just
dump<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:52.830> grains<00:04:53.099> and<00:04:53.310> you're<00:04:53.580> ready

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
dump you grains and you're ready

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.670 
dump you grains and you're ready
together<00:04:54.090> but<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:54.660> basically<00:04:54.930> all<00:04:55.169> I<00:04:55.200> did<00:04:55.289> when

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
together but so basically all I did when

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.270 
together but so basically all I did when
I<00:04:55.710> built<00:04:56.039> it<00:04:56.190> was<00:04:57.000> take<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:58.500> base<00:04:58.710> off<00:04:58.979> of<00:04:59.010> the

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
I built it was take the base off of the

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.360 
I built it was take the base off of the
off<00:04:59.610> of<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.150> meal<00:05:00.389> and<00:05:00.780> use<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.680> outside<00:05:01.889> edge

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
off of the meal and use the outside edge

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.430 
off of the meal and use the outside edge
of<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.729> base<00:05:02.940> I<00:05:03.240> mean<00:05:03.389> of<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.599> meal<00:05:03.780> itself<00:05:04.139> to

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
of the base I mean of the meal itself to

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.110 
of the base I mean of the meal itself to
just<00:05:04.620> draw<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:04.889> line<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:05.490> just<00:05:05.520> kind<00:05:05.820> of<00:05:05.849> try<00:05:06.060> to

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
just draw a line and just kind of try to

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.390 
just draw a line and just kind of try to
Center<00:05:06.539> it<00:05:06.630> up<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:07.470> best<00:05:07.680> I<00:05:07.800> could<00:05:08.010> just<00:05:08.220> drew

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
Center it up the best I could just drew

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.550 
Center it up the best I could just drew
a<00:05:08.430> line<00:05:08.720> through<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.870> hole<00:05:10.020> and<00:05:10.260> use<00:05:10.380> my

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
a line through the hole and use my

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.120 
a line through the hole and use my
jigsaw<00:05:10.979> to<00:05:11.130> cut<00:05:11.160> out<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.580> square<00:05:11.880> and<00:05:13.130> the

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
jigsaw to cut out the square and the

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.219 
jigsaw to cut out the square and the
drill<00:05:14.370> if<00:05:14.639> you<00:05:14.820> it<00:05:15.180> comes<00:05:15.389> with<00:05:15.630> like<00:05:15.810> a<00:05:15.840> handle

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
drill if you it comes with like a handle

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.050 
drill if you it comes with like a handle
that<00:05:16.260> goes<00:05:16.500> on<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:16.740> top<00:05:16.949> and<00:05:17.280> a<00:05:17.639> handle<00:05:17.910> that

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
that goes on the top and a handle that

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.879 
that goes on the top and a handle that
can<00:05:18.180> go<00:05:18.300> on<00:05:18.360> either<00:05:18.449> side<00:05:18.780> and<00:05:19.110> you<00:05:19.169> can't

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
can go on either side and you can't

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.460 
can go on either side and you can't
really<00:05:20.099> lay<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.550> grill<00:05:20.760> on<00:05:20.910> its<00:05:21.090> side<00:05:21.330> and<00:05:21.630> use

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
really lay the grill on its side and use

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.520 
really lay the grill on its side and use
this<00:05:22.650> hole<00:05:22.889> because<00:05:23.099> it<00:05:23.520> makes<00:05:23.760> it<00:05:23.880> too<00:05:24.030> high

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
this hole because it makes it too high

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.050 
this hole because it makes it too high
or<00:05:25.530> actually<00:05:25.830> too<00:05:26.039> low<00:05:26.220> I<00:05:26.460> think<00:05:26.490> so<00:05:26.789> it<00:05:26.880> was

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
or actually too low I think so it was

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.860 
or actually too low I think so it was
but<00:05:27.960> if<00:05:28.800> you<00:05:28.889> can<00:05:29.039> see<00:05:29.190> there's<00:05:29.400> not<00:05:29.610> but<00:05:29.940> up

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
but if you can see there's not but up

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.270 
but if you can see there's not but up
and<00:05:31.080> under<00:05:31.320> the<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:32.310> other<00:05:32.490> hole<00:05:32.760> for<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:34.280> the

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
and under the the other hole for the the

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.830 
and under the the other hole for the the
handle<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:35.729> goes<00:05:35.849> on<00:05:36.000> top<00:05:36.150> is<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.449> same<00:05:36.630> size

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
handle that goes on top is the same size

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.760 
handle that goes on top is the same size
so<00:05:37.020> it<00:05:37.080> was<00:05:37.169> just<00:05:37.320> what<00:05:37.530> is<00:05:37.620> that<00:05:37.650> 3/8<00:05:38.639> maybe<00:05:39.770> so

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
so it was just what is that 3/8 maybe so

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.159 
so it was just what is that 3/8 maybe so
all<00:05:40.949> I<00:05:40.979> did<00:05:41.250> was<00:05:41.460> line<00:05:42.180> that<00:05:42.389> up<00:05:42.419> the<00:05:42.780> best<00:05:42.960> I

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
all I did was line that up the best I

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:43.950 
all I did was line that up the best I
could

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
could

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.020 
could
drilled<00:05:44.199> a<00:05:44.319> kind<00:05:44.590> of<00:05:44.650> over<00:05:45.190> sized<00:05:45.729> hole

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
drilled a kind of over sized hole

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.300 
drilled a kind of over sized hole
because<00:05:46.960> it<00:05:47.110> didn't<00:05:47.350> really<00:05:47.440> matter<00:05:47.650> you<00:05:48.009> know

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
because it didn't really matter you know

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.850 
because it didn't really matter you know
as<00:05:48.400> long<00:05:48.789> as<00:05:48.910> I<00:05:48.970> got<00:05:49.150> it<00:05:49.210> tight<00:05:49.419> and<00:05:49.710> you<00:05:50.710> can

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
as long as I got it tight and you can

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.010 
as long as I got it tight and you can
see<00:05:51.100> I've<00:05:51.340> got<00:05:51.550> two<00:05:51.759> fender<00:05:52.330> washers<00:05:52.630> in<00:05:52.840> there

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
see I've got two fender washers in there

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.740 
see I've got two fender washers in there
that<00:05:53.889> made<00:05:54.099> up<00:05:54.250> the<00:05:54.310> space<00:05:54.849> difference<00:05:55.120> and

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
that made up the space difference and

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.650 
that made up the space difference and
basically<00:05:56.349> just<00:05:56.590> both<00:05:56.860> of<00:05:57.039> it<00:05:57.160> the<00:05:57.849> bolt<00:05:58.180> under

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
basically just both of it the bolt under

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.290 
basically just both of it the bolt under
the<00:05:58.780> underside<00:05:59.440> and<00:05:59.970> through<00:06:00.970> those<00:06:01.090> two

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
the underside and through those two

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.089 
the underside and through those two
fender<00:06:01.599> washers<00:06:01.930> and<00:06:02.169> into<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:02.590> drill<00:06:02.830> hole

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
fender washers and into the drill hole

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.309 
fender washers and into the drill hole
which<00:06:03.940> is<00:06:04.090> the<00:06:04.180> same<00:06:04.419> holds<00:06:04.720> that<00:06:04.870> but<00:06:05.050> just<00:06:05.169> on

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:05.319 
which is the same holds that but just on

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:07.110 
which is the same holds that but just on
top<00:06:05.530> of<00:06:05.590> the<00:06:05.770> grill<00:06:05.919> there<00:06:06.099> and<00:06:06.669> it<00:06:06.759> holds<00:06:06.940> it

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
top of the grill there and it holds it

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.680 
top of the grill there and it holds it
in<00:06:07.240> place<00:06:07.389> really<00:06:07.780> good<00:06:08.050> tight<00:06:08.699> and<00:06:10.650> the<00:06:12.690> base

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
in place really good tight and the base

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.719 
in place really good tight and the base
for<00:06:13.900> the<00:06:13.960> grain<00:06:14.139> mill<00:06:14.319> are<00:06:14.500> just<00:06:14.710> a<00:06:14.949> couple

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
for the grain mill are just a couple

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:17.010 
for the grain mill are just a couple
places<00:06:15.970> as<00:06:16.210> you<00:06:16.300> can<00:06:16.419> see<00:06:16.509> those<00:06:16.690> on<00:06:16.840> back

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
places as you can see those on back

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.499 
places as you can see those on back
there<00:06:17.520> just<00:06:18.520> mound<00:06:18.789> it<00:06:18.940> down<00:06:19.060> so<00:06:19.240> it's<00:06:19.360> good

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:19.509 
there just mound it down so it's good

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:21.860 
there just mound it down so it's good
and<00:06:19.570> sturdy<00:06:19.750> so<00:06:20.050> yeah<00:06:20.560> it<00:06:21.280> goes<00:06:21.430> really<00:06:21.639> well

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
and sturdy so yeah it goes really well

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.300
