00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.190 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.730 

so<00:00:20.000> I<00:00:20.030> figured<00:00:20.120> it<00:00:20.630> was<00:00:20.840> about<00:00:21.050> time<00:00:21.200> and<00:00:21.590> also

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
so I figured it was about time and also

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.220 
so I figured it was about time and also
I've<00:00:22.100> been<00:00:22.130> noticing<00:00:22.490> that<00:00:22.940> my<00:00:23.510> hair<00:00:23.780> has

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
grown considerably I think visibly this

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.710

so it's not like a good like
concert<00:05:18.320> amount<00:05:18.650> of<00:05:18.740> growth<00:05:21.220> that<00:05:22.220> one's

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
concert amount of growth that one's

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.879 
concert amount of growth that one's
measuring<00:05:22.909> in<00:05:23.030> about<00:05:23.360> 18<00:05:23.750> inches<00:05:23.990> for<00:05:24.500> 257

there's that piece is 21 inches aka 53

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.040 
there's that piece is 21 inches aka 53
centimeters<00:05:33.099> um<00:05:34.099> that's<00:05:34.909> why<00:05:35.090> this<00:05:35.150> is<00:05:35.389> it<00:05:35.750> so

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
centimeters um that's why this is it so

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.960 
centimeters um that's why this is it so
hard<00:05:36.320> to<00:05:36.440> measure<00:05:38.949> someone<00:05:39.949> like<00:05:40.490> sent<00:05:40.849> me<00:05:40.909> a

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
hard to measure someone like sent me a

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.540 
hard to measure someone like sent me a
link<00:05:41.180> about<00:05:41.300> t-shirts<00:05:42.130> last<00:05:43.130> time<00:05:43.400> or

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
link about t-shirts last time or

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.249 
link about t-shirts last time or
something<00:05:43.880> that<00:05:44.659> you<00:05:44.780> could<00:05:44.900> like<00:05:45.050> measure

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
something that you could like measure

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:48.210 
something that you could like measure
your<00:05:45.560> hair<00:05:45.740> with

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.510 

this<00:05:49.150> one<00:05:49.360> is<00:05:49.510> 18<00:05:49.750> /<00:05:50.350> forty<00:05:50.830> six<00:05:51.040> centimeters

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
this one is 18 / forty six centimeters

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.200 
this one is 18 / forty six centimeters
um<00:05:52.410> so<00:05:53.410> I<00:05:53.470> guess<00:05:53.650> most<00:05:54.520> of<00:05:54.670> my<00:05:54.820> hair<00:05:55.060> is

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
um so I guess most of my hair is

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.870 
um so I guess most of my hair is
hovering<00:05:55.630> in<00:05:55.870> the<00:05:55.900> anywhere<00:05:56.530> from<00:05:56.680> 17<00:05:57.280> to<00:05:57.310> 20

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
hovering in the anywhere from 17 to 20

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.910 
hovering in the anywhere from 17 to 20
inches<00:05:58.210> range<00:05:58.990> i<00:05:59.530> think<00:06:00.840> it<00:06:01.840> was<00:06:02.080> around<00:06:02.260> 19

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920 
inches range i think it was around 19

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.470 
inches range i think it was around 19
inches<00:06:03.220> will<00:06:03.430> always<00:06:03.760> be<00:06:03.880> the<00:06:03.940> found<00:06:04.180> the<00:06:04.300> side

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 
inches will always be the found the side

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.790 
inches will always be the found the side
