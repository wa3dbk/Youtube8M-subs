 Here you can also see our moment 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.079
 Coal crop to diligent one man 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.870

 like to join the coal 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.810
 Of course, an adventure itself 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.210
 cut cabbage and then on red cabbage 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.290
 white cabbage falls out and even the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.490
 take cabbage home then 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.830
 afterwards he himself was harvested 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.659
 So you're already in the middle of it 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.119
 The cool harvest you can really do in it 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.320
 say that's the last one 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.390
 energy supplier and vitamins supplier 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.500
 Absolutely and not only before winter 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.130
 but over the whole winter 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.540
 out 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.970
 earlier than it was not like that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.650
 Refrigerators and the fruit across the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.240
 World was for the people of the wise 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.780
 red cabbage quite important because he just 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.310
 a total vitamin supplier is the 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.320
 not just vitamin c but much 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.909
 many healthy plant substances white cabbage 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.220
 is for example already with the romans 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.810
 has been used as medicine even though 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.520
 They had a card the next day 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.509
 because he's one I dare quite well and 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.549
 then I felt better again 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.470
 one knows the coal wind with fever 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.689
 and with swelling you take the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.450
 red cabbage this works great red 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.950
 color has the dye and ocean of 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.530
 It is very healthy for him 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.840
 Cells quite important that cancer hammond 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.790
 and a total of zinc and many 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.310
 important stuff is the cabbage both 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.289
 that's the red cabbage and that used to be 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.940
 where are the people healthy by the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.569
 winter have come and the whole thing too 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.890
 not hurt 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.749
 You're just saying healthy through the winter 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.310
 how long does that cool? 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:19.530
 or what can I do with it 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.030
 So long keeps the cabbage of the winter 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.560
 Customer differentiate between summer and cabbage 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.719
 to cabbage the cabbage is summer 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.310
 something softer that just stores a few 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.959
 weeks of winter cabbage but now 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.030
 really over the whole winter it has to 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.829
 so stored at just over zero degrees 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.150
 become 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.560
 if he is below zero degrees he would 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.569
 break down the tolerates no halt 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.250
 frost I told them so short 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.290
 it is over zero degrees in the special store 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.389
 us stored at home in the refrigerator 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.879
 even if one has bought coal can 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:47.250
 it is good in the vegetable compartment at 23 degrees 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.620
 Quite a few weeks' storage there happened 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.930
 not two of those cabbages you can 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.030
 we handle it properly and properly 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.680
 really strong and therefore it protects 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.079
 to dry oneself off 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.430
 if it is then stored for a long time 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.959
 from the outside just scroll 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.239
 agreed which are then maybe a 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.709
 have become a bit world but are inside 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.879
 the leaves then all still top and from 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.219
 therefore, you can go into the spring 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.290
 until the february march into the now 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.310
 Enjoy cabbage when I shop now 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.049
 go there's something special 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.250
 what I have to pay attention to so I too 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.099
 really fresh cabbage as possible 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.540
 to catch the carbon can not be so 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.069
 do a lot wrong but you can see 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.379
 an example of red cabbage 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.970
 this little white shimmer on it 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.139
 that there is such a sign that the coal 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.340
 that is still very fresh 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.659
 that's nothing 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.129
 mold or white but that's the one 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.139
 natural protective layer as well as in 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.909
 the skits that results in the cabbage 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.379
 protects and if they still get it 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.970
 then you know the coal is still 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.540
 not very fresh by many hands 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.459
 went 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.900
 You can now also use the outer leaves 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.549
 the freshly harvested coal is still good 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.439
 watching looks if they are nice if there 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.030
 everything is ok later in the year though 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.680
 the outside letter below are cleaned 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.689
 I said yes just by storing 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.159
 you can take a few outside of the tobacco 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.229
 you just touch the cabbage and if 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.939
 the city ​​is really solid and stable 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:55.530
 then he is still fresh when he is 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.419
 already became world or somehow 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.340
 from why always from the outside moldy 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.389
 or from the inside world then he becomes 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.549
 softer and then he lets himself 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.049
 press and then there is finger away 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.729
 because then he is somewhere foul in there 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.769
 all clear so best the fresh 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:09.539
 pick out crispy, very solid cabbage 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.620
 and then you can do very nice things 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.000
 make it out of here you have a bit here 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.879
 what is something you prepare for everyone 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.560
 case knows the sauerkraut is coming 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.150
 from white cabbage you can get exactly sauerkraut 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.280
 also make yourself great talking 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.320
 just make the cabbage small and then the 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.150
 Cover has about as much sugar draws 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.139
 then juice and this juice is almost 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.070
 The substance was sent to the 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.500
 lactic acid bacteria 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.420
 then bring the cabbage to you 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.790
 tastes super good homemade 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.350
 sauerkraut and you can then just about 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.930
 One month you can leave that in one 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.340
 stored pot and then stored 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.560
 still three four months to 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.420
 consume and son coal costs currently 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.010
 € fresh so worth the fields themselves 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.390
 sometimes things to do even 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.590
 lasts too long with Sauerkraut 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.380

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.030
 delicious coleslaw conjure up easy too 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.080
 The coal can be minced again 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.460
 by the way, very great with the 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.440
 make slicer because you have to 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.430

 the vitamins are fixed by this 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.710
 cell structure stored well and when 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.630
