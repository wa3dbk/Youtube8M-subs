00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.980
 so everyone had a short info 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.390
 video and that is so short please 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.340
 stay with me until the end 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.330
 Actually, anyone can say that 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.740
 I would like to say 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.570
 most people had to disappear 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.429
 It's always so difficult for everyone 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.710
 to communicate that completely with it 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.369
 but again asked so point for eur 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.949
 1 It's about let's play souza minecraft 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.490
 That means other games may be an extra 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.660
 channel 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.800
 I have not had it for a long time 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.570
 many may be mentioned 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.250
 But I know some or I say so 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.439
 the majority will not know him yet 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.880
 It's been like that for the past six months 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.469
 during my first semester of 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.070
 Study a bit at half throttle 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.210
 ran 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.500
 That is, I have only recorded 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.239
 some of them are still published in the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.460
 october last year has added 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.629
 is now over his first march 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.280
 I run the channel a bit 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.360
 more active there is a daily video and 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.789
 it will come back now as well 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.110
 new ones follow different other games 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.469
 except minecraft you 'll be there 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.670
 find among other things modern apron 3er 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.670
 Of course, it's time to go down 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.690
 and furthermore, for example 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.690
 borderlands 2 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.299
 often even finished that again 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.380
 then we would also skype 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.479
 and will also be portal 2 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.689
 but come to the front how can I come 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.689
 now there 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:01.979
 and of course we also have league 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:06.600
 of legends there really shit like that 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.340
 bad so the channel for many 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.360
 many many others let's place the me 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.860
 I can do one thing at a time 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.880
 I like that so much thematically 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.530
 separate a bit 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.819
 If you're upset, you're welcome 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.530
 the video description will give you one 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.030
 link where he finds this channel below 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.709
 others can subscribe and possibly 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.080
 can stay on it if you the 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.150
 videos are still there a bit more 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.099
 therefore more interested in that then the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.140
 first left of the video description and 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.209
 yes the channel will run as follows 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.890
 Schedule technical daily video 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.690
 the projects will be a small one 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.099
 little alternate but I think so 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.170
 that actually reasonably 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.849
 It will be reasonable to work out 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.380
 or that means it can be it will be like this 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.819
 that in the future even more projects 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.560
 Depending on what I do not feel like 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.329
 that means I'll be the one too 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.500
 then get the latest games and also these 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.209
 then maybe play by if you 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.400
 come out on release date and but 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.230
 Immediately moment that's me now 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.840
 or what's going on now a few 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.069
 projects that hold a bit already 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.799
 take time like we are 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.530
 now 45 pieces so around the turn and from 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.940
 come with three come also terrys 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.980
 that means shooter it comes in general 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.299
 I also try that 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.470
 to do weekly if I go every two 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.350
 weeks ago you had such a bit 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.489
 limit now yes as we have the time 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.720
 is good and yes we do it anyway 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.299
 to this channel as I said her bock 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.440
 just have a look and 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.030
 otherwise still on the two channel 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.310
 Attention next I have one more 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.989
 second barca- phoenix 2 of it as well 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.329
 a description will be linked there 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.769
 i record among other things 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.290
 personally for my main channel 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.599
 not demanding enough 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.819
 think that means you take yes to themselves as 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.130
 It took a lot of effort to do that 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.930
 least not so thought so well 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.310
 maybe not quite like that now 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.750
 but they were not that bad 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.769
 good that I also use the main channel 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.090
 which would upload 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.980
 I can easily do that 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.870
 upload this material to me 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.760
 So do not ask so withheld 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.650
 is called in clear text videos actually 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.840
 Now I do not say so overly 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.680
 they are awesome then stop there 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.290
 uploaded 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.640
 It is like that takes several hours 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.380
 daily on it 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.900
 one can perhaps only is it out 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.860
 a consequence or something cut out and the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.330
 rest you delete again 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.950
 and that's why it's really pretty 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.990
 many more left then you see 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.400
 also something for a whole a lot 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.660
 work that is actually because if you 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.190
 So then you do not always play 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.690
 only good round you also mostly 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.250
 pretty lousy rounds always run 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.290
 is killed sat trouble my image or 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.570
 where else and how do you not go up like that? 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.630
 then come accordingly 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.570
 even at 1 2 thus may further are 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.310
 nothing more to say the magic power 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.570
 or note magic powers you have in mind 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.150
 already seen a few days 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.430
 I would say I am for watching 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.270
 or to hear or hope I am now 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.860
 everyone stayed there 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.910
 now you may be able to if you 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.210
 have interest in the corresponding 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:45.830
 pass by channels and then left 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.830
 description and goodbye
