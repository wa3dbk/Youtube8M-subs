and then she went to the US

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.710 
and then she went to the US
Championships<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:01.280> she<00:01:01.430> had<00:01:01.520> just<00:01:01.790> turned<00:01:02.030> 11

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.340 
think it was that point where I thought
oh<00:01:07.100> my<00:01:07.490> god<00:01:07.670> she's<00:01:08.000> gonna<00:01:08.090> be<00:01:08.360> at<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.719> level<00:01:08.930> of

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
you know and I thought maybe that's a

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.860 
you know and I thought maybe that's a
realistic<00:01:14.420> goal<00:01:14.659> at<00:01:15.590> 16<00:01:16.430> 16<00:01:17.360> is<00:01:17.479> still<00:01:17.690> so
