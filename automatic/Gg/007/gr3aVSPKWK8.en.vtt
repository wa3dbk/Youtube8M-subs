i'll take a couple days to really set in

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.720 
i'll take a couple days to really set in
but<00:02:17.160> uh<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.810> guess<00:02:18.810> we<00:02:18.959> did<00:02:19.110> do<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.520> feels<00:02:20.520> good

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
but uh I guess we did do it feels good

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.030 
but uh I guess we did do it feels good
feels<00:02:21.120> really<00:02:21.390> good

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.890 

these<00:02:27.849> are<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.569> best

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.080 

I'd<00:02:33.439> like<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.709> see<00:02:33.890> RIT<00:02:34.220> call<00:02:34.610> division<00:02:34.849> 1<00:02:35.060> I

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
I'd like to see RIT call division 1 I

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.059 
I'd like to see RIT call division 1 I
think<00:02:35.329> that's<00:02:35.510> our<00:02:35.629> next<00:02:35.780> logical<00:02:36.349> step<00:02:36.709> I

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
think that's our next logical step I

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.429 
think that's our next logical step I
think<00:02:37.340> we're<00:02:37.489> not<00:02:37.640> right<00:02:38.079> maybe<00:02:39.079> a<00:02:39.170> year<00:02:39.379> or

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439 
think we're not right maybe a year or

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.259 
think we're not right maybe a year or
two<00:02:39.590> before<00:02:39.739> we<00:02:40.069> make<00:02:40.250> me<00:02:40.400> realize<00:02:40.939> it<00:02:41.090> alone

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
two before we make me realize it alone

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.460 
two before we make me realize it alone
go<00:02:41.420> Division<00:02:41.629> when<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:41.900> like<00:02:42.019> to<00:02:42.110> win<00:02:42.230> the
