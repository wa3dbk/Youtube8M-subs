it was like 10 plus shipping which i
forget<00:02:21.090> how<00:02:21.150> much<00:02:21.269> shipping<00:02:21.450> was<00:02:21.690> but<00:02:21.930> you

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
forget how much shipping was but you

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.949 
forget how much shipping was but you
know<00:02:22.739> what<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.489> was<00:02:23.580> not<00:02:24.120> too<00:02:24.269> bad<00:02:24.420> price<00:02:24.750> and

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
know what it was not too bad price and

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.770 
know what it was not too bad price and
if<00:02:25.049> you<00:02:25.140> can<00:02:25.290> get<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.940> if<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.120> adapter<00:02:27.629> from

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
if you can get this if the adapter from

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.819 
if you can get this if the adapter from
the<00:02:27.870> one<00:02:28.500> wonderswan<00:02:29.489> crystal<00:02:30.480> whatever<00:02:30.829> that

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
the one wonderswan crystal whatever that

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.670 
the one wonderswan crystal whatever that
would<00:02:32.069> be<00:02:32.220> really<00:02:32.549> cool<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:33.379> that<00:02:34.379> was<00:02:34.500> just

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
would be really cool to that was just

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.100 
would be really cool to that was just
just<00:02:35.190> impossibly<00:02:35.670> awesome<00:02:35.760> it's<00:02:36.629> probably

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
just impossibly awesome it's probably

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.770 
just impossibly awesome it's probably
really<00:02:37.319> rare<00:02:37.590> though<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.849> you're<00:02:39.569> probably

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
really rare though so you're probably

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.380 
really rare though so you're probably
your<00:02:40.409> best<00:02:40.680> bet<00:02:40.829> is<00:02:41.040> probably<00:02:41.610> another<00:02:42.060> one<00:02:42.299> of

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
your best bet is probably another one of

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.349 
your best bet is probably another one of
these<00:02:42.680> or<00:02:43.680> maybe<00:02:43.950> even<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.340> neos<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:45.060> needles

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
these or maybe even the neos the needles

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.449 
these or maybe even the neos the needles
have<00:02:45.569> worked<00:02:46.079> before<00:02:46.410> I've<00:02:46.859> gotten<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.280> to

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
have worked before I've gotten it to

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.559 
have worked before I've gotten it to
work<00:02:47.489> but<00:02:48.319> I<00:02:49.340> keep<00:02:50.340> getting<00:02:50.489> an<00:02:50.790> error<00:02:50.970> on<00:02:51.359> it

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
work but I keep getting an error on it

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.449 
work but I keep getting an error on it
so<00:02:52.410> every<00:02:53.040> time<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.709> probably<00:02:55.709> say<00:02:56.069> one<00:02:56.430> of

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
so every time so I probably say one of

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.569 
so every time so I probably say one of
10<00:02:56.819> times<00:02:57.030> it's<00:02:57.239> worked<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:59.400> might<00:02:59.549> be

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
10 times it's worked so it might be

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.589 
10 times it's worked so it might be
something<00:02:59.879> I'm<00:03:00.120> doing<00:03:00.329> wrong<00:03:00.510> myself<00:03:01.290> or<00:03:02.599> some

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
something I'm doing wrong myself or some

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.319 
something I'm doing wrong myself or some
kind<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.900> issue<00:03:04.049> with<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.709> devices<00:03:05.370> but

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
kind of issue with the devices but

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.180 
kind of issue with the devices but
otherwise<00:03:06.540> they<00:03:06.930> seem<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.349> work<00:03:07.590> very<00:03:07.620> well

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
otherwise they seem to work very well

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.830 
otherwise they seem to work very well
very<00:03:08.909> dependable<00:03:10.220> except<00:03:11.220> mine<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.670> froze<00:03:12.599> on

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
very dependable except mine I froze on

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.360 
very dependable except mine I froze on
me<00:03:13.609> now<00:03:14.609> you<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.790> restart<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:16.069> think<00:03:17.069> I<00:03:17.130> died

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
me now you to restart it I think I died

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:27.270 
me now you to restart it I think I died
a<00:03:17.400> little<00:03:17.730> down<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.150> inside

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:35.550 

you
