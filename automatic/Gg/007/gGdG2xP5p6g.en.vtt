with the thumb of my right hand for
example<00:02:07.000> first<00:02:07.690> I'll<00:02:07.960> play<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.590> string

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
example first I'll play the string

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.790 
example first I'll play the string
number<00:02:09.190> six<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.179> after<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:11.110> went<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.560> play

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
number six and after that I went to play

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.820 
number six and after that I went to play
the<00:02:12.069> string<00:02:12.340> number<00:02:12.610> five<00:02:13.030> when<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:13.989> play<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
the string number five when I play the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.550 
the string number five when I play the
string<00:02:15.610> number<00:02:15.819> five<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.480> don't<00:02:16.810> want<00:02:17.110> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
string number five I don't want the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.559 
string number five I don't want the
string<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:17.980> make<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.160> sound<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.940> I'm<00:02:19.209> going<00:02:19.510> to

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
string to make a sound so I'm going to

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.350 
string to make a sound so I'm going to
use<00:02:19.900> my<00:02:20.140> thumb<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:20.980> millet<00:02:22.650> like<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:24.360> the

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
use my thumb to millet like that the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.180 
use my thumb to millet like that the
position<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.050> left<00:02:26.380> hand<00:02:26.680> has<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.100> be

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
position of the left hand has to be

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.180 
position of the left hand has to be
right<00:02:27.430> angled<00:02:28.090> all<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.570> time<00:02:28.810> otherwise<00:02:29.620> like

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
right angled all the time otherwise like

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.390 
right angled all the time otherwise like
this<00:02:30.400> for<00:02:30.760> example<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.989> plane<00:02:32.230> will<00:02:32.590> be<00:02:32.890> more

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
this for example the plane will be more

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.180 
this for example the plane will be more
difficult<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:34.060> slower<00:02:34.480> I'm<00:02:35.440> going<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:36.010> play

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
difficult and slower I'm going to play

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.820 
difficult and slower I'm going to play
it<00:02:36.400> add<00:02:36.580> 80<00:02:36.970> beats<00:02:37.360> per<00:02:37.540> minute<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.319> increase

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
it add 80 beats per minute and increase

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.210 
it add 80 beats per minute and increase
the<00:02:39.160> speed<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.940> finally<00:02:40.360> reach<00:02:40.650> 120<00:02:41.650> beats<00:02:42.010> per

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
the speed to finally reach 120 beats per

00:02:42.220 --> 00:03:55.510 
the speed to finally reach 120 beats per
minute<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.090> here<00:02:43.390> we<00:02:43.420> go

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.270 

see<00:03:56.520> you<00:03:56.640> next<00:03:57.000> time
