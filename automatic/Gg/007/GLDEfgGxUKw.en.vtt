would<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:25.759> I<00:01:26.759> think<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.570> read<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.990> right<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
would and I think if I read it right it

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.560 
would and I think if I read it right it
was<00:01:28.560> five<00:01:28.860> percent<00:01:30.740> yeah<00:01:31.740> five<00:01:32.369> percent<00:01:32.820> no

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
was five percent yeah five percent no

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.690 
was five percent yeah five percent no
it's<00:01:34.290> five<00:01:34.530> point<00:01:34.799> nine<00:01:34.860> percent<00:01:37.640> so<00:01:39.530> that's

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
it's five point nine percent so that's

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.969 
it's five point nine percent so that's
you<00:01:41.700> might<00:01:41.880> get<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> good<00:01:42.360> buzz<00:01:42.570> off<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.979> few

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.400 
that it wasn't like that otherwise this
beer<00:04:26.430> would<00:04:26.670> have<00:04:26.760> been<00:04:26.940> perfect<00:04:27.750> 10<00:04:28.080> out<00:04:28.350> of

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
beer would have been perfect 10 out of

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.430 
beer would have been perfect 10 out of
10<00:04:28.710> it<00:04:28.920> really<00:04:29.220> would<00:04:29.430> but<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.540> spice<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:30.870> kind

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
10 it really would but the spice is kind

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.010 
10 it really would but the spice is kind
of<00:04:31.590> its<00:04:32.550> kind<00:04:32.670> of<00:04:32.910> putting<00:04:33.150> it<00:04:33.270> down<00:04:33.480> from<00:04:33.870> me

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
of its kind of putting it down from me

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.140 
of its kind of putting it down from me
so<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:34.650> can't<00:04:34.920> really<00:04:35.100> give<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.550> that<00:04:35.580> perfect
