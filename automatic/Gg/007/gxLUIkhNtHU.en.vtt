high-definition in the palm of your hand

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.200 
high-definition in the palm of your hand
and<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:28.650> not<00:00:28.710> one<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:28.949> those<00:00:29.130> other<00:00:29.789> cameras

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and it's not one of those other cameras

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.070 
and it's not one of those other cameras
that's<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.539> oh<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:30.900> one's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
what else this offers a 24p and again

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.940 
what else this offers a 24p and again
it's<00:00:38.160> not<00:00:38.450> simulated<00:00:39.450> 24p<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.260> actually<00:00:40.680> slows

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
it's not simulated 24p it actually slows

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.459 
it's not simulated 24p it actually slows

arrived<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.370> small<00:00:53.699> form<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.539> now

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
arrived in a small form like this now

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.290 
arrived in a small form like this now
first<00:00:55.590> off<00:00:55.770> its<00:00:56.070> got<00:00:56.129> Canon<00:00:56.699> lenses<00:00:57.059> now<00:00:57.180> these

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
first off its got Canon lenses now these

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.209 
first off its got Canon lenses now these
are<00:00:57.480> high-definition<00:00:58.289> lenses<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.739> there<00:00:59.100> is

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
are high-definition lenses and there is

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.889 
are high-definition lenses and there is
fear<00:00:59.460> achill<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.390> what<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.539> means<00:01:00.809> is

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
fear achill so that what that means is

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.569 
fear achill so that what that means is
there's<00:01:01.020> gonna<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.289> no<00:01:01.469> aberration<00:01:02.280> around

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
there's gonna be no aberration around

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.250 
there's gonna be no aberration around
the<00:01:02.699> edges<00:01:03.030> now<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> lot<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> other<00:01:03.809> cameras

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the edges now a lot of the other cameras

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.750 
the edges now a lot of the other cameras
when<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.739> pull<00:01:04.920> all<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> way<00:01:05.189> back<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.430> get

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
when you pull all the way back you get

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.550 
when you pull all the way back you get
like<00:01:05.939> distortion<00:01:06.570> around<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> edges<00:01:07.170> not

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
like distortion around the edges not

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.760 
like distortion around the edges not
with<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.070> lens<00:01:08.520> no<00:01:09.060> way<00:01:09.299> no<00:01:09.869> how<00:01:09.900> my<00:01:10.350> friends

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
with this lens no way no how my friends

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.820 
with this lens no way no how my friends
this<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.420> clarity<00:01:12.420> now<00:01:12.900> another<00:01:13.590> nice<00:01:13.770> thing

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
this is clarity now another nice thing

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.149 
this is clarity now another nice thing
about<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.400> one<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:15.240> uses<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> CMOS<00:01:16.799> sensor

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
about this one this uses a CMOS sensor

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.130 
about this one this uses a CMOS sensor
as<00:01:17.250> opposed<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.670> CCD<00:01:18.000> sensor<00:01:18.450> now<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> lot<00:01:19.110> of

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
as opposed to a CCD sensor now a lot of

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.289 
as opposed to a CCD sensor now a lot of
the<00:01:19.290> small<00:01:19.530> cameras<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.040> use<00:01:20.189> CCD<00:01:20.880> sensors

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the small cameras they use CCD sensors

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.120 
the small cameras they use CCD sensors
and<00:01:21.450> what<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> CCD<00:01:22.110> sensor<00:01:22.409> inside<00:01:22.680> does<00:01:22.950> is

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and what the CCD sensor inside does is

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
and what the CCD sensor inside does is
the<00:01:23.880> problem<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.330> when<00:01:24.600> long<00:01:24.810> times

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the problem of that is when long times

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.840 
the problem of that is when long times
when<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> turn<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.619> you're<00:01:25.979> pointing<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.340> you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
when you turn if you're pointing is you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.399 
when you turn if you're pointing is you
know<00:01:26.970> something<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> lot<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.720> color<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
know something with a lot of color the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.990 
know something with a lot of color the
colors<00:01:28.680> kind<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.979> shift<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.460> blur<00:01:29.729> together

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
colors kind of shift and blur together

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.240 
colors kind of shift and blur together
you<00:01:30.329> get<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> Cimmerian<00:01:31.350> effect<00:01:31.650> with<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
you get like a Cimmerian effect with the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.819 
you get like a Cimmerian effect with the
CMOS<00:01:32.670> sensor<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.509> get<00:01:33.689> none<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.439> meaning

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
CMOS sensor you get none of that meaning

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.039 
CMOS sensor you get none of that meaning
there's<00:01:35.070> more<00:01:35.430> sharpness<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.360> colors<00:01:36.689> look

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
there's more sharpness the colors look

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.319 
there's more sharpness the colors look
better<00:01:37.439> there's<00:01:38.040> more<00:01:38.220> vibrance<00:01:38.640> overall<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
better there's more vibrance overall and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.950 
better there's more vibrance overall and
also<00:01:39.869> no<00:01:40.290> smearing<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.970> CMOS<00:01:42.570> sensor

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
also no smearing this one CMOS sensor

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.649 
also no smearing this one CMOS sensor
produces<00:01:43.170> images<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.159> are<00:01:44.280> comparable<00:01:44.939> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
produces images that are comparable to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.639 
produces images that are comparable to
the<00:01:45.780> professional<00:01:46.530> 3<00:01:47.100> CCD<00:01:48.060> cameras<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.229> we're

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the professional 3 CCD cameras so we're

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.340

down<00:06:01.170> a<00:06:01.200> lot<00:06:01.440> of<00:06:01.470> video<00:06:01.740> with<00:06:01.980> this<00:06:02.100> and<00:06:02.430> it's

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
down a lot of video with this and it's

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.280 
down a lot of video with this and it's
you<00:06:02.910> know<00:06:02.970> some<00:06:03.180> of<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.330> clearest<00:06:03.690> video<00:06:04.110> that

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
you know some of the clearest video that

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.890 
you know some of the clearest video that
i've<00:06:04.380> ever<00:06:04.560> seen<00:06:04.860> and<00:06:05.120> from<00:06:06.120> in<00:06:06.390> canons<00:06:06.720> line

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
i've ever seen and from in canons line

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.390 
i've ever seen and from in canons line
if<00:06:07.080> you<00:06:07.260> know<00:06:07.350> wouldn't<00:06:07.950> can<00:06:08.070> you<00:06:08.130> compare

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
if you know wouldn't can you compare

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.490 
if you know wouldn't can you compare
this<00:06:08.490> to<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:08.700> HV<00:06:09.030> 10<00:06:09.300> it's<00:06:09.870> a<00:06:09.930> totally<00:06:10.470> new

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
this to the HV 10 it's a totally new

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.930 
this to the HV 10 it's a totally new
design<00:06:10.740> they've<00:06:11.070> gutted<00:06:11.340> it<00:06:11.580> they've

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
design they've gutted it they've

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.340 
design they've gutted it they've
redesigned<00:06:12.270> it<00:06:12.540> from<00:06:12.660> the<00:06:12.750> ground<00:06:12.900> up<00:06:13.110> and

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
redesigned it from the ground up and

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.550 
redesigned it from the ground up and
it's<00:06:13.860> superior<00:06:14.670> in<00:06:14.850> every<00:06:15.270> way<00:06:15.630> to<00:06:15.660> the<00:06:15.960> HV<00:06:16.320> 10

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
it's superior in every way to the HV 10

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.710 
it's superior in every way to the HV 10
with<00:06:17.100> the<00:06:17.190> new<00:06:17.310> autofocus<00:06:17.880> mode<00:06:18.060> the<00:06:18.450> Cente

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
with the new autofocus mode the Cente

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.470 
with the new autofocus mode the Cente
mode<00:06:18.930> and<00:06:19.200> 24p<00:06:20.040> you're<00:06:20.490> gonna<00:06:20.610> be<00:06:20.760> making<00:06:20.910> some

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
mode and 24p you're gonna be making some

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.510 
mode and 24p you're gonna be making some
serious<00:06:21.960> movies<00:06:22.740> and<00:06:22.890> again<00:06:23.070> like<00:06:23.220> I<00:06:23.340> said

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
serious movies and again like I said

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.210 
serious movies and again like I said
this<00:06:23.640> CMOS<00:06:24.030> sensor<00:06:24.420> is<00:06:24.600> about<00:06:25.410> the<00:06:25.620> quality<00:06:26.040> of

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
this CMOS sensor is about the quality of

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.580 
this CMOS sensor is about the quality of
a<00:06:26.460> three-chip<00:06:27.150> camera<00:06:27.810> so<00:06:28.200> I<00:06:28.230> don't<00:06:28.410> know<00:06:28.470> what

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
a three-chip camera so I don't know what

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.950 
a three-chip camera so I don't know what
you're<00:06:28.740> waiting<00:06:28.800> for<00:06:28.980> this<00:06:29.220> is<00:06:29.370> the<00:06:30.030> HD<00:06:30.690> camera

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
you're waiting for this is the HD camera

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.840 
you're waiting for this is the HD camera
to<00:06:31.290> have<00:06:31.410> and<00:06:31.770> it<00:06:31.920> fits<00:06:32.130> right<00:06:32.310> in<00:06:32.460> my<00:06:32.550> hand

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
to have and it fits right in my hand

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.370 
to have and it fits right in my hand
it's<00:06:32.970> it's<00:06:33.480> a<00:06:33.540> little<00:06:33.750> larger<00:06:33.930> than<00:06:34.020> some<00:06:34.260> of

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
it's it's a little larger than some of

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.990 
it's it's a little larger than some of
the<00:06:34.440> other<00:06:34.740> cameras<00:06:35.070> but<00:06:35.190> it<00:06:35.340> does<00:06:35.490> a<00:06:35.520> lot<00:06:35.729> more

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
the other cameras but it does a lot more

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.680 
the other cameras but it does a lot more
