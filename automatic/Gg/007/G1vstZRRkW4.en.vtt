are<00:00:44.940> cover<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:46.079> get<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> question<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> lot<00:00:47.010> we

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
are cover and I get a question a lot we

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.740 
are cover and I get a question a lot we
get<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> question<00:00:47.610> at<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> bash<00:00:48.180> University<00:00:48.719> a

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
get a question at the bash University a

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.369 
get a question at the bash University a
lot<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.370> how<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.430> fish<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.690> cover<00:00:51.930> how<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.230> you

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
lot is how you fish the cover how do you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.189 
lot is how you fish the cover how do you
pick<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.949> visible<00:00:53.730> cover<00:00:53.969> apart<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.989> let's

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
pick that visible cover apart so let's

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.889 
pick that visible cover apart so let's
take<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> second<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.190> let's<00:00:56.640> analyze<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.570> bank

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
take a second and let's analyze a bank

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.229 
take a second and let's analyze a bank
like<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.770> let's<00:00:59.309> kind<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.609> go<00:00:59.760> over<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
like this and let's kind of go over the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.119 
like this and let's kind of go over the
scenarios<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.199> how<00:01:01.469> we're<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.890> pick

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
scenarios of how we're going to pick

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.920 
scenarios of how we're going to pick
this<00:01:02.280> cover<00:01:02.579> apart<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.270> let's<00:01:03.449> take<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> look

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
this cover apart so let's take a look

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.750 
this cover apart so let's take a look
real<00:01:04.170> quick<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.650> we'll<00:01:04.799> just<00:01:04.979> examine<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
real quick and we'll just examine a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.550 
real quick and we'll just examine a
piece<00:01:06.030> right<00:01:06.270> here<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.840> we'll<00:01:07.140> give<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.380> some

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
piece right here and we'll give you some

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.950 
piece right here and we'll give you some
examples<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.400> fishing<00:01:09.000> from<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.210> outside<00:01:09.750> in

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
examples of fishing from the outside in

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.940 
examples of fishing from the outside in
and<00:01:10.229> from<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> inside<00:01:10.799> out

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
and from the inside out

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.210 
and from the inside out
so<00:01:13.950> basically<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:15.619> basically<00:01:16.619> if<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:16.920> take<00:01:17.159> a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
so basically so basically if we take a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.820 
so basically so basically if we take a
look<00:01:17.549> at<00:01:18.299> what<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.960> right<00:01:19.259> here<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.650> this

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
look at what we have right here on this

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.890 
look at what we have right here on this
Bank<00:01:20.130> we've<00:01:20.400> got<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> natural<00:01:20.939> Bank<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.720> is

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
Bank we've got a natural Bank this is

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.710 
Bank we've got a natural Bank this is
this<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.290> no<00:01:22.590> nothing<00:01:23.070> man-made<00:01:23.310> here<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.060> if

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
this is no nothing man-made here and if

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.200 
this is no nothing man-made here and if
you<00:01:24.840> look<00:01:24.990> at<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.380> we've<00:01:25.530> got<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.950> beautiful<00:01:26.430> lay

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
you look at it we've got a beautiful lay

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.749 
you look at it we've got a beautiful lay
down<00:01:27.420> log<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.920> we've<00:01:29.159> got<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> love

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
down log here and and we've got a love

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.539 
down log here and and we've got a love
that's<00:01:30.210> got<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.689> couple<00:01:31.380> key<00:01:31.619> pieces<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.400> you

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
that's got a couple key pieces to it you

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.940 
that's got a couple key pieces to it you
know<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.270> obviously<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.350> look<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
know so obviously if we look on the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.999 
know so obviously if we look on the
outside<00:01:35.299> we've<00:01:36.299> got<00:01:36.570> some<00:01:37.229> scattered<00:01:37.799> lily

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
outside we've got some scattered lily

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.510 
outside we've got some scattered lily
pads<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.270> an<00:01:39.420> edge<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.990> vegetation<00:01:40.520> we

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
pads we have an edge of vegetation we

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.850 
pads we have an edge of vegetation we
have<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> hole<00:01:42.210> between<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.869> lily<00:01:43.229> pads<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
have a hole between the lily pads in the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.700 
have a hole between the lily pads in the
log<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.399> then<00:01:44.970> we've<00:01:45.180> got<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.990> log<00:01:46.229> itself

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
log and then we've got the log itself

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.469 
log and then we've got the log itself
we've<00:01:47.009> got<00:01:47.220> what<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.399> call<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.790> heart<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
we've got what I call the heart of the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.139 
we've got what I call the heart of the
cover<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.200> central<00:01:49.770> dense<00:01:50.070> piece<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.549> cover

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
cover the central dense piece of cover

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.399 
cover the central dense piece of cover
