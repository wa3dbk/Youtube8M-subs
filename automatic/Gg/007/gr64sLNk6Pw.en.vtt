00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.450
 and the subscribers of the yeast channel with you I am 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:19.050
 and today i would like to do a little 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:23.580
 an ad related to don star deal to you 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:29.010
 in the fact that i'm filming don starov 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.500
 more than a year now and in that time on my 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.840
 channel as we are more than 200 videos 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.980
 purely just do not starve 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.460
 You know, I feel somehow different 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.829
 maynkrafta cheeks something on my channel 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.610
 so much content 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.399
 exactly one game that somehow even 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.530
 a little shame curtains as if to play 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.079
 more than he did during that time 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.070
 addon old honestly want to vomit 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.439
 a rainbow of joy that the toy is not 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.700
 obsolete 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:12.659
 in fact very pleased with all those 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.509
 people who after i take off 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.659
 video still think about something to say no 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.710
 stupid doing cheerful voice to people 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.090
 liked to listen they are dull and 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.729
 incomprehensible talk about nothing 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.189
 you need to somehow interest the viewer 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:35.220
 the viewer well though to the viewer and the listener 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:38.579
 then I render it until 4 in the morning 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.329
 next morning some very 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.450
 about decent interesting and and certainly 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.119
 with formed personal opinion 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.720
 comrades whom I respect very much 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.390
 put under my rollers dizlaiki I them 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.930
 honestly very grateful 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.140
 anything 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.060
 I did not understand them what is really in it 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.579
 the world 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.770
 I'm interested in someone or call 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.470
 so ardent emotions that 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.300
 does not stand and put dizlaik because 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.819
 Like to really put 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.190
 hard to impress a person but 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:20.769
 irritate a person so that he 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:25.239
 put dizlike here this thing is possible 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:30.940
 even pleasant in general about what I want 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:34.810
 say start on my channel 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:38.049
 I have managed to start with such words 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.470
 talk more dong old on my 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:44.290
 the channel will someday be sure but 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:49.540
 now I just don't have it on him 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:52.180
 time and indeed from such a period 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.239
 time not to win in dawn is already 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.569
 absolutely it would not be interesting if 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.579
 the game was not updated constantly say that 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.610
 same tails and yes and generally it is random 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:08.890
 generated world and everything is very very 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:11.709
 funny but to all those who listened and 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.269
 watched this movie to the end who understood 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.010
 what really is banter 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.239
 welcome to the bands. now 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.120
 appeared on the screens 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.130
 on the real thirteenth series then 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.049
 first what do you think I will leave you without 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:33.180
 do not starve an hour continue to play 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.180
 comrades continue
