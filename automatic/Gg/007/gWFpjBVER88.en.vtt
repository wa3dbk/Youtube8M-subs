00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.079
 wonderful poker world one more day in poker key let's try 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.090
 approach them to the modality of 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.849
 these are worth 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.880
 we'll see through a series of small spaces - it's poker 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.500
 whose goal will be that you are better in each day more in the practice of 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.909
 This sport activity game 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.429
 as they prefer to call it 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.820
 For her we count as always with the presence of our great friend and 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.590
 be so little Juan Manuel 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.210
 this time speak to us of a strange word pneumonia a concept 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.210
 fundamental in this case count ads 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.940
 very good annual form that accounts hello we can talk about the works that is 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.540
 an Anglo-Saxon term that can be translated as the possibilities in 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.290
 against consortiums happening we will leave with something very simple that is a currency 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.510
 face or cross that has that indicate 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.659
 an event 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.859
 occur and against as there is a possible that a face that santa 

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:08.000
 cross then had to postulate to come out against quesada cara 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.470
 we go with everything 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.700
 we have a die we imagine that I want to take 5 and that I read it would give me 60 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.750
 chips every time he pulls 5 and I would give him alleged ten chips can that 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.690
 exit any other number 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.930
 what would the jack be 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.950
 1 to 5 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.850
 but I read 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.900
 I would pay min 1 to 6 that is 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.320
 what favors me that means that supposedly they do nothing 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.280
 I have to play 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.690
 let's go to pop 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.450
 percent let's imagine that I have two letters a 9 and a 8 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.230
 in the common letters saleh a 10 a j and some 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.600
 the other player percent in the pot there sciences 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.390
 It's hard for me to vote 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.760
 ten chips 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.280
 what are my eyes amine would be worth eight cards of the deck to get 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.080
 the maximum play 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.560
 we are with Haitian French deck 52 cards 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.830
 there are 47 to go out those 47 to me are worth 8 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.429
 39 letters that are not worth me 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.309
 and I drink letters that are worth a simple rule of three tells us that the others are 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:14.909
 fifteen 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.269
 what happens if in the boat to 100 chips and I to go to that boat I have to put 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.620
 days I'm 10 to 1 then then it's a subject it's a bet that to me 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.670
 Interested in going boer that boat because the other 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.969
 it compensates 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.129
 imagine that in the pot there were only 30 chips I had to put 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.789
 10 to go would be 3 to 1 as my eleven that comes out stairs are 5 1 do not I 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.919
 I would be interested in voting 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:42.419
 that simple and so simple is the world in texas happy, well, what 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.159
 that they are going home, I think it would be quite clear 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.319
 Anyway, we went to see the practical example that demonstrates what 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.319
 you just got in touch 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.750
 we will know those three common letters is the floppy 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.750
 two jacks against ace j 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:09.199
 and although the player of the two installments 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:13.699
 in the absence of two letters without a nine percent there comes out nothing more in the best 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:17.379
 of the cases we imagine has a 2% 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.400
 what happened 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.649
 how can it be turned off 10 thousand 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:24.779
 in a pot of 55 thousand has paid an inter percent when the 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.749
 Possibilities you have are 2% 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:32.419
 in the best case it would be the best 10% Chinese Sijin had those costs 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:33.969
 what to bring was the staircase 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:35.549
 today even 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.819
 the rest of the jacks that could be out there 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.279
 in any case summarizing 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:44.509
 the Polish the one with the two jacks tim duncan so he had to have paid 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:47.709
 those amounts of 10 thousand 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.859
 to go to that boat because he has paid above the possibilities 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.029
 that offered to win 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:55.169
 the hand has miscalculated 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.169
 and that has cost you chips 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.469
 well there is more this is 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:02.509
 all for today 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:07.639
 we are waiting for you in painting poker people where we will supply you with a little 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.979
 more of vitamins so that they get to have a game with more and more 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.219
 pregnancies 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.349
 see you and remember that the best way for a successful poker is not 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.509
 never stop practice 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:19.169
 until next time
