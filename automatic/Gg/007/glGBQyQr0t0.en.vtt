in<00:01:11.310> different<00:01:11.970> directions<00:01:12.650> so<00:01:13.650> let<00:01:13.830> me<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:14.010> a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
in different directions so let me do a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.380 
in different directions so let me do a
little<00:01:14.189> playthrough<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.939> must<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.270> must

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
little playthrough I must I must

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.210 
little playthrough I must I must
actually<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> think<00:01:16.500> perhaps<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
actually do that I think perhaps and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.600 
actually do that I think perhaps and
show<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.490> some<00:01:17.729> some<00:01:18.119> deck<00:01:18.330> building<00:01:18.810> and

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
show you some some deck building and

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.510 
show you some some deck building and
some<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.479> options<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.310> they<00:01:23.310> have

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
some of the the options that they have

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.810 
some of the the options that they have
for<00:01:25.070> but<00:01:26.070> using<00:01:26.430> some<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.610> these<00:01:26.729> expansions

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
for but using some of these expansions

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.730 
for but using some of these expansions
so<00:01:29.820> let's<00:01:30.000> go<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.810> stuff<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.470> you're

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
so let's go to the stuff that you're

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.429 
so let's go to the stuff that you're
probably<00:01:32.070> most<00:01:32.430> interested<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:33.270> which<00:01:34.170> is

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
probably most interested in which is

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.390 
probably most interested in which is
going<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.189> locations<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:37.400> winds

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
going to be the locations and the winds

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.990 
going to be the locations and the winds
of<00:01:38.460> war<00:01:39.829> still<00:01:40.829> owns<00:01:41.009> fortress<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.850> one

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
of war still owns fortress this is one

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.429 
of war still owns fortress this is one
that<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.360> like<00:01:42.600> they<00:01:43.020> tried<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.259> get<00:01:43.409> a
