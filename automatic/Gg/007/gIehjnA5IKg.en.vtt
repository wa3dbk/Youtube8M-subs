00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.490
 continue with the gold medal of 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.560
 New issue of gta 5 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:12.150
 The mission is called the inspection of the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.759
 jewelers and yes there are only two 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.350
 mission goals we can do the mission 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.170
 probieren only mÃ¼s Hierbei if we have a 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.930
 suit attachment 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.640
 and yes, the real goal is that 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.779
 We'll be there within eight minutes 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:33.440
 create and second mission goal in is 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.460
 that we are three so part in a bit 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.600
 hold on every case we drive like that 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.800
 fast as it goes I have the ride 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.390
 skipped get out immediately 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.570
 Real would have to be really fast 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.520
 schaaf's time gets out immediately 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.520
 then walk to the orange point 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.730
 and is not the cameras idle 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.920
 first to rebel 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.439
 there comes a cutscene supplies 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:08.180
 skipped and then I put in here 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.409
 this corner but not quite in the corner here 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.939
 I have it wrong the first time 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.650
 somebody does not see all three 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.570
 here are three parts you have to all 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.799
 suddenly not so far left 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.549
 So here these three parts have to go up 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.420
 paying a picture is a picture taken 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.890
 and now actually you should still 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.490
 do not go out I 'm unfortunately already 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.110
 gone out must first wait until the 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.799
 guy from outside says frizzy and then allowed to 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.600
 you go out 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.689
 I have to turn around that costs me 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.060
 all the time but in the end I have it 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.780
 then you made it with one 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.780
 gold medal 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.990
 so now we have to go back 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.080
 outside 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.890
 As I said, you can always hurry 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.440
 jeweler or a jeweler's shop 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.580
 at the jeweler holding net races in the store 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.580
 you have to walk slowly 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.369
 we have to get on the roof somehow 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.770
 come 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.750
 The farmer once around is around the block 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.750
 just turn right twice around 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:24.600
 then just get entertained like that 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.880
 fast the sg always run again 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.560
 Sprint bridge here climb on 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.050
 best not to fall under it so looks 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.640
 one actually or many things wrong 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.170
 not quite optimal I get 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.019
 still in the end in the gold medal 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.760
 white in the time now I have to 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.920
 just take care of the time and that i 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.150
 I have the first mission goal 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.200
 yes with those with the photo 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.200
 Ladders can be raised quickly 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.830
 so we have run although now 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:27.980
 exactly where we need to go 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:32.200
 continue to follow exactly this trail 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.200
 high and then we have a two photos 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:45.110
 and make the box and the photo or 2 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.300
 and down there again and yourself 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.350
 go down to the car because we 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.490
 still have to make it in time 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.050
 but eight minutes that actually 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.050
 good feasible feasible 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.380
 you could also crash some in now 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.590
 Buying animals connected 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.130
 he still has a life of it 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.630
 You just can not die here 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:25.020
 I have missed in input now but 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:28.260
 can go even so somehow no idea 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:34.140
 where is the 100 shit i have to go 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:37.700
 hurry I just jump for a 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.700
 little bit live completely no matter 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.960
 Here is right back 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.490
 I hope I am usually full down 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.490
 but that's the quickest way 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:02.540
 get back in the car from the 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.540
 follow the orange trail 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:11.450
 I skipped that again 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.190
 when we have arrived there then 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.250
 we down there to decide whether we for 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.460
 us for the loud and quiet variation of the 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.580
 next decide on or above 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:26.200
 he clearly told blablabla that 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.200
 I mostly handle everything 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:35.410
 because the missions have not ended yet 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.410
 as everything just skip it 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:46.610
 the loud version as I said the crew 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:51.500
 want to put together all 14 share 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:57.050
 fits long wait cat again 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.160
 skip skipped then you will 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.440
 I hope you also with one 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.870
 gold medal so I rewarded seven 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.310
 minutes I have the box 9 as if I 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.470
 just under a minute had time 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.880
 it really just plays 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.040
 quite simply gold with alec good 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.590
 I hope I could not help then 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.890
 we see you at the next video to 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.890
 next time
