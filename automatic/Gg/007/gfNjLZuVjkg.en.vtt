 hi are you watching video on comfy site 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.140
 imagine her big now 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.000
 the TV is really huge so now even 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.240
 now that your head is big 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.539
 TV dimensions are shocking you 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:29.649
 l g84 you by 980 diagonal of this table 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:32.800
 84 inch ping pong is more than 2 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:37.260
 4k resolution resolution and this is four times 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.510
 more than full hd that is 3840 points on 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.300
 2160 aspect ratio 16 9 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.579
 ips screen manufacturing technology with 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.589
 side diode backlight on such 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.660
 screen you can watch the billiard game 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.539
 one to one scale serves 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.019
 display special processor true for 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.329
 ok 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.120
 an engine that optimizes at any 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.190
 permission to display on 4k screen needed 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.679
 he then rarely what video now 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.930
 the more tv signals have permission 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:06.970
 4k therefore it needs to be artificially 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.550
 magnify and display also 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.650
 It is worth noting the sound component of it 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.020
 did the guys from harman kardon 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.950
 their influence can be seen even in numbers 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.380
 power 120 watts system 52 that is here 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.180
 there are two subwoofers and 5 satellites 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.860
 subwoofer and rear mounted and 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.140
 calculated that the telly will stand at 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.970
 walls for low frequency zoning 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.040
 speakers are on special racks 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.320
 on the sides and aimed at the viewer a 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.870
 the sound quality is just gorgeous 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.090
 really full sound in 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.590
 principle a separate audio system can and 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.960
 not needed if we talk about 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.150
 appearance then I am beautiful a pretty we are about 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.310
 body except stand alone speakers and 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.100
 nothing to say except check this out 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.990
 beautiful arc going from edge to edge 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.370
 and the rest is just a classic design 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.220
 tv from lg 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.420
 there are all the necessary usb connectors in the back and 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.340
 hdmi and scart tulips headphone input 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.350
 optical audio output and other TV 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.870
 this class simply can not be without 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.450
 3d here it is passive and points in the kit 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.050
 is about 4 pairs they do not bend and not 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.300
 break down 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.070
 I also want to mention technology with marti 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.460
 vii which occurs almost in 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.410
 each premium television 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.840
 and here it is based on the operating 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.730
 system in the belt it allows the TV 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.350
 surf the internet launch application 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.600
 from the store to play games 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.880
 chat on skype by the way for him here 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.320
 there is a built-in 8 megapixel 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.790
 webcam you can selfie on the TV 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.950
 make it all works on the base 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.290
 cortex a9 dual core processor 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.090
 clock frequency of 1 2 gigahertz and three 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.890
 gigabytes of ram in 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.900
 set except instruction types and 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.460
 guarantee comes two remote one 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.950
 standard for watching tv 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.230
 and another boy remout to manage in 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.300
 smart tv mode due to accelerometer and 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.670
 gyroscope it can determine the position 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.950
 hands and remote control and accordingly 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.350
 change the position of the cursor on the screen in 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.140
 I can say that yes, telly is expensive 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.420
 but he meets all the requirements of the present 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.820
 Ayti culture and still buying such a TV 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.070
 you can save on repair put it 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.620
 under some small wall without 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:11.210
