in<00:02:00.210> there<00:02:00.390> before<00:02:01.110> we<00:02:01.200> get<00:02:01.350> started<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.860> want<00:02:02.040> to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
in there before we get started I want to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.350 
in there before we get started I want to
let<00:02:02.220> you<00:02:02.370> know<00:02:02.400> that<00:02:02.520> I'm<00:02:02.760> using<00:02:02.940> a<00:02:03.150> light

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
let you know that I'm using a light

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.480 
let you know that I'm using a light
stand<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.350> microphone<00:02:04.800> sitting<00:02:05.160> on<00:02:05.280> this

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
stand and the microphone sitting on this

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.150 
stand and the microphone sitting on this
so<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.690> get<00:02:06.840> cleaner<00:02:07.170> audio<00:02:07.410> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
so that I can get cleaner audio the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.590 
so that I can get cleaner audio the
closer<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.670> put<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.000> mic<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
closer you can put the mic to the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.960 
closer you can put the mic to the
speaker<00:02:09.929> voice<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.710> better<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.610> normally

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
speaker voice the better so normally

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.640 
speaker voice the better so normally
