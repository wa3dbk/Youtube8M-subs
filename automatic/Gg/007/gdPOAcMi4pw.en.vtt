00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.400 
installing the glass and glass brackets
I<00:00:05.100> don't<00:00:05.640> have<00:00:05.819> actual<00:00:06.480> correct<00:00:06.960> pieces<00:00:07.170> of

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
I don't have actual correct pieces of

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.850 
I don't have actual correct pieces of
glass<00:00:08.690> here<00:00:09.690> but<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.320> have<00:00:10.500> some<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.830> are

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
glass here but I have some that are

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.919 
glass here but I have some that are
close<00:00:11.130> enough<00:00:11.330> each<00:00:12.330> one<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.599> these<00:00:12.690> glass

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
close enough each one of these glass

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.900 
close enough each one of these glass
brackets<00:00:13.440> has<00:00:13.590> two<00:00:13.799> two<00:00:14.190> holes<00:00:14.549> there's<00:00:14.820> a

going<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.680> go<00:00:25.800> toward<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> glass<00:00:26.779> the<00:00:27.949> little

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
going to go toward the glass the little

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.740 
going to go toward the glass the little
dots<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.640> sent<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:30.260> go<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:32.239> to<00:00:33.239> each<00:00:33.450> one

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
dots that I sent with go on to each one

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
dots that I sent with go on to each one
of<00:00:33.899> these<00:00:33.989> things<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.469> there<00:00:34.590> should<00:00:34.739> be

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
of these things and there should be

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.770 
of these things and there should be
enough<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.190> get<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:36.140> onto<00:00:37.140> each<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:38.780> each

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
enough to get to onto each of the each

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.180 
enough to get to onto each of the each
bracket<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.559> they<00:00:40.680> should<00:00:40.860> end<00:00:41.040> up<00:00:41.129> looking

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
bracket and they should end up looking

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.110 
bracket and they should end up looking
like<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:42.920> and<00:00:43.920> they<00:00:44.040> switch<00:00:44.340> from<00:00:44.610> dots<00:00:44.879> in

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
like this and they switch from dots in

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.819 
like this and they switch from dots in
the<00:00:45.210> future<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:45.690> they<00:00:45.840> were<00:00:45.899> good<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.739> know

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the future but they were good you know

from this as you can get it and in a way

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.530 
from this as you can get it and in a way
that's<00:02:15.680> gonna<00:02:15.830> let<00:02:16.100> you<00:02:16.190> pull<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:16.850> against

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
that's gonna let you pull this against

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.680 
that's gonna let you pull this against
the<00:02:17.630> glass<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:19.370> what<00:02:19.880> I'm<00:02:19.970> gonna<00:02:20.120> do

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
the glass so what I'm gonna do

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.410 
the glass so what I'm gonna do
rob<00:02:21.050> has<00:02:21.080> one<00:02:21.470> method<00:02:22.120> written<00:02:23.120> up<00:02:23.209> in<00:02:23.360> the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
rob has one method written up in the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.660 
rob has one method written up in the
instructions<00:02:23.959> what<00:02:24.860> I'm<00:02:24.950> going<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.160> do<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:25.610> a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
instructions what I'm going to do is a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.820 
instructions what I'm going to do is a
slight<00:02:26.260> variation<00:02:27.260> on<00:02:27.350> that<00:02:27.410> where<00:02:27.770> I

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
slight variation on that where I

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.240 
slight variation on that where I
essentially<00:02:28.340> set<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.730> glass<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.270> here<00:02:29.570> and

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
essentially set the glass in here and

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.080 
essentially set the glass in here and
look<00:02:31.250> at<00:02:31.430> about<00:02:31.640> where<00:02:31.850> it's<00:02:32.000> supposed<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.510> be

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
look at about where it's supposed to be

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.410 
look at about where it's supposed to be
and<00:02:35.090> press<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.690> screw<00:02:35.990> in<00:02:36.110> so<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.320> get<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.560> little

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
and press the screw in so I get a little

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.400 
and press the screw in so I get a little
little<00:02:38.420> dot<00:02:38.720> where<00:02:39.459> I'd<00:02:40.459> like<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.970> be<00:02:44.410> I'll

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
little dot where I'd like it to be I'll

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:56.270 
little dot where I'd like it to be I'll
do<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.650> same<00:02:45.860> down<00:02:46.070> here

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.130 

okay<00:02:57.280> let<00:02:57.760> me<00:02:57.819> take<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.150> glass<00:02:58.360> out<00:02:58.629> and<00:03:01.140> put

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
okay let me take the glass out and put

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.380 
okay let me take the glass out and put
the<00:03:02.260> screw<00:03:02.560> in<00:03:03.040> I'm<00:03:03.730> going<00:03:03.909> to<00:03:03.970> do<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.180> by

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
the screw in I'm going to do this by

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.610 
the screw in I'm going to do this by
hand<00:03:04.629> because<00:03:04.840> it's<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.200> little<00:03:05.379> bit<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.560> a

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
hand because it's a little bit of a

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.850 
hand because it's a little bit of a
delicate<00:03:05.799> operation<00:03:06.989> so<00:03:07.989> just<00:03:08.200> turn<00:03:08.500> this<00:03:09.540> in

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
delicate operation so just turn this in

the second one actually okay and take

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.920 
the second one actually okay and take
another<00:03:35.739> glass<00:03:36.040> bracket<00:03:36.640> using<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:37.540> slot

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
another glass bracket using the slot

00:03:37.930 --> 00:04:06.670 
another glass bracket using the slot
side<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.040> outside<00:03:39.489> here

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.550 

okay<00:04:07.720> turn<00:04:08.720> this<00:04:08.810> around<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.260> do<00:04:09.409> the<00:04:09.530> other

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
okay turn this around and do the other

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.770 
okay turn this around and do the other
side<00:04:09.739> I<00:04:10.310> don't<00:04:10.819> think<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.120> need<00:04:11.269> to<00:04:11.299> do<00:04:11.480> all<00:04:11.750> of

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
side I don't think I need to do all of

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.140 
side I don't think I need to do all of
these<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.260> show<00:04:12.290> you<00:04:12.549> how<00:04:13.549> to<00:04:13.610> do<00:04:13.819> this<00:04:13.970> but

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
these to show you how to do this but

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.330 
these to show you how to do this but
we'll<00:04:14.299> do<00:04:14.420> one<00:04:14.629> complete<00:04:14.959> pane<00:04:15.349> of<00:04:15.500> glass

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.290 

again<00:04:22.340> just<00:04:22.669> mark<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.870> tip<00:04:24.139> of<00:04:24.289> the<00:04:24.350> screw

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
again just mark the tip of the screw

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.560 
again just mark the tip of the screw
about<00:04:26.300> where<00:04:26.479> I<00:04:26.509> would<00:04:26.690> like<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:27.110> like<00:04:27.259> the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
about where I would like it like the

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:40.719 
about where I would like it like the
glass<00:04:29.570> back<00:04:29.870> in<00:04:30.080> here<00:04:30.259> actually<00:04:30.410> just<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.830> see

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.230 

that<00:04:41.419> still<00:04:41.659> looks<00:04:41.749> pretty<00:04:41.960> reasonable<00:04:42.199> and

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
that still looks pretty reasonable and

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.909 
that still looks pretty reasonable and
I'll<00:04:44.240> go<00:04:44.389> down<00:04:44.539> here<00:04:44.809> and<00:04:44.930> do<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.110> same

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:05:47.470 

okay<00:04:52.460> give<00:04:53.460> those<00:04:53.610> a<00:04:53.639> little<00:04:53.849> start<00:04:54.689> drill

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.730 

okay<00:05:48.480> now<00:05:49.470> to<00:05:49.530> mount<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:50.010> glass<00:05:51.470> you<00:05:52.470> can<00:05:52.590> have

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
okay now to mount the glass you can have

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.990 
okay now to mount the glass you can have
you<00:05:52.889> would<00:05:53.010> have<00:05:53.100> the<00:05:53.220> other<00:05:53.310> pane<00:05:53.639> in<00:05:53.820> here

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
you would have the other pane in here

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.510 
you would have the other pane in here
but<00:05:54.180> you<00:05:54.270> just<00:05:54.300> push<00:05:54.630> it<00:05:54.780> up<00:05:55.190> until<00:05:56.190> it's<00:05:56.370> right

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
but you just push it up until it's right

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.290 
but you just push it up until it's right
at<00:05:56.669> the<00:05:56.700> apex<00:05:56.910> of<00:05:57.419> these<00:05:57.540> two<00:05:57.780> parts<00:05:58.200> and<00:05:59.300> then

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
at the apex of these two parts and then

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.340 
at the apex of these two parts and then
press<00:06:01.290> on<00:06:01.530> these<00:06:01.770> as<00:06:02.100> hard<00:06:02.340> as<00:06:02.460> you<00:06:02.580> dare<00:06:03.350> and

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
press on these as hard as you dare and

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.000 
press on these as hard as you dare and
tighten<00:06:04.830> the<00:06:04.919> screws<00:06:05.220> down<00:06:06.260> and<00:06:07.260> the<00:06:07.410> clamps

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
tighten the screws down and the clamps

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.879 
tighten the screws down and the clamps
will<00:06:08.160> kind<00:06:08.340> of<00:06:08.400> come<00:06:08.730> in<00:06:09.000> and<00:06:09.470> grip<00:06:10.470> the<00:06:10.500> glass

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
will kind of come in and grip the glass

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:13.159 
will kind of come in and grip the glass
to<00:06:11.340> hold<00:06:11.490> it<00:06:11.610> in<00:06:11.669> place<00:06:11.820> you<00:06:12.750> can<00:06:12.810> have<00:06:12.930> to<00:06:13.050> do

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
to hold it in place you can have to do

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.450 
to hold it in place you can have to do
this<00:06:13.290> a<00:06:13.350> few<00:06:13.440> times<00:06:13.650> to<00:06:14.070> get<00:06:14.160> it<00:06:14.220> right<00:06:14.600> but

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
this a few times to get it right but

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:22.130 
this a few times to get it right but
when<00:06:17.460> it's<00:06:17.610> when<00:06:17.910> it's<00:06:18.060> on<00:06:18.230> it's<00:06:19.230> really<00:06:19.620> on<00:06:21.140> so

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
when it's when it's on it's really on so

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.450 
when it's when it's on it's really on so
and<00:06:22.440> that's<00:06:22.560> only<00:06:22.680> with<00:06:22.860> two<00:06:23.010> clamps<00:06:23.340> holding

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
and that's only with two clamps holding

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.850 
and that's only with two clamps holding
it<00:06:23.730> so<00:06:24.540> that's<00:06:24.690> the<00:06:24.840> general<00:06:24.990> glass<00:06:25.470> holding

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
it so that's the general glass holding

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.250 
it so that's the general glass holding
system
