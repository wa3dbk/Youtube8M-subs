00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
I should take care of that there

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.730 
I should take care of that there
shouldn't<00:00:41.000> be<00:00:41.120> really<00:00:41.600> a<00:00:41.840> strong<00:00:42.290> smell<00:00:42.560> at

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
shouldn't be really a strong smell at

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.040 
shouldn't be really a strong smell at
all<00:00:43.300> from<00:00:44.300> this<00:00:44.510> side<00:00:44.750> so<00:00:45.640> now<00:00:46.720> we're<00:00:47.720> going<00:00:47.930> to

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
all from this side so now we're going to

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.430 
all from this side so now we're going to
get<00:00:48.800> it<00:00:49.040> and<00:00:49.310> it's<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:50.120> lot<00:00:50.270> better<00:00:50.660> to<00:00:50.870> cut<00:00:51.320> it

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
get it and it's a lot better to cut it

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.590 
get it and it's a lot better to cut it
from<00:00:51.590> this<00:00:51.800> side<00:00:52.070> because<00:00:52.760> all<00:00:52.790> of<00:00:53.180> all<00:00:53.450> the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
from this side because all of all the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.460 
from this side because all of all the
hair<00:00:53.870> on<00:00:53.900> the<00:00:54.200> other<00:00:54.350> side<00:00:54.620> and<00:00:56.200> your<00:00:57.200> knife

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
hair on the other side and your knife

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.860 
hair on the other side and your knife
will<00:00:57.740> be<00:00:57.770> really<00:00:58.400> dull<00:00:58.640> if<00:00:59.030> you<00:00:59.210> try<00:00:59.510> to<00:00:59.570> cut<00:00:59.780> it

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
will be really dull if you try to cut it

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.620 
will be really dull if you try to cut it
from<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:00.140> other<00:01:00.500> side<00:01:00.590> really<00:01:00.950> fast<00:01:01.630> however

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
from the other side really fast however

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.350 
from the other side really fast however
it's<00:01:03.230> a<00:01:03.350> lot<00:01:03.440> easier<00:01:03.980> to<00:01:04.280> shape<00:01:04.699> it<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.210> way

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
it's a lot easier to shape it the way

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.390 
it's a lot easier to shape it the way
you<00:01:05.570> want<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.290> cut<00:01:06.590> out<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.829> shape<00:01:07.040> you<00:01:07.220> want

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
from the other side so I'm going to flip

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:30.359 
from the other side so I'm going to flip
it<00:01:10.700> right<00:01:10.850> now<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.300> show<00:01:11.690> you<00:01:12.550> how<00:01:13.550> to<00:01:13.610> do<00:01:13.820> that

cut into the hide and pretty much what I

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.520 
cut into the hide and pretty much what I
want<00:01:39.829> is<00:01:40.130> just<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.880> hair<00:01:41.119> on<00:01:41.329> skin<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:41.929> not

side<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.439> then<00:01:49.189> I'll<00:01:49.340> flip<00:01:49.579> it<00:01:49.729> over<00:01:50.000> again

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
side and then I'll flip it over again

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.169 
side and then I'll flip it over again
and<00:01:50.750> then<00:01:50.899> I'll<00:01:51.020> cut<00:01:51.259> out<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.530> whole<00:01:51.679> shape

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179

clean<00:02:03.319> out<00:02:03.439> very<00:02:03.679> well<00:02:03.709> so<00:02:04.069> I'm<00:02:04.549> going<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.759> cut

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
clean out very well so I'm going to cut

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.660 
clean out very well so I'm going to cut
out<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.299> very<00:02:05.509> top<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.229> so<00:02:07.009> I<00:02:07.039> can<00:02:07.280> cut<00:02:07.489> out<00:02:07.640> a

out the very top and so I can cut out a
Marten<00:02:08.060> too<00:02:08.269> just<00:02:08.840> by<00:02:08.989> going<00:02:09.049> straight

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
Marten too just by going straight

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.039 
Marten too just by going straight
through<00:02:10.039> right<00:02:12.340> there<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.849> here<00:02:14.780> I'm<00:02:14.870> just

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.340 

that's<00:02:29.000> real<00:02:29.359> easy<00:02:29.389> to<00:02:29.810> do<00:02:29.930> when<00:02:30.109> there's<00:02:30.290> no

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.610 
all right
so<00:03:04.480> that's<00:03:04.690> going<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:04.930> okay<00:03:05.230> give<00:03:05.440> me<00:03:05.470> a

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
so that's going to okay give me a

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.800 
so that's going to okay give me a
pattern<00:03:06.130> of<00:03:06.340> sort<00:03:06.670> from<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.090> other<00:03:07.210> side<00:03:07.480> so

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
pattern of sort from the other side so

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:24.960 
pattern of sort from the other side so
I'm<00:03:07.900> go<00:03:08.260> back<00:03:08.440> on<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.650> other<00:03:08.710> side<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:24.820> now

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
I'm go back on the other side and now

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.390 
I'm go back on the other side and now
have<00:03:25.209> all<00:03:25.390> our<00:03:25.570> marks<00:03:25.930> so<00:03:26.590> I<00:03:26.620> have<00:03:26.830> that<00:03:26.950> my<00:03:27.160> top

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
have all our marks so I have that my top

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.980 
have all our marks so I have that my top
mark<00:03:27.670> here<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.090> I'm<00:03:28.360> not<00:03:28.480> going<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.690> go<00:03:28.840> any

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
mark here so I'm not going to go any

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.850 
mark here so I'm not going to go any
higher<00:03:29.080> than<00:03:29.230> that

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
higher than that

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.220 
higher than that
then<00:03:30.310> I'm<00:03:30.430> pretty<00:03:30.580> much<00:03:30.760> just<00:03:30.910> gonna<00:03:31.230> connect

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
then I'm pretty much just gonna connect

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.680 
then I'm pretty much just gonna connect
the<00:03:32.290> dots<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:33.459> it's<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:33.820> lot<00:03:33.970> better<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.270> start

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
the dots and it's a lot better to start

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.540 
the dots and it's a lot better to start
from<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.959> bottom<00:03:35.110> so<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.950> top<00:03:36.190> remains

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
from the bottom so that the top remains

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.490 
from the bottom so that the top remains
attached<00:03:36.910> otherwise<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:37.810> top<00:03:38.020> will<00:03:38.260> just

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
attached otherwise the top will just

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.280 
attached otherwise the top will just
fold<00:03:38.800> onto<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.660> that's<00:03:40.660> just<00:03:40.780> what<00:03:41.080> I'll<00:03:41.170> do

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
fold onto you that's just what I'll do

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.699 
fold onto you that's just what I'll do
here<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.070> I'll<00:03:42.640> be<00:03:42.790> cutting<00:03:43.050> you<00:03:44.050> know<00:03:44.170> from
