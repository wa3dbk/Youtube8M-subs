00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 the agent today he answered a tag 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.170
 I will leave the credits and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.769
 where I watch down there are six 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.380
 Questions about books authors anyway 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.780
 about the literary universe and I answered 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.970
 What do you love, first question, would you do? 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.390
 one month and the internet could at first 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.699
 autographed edition of which book george 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.439
 and frankie, people do not know if it's worth 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.460
 answer type a person who has already died 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.960
 I think this is what I most like this 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.480
 I really wanted to have some edition 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.340
 autographed mainly the first 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.469
 but only to speak an author who is alive 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.510
 I would still choose the emc institute 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.340
 second question I would stay a year 5 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.000
 mpixels if you could sit next to 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.120
 what is the author during the flight people one year 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.250
 without eating pizza look I do not know if I 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.320
 I would stay there again very much. 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.719
 side of a flight with John Green because he 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.360
 should be a very fun option and 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.430
 It's a London flight and it's very funny. 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.680
 misdemeanor for several hours 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.300
 but to speak thus sincerely do not 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.220
 would exchange a pizza year for none 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.229
 author who sat next to me during the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.510
 flight or not we have to establish 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.369
 priorities and be the question I 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.320
 would face a marathon of commercials 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.409
 a thousand hours if which book turned movie 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.930
 in fact already has a book that I read that 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.630
 going to turn movie is not so still enough 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.090
 recording or during this recording period 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.670
 finally that is the day's passage 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.080
 Synchronize I did not comment here much 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.380
 background on this book but it's a book 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.090
 very good and what people I really wanted 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.610
 to turn film and will turn 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.310
 so I'm super excited to see the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.229
 passage to the fourth question I never 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.390
 I would have a book again if I could live 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.070
 within which the book that I think 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.710
 I'll have to be cool about the clichÃ©. 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.000
 if I could see inside the universe 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.649
 so from harry potter 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.110
 I think I would abandon him, denied 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.960
 reading because only by reporter would I do 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.439
 these people because we imagine only 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.469
 received the letter to bury words mother 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.909
 must be today is unbearable people I 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.850
 I do not know what a dog he is 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.650
 ultra 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.900
 I would leave my 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.860
 public google search if you could 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.800
 be best friend that we author 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.810
 possible king for sure because 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.030
 obviously that human being should be the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.470
 best everton best friend 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.840
 perhaps helping himself to kill with the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.580
 enemies already hide in a pit not 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.770
 find a question so, my God, I need 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.750
 to choose to which a very fucking author 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.850
 because my search history 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.319
 Google has nothing to do with me 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.989
 I think the second fÃ¡bio priest's goal 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.300
 I do not have a shirt 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.500
 We 're fighting video. Do not worry. 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.500
 forget the queen 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.760
 this question I would give everything I have 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.769
 to charity could be dating 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.660
 What fictional character do we have? 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.430
 I could date a pack of the advantages of 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.480
 be invisible because he is the best 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.730
 person is to see people are very good and kind 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.530
 book was much better when he 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.000
 entered and I still do not think it's too cool to 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.890
 dating and also feel sorry for not 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.450
 talking lived and his best friend despite 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.299
 one thing is linked to another 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.000
 The video was very short and it's short. 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.350
 Actually, there are only six questions I hope 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.200
 much you enjoyed not 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.720
 forget that joinha helps me a lot and 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.560
 I'll see you in the next kiss video, okay? 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.560
 bye
