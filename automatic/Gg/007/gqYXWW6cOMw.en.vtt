00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.360
 so go warned on the chain of 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.169
 kicked corner 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.020
 today it's me a thousand who 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.060

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.099
 product that i can sol that request 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.090
 canet the child today I was talking about 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.600
 Castor oil 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:42.000
 so it looks like that here I 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:48.480
 think of me here I am then in English 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.469

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.230
 of research oil today 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.659
 because it's natural that many 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.519
 good for our internet skin 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.839
 for our hair everything I have 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.710
 explained what you can do with 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.569
 this oil 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.290
 so if you're interested but when we 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:06.990
 therefore watched the fight without allying 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.640
 of a plant that is called Russian we 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.659
 communists I'm wrong then 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.100
 childhood and a hideout and small 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.440
 only inside then still press 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.810
 skew there to extract oil oil 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.760
 spare time then so that's it 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.040
 for its nature and its organic and everything 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.320
 it's really good for everything 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.560
 from the skin the hair the eyelashes the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.900
 dirty nails had a lot of virtues 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.540
 fortifying even as from 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.240
 the antique woodlice used they 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.950
 paid to remove makeup that date 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.990
 not today it's a little 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.880
 moment it's been for a long time 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.100
 that it's titus is a 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.950
 so I explain to you how we 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.140
 can actually use it really can 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.600
 use it for our hair childhood has 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.850
 stole fortify his valley all the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.310
 Broken hair like me I should like 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.720
 their faith there but it will help for them 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.450
 broken ankles split ends 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.730
 if you have the choices trend is that 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.160
 it 's really going north and then it's 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.150
 really good kid 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.280
 I do them a couple of times 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.989
 take oil but I tell you it is 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.819
 really bad 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.590
 vickers is not it really should not 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.840
 put a lot because otherwise under a 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.209
 meter you put too much thick 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.370
 sarr even drinking to get into your 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.390
 so much choice that it's big and thick 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.280
 so what I did me man and I got 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.720
 am no I'm not here the hair 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.810

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.000
 wash your hair and put on 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.470
 oil everywhere but I was not 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.569
 sure disappointed because I was too scared that 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.549
 it makes my hair look greasy because it's 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.129
 really when I say really big but 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.910
 germs was that a tutsi up 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.860
 tips 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.930
 I put everything back in my hair 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.959
 after if I brushed for good times 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.470
 and everywhere in my hair and then I 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.760
 slept with him all night as it is 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.590
 that I have no sugar when you 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.810
 do not have the m expected a bit like 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.160
 gold coast put the cup of advance 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.150
 for that app to be a little more present 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.860
 now your bed but that's what I 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.010
 slept with all night 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.590
 the next day I slept a good 8 years the 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.510
 temple is a medicine that is that 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.099
 russell had not even penetrated everything in 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.410
 my hair so I can still smell a 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.790
 texture a little shine are my 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.250
 hair but I got the grid choice 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.700
 after that I tell you but I am 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.540
 so sweet of those crowds at his fault 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:31.139
 if the hair makes them more 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.230
 strong then that's really it feeds them 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:36.660
 extremely the really it's crazy 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.910
 more if it's really for 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.910
 nails and allow the child to have 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.430
 followed during his volvo cars easily 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.730
 and I'm not my colleague and I 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.919
 are slow and they are strong but little 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.569
 of people the sting 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:54.810
 here is worth it on your nails if the 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.079
 public is not called too much 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.639
 because otherwise it's going to really hurt the 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:03.090
 columnist can really help to 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.440
 to go stronger in you stronger but 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.670
 also for eyelashes 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.480
 it's really good if you want that 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.760
 your lashes inches I give you a little 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.710
 I took an old bros 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.410
 of mascara that I clean everything up jeans 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.650
 the bitoux all the mascara that had 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.140
 I do it because I made the 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.350
 for a little bit but I think 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.940
 more than I tend to forget or else 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.420
 the stuff we have to do and each 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.130
 day I tend to forget this but I 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.020
 remind you of my brush in the thing and then 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.360
 if I really had the excess over 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.520
 the sides because it really puts 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.400
 copy it's at eye level we want 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.190
 at rest that we if really 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.080
 very very big so I remind you rock 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.680
 and then I applied like this summit if he 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.660
 is doing masquerade kids then but not 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.660
 too much citizens as its flash form 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.670
 remove the excess then I had 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.170
 be asleep at the wheel but I 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.160
 I marveled little it had all habib 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:04.530
 and then I tell you it as I have 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.070
 did while i tailed two months 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.780
 about 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.300
 I had already noticed a difference that 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.100
 but it's the protracted war but 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.450
 it's not all kind was losing because 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.650
 than me when I remove my makeup often 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.050
 I have lots of series falling here 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.650
 then it's because they're less strong 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.590
 then tend to be fragile fa which 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.970
 falls but with this people saw less there 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.980
 had less than less than 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.710
 fell then I saw that he was over 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.330
 early the strongest then because that's 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.400
 really a good thing that it is 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.750
 really for that then same thing for 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.550
 the hair I read not mentioned but to 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.380
 force to do it because it repairs 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.610
 all your hair ben saada the 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.290
 lengthen also makes it really 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.110
 a good thing just like me who have 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.850
 really I got because I have 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.430
 bleach and all this part if not for 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.419
 do kind of mood members and with 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.480
 lighting that right now it's 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:54.030
 sorry I do not have a nail but I saw 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.200
 bettie that I did that after that is 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.419
 really helped because my spikes 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.130
 was really when got damaged 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.230
 because of the blick ch or if it's really 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.110
 beautiful for those moments it's really good 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:08.730
 for skin care kids if you 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.500
 have the student who manages this beautiful shot 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:14.010
 frank but his touch on your 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:16.470
 lips it really wants to help to to 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.520
 repair everything that is possible so much 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.560
 deserved you really have hands 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.539
 dry pif life nothing to stop 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.610
 all creams mpcc things go wrong 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.860
 we dream - for sure you have 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.479
 plucked dry after it's safe so 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.789
 I hope it teaches you a little 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.700
 more linseed oil and it's fine 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:35.430
 Cast iron will align to summarize 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.160
 the hair to strengthen them to feed them 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.660
 for those with damaged hair 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.850
 for men 6 to make them more 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.740
 strong same eyelash has 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.890
 flew up to lengthen them makes them more 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:50.130
 loud then it's going to tend to a minus 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:52.020
 to lose and for the skin if that's all 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.760
 as good when I say it's really 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.330
 natural family no chemicals 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.880
 in there 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.330
 there is no danger in using this 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:05.220
 oil is at the annual base for beet 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:07.919
 children's laxative steam is on the 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.900
 purpose of this city work that is not 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.190
 worried if you buy one hour five 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.710
 its marks under laxatives 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:16.560
 stimulating oral do not worry 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:19.260

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.450
 this is the personal invoice 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.400

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.860
 to have about the pizzaïolo talent 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.590
 held camp we would not have 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.419
 a lot and then it's very much passed 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.700
 near serious 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:34.500
