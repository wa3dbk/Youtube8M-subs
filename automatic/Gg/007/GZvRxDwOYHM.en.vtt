Tanaka<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.159> goes<00:01:05.280> towards<00:01:05.549> war<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:06.360> it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
Tanaka it just goes towards war here it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.020 
Tanaka it just goes towards war here it
turns<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:09.030> steering<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.930> not<00:01:10.680> good<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.400> is

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
turns but the steering is not good it is

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.060 
turns but the steering is not good it is
so<00:01:12.360> not<00:01:12.600> good<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.290> means<00:01:13.590> because<00:01:13.860> it's

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
so not good that is means because it's

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.010 
so not good that is means because it's
hard<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.490> keep<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.820> car<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> straight<00:01:15.720> line

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
hard to keep the car on a straight line

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.200 
hard to keep the car on a straight line
if<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:16.979> tap<00:01:17.189> right<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.759> tap<00:01:17.970> left

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that's the way I'm thinking of it's

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.560 
that's the way I'm thinking of it's
really<00:01:25.740> sensitive<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.970> gotta<00:01:27.119> make<00:01:27.360> your

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
really sensitive you gotta make your

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.719 
really sensitive you gotta make your

corners and just hold that control and

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.640 
corners and just hold that control and
keep<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.360> straight<00:01:30.720> line<00:01:31.049> even<00:01:31.350> if<00:01:31.530> you

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
keep it on a straight line even if you

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.160 
keep it on a straight line even if you
tap<00:01:31.950> right<00:01:32.579> -<00:01:32.880> -<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.900> know<00:01:33.960> like

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
like this racing games cars don't just

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.350 
like this racing games cars don't just
was<00:02:01.890> off<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.430> road<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.090> they<00:02:03.210> don't

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
was off the road like this they don't

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.359 
was off the road like this they don't
just<00:02:03.479> lose<00:02:03.689> control<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.320> easily<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:04.860> or

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
just lose control so easily like this or

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.880 
just lose control so easily like this or
put<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.509> way<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.350> drive<00:02:07.680> in

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
put it this way you have to drive in

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.650 
put it this way you have to drive in
really<00:02:08.220> bad<00:02:08.459> rainy<00:02:08.729> conditions<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.390> get<00:02:09.479> this

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
really bad rainy conditions to get this

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.140 
really bad rainy conditions to get this
bad<00:02:09.929> handling<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.220> thought<00:02:11.489> right<00:02:11.760> now<00:02:11.940> I

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
bad handling so I thought right now I

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.940 
bad handling so I thought right now I
played<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.810> beta<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.349> can<00:02:13.500> tell<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.800> that

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
played the beta and I can tell you that

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.360 
played the beta and I can tell you that
the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.059 
the
handling<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:14.879> this<00:02:14.970> game<00:02:15.209> is<00:02:15.720> bad<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
handling in this game is bad the

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.530 
handling in this game is bad the
difference<00:02:17.430> between<00:02:17.549> this<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.819> watchdogs<00:02:18.330> is

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
difference between this and watchdogs is

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.440 
difference between this and watchdogs is
just<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.500> game<00:02:19.769> your<00:02:20.340> car<00:02:20.670> steers

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
just that in this game your car steers

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.259 
just that in this game your car steers
right<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:22.019> left<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.590> really<00:02:23.010> sensitive<00:02:23.580> you

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
right to left a really sensitive you

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.339 
right to left a really sensitive you
have<00:02:24.299> to<00:02:24.390> watch<00:02:24.629> when<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.870> actually<00:02:24.989> touching

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
have to watch when you actually touching

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.320 
have to watch when you actually touching
the<00:02:25.409> controller<00:02:25.739> but<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.640> managed<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.030> get

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
the controller but I managed to get

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.880 
the controller but I managed to get

mechanic if you can get over it the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.710 
mechanic if you can get over it the
sensitivity<00:02:35.190> then<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.329> actually<00:02:36.450> play

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
sensitivity then you can actually play

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.030
