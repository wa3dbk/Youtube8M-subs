were<00:02:40.100> light<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.760> can<00:02:41.000> abuse<00:02:41.360> construct

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
were light so you can abuse construct

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.100 
were light so you can abuse construct
absolutely<00:02:43.370> no<00:02:43.460> reason<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:43.880> I'm<00:02:44.300> shot<00:02:44.780> this

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
absolutely no reason that I'm shot this

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.740 
absolutely no reason that I'm shot this
wasn't<00:02:45.440> thought<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.740> little<00:02:45.950> bit<00:02:46.040> center

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
wasn't thought of a little bit center

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.330 
wasn't thought of a little bit center
but<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:48.050> taking<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.440> best<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.770> both<00:02:48.890> worlds

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
but it's taking the best of both worlds

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.930 
but it's taking the best of both worlds
like<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:49.880> said<00:02:50.090> earlier<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.980> do<00:02:52.130> get<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.580> combo

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
like I said earlier you do get the combo

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.910 
like I said earlier you do get the combo
power<00:02:53.150> from<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:54.170> side<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.560> deck<00:02:54.710> and

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
power from this side of the deck and

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.880 
power from this side of the deck and
then<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.700> very<00:02:55.940> consistent<00:02:56.650> fusions<00:02:57.650> and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
then the very consistent fusions and

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.270 
then the very consistent fusions and
versatility<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:58.970> this<00:02:59.330> side<00:02:59.720> gives<00:03:00.050> you

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
versatility that this side gives you

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.070

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
along with you have basically the option

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.070 
along with you have basically the option
to<00:03:03.110> run<00:03:03.590> dual<00:03:04.010> o<00:03:04.250> TKS<00:03:04.730> um<00:03:05.000> in<00:03:05.660> normal

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
to run dual o TKS um in normal

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.650 
to run dual o TKS um in normal
situations<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.770> shouldn't<00:03:07.280> clog<00:03:07.520> you<00:03:07.760> plus

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
situations that shouldn't clog you plus

farm girls recruit ability combined with
once<00:03:11.810> again<00:03:12.080> this<00:03:12.650> should<00:03:12.800> all<00:03:12.920> part<00:03:13.190> of<00:03:13.280> the

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
once again this should all part of the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
once again this should all part of the
deck<00:03:13.580> really<00:03:14.510> makes<00:03:14.720> otk<00:03:15.230> pushes<00:03:15.740> and

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
deck really makes otk pushes and

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.000

stabilizing<00:03:17.420> board<00:03:17.690> control<00:03:18.140> all<00:03:18.320> that<00:03:18.890> much

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
stabilizing board control all that much

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.600 
stabilizing board control all that much
easier<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:20.920> that's<00:03:21.920> one<00:03:22.100> of<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.250> things<00:03:22.310> that

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
easier and that's one of the things that

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.780 
easier and that's one of the things that
I<00:03:22.640> like<00:03:22.880> about<00:03:22.940> this<00:03:23.210> deck<00:03:23.540> though<00:03:23.720> is<00:03:23.930> because

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
I like about this deck though is because

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.240 
I like about this deck though is because
not<00:03:25.790> how<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:26.750> look<00:03:27.140> at<00:03:27.320> it<00:03:27.350> but<00:03:27.800> you<00:03:27.920> can<00:03:28.070> tell

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
not how you look at it but you can tell

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.400 
not how you look at it but you can tell
that<00:03:28.430> this<00:03:28.640> was<00:03:28.910> decently<00:03:29.570> well<00:03:29.870> built<00:03:30.230> on

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
that this was decently well built on

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.520 
that this was decently well built on
some<00:03:31.130> of<00:03:31.250> his<00:03:31.400> numbers<00:03:31.870> 45<00:03:32.870> cards<00:03:33.260> not

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
some of his numbers 45 cards not

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.890 
some of his numbers 45 cards not
terrible<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.730> lot<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.450> all<00:03:35.540> players<00:03:35.780> I've

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900
