natural<00:00:49.940> in<00:00:50.299> the<00:00:50.360> water<00:00:50.659> but<00:00:51.290> there's<00:00:51.470> a<00:00:51.530> few

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
natural in the water but there's a few

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:54.009 
natural in the water but there's a few
properties<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:52.790> our<00:00:52.940> design<00:00:53.330> that<00:00:53.570> makes<00:00:53.600> us

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
properties to our design that makes us

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.359 
properties to our design that makes us
different<00:00:54.229> than<00:00:54.559> any<00:00:54.680> others<00:00:54.979> that<00:00:55.010> are<00:00:55.250> on

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:55.369 
different than any others that are on

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:58.180 
different than any others that are on
the<00:00:55.460> market<00:00:55.610> and<00:00:56.119> one<00:00:56.720> is<00:00:56.989> is<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.769> design<00:00:58.159> of

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
the market and one is is the design of

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.369 
the market and one is is the design of
that<00:00:58.489> body<00:00:58.760> style<00:00:59.000> it's<00:00:59.570> kind<00:00:59.720> of<00:00:59.839> flat<00:01:00.140> right

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
that body style it's kind of flat right

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.380 
that body style it's kind of flat right
on<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.650> top<00:01:00.860> here<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:01.519> that<00:01:01.850> bottom<00:01:02.269> is

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
on the top here and that bottom is

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.899 
on the top here and that bottom is
v-shaped<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.320> really<00:01:03.589> it<00:01:03.890> has<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.369> the

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
v-shaped so really it has the the

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.820 
v-shaped so really it has the the
concept<00:01:05.360> of<00:01:05.479> a<00:01:05.600> bass<00:01:05.780> boat<00:01:05.810> it's<00:01:06.290> shaped<00:01:06.619> that

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
concept of a bass boat it's shaped that

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.740 
concept of a bass boat it's shaped that
way<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.580> why<00:01:07.790> that's<00:01:07.939> important<00:01:08.479> is<00:01:08.600> when

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
way and why that's important is when

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.050 
way and why that's important is when
this<00:01:08.869> thing<00:01:09.110> sits<00:01:09.380> in<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.650> water<00:01:09.920> it<00:01:10.700> does<00:01:10.909> not

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
this thing sits in the water it does not

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.179 
this thing sits in the water it does not
have<00:01:11.299> a<00:01:11.330> tendency<00:01:11.930> to<00:01:11.960> roll<00:01:12.350> as<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:12.979> angler

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
have a tendency to roll as the angler

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.800 
have a tendency to roll as the angler
starts<00:01:13.460> twitching<00:01:13.670> that<00:01:13.939> thing<00:01:14.150> back<00:01:14.299> if<00:01:14.750> we

you twitch that through the water that
tail<00:01:54.920> just<00:01:55.219> goes<00:01:55.399> crazy<00:01:55.429> it<00:01:55.939> doesn't<00:01:56.060> have<00:01:56.299> a

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
tail just goes crazy it doesn't have a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:57.760 
tail just goes crazy it doesn't have a
tendency<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.840> roll<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.350> that's<00:01:57.499> what<00:01:57.649> makes

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
tendency to roll and that's what makes

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.620 
tendency to roll and that's what makes
that<00:01:57.920> body<00:01:58.159> style<00:01:58.340> unique<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:59.240> other<00:01:59.359> thing

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
that body style unique the other thing

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.819 
that body style unique the other thing
though<00:01:59.780> that's<00:01:59.990> really<00:02:00.319> one<00:02:00.469> of<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.649> most

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
though that's really one of the most

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.410 
though that's really one of the most
important<00:02:01.280> things<00:02:01.460> is<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:01.850> long<00:02:02.090> vertical

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
important things is this long vertical

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.469 
important things is this long vertical
tail<00:02:02.899> we<00:02:03.679> designed<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:04.310> vertically<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.329> that

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
tail we designed it vertically so that

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.029 
tail we designed it vertically so that
it<00:02:05.600> actually<00:02:05.780> has<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.229> swimming<00:02:06.710> action

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
it actually has a swimming action

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.190 
it actually has a swimming action
through<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.579> water<00:02:07.850> okay<00:02:08.420> okay<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:08.990> kind

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
through the water okay okay so it kind

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.359 
through the water okay okay so it kind
of<00:02:09.289> gives<00:02:09.380> that<00:02:09.619> little<00:02:09.649> snake<00:02:10.100> like

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
of gives that little snake like

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.340 
of gives that little snake like
appearance<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:11.000> then<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.600> tail<00:02:11.840> on<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.110> is

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
appearance and then the tail on it is

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.870 
appearance and then the tail on it is
like<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.560> dolphin<00:02:12.920> or<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.370> whale<00:02:13.580> it's<00:02:13.790> a

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
like a dolphin or a whale it's a

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.300 
like a dolphin or a whale it's a
horizontal<00:02:14.480> tail<00:02:14.750> it's<00:02:15.290> not<00:02:15.500> vertical<00:02:16.160> like

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
horizontal tail it's not vertical like

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.790 
horizontal tail it's not vertical like
on<00:02:16.459> a<00:02:16.490> typical<00:02:16.790> real<00:02:17.390> baked<00:02:17.690> fish<00:02:17.959> right<00:02:18.440> so

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
on a typical real baked fish right so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.559 
on a typical real baked fish right so
what<00:02:19.160> makes<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.550> unique<00:02:19.819> about<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.300> is

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
what makes the unique about that is

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.560 
what makes the unique about that is
especially<00:02:20.930> like<00:02:21.319> on<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.500> four-inch<00:02:22.180> okay<00:02:23.180> if

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
especially like on a four-inch okay if

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.270 
especially like on a four-inch okay if
you<00:02:23.750> put<00:02:23.960> that<00:02:24.080> four-inch<00:02:24.410> like<00:02:24.740> a<00:02:24.770> little<00:02:25.070> jig

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
you put that four-inch like a little jig

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.470 
you put that four-inch like a little jig
head<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:25.670> let's<00:02:25.880> say<00:02:26.030> we're<00:02:26.210> fishing

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
trout colors what we try to do is when

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.060 
trout colors what we try to do is when
we're<00:03:21.630> designing<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:22.140> bait<00:03:22.320> especially<00:03:22.860> in<00:03:22.980> the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
we're designing a bait especially in the

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.270 
we're designing a bait especially in the
color<00:03:23.310> scenario<00:03:23.940> want<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.540> try<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.720> match<00:03:24.959> that

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
color scenario want to try to match that

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.920 
color scenario want to try to match that
excellent<00:03:26.280> yeah<00:03:26.400> that's<00:03:26.730> exactly<00:03:26.930> exactly

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
excellent yeah that's exactly exactly

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.660
