different styles of this ledger so and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.490 
different styles of this ledger so and
we<00:00:15.030> had<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> lot<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.540> comments<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.139> lot<00:00:16.350> of

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
we had a lot of comments in a lot of

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.349 
we had a lot of comments in a lot of
requests<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:17.010> do<00:00:17.130> some<00:00:17.400> kind<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.760> bill<00:00:18.000> tracker

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
I thought well it would be nice to

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.259 
I thought well it would be nice to
design<00:00:23.550> something<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.150> use<00:00:24.240> for

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
design something that you can use for

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.740 
design something that you can use for
all<00:00:24.539> three<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.869> those<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.570> just<00:00:27.570> did<00:00:27.720> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
all three of those so I just did a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.870 
all three of those so I just did a
ledger<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.619> up<00:00:29.099> here<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.490> could<00:00:29.670> write

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
ledger so up here you could write

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.730 
ledger so up here you could write
there's<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.390> little<00:00:30.570> highlighted<00:00:31.289> area<00:00:31.529> where

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
there's a little highlighted area where

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.069 
there's a little highlighted area where
you<00:00:31.830> could<00:00:31.980> write<00:00:32.189> um<00:00:32.630> what<00:00:33.630> your<00:00:33.750> Ledger's

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
you could write um what your Ledger's

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.560 
you could write um what your Ledger's
for<00:00:34.530> if<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:35.130> expenses<00:00:35.610> or<00:00:35.910> gas<00:00:36.149> mileage
