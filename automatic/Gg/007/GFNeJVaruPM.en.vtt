00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
we were looking at earlier that looks

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.520 
we were looking at earlier that looks
stunning<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:25.330> all<00:01:25.630> of<00:01:25.690> these<00:01:25.899> are<00:01:26.080> taken<00:01:26.349> on

stunning so all of these are taken on

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.430 
stunning so all of these are taken on
the<00:01:26.740> c7<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.630> what<00:01:28.630> we<00:01:28.720> have<00:01:28.840> now<00:01:28.959> implemented

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
the c7 and what we have now implemented

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.809 
the c7 and what we have now implemented
interest<00:01:29.709> in<00:01:29.800> me<00:01:29.890> three<00:01:30.069> is<00:01:30.220> pinch<00:01:30.550> zoom

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
interest in me three is pinch zoom

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.080 
interest in me three is pinch zoom
technology<00:01:31.360> so<00:01:31.899> we<00:01:32.050> can<00:01:32.200> pinch<00:01:32.410> zoom<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.880> the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
technology so we can pinch zoom on the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.660 
technology so we can pinch zoom on the
device<00:01:34.330> and<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.590> greatest<00:01:36.310> thing<00:01:36.459> that<00:01:36.610> I

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
device and the greatest thing that I

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.339 
device and the greatest thing that I
want<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.030> pick<00:01:37.119> out<00:01:37.239> here<00:01:37.420> is<00:01:37.539> is<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:38.140> water

00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:38.349 
want to pick out here is is the water

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:40.919 
want to pick out here is is the water
detail<00:01:39.149> but<00:01:40.149> generally<00:01:40.479> with<00:01:40.569> a<00:01:40.599> normal<00:01:40.780> i

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
detail but generally with a normal i

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.419 
detail but generally with a normal i
should<00:01:41.080> have<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.289> focus<00:01:41.470> on<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.890> that<00:01:42.039> but

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
should have to focus on to that but

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.609 
should have to focus on to that but
because<00:01:42.520> full<00:01:42.940> focus<00:01:43.179> is<00:01:43.390> always<00:01:43.569> there<00:01:43.869> the

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
because full focus is always there the

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.150 
because full focus is always there the
background<00:01:44.950> is<00:01:45.429> still<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.840> in<00:01:47.170> detail<00:01:47.530> and

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
background is still is in detail and

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.559 
background is still is in detail and
it's<00:01:48.399> just<00:01:48.640> one<00:01:48.759> of<00:01:48.849> the<00:01:48.910> most<00:01:49.000> amazing<00:01:49.390> things

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
it's just one of the most amazing things

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.059 
it's just one of the most amazing things
because<00:01:50.050> it's<00:01:50.170> very<00:01:50.319> thin<00:01:50.649> you<00:01:50.800> know<00:01:50.920> this<00:01:51.039> is

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
because it's very thin you know this is

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:54.479 
because it's very thin you know this is
10.5<00:01:51.459> millimeters<00:01:52.270> thin<00:01:53.009> how<00:01:54.009> we<00:01:54.069> did<00:01:54.340> all<00:01:54.459> of

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:54.489 
10.5 millimeters thin how we did all of

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.400 
10.5 millimeters thin how we did all of
that<00:01:54.640> into<00:01:54.910> that<00:01:55.149> size<00:01:55.509> is<00:01:55.780> still<00:01:56.050> beyond<00:01:56.319> me

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
that into that size is still beyond me

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.740 
that into that size is still beyond me
but<00:01:56.739> i<00:01:57.190> think<00:01:57.399> that's<00:01:57.550> a<00:01:57.700> massive<00:01:58.539> win<00:01:58.869> win

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
but i think that's a massive win win

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.650 
but i think that's a massive win win
so<00:02:00.530> we<00:02:00.650> can<00:02:00.770> double<00:02:01.100> tap<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:02.360> we've<00:02:02.450> caught

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
so we can double tap and we've caught

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.010 
so we can double tap and we've caught
these<00:02:02.810> very<00:02:03.740> kind<00:02:04.040> of<00:02:04.130> swype<00:02:04.400> motions<00:02:05.060> so

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
these very kind of swype motions so

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.370 
these very kind of swype motions so
Jesse<00:02:06.380> allergy<00:02:07.160> to<00:02:08.030> double<00:02:08.450> zoom<00:02:08.600> so<00:02:09.200> there's

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
Jesse allergy to double zoom so there's

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.440 
Jesse allergy to double zoom so there's
no<00:02:09.530> way<00:02:10.900> it's<00:02:11.900> always<00:02:12.260> on<00:02:12.560> this<00:02:13.220> one<00:02:13.700> it's<00:02:14.270> one

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
no way it's always on this one it's one

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.970 
no way it's always on this one it's one
close<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:14.870> supposed<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.320> start<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.560> camera<00:02:15.740> now

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
close I supposed to start the camera now

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.250 
close I supposed to start the camera now
most<00:02:16.670> most<00:02:17.120> devices<00:02:17.510> you'd<00:02:17.660> see<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> couple<00:02:18.110> of

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
most most devices you'd see a couple of

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.330 
most most devices you'd see a couple of
seconds<00:02:18.590> starts<00:02:19.190> if<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:20.300> uh

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
seconds starts if I I just uh

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.280 
seconds starts if I I just uh
do<00:02:21.910> that<00:02:22.090> so<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.540> press<00:02:22.780> turn<00:02:22.870> off<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.050> camera

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
do that so I press turn off the camera

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.910 
do that so I press turn off the camera
key<00:02:23.440> now<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.660> that's<00:02:25.840> on<00:02:25.989> so<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.530> will<00:02:26.709> just

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
key now and that's on so that will just

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.070 
key now and that's on so that will just
literally<00:02:27.370> that's<00:02:28.330> all<00:02:28.480> that's<00:02:28.569> focused<00:02:28.989> on

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
literally that's all that's focused on

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.890 
literally that's all that's focused on
the<00:02:29.140> foreground<00:02:29.470> on<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.739> background<00:02:30.900> and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
the foreground on the background and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.670 
the foreground on the background and
that's<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:33.430> what's<00:02:33.879> the<00:02:34.030> limit<00:02:34.379> what<00:02:35.379> I'll

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
that's it so what's the limit what I'll

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.680 
that's it so what's the limit what I'll
balls<00:02:35.980> can<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.250> get<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:36.879> probably<00:02:37.390> it's<00:02:37.510> about

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
balls can you get so probably it's about

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.089 
balls can you get so probably it's about
about<00:02:39.390> 30<00:02:40.390> centimeters<00:02:40.690> maybe<00:02:41.260> two<00:02:41.530> maybe<00:02:41.980> two

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
about 30 centimeters maybe two maybe two

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.610 
about 30 centimeters maybe two maybe two
meter<00:02:42.489> you<00:02:43.150> know<00:02:43.269> for<00:02:43.720> kind<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:43.989> distance

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
meter you know for kind of distance

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.500 
meter you know for kind of distance
between<00:02:44.650> one<00:02:45.489> meter<00:02:45.670> doing<00:02:45.879> for<00:02:46.090> infinite

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
between one meter doing for infinite

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.150 
between one meter doing for infinite
value<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.200> think<00:02:47.379> that's<00:02:47.500> one<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:48.010> key

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
value so I think that's one of the key

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.210 
value so I think that's one of the key
things<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:50.560> again<00:02:50.739> we<00:02:50.830> can<00:02:50.980> leave<00:02:51.099> that

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
things so but again we can leave that

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.530 
things so but again we can leave that
running<00:02:51.400> in<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.549> background<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:52.060> if<00:02:52.269> we<00:02:52.390> want

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
running in the background and if we want

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.539 
running in the background and if we want
to<00:02:52.569> come<00:02:52.750> back<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.900> that<00:02:52.989> later<00:02:53.220> then<00:02:54.220> we<00:02:54.340> can

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
to come back to that later then we can

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.039 
to come back to that later then we can
do<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:55.090> know<00:02:55.180> simple<00:02:55.510> as<00:02:55.599> that<00:02:55.630> when<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:55.959> just

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
do you know simple as that when you just

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.750 
do you know simple as that when you just
go<00:02:56.170> straight<00:02:56.290> back<00:02:56.410> into<00:02:56.560> photos<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.370> do

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
go straight back into photos and and do

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.160 
go straight back into photos and and do
whatever<00:02:57.970> we<00:02:58.690> were<00:02:59.019> doing<00:03:00.720> ok<00:03:01.720> so<00:03:01.780> let's<00:03:02.110> look

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
whatever we were doing ok so let's look

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.559 
whatever we were doing ok so let's look
at<00:03:02.319> our<00:03:02.920> other<00:03:03.489> elements<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.269> Vice<00:03:04.390> so

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
at our other elements of the Vice so

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.100 
at our other elements of the Vice so
Simeon<00:03:05.200> three<00:03:05.380> supports<00:03:05.769> a<00:03:06.340> sort<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:06.790> a

Simeon three supports a sort of a

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.530 
Simeon three supports a sort of a
60-pound<00:03:08.110> a<00:03:08.200> second<00:03:08.500> scroller<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:10.180> can<00:03:10.360> use

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
60-pound a second scroller you can use

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.089 
60-pound a second scroller you can use
that<00:03:10.690> in<00:03:10.810> in<00:03:11.049> any<00:03:11.200> Lisp<00:03:11.560> unit<00:03:11.860> you've<00:03:11.980> got

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
that in in any Lisp unit you've got

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.580 
that in in any Lisp unit you've got
whether<00:03:12.310> we<00:03:12.489> music<00:03:13.209> player<00:03:13.420> whether<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.410> be<00:03:14.560> in

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
whether we music player whether it be in

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.970 
whether we music player whether it be in

either you've got so let's have a look

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.809 
either you've got so let's have a look
at<00:03:20.140> music<00:03:20.230> player<00:03:20.590> now<00:03:20.799> for<00:03:20.980> instance<00:03:21.310> so

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
at music player now for instance so

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.270 
at music player now for instance so
let's<00:03:21.940> open<00:03:22.030> up<00:03:22.209> music<00:03:22.540> player

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
let's open up music player

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.670 
let's open up music player
and<00:03:24.819> as<00:03:24.910> you<00:03:24.970> can<00:03:25.120> see<00:03:25.150> here<00:03:25.450> really<00:03:26.440> really

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
and as you can see here really really

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.300 
and as you can see here really really
simple<00:03:27.490> very<00:03:28.270> fast<00:03:28.510> very<00:03:28.690> fluid<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.620> because

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
simple very fast very fluid and because

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.610 
simple very fast very fluid and because
we<00:03:30.430> have<00:03:30.550> a<00:03:30.580> dedicated<00:03:30.790> GPU<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.260> dedicated

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
we have a dedicated GPU and a dedicated

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.100 
we have a dedicated GPU and a dedicated
cpu<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:33.250> that's<00:03:33.400> kind<00:03:33.640> of<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:34.000> base<00:03:34.690> mark<00:03:34.959> now

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
cpu and that's kind of a base mark now

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.500 
cpu and that's kind of a base mark now
with<00:03:35.140> symbian<00:03:35.500> three<00:03:35.620> so<00:03:36.610> you<00:03:37.240> know<00:03:37.330> that's

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
with symbian three so you know that's

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.730 
with symbian three so you know that's
that's<00:03:37.630> what<00:03:37.810> makes<00:03:38.020> it<00:03:38.140> fast<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.650> reliable

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
that's what makes it fast and reliable

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.070 
that's what makes it fast and reliable
so<00:03:39.580> let's<00:03:39.850> go<00:03:39.940> play<00:03:40.180> some<00:03:40.209> songs<00:03:40.750> will<00:03:40.930> just

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
so let's go play some songs will just

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.900 
so let's go play some songs will just
shuffle<00:03:41.319> them<00:03:41.410> all<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:42.459> it's<00:03:42.610> not<00:03:42.700> my

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
shuffle them all so it's not my

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.699 
shuffle them all so it's not my
deliberate<00:03:43.300> music<00:03:43.930> taste<00:03:44.140> it<00:03:44.260> goes<00:03:44.410> on<00:03:44.530> here

but you know cut the music off but but

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.019 
but you know cut the music off but but
you<00:05:46.930> know<00:05:47.020> a<00:05:47.259> megapixel<00:05:47.949> 720p<00:05:48.699> let's<00:05:48.879> show<00:05:49.000> you

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:49.029 
you know a megapixel 720p let's show you

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:50.909 
you know a megapixel 720p let's show you
some<00:05:49.210> video<00:05:49.419> recording<00:05:49.900> or<00:05:50.500> some<00:05:50.710> video

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
some video recording or some video

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.260 
some video recording or some video
playback<00:05:51.219> on<00:05:51.490> the<00:05:51.580> device<00:05:51.789> but<00:05:51.969> I<00:05:52.000> think<00:05:52.180> that

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
playback on the device but I think that

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:59.170 
playback on the device but I think that
looks<00:05:52.449> stunning<00:05:52.750> as<00:05:52.840> well

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:07.210 

so<00:05:59.810> this<00:05:59.960> is<00:06:00.110> a<00:06:00.139> 720p<00:06:00.680> trailer

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.090 

so<00:06:07.850> using<00:06:08.120> Yammer<00:06:08.270> AMOLED<00:06:08.780> technology<00:06:09.010> so<00:06:10.010> it

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
so using Yammer AMOLED technology so it

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.270 
so using Yammer AMOLED technology so it
says<00:06:10.220> 3.5<00:06:10.520> inch<00:06:11.030> capacitive<00:06:11.180> display<00:06:12.130> we<00:06:13.130> just

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
says 3.5 inch capacitive display we just

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.680 
says 3.5 inch capacitive display we just
have<00:06:13.400> big<00:06:13.580> feedback<00:06:13.970> as<00:06:14.150> well<00:06:14.180> brilliant

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
have big feedback as well brilliant

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.150 
have big feedback as well brilliant
haptic<00:06:14.930> feedback<00:06:14.960> so<00:06:15.410> you<00:06:15.800> know<00:06:15.890> people

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
haptic feedback so you know people

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.350 
haptic feedback so you know people
aren't<00:06:16.280> sure<00:06:16.490> about<00:06:16.610> going<00:06:16.880> from<00:06:17.000> button<00:06:17.240> to

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
aren't sure about going from button to

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.960 
aren't sure about going from button to
touch<00:06:18.020> then<00:06:18.530> we<00:06:18.950> do<00:06:19.100> a<00:06:19.130> really<00:06:19.430> great<00:06:19.610> job<00:06:19.700> of

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
touch then we do a really great job of

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.130 
touch then we do a really great job of
main<00:06:20.150> sure<00:06:20.300> they<00:06:20.450> know<00:06:20.600> when<00:06:20.750> they<00:06:20.840> touch<00:06:20.990> the

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
main sure they know when they touch the

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.040 
main sure they know when they touch the
screen<00:06:21.320> a<00:06:21.620> really<00:06:22.130> nice<00:06:22.340> vibration<00:06:22.910> we<00:06:23.900> use

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
screen a really nice vibration we use

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.040 
screen a really nice vibration we use
640<00:06:24.890> x<00:06:24.980> 360<00:06:25.550> pixels<00:06:26.000> the<00:06:26.420> same<00:06:26.630> as<00:06:26.750> we<00:06:26.840> have<00:06:26.960> on

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
640 x 360 pixels the same as we have on

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.020 
640 x 360 pixels the same as we have on
the<00:06:27.140> innate<00:06:27.350> saves<00:06:28.070> you<00:06:28.130> have<00:06:28.220> on<00:06:28.340> the<00:06:28.430> e7<00:06:28.910> and

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
the innate saves you have on the e7 and

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.150 
the innate saves you have on the e7 and
the<00:06:29.330> C<00:06:29.480> 601

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.520 

so<00:06:32.760> look<00:06:33.030> stunning<00:06:33.330> we<00:06:33.480> again<00:06:33.720> we<00:06:34.260> can<00:06:34.410> run

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
so look stunning we again we can run

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.990 
so look stunning we again we can run
that<00:06:34.650> in<00:06:34.740> the<00:06:34.800> background<00:06:35.250> and<00:06:35.430> what<00:06:35.910> will

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
that in the background and what will

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.880 
that in the background and what will
happen<00:06:36.330> is<00:06:36.540> that<00:06:36.810> it<00:06:37.260> will<00:06:37.410> just<00:06:37.590> give<00:06:37.740> you<00:06:37.770> the

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
happen is that it will just give you the

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.190 
happen is that it will just give you the
give<00:06:38.490> you<00:06:38.520> a<00:06:38.610> snapshot<00:06:38.880> or<00:06:39.450> whatever<00:06:39.930> you<00:06:40.110> were

doing last so if you about the videos
there<00:06:42.680> and<00:06:43.680> continue<00:06:44.070> the<00:06:44.280> video<00:06:44.630> it's<00:06:45.630> a

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
there and continue the video it's a

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.360 
there and continue the video it's a
really<00:06:45.900> really<00:06:46.170> quick<00:06:46.470> it's<00:06:46.890> basically<00:06:47.250> a

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
really really quick it's basically a

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.050 
really really quick it's basically a
need<00:06:48.710> well<00:06:49.710> there's<00:06:50.040> the<00:06:50.220> software<00:06:50.610> of<00:06:50.640> it<00:06:50.790> is

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
need well there's the software of it is

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.910 
need well there's the software of it is
all<00:06:51.150> very<00:06:51.360> similar<00:06:51.690> that<00:06:51.930> is<00:06:52.170> part<00:06:52.800> of<00:06:52.830> a

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:52.920 
all very similar that is part of a

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.650 
all very similar that is part of a
family<00:06:53.160> every<00:06:54.000> device<00:06:54.180> has<00:06:54.390> its<00:06:54.540> own

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
family every device has its own

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.060 
family every device has its own
individual<00:06:55.080> properties<00:06:55.440> that's<00:06:55.650> what<00:06:55.830> makes

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
individual properties that's what makes

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.370 
individual properties that's what makes
you<00:06:56.490> know<00:06:56.520> are<00:06:57.000> the<00:06:57.180> most<00:06:57.330> unique<00:06:57.690> you<00:06:58.170> know<00:06:58.200> we

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
you know are the most unique you know we

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.540 
you know are the most unique you know we
don't<00:06:58.500> believe<00:06:58.650> in<00:06:58.710> that<00:06:58.830> one<00:06:59.070> side<00:06:59.250> model

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
don't believe in that one side model

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.250 
don't believe in that one side model
fits<00:06:59.700> all<00:06:59.850> everyone<00:07:00.570> has<00:07:00.690> a<00:07:00.720> different<00:07:00.900> need

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:01.260 
fits all everyone has a different need

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.930 
fits all everyone has a different need
so<00:07:01.620> that's<00:07:02.040> why<00:07:02.220> there's<00:07:02.370> so<00:07:02.490> many<00:07:02.550> devices

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
so that's why there's so many devices

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.080 
so that's why there's so many devices
but<00:07:03.780> you<00:07:03.930> know<00:07:04.050> a<00:07:04.080> lot<00:07:04.350> a<00:07:04.380> lot<00:07:04.560> of<00:07:04.710> the

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.090 
but you know a lot a lot of the

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.130 
but you know a lot a lot of the
familiarities<00:07:06.090> will<00:07:06.480> be<00:07:06.570> the<00:07:06.720> same<00:07:06.870> whether

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.140 
familiarities will be the same whether

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.920 
familiarities will be the same whether
it<00:07:07.290> be<00:07:07.380> from<00:07:07.860> the<00:07:08.010> n8<00:07:08.250> to<00:07:08.460> the<00:07:08.550> c6<00:07:09.060> to<00:07:09.240> the<00:07:09.360> e7

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930 
it be from the n8 to the c6 to the e7

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
it be from the n8 to the c6 to the e7
until<00:07:10.620> the<00:07:10.710> scenes<00:07:11.420> so<00:07:12.420> but<00:07:12.840> you<00:07:13.020> know<00:07:13.050> because

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:13.950 
until the scenes so but you know because

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.760 
until the scenes so but you know because
Simeon<00:07:14.340> 3<00:07:14.520> itself<00:07:14.880> supports<00:07:15.210> things<00:07:15.660> like<00:07:15.930> USB

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:16.770 
Simeon 3 itself supports things like USB

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.350 
Simeon 3 itself supports things like USB
on-the-go<00:07:17.600> so<00:07:18.600> you<00:07:18.660> can<00:07:18.930> plug<00:07:19.020> in<00:07:19.170> any<00:07:19.290> USB

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 
on-the-go so you can plug in any USB

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.740 
on-the-go so you can plug in any USB
flash<00:07:21.360> drive<00:07:21.660> to<00:07:21.930> the<00:07:22.260> to<00:07:22.500> the<00:07:22.530> c7<00:07:23.330> the<00:07:24.330> cable

flash drive to the to the c7 the cable

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.450 
flash drive to the to the c7 the cable
probably<00:07:24.990> won't<00:07:25.110> be<00:07:25.170> in<00:07:25.260> the<00:07:25.290> box<00:07:25.530> but<00:07:26.010> it<00:07:26.070> is

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 
probably won't be in the box but it is
