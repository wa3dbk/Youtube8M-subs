00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:08.560
 Nerja 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:11.140
 So when I hit the spoon and hit the beat, the girl stops doing such an enormous story 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:16.360
 A person is a genius. 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:20.500
 That's why it's incredibly difficult for me to eat it with music. 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.550
 And I can do any band, but then again how much Would you like 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:28.359
 Called 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:30.890
 9 minutes thinking framework makes sense Oh yeah Well, then I have to look at what happens with 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.940
 To 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:40.160
 This is a shameful example 2 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:43.750
 I am embarrassed at the entrance, but yes, the place where the friend is talking 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.750
 I'm talking about a friend like this. 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.230
 I can not help but have to pay for my help. 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:57.079
 If any, but I am in a hurt mind 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:01:02.390
 I Have to say that that is where ah geureongeo For example, it makes no sense now 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:07.550
 I've been to church, and I've never been taught so. 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:11.869
 I ahahak from own this is my bitch and I tell Central Asia 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:15.740
 I'll keep pushed me based on me Oh, just what money already, but this also 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:22.610
 Can I make it so much I thought it 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:25.670
 Baseball, then shocked the world wrong so what are you hungry to rock 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.860
 No, I do not. 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:35.960
 So I looked Why do you think that will do so again in the amount of time just to society 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:39.740
 You know what you've learned . Yeah, there's been a sudden change in society . 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:44.539
 The speed at which the world changed was so fast that I could not predict the amount 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.659
 People have made this mistake and that's what happened these days. 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:54.590
 We have to predict how it will change in the future . 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:56.350
 It means that you think would have learned to live within that range Alas you need to know 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.920
 Will 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:05.310
 Uh, yeah, I gotta get rid of it . 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.310
 But uh film's happened to college 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:15.310
 Those who do not have such knowledge as me are almost more foolish 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:18.430
 Ah yes it is a very window thinking that society is wrong 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:23.050
 Oh, then it's not like that. 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:27.760
 Yeah. Well , you know, it's not based on what you know. 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:32.890
 This is a dialogue with friends who are adults. 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.700
 And the like have little hangeotyigo put in and the head of the lyrics and who want to have 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.459
 I did not. 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:43.610
 There was no such thing . 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:47.269
 It was nice to have just been in Seoul , 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:53.060
 o It's a reversal. 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:58.099
 In fact when we are in university 1 2 grade, our case is actually talking about jiggling resistance 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:03.349
 And there remains a lot more vigor enough to fit a previous bunwiga 80s 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:07.489
 So one time, the resistance did not do much to me, 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:12.349
 Do not drink too much. 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:16.970
 Oh, and drinking a lot with each other was tuned to the 4 opinions Alas for example, 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:21.470
 Film about fishing in those figures yet because I have sim 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:26.930
 When the day to Southeast Asia sleeping in the house, so the sea is now the university is 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.099
 Check ahkkan sorry while not tell thee so ANYTHING to Web actions 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.909
 Eat it. 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:36.010
 And then the next day , just after work at home again. 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.010
 I was out of bed and lodging. 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:46.069
 bp very love i direct 2 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.319
 I dreamed that I would go for a dÃ©partement, 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:53.870
 Do you thing that the band no less 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:56.540
 Despite this idea, there is no musical activity during the first and second grade 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:01.669
 So I'm going to be right because that gangssaem 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:05.620
 It's time to get to know the dimension. 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:11.200
 That's when I saw a sense of crisis . 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.950
 I can not get to the band and I can not get to work 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.030
 I will. 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.840
 This is what I think. But there are no kids who can play and have no wives. 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.240
 4 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:24.100
 So it was twenty two trillion people own birds among winter juniors doing gyaene 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.729
 Seven years since I heard it. 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.360
 Yes 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.360
 4 cases 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.110
 Then again, just as the Scion did with the Mimi Sisters 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.110
 Ah 

00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:42.860
 That'm the younger seedlings are inde one year and then like gyaene tripping sheet 

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:48.110
 Give this to the floor. 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:50.749
 Yes Yes Yes Ringer real production times do you hear to see why the very idea 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.649
 Maybe year-round, but yeah. 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:58.909
 If it ever gets real fun when the shaft 20 Example 3 

00:04:54.649 --> 00:05:01.629
