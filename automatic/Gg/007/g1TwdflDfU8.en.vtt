 Your itinerary

 a healthy aquarium for your fish thanks

 favors the colonization of the filter the 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.720
 natural biotope of fish should be 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.550
 created before their introduction into 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.989
 aquarium 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.600
 but this step can last several 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.970
 weeks 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.430
 with these start you immediately create 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.710
 a biological environment is 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.380
 perfectly adapted to the needs of your 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.360
 fish without biological filtration 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.009
 nitrite and ammonia contents 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.539
 of your new aquarium can 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.800
 quickly put your fish in danger 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.539
 the ammonia level reaches as early as 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.869
 first weeks of toxic sales 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.869
 for fish 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.300
 ammonia that turns into 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.580
 nitrites after two to three 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.229
 weeks can also reach 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.170
 harmful values for the health of 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.179
 fish will help you these reduced start 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.350
 significantly ammonia levels and 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.720
 toxic nitrites 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.330
 throughout the impoundment phase of 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.700
 your aquarium 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.620
 the bacteria contained in these start 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.200
 converts toxic ammonia into 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.900
 nitrites and then nitrates which are then 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.180
 harmless for fish 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.720
 a research institute confirm these 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.450
 results 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.400
 we add in cev start the rates 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.140
 of ammonia and nitrite its contents 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.140
 tolerable thresholds for fish 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.540
 your goal is reached an aquarium

 of the zot cycle in a very short time 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.880
 you get a healthy environment 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.620
 essential to the well-being of fish 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.410
 we advise you to use the one 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.140
 start after cleaning the filter when 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.209
 from the introduction of new fish to 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.740
 every bone change and after all 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:30.250
