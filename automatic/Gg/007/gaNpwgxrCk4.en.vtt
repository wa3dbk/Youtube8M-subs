00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello guys and girls I'm rob and here 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.839
 I am back with you and 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.849
 welcome to a new video of gta 5 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.269
 online and today guys is not about a 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.670
 trick of money or mercy and nothing 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.410
 I just come to tell you one thing 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.840
 pretty important for a couple of things 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.300
 quite important that I need I want 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.760
 that everyone is aware of it so 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.560
 let's go there guys how have you 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.480
 realized and if not good then I already 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.949
 I am now counting the tricks of money 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.619
 or the tricks in general 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.110
 they are currently lasting a few hours a 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.450
 day two days as much is worth arrived at 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.200
 know tricks that have lasted hours worth 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.510
 hours is more one of rpp we're going that neither 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.420
 I could not even record, we can not even 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.550
 I can not even use it, it came out 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.890
 three or four hours before I 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.510
 try and the trick was already patched 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.059
 ok because these things are happening 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.770
 the truth is something that we were not 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.899
 previously used it seems that 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.300
 rockstar is getting the batteries with 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.440
 this topic of patching the tricks and so on 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.809
 we will see in the next update 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.990
 that we hope will come out soon if they continue 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.430
 if they continue like this we go with this dynamic 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.020
 and what is happening guys what 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.880
 is what is happening by the seen the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.450
 rockstar people are getting into 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.210
 moderators in public sessions 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.610
 this entails a problem and that is 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.619
 if they see you now doing the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.890
 tricks in public sessions and so on 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.960
 Etcetera, I was running the risk 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.970
 okay, this is a rumor 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.820
 quite pretty spread out along 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.119
 of the internet because there have been enough 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.830
 cases of going from people who do not have 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.020
 Rare knicks or nicks that have something 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.119
 referring to rockstar or anything 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.670
 for style not then I recommend you 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.649
 one thing from here and from now on 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.090
 agreement and is that most of the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.770
 tricks most of the area tricks 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.299
 tricks that obviously do not have 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.130
 sense to make private elections not 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.539
 for example the tricks these so 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.369
 uncles et cetera et cetera 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.840
 Well man you need people from 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.520
 public games to be able to throw a 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.140
 little bit and so you can get a little 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.909
 from me gal to the trick but I want to warn 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.439
 is that most of the tricks that 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.479
 especially the ones that I bring in 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.340
 the channel or value or are what they say 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.540
 otherwise they can not be done in 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.790
 private games ie for feet 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.670
 in which you have to add in them to 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.109
 through an invitation then it is what 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.150
 that I recommend you to start 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.799
 from now on at least until the thing 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.310
 it calmed down a bit it normalized a 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.019
 little because if you put massively that 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.519
 I got to see him in some games that 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.590
 I play with members of the crew 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.840
 I meet 5 or 6 people doing 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.970
 tricks in public games worth 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.620
 completely public games doing 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.049
 infinite money tricks and so on 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.599
 etcetera in which you run the danger of 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.459
 that some member of rockstar some 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.319
 rockstar moderator or you are 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.670
 patch the trick and no longer just so that the 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.439
 trick but cause patch to you the 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.389
 face directly you goal a ban of 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.939
 a week of a month or whatever it is not 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:57.340
 then the whole theme of the patch or of 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.870
 tricks that I insist and I apologize already 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.919
 says not all the videos I apologize for 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.329
 the air 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.950
 many times you come to the tricks you have 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.810
 patched if it's really not my fault I 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.970
 I upload them as soon as I do them I recorded them 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.939
 the immediately rises slow in average 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.439
 they are uploaded so I tell you 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.419
 that the tricks try to make them in 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.639
 private games bars in sessions 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:18.519
 private without stress help from a friend 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.930
 because you believe it, others invited him and so 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.370
 you do not have any river 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.079
 these panels agree and so 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.430
 We contribute to the tricks to last a 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.959
 little bit more because rockstar people 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.299
 It will take a little longer to find 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.379
 the trick and in patching the graphics this 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.849
 It has been everything I hope you liked it 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.200
 the video if so, voting please 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.760
 share it with your friends because 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.980
 is something very important is something very 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.079
 important that we want let's all 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.450
 We want no one to leave us in 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.159
 agreement so I insist the tricks 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.750
 try to make them in private games 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.609
 so that it has not spoiled the ravings 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.530
 and so I hope you liked it 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.150
 as I say share it subscribe one 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.430
 to not lose any more and more videos of 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.430
 200 videos goodbye guys
