 rar 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:17.560
 The sensor is equipped with a triple sensor that has evolved into a stylish design 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:19.680
 We will introduce Casio's Protolek prw 3000 series . 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:26.930
 Let's 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.930
 We adopt beautiful and easy-to-see LCD display which is particular in lyric while compact size 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:34.860
 An icon for each mode is displayed at 12 o'clock, making it easy to use 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.860
 I will 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:45.710
 Design and lightness are realized by adopting a lightweight aluminum material for the bezel part 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:54.460
 Proto Lec boasts a huge popularity especially in the outdoor scene equipped with a triple sensor 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:04.920
 It is possible to read the change of nature with three sensors of azimuthal pressure altitude and temperature 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.560
 With the prw 3000 series , measurement is possible with simple operation. 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.250
 The right side of this is the operation button 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.250
 From above 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.020
 Orientation measurement 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.340
 Heat temperature measurement 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.610
 And 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.590
 Hardness measurement and 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.590
 Measurement is possible with one push 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.720
 This professional topic has further evolved its Triple Sensor 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:52.230
 In hardness measurement , the measurement interval is reduced from 5 seconds to 1 second 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.230
 I want to measure but it has improved from 5 meters to 1m 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.710
 Continuous measurement time extended from 20 seconds to 60 seconds for azimuth measurement 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:09.020
 Furthermore, in the pressure measurement, it is reported that the sudden change in pressure is notified by an alarm. 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.100
 as soon as you can 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:17.910
 Longer 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:20.420
 And it is possible to accurately penetrate the change of the great nature by being able to measure more accurately 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.420
 I can do it 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:33.000
 And to Protolek radio clock function 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:33.000
 It is equipped with multi band 6 which receives electric wave of six stations in the world and corrects time automatically 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.630
 You can use it safely overseas 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:47.160
 Also equipped with a solar panel 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:52.050
 Moreover, Casio can change to registration even with weak light such as fluorescent light 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:59.460
 Tough solar with almost no battery replacement 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:03.900
 Furthermore, it is easy to see in the dark place in addition to the waterproof specification of 10 atmosphere pressure relief even if health deteriorates 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:09.930
 We are equipped with two white led lights 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.160
 Casio Protolec prw 3000 is easier to use and more compact 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.050
 series 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.050
 We will by all means please consider you for this opportunity
