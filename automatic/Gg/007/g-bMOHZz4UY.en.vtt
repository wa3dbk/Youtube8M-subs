00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.170
 good afternoon dear readers today i 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.960
 I want to show you a very quick breakfast 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.930
 we have two eggs available two pieces of cheese 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.090
 and just a little oil sprinkle it 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.490
 on the pan griddle us 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.810
 ceramic coating in this way 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.160
 I beat the eggs completely without a mixer 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.050
 simple screw 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.900
 I do not try to mass 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.750
 uniform sticking to that dream 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:41.109
 well placed here i have salt 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:46.399
 a little bit of salt still 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:49.489
 mix and we have a frying pan already 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:54.499
 warmed up and just pouring on 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:57.050
 pan seek to it 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:01:02.269
 spread evenly throughout 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:06.710
 the pan so that the pancake was bigger on 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:10.030
 midway I put north immediately between 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.030
 Qubdar 100 will start to cling 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.150
 mean we were a red-hot egg 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.040
 the pan we have power on nine 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.480
 worth and the middle put the pieces of cheese 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.180
 the button began to grab well 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.180
 we wrap it in an envelope 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.540
 waiting for you to the bottom she is preparing 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.330
 bake 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.610
 and flip it that way and cheese 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.610
 a little bit of melted egg is reflected 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.570
 This is how we got an envelope than 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.430
 I like this turn to that 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.260
 they can just be so simple 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.770
 way with not experienced years you need a little bit 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:30.250
 touch up decorate with vegetables and give it 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:31.870
 we go or need for breakfast than not 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.000
 like this dish and so what it is 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.250
 getting ready fast it's based on 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.840
 protein component so you will 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.000
 from this until dinner 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.180
 well and melted cheese is very 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.880
 Artist and children and all adults who 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.890
 just did not ask here is very good 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.420
 breakfast fast when you don't leave for 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.420
 work can be done quickly
