00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.199 
yards out of range so this Ridge you
know<00:02:25.620> every<00:02:25.920> single<00:02:26.130> trail<00:02:26.519> up<00:02:26.730> here's<00:02:26.970> into

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
know every single trail up here's into

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.990 
know every single trail up here's into
that<00:02:27.420> wolf<00:02:27.630> trail<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.260> mean<00:02:28.560> we're<00:02:29.430> all<00:02:29.549> over<00:02:29.850> up

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
that wolf trail I mean we're all over up

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.850 
that wolf trail I mean we're all over up
and<00:02:30.150> down<00:02:30.329> each<00:02:30.540> finger<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.230> back<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.590> forth

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
and down each finger and back and forth

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.289 
and down each finger and back and forth
so<00:02:32.360> it's<00:02:33.360> no<00:02:33.690> -<00:02:33.750> days<00:02:34.350> ago<00:02:34.709> which<00:02:35.640> means<00:02:35.940> all

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
so it's no - days ago which means all

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.849 
so it's no - days ago which means all
these<00:02:36.510> tracks<00:02:36.900> have<00:02:37.109> been<00:02:37.140> over<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.470> last<00:02:37.590> two

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
these tracks have been over the last two

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.819 
these tracks have been over the last two
days<00:02:38.480> most<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.660> them<00:02:39.780> are<00:02:39.930> from<00:02:40.109> this<00:02:40.320> morning

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
days most of them are from this morning

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.110 
days most of them are from this morning

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.979 
so I also found a spot where they had
two<00:02:45.930> wolves<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.410> chase<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.950> lion<00:02:47.190> around

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
saddles come in a jump-off point so I

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.610
