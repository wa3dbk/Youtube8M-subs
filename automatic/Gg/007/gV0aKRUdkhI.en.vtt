00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:06.020
 so that can be seamless about this and indeed from this Gerwien to the 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.099
 beautiful surfaces curtains Lehmann can also make large areas 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.749
 Afterwards Russia is so beautiful, so he does not even see it here 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.919
 but this is a wood tissue here Vienna such a very interesting natural 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.550
 component 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.179
 Of course there so if he wants to get into nature in the house is 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.869
 of course, lots of nice story right 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.499
 but then here 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:32.790
 Sweeteners 7 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.940
 Here we have only five of an artist Anna Flowers 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.480
 that is also very interesting 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.250
 you can loosen up the surfaces with it it does not always have everything his wife 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.720
 should nine chimneys in front of the game you can ditch with different transparency 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.720
 play up to pumping off and fabrics 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.710
 they have to give you all the product 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.140
 whatever you can use 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.600
 for example 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.940
 why train a space opium poppy area to separate something into it 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.230
 Middle Dr 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.430
 really busy citizens arrive directly to the citizens 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.740
 has several tracks and 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.210
 which can then be relatively close together depending of course 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.630
 prepare the fabric we have 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.150
 how to do so 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.270
 three pieces of death 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.740
 it depends on the further on that one can not say so it seems 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.579
 two runs 5 three runs four runs me and five runs is one can then 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.229
 Only two years later, you will be finished or you can start 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.920
 again, it seemed like one after the other but if that was the most sensible 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.150
 then you should no more living space 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.440
 yes that's right then you should start sometime with the panel 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.200
 to play wide and here we have the advantage because we have this 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.540
 very nicely made to measure 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.780
 that means we are not dependent on it 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.470
 this usual 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.310
 default 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.520
 Dimensions of other panels 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.980
 so for really really very large areas with few games 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.910
 To lease the 3 can if a train should normally be 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.039
 so indoors you can spread a train up to a meter eighty 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.510
 whether that necessarily always meaningfully used 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.330
 I dare to doubt but bad luck is not feasible that will of course also 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.349
 not see yet 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.129
 complicated because in which he is in clubs right then of course after 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.879
 Yield reduction so be the kids said that you just can not 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.439
 does not work much together anymore 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.860
 again and again thought 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.860
 which I like very much that he has this variant here 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.519
 So here comes movement when the game comes in, so it's back in sight 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.619
 the seventies 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:40.759
 the green back of course that is a certain transparency the 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:45.149
 we have here one can play with it that relaxes the whole thing very high 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:46.779
 I have a 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:50.060
 especially never a bit of privacy protection 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.430
 a conclusion of a room but still the big distance behind because 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.810
 I just by groups so the vocal as a women's trainer in the ring 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.950
 Seven-series the a4 was then really gone through a few times 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.489
 can 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.430
 that's the beautiful that must be right 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.840
 his beautiful stories too 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.319
 if she looks different green now maybe love 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.319
 It's really every spectator that sees the greens 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:12.969
 just by it 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.969
 Of course the light is different 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.569
 reflected differently
