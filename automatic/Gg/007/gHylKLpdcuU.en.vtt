invitations to give out so that's how
it's<00:01:31.140> been<00:01:31.229> spreading<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.100> find<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.299> ello<00:01:34.009> and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
it's been spreading I find that ello and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.100 
it's been spreading I find that ello and
I<00:01:35.189> think<00:01:35.490> might<00:01:35.729> actually<00:01:36.000> take<00:01:36.540> off<00:01:36.780> even

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
I think might actually take off even

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.710 
I think might actually take off even
further<00:01:37.650> as<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.579> grows<00:01:38.850> much<00:01:39.180> more<00:01:39.479> quickly

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
further as it grows much more quickly

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.499 
further as it grows much more quickly
because<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:41.040> does<00:01:41.310> something<00:01:41.729> different<00:01:41.909> it

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
because it does something different it

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.330 
because it does something different it
allows<00:01:42.840> people<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.290> communicate<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.310> way

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
allows people to communicate in a way

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.030 
allows people to communicate in a way
without<00:01:44.610> advertising<00:01:45.470> some<00:01:46.470> people<00:01:46.799> call<00:01:46.979> it

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
without advertising some people call it

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.580 
without advertising some people call it
a<00:01:47.189> Facebook<00:01:47.700> killer<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.450> disagree<00:01:48.869> with<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.200> I

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
a Facebook killer I disagree with that I

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.760 
a Facebook killer I disagree with that I

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
big difference so if there's one chapter

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.940 
big difference so if there's one chapter
chapter<00:04:41.580> 14<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.300> I<00:04:42.660> underlined<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.560> so

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
chapter 14 and I underlined it so

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
more abstract terms so what does that

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.070 
more abstract terms so what does that
mean<00:05:02.100> for<00:05:02.640> example<00:05:02.700> if<00:05:03.300> you<00:05:03.420> were<00:05:03.480> to<00:05:03.600> ask<00:05:03.630> your
