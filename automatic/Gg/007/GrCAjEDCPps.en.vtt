making this classroom I use as a shotgun
I<00:00:11.019> could<00:00:11.230> not<00:00:11.440> decide<00:00:11.769> what<00:00:12.070> my<00:00:12.190> first<00:00:12.490> or

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790 
I could not decide what my first or

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.030 
I could not decide what my first or
second<00:00:13.179> part<00:00:13.389> should<00:00:13.629> be<00:00:13.660> so<00:00:14.320> I<00:00:14.379> decided<00:00:14.740> well

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.040 
second part should be so I decided well

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.920 
second part should be so I decided well
okay<00:00:15.400> then<00:00:15.610> I'll<00:00:15.820> just<00:00:16.090> take<00:00:16.330> overkill<00:00:16.900> and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
okay then I'll just take overkill and

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.589 
okay then I'll just take overkill and
slide<00:00:17.650> up<00:00:17.770> and<00:00:17.919> throw<00:00:18.189> I'm<00:00:19.000> going<00:00:19.180> to<00:00:19.240> throw<00:00:19.480> my

get an idea what's going on in the other
side<00:00:22.930> of<00:00:22.989> the<00:00:23.079> point<00:00:23.259> and<00:00:23.380> then<00:00:23.529> in<00:00:23.680> charge

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
side of the point and then in charge

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.830 
side of the point and then in charge
past<00:00:24.309> keep<00:00:24.880> them<00:00:25.090> from<00:00:25.239> even<00:00:25.599> getting<00:00:25.809> close

to the point not with them even bother
my<00:00:28.390> teammates<00:00:28.750> we're<00:00:28.960> gonna<00:00:29.050> cap<00:00:29.290> before<00:00:29.529> me

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
my teammates we're gonna cap before me

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.729 
my teammates we're gonna cap before me
and<00:00:30.070> you<00:00:30.520> know<00:00:30.640> I<00:00:30.669> pick<00:00:30.969> up<00:00:31.119> a<00:00:31.210> couple<00:00:31.390> kills

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
and you know I pick up a couple kills

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.619 
and you know I pick up a couple kills
occasional<00:00:32.739> quad<00:00:32.950> not<00:00:33.760> doing<00:00:34.000> too<00:00:34.149> bad<00:00:34.329> myself

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
occasional quad not doing too bad myself

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.290 
occasional quad not doing too bad myself
here<00:00:34.989> anyway<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:35.980> reason<00:00:36.280> for<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.490> mp7<00:00:36.760> is

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
here anyway the reason for the mp7 is

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.410 
here anyway the reason for the mp7 is
that<00:00:38.050> like<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:39.190> use<00:00:39.460> a<00:00:39.610> shotgun<00:00:39.940> I<00:00:40.210> don't

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
that like the use a shotgun I don't

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.240 
that like the use a shotgun I don't
really<00:00:40.570> know<00:00:40.780> what<00:00:40.990> first<00:00:41.290> or<00:00:41.470> second<00:00:41.890> part<00:00:42.070> I

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
really know what first or second part I

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.710 
really know what first or second part I
want<00:00:42.579> to<00:00:42.670> run<00:00:42.910> on<00:00:43.000> the<00:00:43.060> gun<00:00:43.180> I<00:00:43.240> don't<00:00:43.390> feel<00:00:43.600> like

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
want to run on the gun I don't feel like

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.990 
want to run on the gun I don't feel like
I<00:00:43.840> need<00:00:44.110> to<00:00:44.140> run<00:00:44.380> anything<00:00:44.829> a<00:00:45.010> big<00:00:45.610> one<00:00:45.820> there

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
I need to run anything a big one there

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.090 
I need to run anything a big one there
is<00:00:46.210> that<00:00:46.780> like<00:00:46.960> submachine<00:00:47.620> guns<00:00:47.829> it<00:00:47.950> has<00:00:48.070> a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
is that like submachine guns it has a

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.490 
is that like submachine guns it has a
fast<00:00:48.660> aim-down-sights<00:00:49.660> time<00:00:49.960> so<00:00:50.200> I<00:00:50.230> don't

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
fast aim-down-sights time so I don't

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.550 
fast aim-down-sights time so I don't
feel<00:00:50.770> like<00:00:50.950> I<00:00:51.130> really<00:00:51.610> need<00:00:51.970> quick-draw<00:00:52.810> to

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
feel like I really need quick-draw to

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.220 
feel like I really need quick-draw to
give<00:00:53.800> me<00:00:53.890> an<00:00:54.010> advantage<00:00:54.430> there<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.840> it's<00:00:56.110> a

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
give me an advantage there so it's a

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.260 
give me an advantage there so it's a
good<00:00:56.440> compliment<00:00:57.070> especially<00:00:57.239> as<00:00:58.239> a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
good compliment especially as a

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.090 
good compliment especially as a
submission<00:00:58.600> with<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:59.050> lot<00:00:59.200> of<00:00:59.230> range<00:00:59.590> to<00:00:59.860> the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
submission with a lot of range to the

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.010 
submission with a lot of range to the
close-range<00:01:00.730> capabilities<00:01:01.300> of<00:01:01.480> my<00:01:01.630> use<00:01:01.810> at

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
close-range capabilities of my use at

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.810 
close-range capabilities of my use at
shotgun<00:01:02.500> I<00:01:02.620> think<00:01:02.829> I'm<00:01:02.920> even<00:01:03.070> running<00:01:03.309> a<00:01:03.520> range

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
shotgun I think I'm even running a range

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.440 
shotgun I think I'm even running a range
on<00:01:04.149> my<00:01:04.750> mp7<00:01:05.320> here<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:06.490> we've<00:01:06.850> got<00:01:06.880> extended

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
on my mp7 here and we've got extended

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.330 
on my mp7 here and we've got extended
mags<00:01:07.630> on<00:01:07.869> it<00:01:08.020> so<00:01:08.380> going<00:01:08.619> loud<00:01:08.889> all<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.219> way

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
mags on it so going loud all the way

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.800 
mags on it so going loud all the way
although<00:01:09.579> it<00:01:09.729> really<00:01:10.210> doesn't<00:01:10.569> matter<00:01:10.719> a

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
although it really doesn't matter a

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.770 
although it really doesn't matter a
whole<00:01:10.869> lot<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.439> just<00:01:12.329> remembering<00:01:13.329> to<00:01:13.509> swap

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
whole lot and just remembering to swap

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.389 
whole lot and just remembering to swap
between<00:01:13.899> the<00:01:14.319> weapons<00:01:14.619> and<00:01:14.829> have<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.130> best

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
between the weapons and have the best

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.029 
between the weapons and have the best
one<00:01:15.639> for<00:01:15.819> any<00:01:15.999> given<00:01:16.329> situation<00:01:16.569> I<00:01:17.170> do<00:01:17.590> tend<00:01:18.009> to

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
one for any given situation I do tend to

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:19.559 
one for any given situation I do tend to
favor<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.460> shotgun<00:01:18.880> on<00:01:18.969> this<00:01:19.090> class<00:01:19.299> I<00:01:19.479> do

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
favor the shotgun on this class I do

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:21.629 
favor the shotgun on this class I do
think<00:01:19.959> of<00:01:20.079> it<00:01:20.170> as<00:01:20.319> a<00:01:20.350> shotgun<00:01:20.829> class<00:01:21.159> just<00:01:21.490> with

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:21.639 
think of it as a shotgun class just with

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:24.480 
think of it as a shotgun class just with
some<00:01:21.819> really<00:01:22.479> good<00:01:22.859> long-range<00:01:23.859> backup<00:01:24.310> as<00:01:24.459> a

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
some really good long-range backup as a

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.219 
some really good long-range backup as a
secondary<00:01:24.909> weapon<00:01:25.119> I<00:01:25.359> mean<00:01:25.539> don't<00:01:26.079> get<00:01:26.170> me

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
secondary weapon I mean don't get me

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.010 
secondary weapon I mean don't get me
wrong<00:01:26.319> the<00:01:26.590> mp9<00:01:26.920> is<00:01:27.280> great<00:01:27.700> but<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.240> mp7<00:01:28.539> is

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
wrong the mp9 is great but the mp7 is

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.800 
wrong the mp9 is great but the mp7 is
just<00:01:29.740> a<00:01:29.829> little<00:01:30.069> bit<00:01:30.189> better<00:01:30.569> the<00:01:31.569> other

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
just a little bit better the other

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.539 
just a little bit better the other
reason<00:01:32.200> for<00:01:32.229> having<00:01:32.469> that<00:01:32.709> shotgun<00:01:32.950> primary

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
reason for having that shotgun primary

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.669 
reason for having that shotgun primary
is<00:01:33.729> because<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.270> USS<00:01:34.630> gives<00:01:35.139> you<00:01:35.259> a<00:01:35.289> little

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
is because the USS gives you a little

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.289 
is because the USS gives you a little
bit<00:01:35.799> of<00:01:35.950> extra<00:01:36.159> sprint<00:01:36.549> distance<00:01:36.700> something

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
bit of extra sprint distance something

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.819 
bit of extra sprint distance something
you<00:01:37.450> know<00:01:37.539> not<00:01:37.689> bad<00:01:37.869> to<00:01:38.020> start<00:01:38.259> out<00:01:38.469> with<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:38.740> at

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
you know not bad to start out with it at

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.789 
you know not bad to start out with it at
first<00:01:39.359> so<00:01:40.359> I'm<00:01:40.479> doing<00:01:40.630> my<00:01:40.779> fairly<00:01:41.380> normal

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
first so I'm doing my fairly normal

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.399 
first so I'm doing my fairly normal
highly<00:01:42.520> mobile<00:01:42.909> defensive<00:01:43.569> strategy<00:01:44.229> and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
highly mobile defensive strategy and

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.160 
highly mobile defensive strategy and
very<00:01:44.679> similar<00:01:45.039> to<00:01:45.219> the<00:01:45.340> pm7<00:01:46.240> video<00:01:46.630> I<00:01:46.689> posted

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
very similar to the pm7 video I posted

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.849 
very similar to the pm7 video I posted
then<00:01:47.889> this<00:01:48.130> happens<00:01:48.579> and<00:01:49.450> are<00:01:49.959> you<00:01:50.139> serious<00:01:50.679> i

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
then this happens and are you serious i

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.690 
then this happens and are you serious i
I<00:01:51.520> had<00:01:51.939> to<00:01:52.090> go<00:01:52.209> back<00:01:52.359> and<00:01:52.420> watch<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:53.049> again<00:01:53.700> one

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
I had to go back and watch it again one

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.080 
I had to go back and watch it again one
last<00:01:55.479> stand<00:01:55.929> -<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:56.679> should<00:01:56.889> be<00:01:57.039> dead<00:01:57.279> and<00:01:57.520> I

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
last stand - you should be dead and I

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.699 
last stand - you should be dead and I
obviously<00:01:58.270> I<00:01:58.630> have<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.840> turn<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.349> shoot<00:01:59.560> the

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
obviously I have to turn and shoot the

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.459 
obviously I have to turn and shoot the
second<00:02:00.039> target<00:02:00.249> because<00:02:00.759> I<00:02:01.060> kept<00:02:01.749> there<00:02:02.349> he's

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
second target because I kept there he's

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.109 
second target because I kept there he's
going<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.679> get<00:02:02.770> shots<00:02:03.069> on<00:02:03.219> me<00:02:03.249> too<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.700> so<00:02:03.909> I

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
going to get shots on me too and so I

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.599 
going to get shots on me too and so I
don't<00:02:04.990> know<00:02:05.139> what<00:02:05.409> happened<00:02:05.770> here<00:02:05.979> if<00:02:06.249> you<00:02:06.459> can

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
don't know what happened here if you can

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.940 
don't know what happened here if you can
explain<00:02:06.969> that<00:02:07.149> please<00:02:07.840> tell<00:02:08.200> me<00:02:08.349> because<00:02:08.500> I

explain that please tell me because I

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.350 
explain that please tell me because I
still<00:02:09.369> don't<00:02:09.429> understand<00:02:10.090> it

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
still don't understand it

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.929 
still don't understand it
now<00:02:11.260> as<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.560> did<00:02:11.620> mention<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.190> posted<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.760> video

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:12.939 
now as I did mention I posted a video

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.539 
now as I did mention I posted a video
with<00:02:13.689> a<00:02:13.720> silence<00:02:14.319> pm7<00:02:14.799> where<00:02:15.069> I<00:02:15.099> just<00:02:15.280> ran

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
with a silence pm7 where I just ran

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.410 
with a silence pm7 where I just ran
round<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:15.970> hip<00:02:16.090> fired<00:02:16.360> everything

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
round and hip fired everything

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.510 
round and hip fired everything
and<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.750> looks<00:02:17.990> great<00:02:18.380> most<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.310> time

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
and that looks great most of the time

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.160 
and that looks great most of the time
it's<00:02:19.790> got<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.000> little<00:02:20.390> bit<00:02:20.480> more<00:02:20.660> range<00:02:20.900> in<00:02:21.050> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
it's got a little bit more range in the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.350 
it's got a little bit more range in the
use<00:02:21.349> house<00:02:21.590> just<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.400> little<00:02:22.610> bit<00:02:22.730> but<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.239> has

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
use house just a little bit but it has

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.059 
use house just a little bit but it has
the<00:02:23.480> benefit<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:23.840> being<00:02:24.020> silenced<00:02:24.650> still

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
the benefit of being silenced still

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.760 
the benefit of being silenced still
there<00:02:25.730> are<00:02:25.880> some<00:02:26.090> lines<00:02:26.330> aside<00:02:26.750> here<00:02:27.050> that<00:02:27.380> if

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
there are some lines aside here that if

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.260 
there are some lines aside here that if
I<00:02:27.980> want<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.400> really<00:02:28.580> get<00:02:28.760> on<00:02:28.849> some<00:02:29.030> nice

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
I want to really get on some nice

I want to really get on some nice
flanking<00:02:29.870> routes<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.319> will<00:02:30.830> find<00:02:31.069> myself

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
flanking routes I will find myself

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.120 
flanking routes I will find myself
looking<00:02:32.239> down<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.690> I<00:02:33.080> won't<00:02:33.680> be<00:02:33.860> able<00:02:33.980> to

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
looking down and I won't be able to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.940 
looking down and I won't be able to
return<00:02:34.430> fire<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:35.060> any<00:02:35.209> practical<00:02:35.510> sense<00:02:36.020> with

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
return fire in any practical sense with

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.110 
return fire in any practical sense with
a<00:02:37.160> pm7<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.270> having<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.410> mv9<00:02:39.860> is<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.370> backup<00:02:40.819> is

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
a pm7 so having the mv9 is a backup is

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.229 
a pm7 so having the mv9 is a backup is
not<00:02:41.720> bad<00:02:42.170> but<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:42.920> mp-<00:02:43.459> would<00:02:43.940> have<00:02:44.030> run

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
not bad but the mp- would have run

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.570 
not bad but the mp- would have run
around<00:02:44.360> with<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:45.170> mp9<00:02:45.470> as<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:45.980> primary<00:02:46.430> weapon

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
around with the mp9 as a primary weapon

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.140 
around with the mp9 as a primary weapon
instead<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.750> mp7<00:02:48.050> here<00:02:48.680> packs<00:02:49.519> just<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:49.970> little

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
instead the mp7 here packs just a little

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.790 
instead the mp7 here packs just a little
bit<00:02:50.239> more<00:02:50.330> punch<00:02:50.630> at<00:02:50.870> range<00:02:51.140> a<00:02:51.260> little<00:02:51.709> bit

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
bit more punch at range a little bit

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.190 
bit more punch at range a little bit
less<00:02:51.980> recoil<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:53.269> I'm<00:02:53.450> able<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.840> go<00:02:54.050> on

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
less recoil and so I'm able to go on

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.650 
less recoil and so I'm able to go on
these<00:02:54.319> flanking<00:02:54.800> routes<00:02:55.010> like<00:02:55.310> this<00:02:55.549> one<00:02:55.819> that

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
these flanking routes like this one that

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.039 
these flanking routes like this one that
while<00:02:57.200> I'm<00:02:57.380> not<00:02:57.880> looking<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:59.299> get<00:02:59.510> long-range

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
while I'm not looking to get long-range

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.780 
while I'm not looking to get long-range
fights<00:03:00.350> sometimes<00:03:00.739> I<00:03:01.069> end<00:03:01.220> up<00:03:01.310> with<00:03:01.430> one<00:03:01.610> when

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
fights sometimes I end up with one when

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.090 
fights sometimes I end up with one when
I<00:03:01.850> run<00:03:02.120> up<00:03:02.209> this<00:03:02.330> ramp<00:03:02.569> I<00:03:02.840> need<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.709> have<00:03:03.920> the

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
I run up this ramp I need to have the

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.470 
I run up this ramp I need to have the
long-range<00:03:04.430> gun<00:03:04.670> out<00:03:04.790> because<00:03:05.030> those<00:03:05.269> guys

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
long-range gun out because those guys

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.660 
long-range gun out because those guys
that<00:03:05.600> were<00:03:05.720> there<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.950> doesn't<00:03:07.160> matter<00:03:07.340> if<00:03:07.549> it

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
that were there it doesn't matter if it

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.460 
that were there it doesn't matter if it
kill<00:03:07.880> them<00:03:08.000> or<00:03:08.120> not<00:03:08.239> I<00:03:08.510> need<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.049> make<00:03:09.200> them<00:03:09.350> get

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
kill them or not I need to make them get

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.229 
kill them or not I need to make them get
their<00:03:09.620> heads<00:03:09.860> down<00:03:10.100> so<00:03:10.340> I<00:03:10.370> can<00:03:10.700> run<00:03:10.880> around<00:03:11.000> and

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
their heads down so I can run around and

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.280 
their heads down so I can run around and
come<00:03:11.480> back<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:11.930> B<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.350> do<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:12.920> loop<00:03:13.100> again<00:03:13.280> I

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
come back to B and do the loop again I

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.870 
come back to B and do the loop again I
don't<00:03:15.290> want<00:03:15.739> to<00:03:15.830> stay<00:03:16.010> on<00:03:16.160> that<00:03:16.190> ramp<00:03:16.519> up<00:03:16.730> to

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
don't want to stay on that ramp up to

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.120 
don't want to stay on that ramp up to
Bravo<00:03:17.120> very<00:03:17.480> long<00:03:17.810> there's<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.560> temptation<00:03:18.799> to

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
Bravo very long there's a temptation to

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.280 
Bravo very long there's a temptation to
look<00:03:19.370> down<00:03:19.519> into<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.880> spot<00:03:20.299> on<00:03:20.510> alpha<00:03:21.049> and

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
look down into the spot on alpha and

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.890 
look down into the spot on alpha and
probably<00:03:22.040> move<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.820> don't<00:03:23.090> have<00:03:23.299> a<00:03:23.329> great

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
probably move it and don't have a great

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.990 
probably move it and don't have a great
long-range<00:03:24.500> gonna<00:03:24.769> fight<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.489> kills<00:03:25.760> if<00:03:25.910> I

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
long-range gonna fight the kills if I

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.710 
long-range gonna fight the kills if I
have<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.510> but<00:03:26.780> this<00:03:26.900> is<00:03:26.959> not<00:03:27.470> an<00:03:27.769> assault<00:03:28.160> rifle

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
have to but this is not an assault rifle

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.300 
have to but this is not an assault rifle
but<00:03:29.720> I<00:03:29.750> do<00:03:29.870> need<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.320> clear<00:03:30.680> them<00:03:30.829> off<00:03:31.010> that

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
but I do need to clear them off that

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.699 
but I do need to clear them off that
ramp<00:03:31.579> to<00:03:31.820> Bravo<00:03:32.290> especially<00:03:33.290> because<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:33.620> just

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
ramp to Bravo especially because it just

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.440 
ramp to Bravo especially because it just
makes<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.100> hard<00:03:34.310> for<00:03:34.459> anybody<00:03:34.730> else<00:03:35.060> wanting

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
makes it hard for anybody else wanting

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.670 
makes it hard for anybody else wanting

side of the map to avoid that long line
of<00:03:39.350> sight<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.890> keep<00:03:39.920> making<00:03:40.340> their<00:03:40.760> loop

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
obviously on the loop I just showed you

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.300 
obviously on the loop I just showed you
I<00:03:44.359> have<00:03:44.660> to<00:03:44.810> run<00:03:44.959> clockwise<00:03:45.260> because<00:03:45.799> you<00:03:45.890> kind

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
I have to run clockwise because you kind

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.979 
I have to run clockwise because you kind
of<00:03:46.340> fall<00:03:46.579> down<00:03:46.609> a<00:03:46.760> hill<00:03:47.000> but<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.480> other<00:03:47.690> side

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
of fall down a hill but the other side

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.620 
of fall down a hill but the other side
can<00:03:48.170> go<00:03:48.230> either<00:03:48.590> way<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:49.250> it's<00:03:50.150> especially

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
can go either way and it's especially

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.660 
can go either way and it's especially
beneficial<00:03:50.989> to<00:03:51.290> take<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.650> very<00:03:52.010> narrow<00:03:52.340> path

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
beneficial to take the very narrow path

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.449 
beneficial to take the very narrow path
just<00:03:53.209> above<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.930> creek<00:03:54.290> a<00:03:54.590> ravine<00:03:55.040> there<00:03:55.280> and

just above the creek a ravine there and

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.610 
just above the creek a ravine there and
you<00:03:56.000> can<00:03:56.150> loop<00:03:56.420> around<00:03:56.570> and<00:03:56.930> pick<00:03:57.140> people<00:03:57.320> off

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
you can loop around and pick people off

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.949 
you can loop around and pick people off
as<00:03:57.890> they<00:03:58.310> try<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.579> cross<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:58.910> bridge<00:03:59.329> or<00:03:59.630> go

long-range threats on this map and at

long-range threats on this map and at
this<00:04:08.840> point<00:04:09.019> I'm<00:04:09.319> going<00:04:09.440> to<00:04:09.530> have<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.489> say

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
this point I'm going to have to say

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.280 
this point I'm going to have to say
something<00:04:10.700> about<00:04:11.120> green<00:04:11.450> arrows<00:04:11.750> because<00:04:11.959> I

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
something about green arrows because I

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.199 
something about green arrows because I
can<00:04:12.799> see<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.130> two<00:04:13.280> dots<00:04:13.459> in<00:04:13.609> the<00:04:13.670> mini-map<00:04:13.970> and

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
can see the two dots in the mini-map and

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.550 
can see the two dots in the mini-map and
I<00:04:14.269> can<00:04:14.420> see<00:04:14.569> where<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.750> green<00:04:14.930> arrows<00:04:15.200> looking

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
I can see where the green arrows looking

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.529 
I can see where the green arrows looking
and<00:04:15.709> if<00:04:15.980> that<00:04:16.100> was<00:04:16.250> a<00:04:16.280> blue<00:04:16.519> arrow<00:04:16.729> I<00:04:17.000> would

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
and if that was a blue arrow I would

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.690 
and if that was a blue arrow I would
know<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:18.500> would<00:04:18.590> be<00:04:18.709> gunshots<00:04:19.130> fired<00:04:19.430> at<00:04:19.549> both

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
know it would be gunshots fired at both

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.819 
know it would be gunshots fired at both
of<00:04:19.729> these<00:04:19.940> guys<00:04:20.180> but<00:04:21.049> that<00:04:21.380> guy<00:04:21.560> is<00:04:21.620> just

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
of these guys but that guy is just

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.460 
of these guys but that guy is just
clueless<00:04:22.669> so<00:04:23.479> I<00:04:23.510> guess<00:04:23.900> that's<00:04:24.080> what<00:04:24.289> we<00:04:24.380> get

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
clueless so I guess that's what we get

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.529 
clueless so I guess that's what we get
for<00:04:24.680> having<00:04:24.889> not<00:04:25.460> enough<00:04:25.520> people<00:04:26.030> on<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.390> team

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
for having not enough people on the team

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.450 
for having not enough people on the team
to<00:04:26.690> fill<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:26.960> out<00:04:27.050> really<00:04:27.950> seriously

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
to fill it out really seriously

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.190 
to fill it out really seriously
sometimes<00:04:28.880> it<00:04:28.970> would<00:04:29.060> be<00:04:29.090> easier<00:04:29.539> if<00:04:29.810> we<00:04:29.960> could

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
sometimes it would be easier if we could

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.970 
sometimes it would be easier if we could
just<00:04:30.260> not

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
just not

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.910 
just not
have<00:04:31.100> a<00:04:31.370> sixth<00:04:31.880> player<00:04:32.090> on<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.360> team<00:04:32.920> still

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
have a sixth player on the team still

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.800 
have a sixth player on the team still
our<00:04:34.190> own<00:04:34.430> worst<00:04:34.850> enemy<00:04:35.240> on<00:04:35.360> this<00:04:35.450> map<00:04:35.630> is

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
our own worst enemy on this map is

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.140 
our own worst enemy on this map is

Charlie<00:04:38.630> they<00:04:39.530> just<00:04:39.740> aren't<00:04:39.950> aggressive

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
Charlie they just aren't aggressive

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.190 
Charlie they just aren't aggressive
enough<00:04:40.610> most<00:04:40.790> of<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:40.970> time<00:04:41.030> so<00:04:41.450> giving<00:04:42.050> them

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.130 
way I'm gonna drop my sentry gun here
that's<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.270> reason<00:04:53.450> I<00:04:53.510> have<00:04:53.570> sentries<00:04:54.020> on

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
that's the reason I have sentries on

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.040 
that's the reason I have sentries on
this<00:04:54.260> class<00:04:54.470> block<00:04:55.340> that<00:04:55.580> spawn<00:04:55.940> point<00:04:56.240> off<00:04:56.420> so

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
this class block that spawn point off so

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.990 
this class block that spawn point off so
that<00:04:57.080> they<00:04:57.320> keep<00:04:57.470> spawning<00:04:57.800> down<00:04:58.130> alpha<00:04:58.610> even

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
that they keep spawning down alpha even

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.870 
that they keep spawning down alpha even
if<00:04:59.120> we<00:04:59.360> get<00:04:59.510> a<00:04:59.540> little<00:04:59.720> dicey<00:04:59.960> on<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:00.470> spawns

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
if we get a little dicey on the spawns

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.950 
if we get a little dicey on the spawns
and<00:05:01.880> I'll<00:05:02.060> just<00:05:02.180> go<00:05:02.270> ahead<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.480> fast<00:05:02.660> for<00:05:02.870> the

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
and I'll just go ahead and fast for the

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.180 
and I'll just go ahead and fast for the
end<00:05:03.110> because<00:05:03.410> there's<00:05:03.620> really<00:05:03.740> nothing<00:05:04.070> else

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
end because there's really nothing else

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.910 
end because there's really nothing else
that<00:05:04.280> happens<00:05:04.640> this<00:05:04.760> game<00:05:05.410> but<00:05:06.410> anyway<00:05:06.800> I

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
that happens this game but anyway I

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.710 
that happens this game but anyway I
thought<00:05:07.100> this<00:05:07.250> was<00:05:07.520> a<00:05:07.550> great<00:05:08.060> example<00:05:08.240> of

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
thought this was a great example of

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.960 
thought this was a great example of
complementary<00:05:09.560> flanking<00:05:10.010> routes<00:05:10.220> to<00:05:10.730> keep

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
complementary flanking routes to keep

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.550 
complementary flanking routes to keep
enemies<00:05:11.240> off<00:05:11.570> of<00:05:11.750> some<00:05:11.900> of<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.020> longer<00:05:12.410> line

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
enemies off of some of the longer line

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.230 
enemies off of some of the longer line
decide<00:05:12.890> that<00:05:13.010> they<00:05:13.130> really<00:05:13.400> like<00:05:13.580> to<00:05:13.700> camp<00:05:14.000> and

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
decide that they really like to camp and

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.440 
decide that they really like to camp and
we<00:05:14.300> start<00:05:14.540> locking<00:05:15.020> them<00:05:15.200> in<00:05:15.350> on<00:05:15.560> alpha<00:05:16.450> into

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
we start locking them in on alpha into

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.730 
we start locking them in on alpha into
that<00:05:17.600> will<00:05:17.840> bring<00:05:17.990> us<00:05:18.110> to<00:05:18.230> the<00:05:18.320> end<00:05:18.350> of<00:05:18.590> there

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
that will bring us to the end of there

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.040 
that will bring us to the end of there
I'll<00:05:19.610> try<00:05:19.850> to<00:05:19.910> find<00:05:20.120> some<00:05:20.270> similar<00:05:20.630> examples

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
I'll try to find some similar examples

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.720 
I'll try to find some similar examples
of<00:05:21.170> complementary<00:05:21.830> rush<00:05:22.040> routes<00:05:22.280> on<00:05:22.460> other

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
of complementary rush routes on other

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.670 
of complementary rush routes on other
