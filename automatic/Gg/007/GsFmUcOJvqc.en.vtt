00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
an idea which chip it is if they could

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.040 
an idea which chip it is if they could
give<00:02:10.619> me<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.890> number<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> chip<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.690> can

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
give me the number of the chip and I can

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.710 
give me the number of the chip and I can
order<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.069> change<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.090> be<00:02:15.239> happy<00:02:15.450> so
