00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.440
 Hi, I'm here to talk and explain 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.269
 the benefits of banic dolls and in 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.400
 the development of the children's game and 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.470
 girls and what are dolls mannequin 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.900
 Well, in all those dolls that 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.850
 they allow listed an adult person 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.789
 an adult woman in this case and that 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.330
 they allow the imitation game of the world 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.580
 adult of boys and girls 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.260
 well I start explaining is a secret and 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.540
 is that I belong to that group of 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.270
 moms who did not want to buy at the time 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.600
 their daughters Barbie dolls why then 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.239
 because I looked like dolls vases 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.680
 only worried about aesthetics 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.410
 selfish in this regard and I did not want that 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.090
 those were the values ​​of my daughters without 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.040
 However, all this changed the day and a 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.170
 of them told me mom and you why not 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.940
 you want to buy a barbie doll 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.800
 What I want is to play with her as 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.770
 make my friends to pain dress her and 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.720
 store things with her 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.030
 at that moment I realized that 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.310
 really the expectations that we have 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.870
 the adults about the toys are not 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.170
 exactly the same as those 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.600
 children they incorporate those toys their 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.790
 own values the values ​​that live in 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.620
 the family and for now it does not make them 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.720
 at table the dolls in what they 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.120
 They want not be princesses 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.220
 course but they will also be pilots 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.729
 of conductive bus cars or 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.830
 adventurous the symbolic game starace 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.619
 It is a very important moment and it has to be 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.150
 very rich and it is because children drink 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.830
 of those movies that you see in 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.200
 magazines that friends and their friends read 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.320
 own experiences the broader 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.470
 be that better and richer repertoire goes to 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.210
 be what they reproduce I loved 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.530
 see my daughters play with the dolls 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.009
 barbies 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.840
 and see how they were taken to the doctor 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.210
 put in the vaccines evidently the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.280
 dolls did not want to go to turn 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.670
 our monsters in pets to which 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.040
 take a walk 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.869
 we forget many times that the game 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.670
 it is liberating the children do active 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.909
 what they live passively and the game 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.590
 this is allowed 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.679
 I'm going to explain a secret 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:15.440
 Obviously Barbie came home and 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:18.569
 it was already I know what you will be thinking 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.459
 But if this does not fit at home, it's the 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.349
 big problem of the dollhouses and 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.269
 this is not an exception but without 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.220
 But every time they think more about us 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.260
 parents and in the ease of 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.610
 save them and transport them is perhaps 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.560
 instrument that can go from your home 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.260
 to grandparents' house without any 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.030
 difficulty but they have bases of 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.799
 nice this house because a very 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.930
 important and that is precisely in 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.870
 a house the house of barbie is not a 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.519
 hotel is your house in that children house and 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.099
 girls will be able to imagine stories 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.690
 real or imaginary and they will be able to 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.579
 recreate everything they can do 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.340
 a house they will be able to invite their 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:56.430
 friends will be able to decorate the fix 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.060
 study to connect to the internet sleep 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.829
 dine eat all those aspects what 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.870
 they favor is precisely the autonomy 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.490
 of children and the responsive 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.340
 responsibility 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.200
 it's not a really fantastic way to 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.740
 educate in autonomy and responsible 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.740
 of our children 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.450
