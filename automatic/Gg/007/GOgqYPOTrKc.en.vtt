00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello tankers with you slim rival 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.900
 Today we have a review 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.469
 artillery this time it is french 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.110
 art seventh level lorraine 155 50 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.900
 Immediately I would like to say that there are expensive 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.660
 friends i know i know our favorite 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.390
 graham very large number of players 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.699
 Artu simply hate even many 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.410
 it is not a game for them at all is taboo 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.720
 but nevertheless consider that reviews on 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.759
 Art is also needed at least to 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.990
 know 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.719
 the opponent's face know what he is 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.180
 capable and if so understand it is not 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.430
 yet iraq refused to play on 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.239
 art-sau 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.840
 refuses of course on several 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.800
 reasons one of them is boring and 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.410
 tedious gameplay 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.969
 because essentially the whole fight we press 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.969
 just one button to shoot 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.000
 the second reason is that artillery 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.010
 such an ambiguous class of technique and in 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.109
 our game it depends more on 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.350
 action of the allied team because the whole 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.370
 battle we shoot at someone else's glare and 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.740
 the final part of the fight to us 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.350
 problematic to drag the fight but not 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.090
 less on artillery at the same beginning of the battle 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.159
 you can make some good ones 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.560
 shots which predetermined the outcome 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.829
 duel here please lit 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.909
 enemy ISU 152 reduced shooting and 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:26.189
 more than the choice of the projectile flies where necessary 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.189
 1010 damages of the photoshoot and we have neutralized 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.590
 I think it is not necessary to have an enemy top and ned 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.640
 once again remind you that this guy has 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.850
 his bl-10 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.009
 could make the Allied squad fight 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.680
 continues we recharge comes down 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.720
 enemy t34 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.479
 we reduce shots with lead puncture 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.520
 to dress well in general 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.280
 please start the fight we did two 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.619
 shots inflicted 2000 damages and we 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.979
 neutralized two enemy top if 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.130
 ISU-152 was immediately sent to the hangar 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.759
 enemy t34 is now vanishing 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.990
 the guy will 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.840
 be careful not to become impudent and to allies 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.039
 not be quicker than him 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.740
 send to the hangar 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.280
 but I want to say that dear viewers if 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.420
 you are planning to siphon off 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.730
 french artillery then here such 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.340
 shots for a thousand 900 to magic with 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.120
 a shot for them is more so 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:31.260
 rare because starting from level 5 and 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.340
 up to the booty booty length 155 58 you 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.430
 will have to get used 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.040
 I can do it for three hundred and four hundred with a shot 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.530
 This is the norm for the French artillery. 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.069
 but no less than a thousand suitcases 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.849
 sometimes as you see fly in but 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.040
 to the french branch of art sau 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.389
 zest its advantages one of them 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.370
 this is starting from the seventh difficulty level 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:03:00.000
 5550 we get enough mobile 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.250
 movable art that will allow us sometimes 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.959
 take non-standard for artillery 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.040
 position and in order 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:10.739
 Occupations take the enemy by surprise 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.859
 throw buns from unexpected places 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.609
 also the case if you broke the flank 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:21.480
 there will be a great opportunity to escape from 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:23.840
 the opponent is also a chip french 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.000
 branches artillery is 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.620
 good accuracy fast 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.590
 rate of fire as a rule 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.160
 and quite good artillery reduced 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.560
 but for all this, it was said earlier 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:41.549
 will have to pay not high 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:46.109
 damage with a shot let's go back to 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.750
 review a little history of lorraine 155 50 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:51.419
 This fat which was developed on base 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.350
 we already know the medium tank 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:56.460
 which we have here 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.150
 lorraine 40t levels by setting to 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.620
 his chassis stupas 10mm howitzer 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.450
 fixed breech gives this 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.490
 fighting machine is very similar to 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.990
 assault guns that are widely 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.190
 were used during the second world 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.680
 war engine initially recovered 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:18.230
 talbot but in 1951 he was replaced 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:22.830
 maybach engine parameters of this art 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:25.200
 the weight of the machine is 30 tons the crew was five 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.420
 man armament was 150 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.120
 millimeter howitzer also became 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.100
 20 mm declared gun 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.080
 maximum speed all two kilometers 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.670
 at one o'clock 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.840
 the main difference is the location 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.160
 breech 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.230
 since on the first prototype she 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.540
 located central part of the body 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.700
 she subsequent was located front 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.010
 part of the hull so running was she 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.100
 followed from the medium tank lorraine 40t 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.930
 It is worth noting that the presence of rubber tires 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.680
 for track rollers for additional 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.020
 depreciation 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.260
 turned out to be a very interesting decision 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.920
 however, the decision was made in 1955 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.310
 in favor of the project batchatilion 155 this 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.250
 the choice 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.680
 was a logical consequence of rejecting 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.350
 assault weapons concept which is clearly 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.550
 viewed in project development from 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.910
 we are a prototype Lorain was ready in 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.480
 1952 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:23.220
 and lorraine artillery was developed in 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:25.920
 1950 and 1951 from here respectively 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.090
 and the numbers in the title lorraine 155 50 and 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.680
 lorraine 155 51 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.020
 judging by the available information 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.480
 both models were built metal and 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.990
 were tested approximately the same 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.200
 period 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.710
 like the foot tank itself since the lorraine tank 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.900
 40t 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.860
 It was not adopted by then, and both 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.390
 artillery 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:50.190
 turned out to be out of work our fight fits 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.980
 the end 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.540
 in principle, let's summarize 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:59.850
 the results were in this fight the master received 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:04.130
 main caliber and medal city since 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:06.030
 4055 damages and a medal were applied 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.910
 accordingly deserved because 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:13.470
 caused damage which is 10 times more than 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:15.870
 actually hp tank this is not all with 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:20.090
 you were a slim opponent subscribe to 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.090
 my channel all good luck in battles and bye
