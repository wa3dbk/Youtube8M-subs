 android samp in this video I bring you to 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.980
 share an expo module is called 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.930
 company ok what is this use for? 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.150
 apply this module serves us 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.279
 mainly value the battery of 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.160
 our device in a very 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.350
 effective good first thing we have to 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.860
 to do is to meet certain requirements that 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.650
 would be a root user and have installed 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.530
 the expulsion install good if you do not 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.659
 you are my root user or you do not have 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.129
 exposed installed you can go the 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.960
 description of the video that has left 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.530
 a couple of videos from a sister channel 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.500
 so you can see how it is done and how it 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.990
 install good after you already have 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:01:00.140
 the requirements we go to the place thor 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.090
 and we download amplified anyway 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.220
 in the description of the video I leave you a 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.050
 direct link to place thor so you do not 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.210
 you have to look for it just comes 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.640
 if you install it since you have installed it 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.400
 we are going to go to expo set 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.620
 a few seconds please and we're going to go 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.960
 to modules we will look for the module as you see 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.750
 it's this frank job we're going to mark 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.580
 here the small arrow that we are here 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.440
 let's go back we'll give to the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.200
 framework and here where the restart says 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.770
 soft after the device is 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.770
 have restarted 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.680
 we will open the module that will appear here 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.909
 in the application drawer as you see me 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.689
 I already have it in my folder it's called 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:45.259
 amplified good simply this module 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:49.039
 It has a standard configuration or longer 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.689
 drawer as you want to say that makes you 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.369
 save the battery simply with 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.329
 have it selected 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.450
 but you can always do more than you 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:02.420
 here for example there must be some 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.829
 some parameter that says sure good 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.700
 We are going to give you here the menu of the 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.680
 left 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.039
 Here you will see certain parameters to 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.160
 configure wicklow alarms and services 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.620
 good to be able to modify these 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.810
 parameters you need to donate the application 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.750
 but remember that there are always methods 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.180
 optional as they are lucky to cher or 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.239
 freedom that with these you can create this 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.430
 good module let's go here and as 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.170
 come here we see a list of the 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.300
 weblogs that are already limited 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.610
 a list of those that are safe to 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.950
 limit according to the application and others that 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.160
 are unknown that the application does not 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.290
 assures you that it's good to stop them 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.370
 some good time what they do if this 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.840
 application 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.209
 let's open those that are safe to 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:55.150
 limit is that the applications are 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.640
 Restart or search for updates every 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.100
 more time because for example some what 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.170
 they do every 60 seconds and that drains the 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.840
 battery of our device we're going 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.380
 to give here and as you see here we put it to 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.450
 240 seconds that makes it four 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.200
 times more time you can change it 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.989
 even at the time that you consider but 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.769
 I give you a piece of advice that does not exceed 300 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.330
 good since you have done it good 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.810
 we are still here 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.459
 wing lops 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.650
 and as you see already all those who are 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.470
 safe to limit are limited 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.950
 now we are going to alarm and I left 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.950
 a here 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.280
 some seconds good here is 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.550
 secured half so you can see as if 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.410
 is activated and then if you want you 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.740
 you can change the activation time 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.720
 which is good since it's there in 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.040
 services there is none that comes 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.530
 ensures to limit so that you 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.380
 I recommend not move well because it 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.400
 have you simply restart your 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.800
 device and the effects will have done 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.140
 the changes good I hope you liked 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.020

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.970
 subscribe to the channel and comment if you have 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.020
 some doubt or the same in the description 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.590
 of the video 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:18.049
 I leave the link to the channel facebook 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.419
 Well I hope I have served you seriously 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.250
 this application or this module serves as 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.860
 a lot for battery saving 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.070
 Even I do not even use this mine 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.290
 which is what they bring by default 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.950
 the xperia to save battery since 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.950
 what this mine does is deactivate 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.620
 some some settings options 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.150
 more than anything and well with this you do not have 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.240
 to do that 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:48.130
 that saves me more good battery this was 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.130
 all for android ham up the
