photography or DJs so well first of all
when<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.189> comes<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.490> choosing<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.849> camera<00:00:27.119> in

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
when it comes to choosing a camera in

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.939 
when it comes to choosing a camera in
the<00:00:27.240> lens<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:28.019> most<00:00:28.199> important<00:00:28.619> part<00:00:28.769> is

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
the lens the most important part is

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.439 
the lens the most important part is
choosing<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.550> good<00:00:29.699> bond<00:00:29.939> there's<00:00:30.240> three

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
choosing a good bond there's three

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.330 
choosing a good bond there's three
different<00:00:30.570> types<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.199> sensors<00:00:31.859> out<00:00:32.009> there<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
different types of sensors out there and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.400 
different types of sensors out there and
it's<00:00:32.490> really<00:00:32.730> went<00:00:32.970> Wingull<00:00:33.300> down<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.630> two<00:00:33.810> you

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
it's really went Wingull down to two you

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.260 
it's really went Wingull down to two you
have<00:00:34.530> your<00:00:34.680> full-frame<00:00:35.190> sensor<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:36.120> have

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
have your full-frame sensor you have

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.530 
have your full-frame sensor you have
your<00:00:36.480> aps-c<00:00:37.080> and<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.010> your<00:00:38.130> a<00:00:38.310> PSP<00:00:38.760> side

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
your aps-c and you have your a PSP side

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.450 
your aps-c and you have your a PSP side
to<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:39.810> sensor<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.620> only<00:00:40.800> getting<00:00:40.950> parallel

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
to the sensor it's only getting parallel

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.670 
to the sensor it's only getting parallel
rays<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.820> light<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.270> means<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.140> as<00:00:43.350> we're

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
rays of light that means that as we're

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.980 
rays of light that means that as we're
shooting<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.880> front<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.360> gonna<00:00:45.510> be<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.780> focus

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
shooting the front is gonna be in focus

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.110 
shooting the front is gonna be in focus
the<00:00:46.440> back<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.890> gonna<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> lot<00:00:47.490> more<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.790> focus

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
the back is gonna be a lot more in focus

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.610 
the back is gonna be a lot more in focus
as<00:00:48.240> well<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.900> the<00:00:49.050> image<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.350> gonna<00:00:49.470> be

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
as well but the image is gonna be

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.500 
as well but the image is gonna be
significantly<00:00:50.310> darker<00:00:50.790> because<00:00:51.330> you're

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
significantly darker because you're

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.900 
significantly darker because you're
letting<00:00:51.810> less<00:00:52.290> light<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.800> these<00:00:53.610> are<00:00:53.760> these

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
letting less light in these are these

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.430 
letting less light in these are these
examples<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.510> I'm<00:00:54.630> showing<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> screen

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
examples that I'm showing on the screen

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.070 
examples that I'm showing on the screen
now<00:00:55.680> you're<00:00:56.460> gonna<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:56.880> this<00:00:57.330> image<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.990> was

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
now you're gonna see this image that was

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.260 
now you're gonna see this image that was
shot<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.950> low<00:00:59.190> aperture<00:00:59.610> value<00:00:59.910> shown<00:01:00.090> on

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
shot at a low aperture value shown on

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.170 
shot at a low aperture value shown on
the<00:01:00.360> screen<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.830> same<00:01:02.070> image<00:01:02.250> ISO

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the screen and in the same image ISO

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.060 
the screen and in the same image ISO
everything<00:01:03.750> was<00:01:03.930> all<00:01:04.080> up<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.409> same<00:01:04.619> aperture

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
everything was all up the same aperture

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.419 
everything was all up the same aperture
was<00:01:05.790> moved<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.299> much<00:01:06.659> higher<00:01:06.689> value<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.189> it

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:08.429 
was moved to a much higher value so it

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:15.859 
was moved to a much higher value so it
was<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:09.109> less<00:01:10.109> direct<00:01:10.320> light<00:01:10.710> coming<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:14.600> TV<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
was a less direct light coming on TV and

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.020 
was a less direct light coming on TV and
AV<00:01:16.079> you<00:01:16.829> choose<00:01:17.070> either<00:01:17.280> your<00:01:17.520> shutter<00:01:17.820> speed

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
AV you choose either your shutter speed

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.230 
AV you choose either your shutter speed
or<00:01:18.659> your<00:01:18.869> aperture<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.679> then<00:01:20.520> your<00:01:20.729> exposure

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
or your aperture and then your exposure

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.770 
or your aperture and then your exposure
and<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.979> camera<00:01:23.369> does<00:01:23.609> the<00:01:23.820> rest<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.600> for

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and then the camera does the rest so for

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.419 
and then the camera does the rest so for
example<00:01:25.170> let's<00:01:25.350> say<00:01:25.469> you<00:01:25.829> know<00:01:25.950> I'm<00:01:26.130> shooting

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
example let's say you know I'm shooting

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.730 
example let's say you know I'm shooting

going everywhere and it's making my

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.880 
going everywhere and it's making my
exposures<00:01:30.240> real<00:01:30.420> crazy<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.960> can<00:01:31.350> actually<00:01:31.679> tell

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
to make sure that my camera stays

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.270 
to make sure that my camera stays
exactly<00:01:38.969> at<00:01:39.630> one<00:01:40.020> fiftieth<00:01:40.469> of<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.710> second<00:01:41.100> or

will change around to make sure that it

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.440 
will change around to make sure that it
stays<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.619> exposure<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.130> want<00:01:47.520> by<00:01:48.030> keeping

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
stays of exposure you want by keeping

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.529 
stays of exposure you want by keeping
either<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.170> shutter<00:01:50.100> value<00:01:50.549> or<00:01:51.240> your

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
aperture value that you've chosen the

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.980 
aperture value that you've chosen the
two<00:01:56.219> lens<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.789> I'll<00:01:57.149> show<00:01:57.389> how<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:57.600> entire

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
two lens and I'll show how the entire

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.480 
two lens and I'll show how the entire
venue<00:01:58.380> has<00:01:58.560> been<00:01:58.709> transformed<00:01:59.280> with<00:01:59.310> my

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
venue has been transformed with my

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.460 
venue has been transformed with my
lighting

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
lighting

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.100 
lighting
but<00:02:01.100> my<00:02:01.250> DJ<00:02:01.580> setup<00:02:01.940> isn't<00:02:02.150> in<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.480> way<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:02.960> it

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
but my DJ setup isn't in the way and it

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.350 
but my DJ setup isn't in the way and it
actually<00:02:03.260> adds<00:02:03.650> to<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.070> overall<00:02:04.340> look<00:02:04.730> of<00:02:05.000> the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
actually adds to the overall look of the
