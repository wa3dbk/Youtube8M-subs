recently<00:00:04.040> on<00:00:04.190> the<00:00:04.220> show<00:00:04.580> we've<00:00:04.880> talked<00:00:05.180> about

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:05.360 
recently on the show we've talked about

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.630 
recently on the show we've talked about
fungicide<00:00:06.200> use<00:00:06.500> and<00:00:06.740> we've<00:00:06.860> said<00:00:07.160> you've<00:00:07.610> got

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:07.640 
fungicide use and we've said you've got

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.940 
fungicide use and we've said you've got
to<00:00:07.910> spray<00:00:08.330> early<00:00:08.780> but<00:00:09.260> there<00:00:09.410> is<00:00:09.440> a<00:00:09.530> limit<00:00:09.740> to

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
to spray early but there is a limit to

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.740 
to spray early but there is a limit to
it<00:00:10.190> when<00:00:10.310> it<00:00:10.340> comes<00:00:10.610> to<00:00:10.760> corn<00:00:11.030> there<00:00:11.570> certainly

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
it when it comes to corn there certainly

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.100 
it when it comes to corn there certainly
is<00:00:12.110> we're<00:00:12.620> out<00:00:12.800> way<00:00:13.040> too<00:00:13.070> early<00:00:13.370> to<00:00:13.700> be<00:00:13.790> swap<00:00:14.110> or

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
is we're out way too early to be swap or

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.620 
is we're out way too early to be swap or
spray<00:00:15.530> at<00:00:15.710> this<00:00:15.889> point<00:00:16.219> but<00:00:16.730> the<00:00:16.970> whole<00:00:17.329> had

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
spray at this point but the whole had

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.509 
spray at this point but the whole had
some<00:00:17.990> disease<00:00:18.380> but<00:00:18.650> in<00:00:18.800> our<00:00:19.159> part<00:00:19.400> of<00:00:19.460> the

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:19.519 
some disease but in our part of the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.179 
some disease but in our part of the
country<00:00:19.609> we<00:00:20.269> don't<00:00:20.390> have<00:00:20.659> real<00:00:21.320> significant

country we don't have real significant
disease<00:00:22.519> in<00:00:22.819> corn<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:23.329> breeding<00:00:23.689> has<00:00:23.810> been

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:23.989 
disease in corn the breeding has been

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.290 
disease in corn the breeding has been
excellent<00:00:24.470> and<00:00:24.829> for<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:25.460> most<00:00:25.640> part<00:00:25.759> we've

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
excellent and for the most part we've

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.609 
excellent and for the most part we've
taken<00:00:26.569> care<00:00:26.720> of<00:00:26.899> a<00:00:26.989> lot<00:00:27.140> of<00:00:27.199> those<00:00:27.409> early

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
taken care of a lot of those early

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.919 
taken care of a lot of those early
season<00:00:28.189> diseases<00:00:28.759> that<00:00:28.939> used<00:00:29.210> to<00:00:29.359> show<00:00:29.539> up<00:00:29.749> in

diseases that happen later on in the
season<00:00:34.850> when<00:00:35.059> we<00:00:35.120> get<00:00:35.300> into<00:00:35.420> the<00:00:35.570> hotter<00:00:35.809> part

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140

season when we get into the hotter part
of<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.350> summer<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:36.829> especially<00:00:37.370> when<00:00:37.730> we<00:00:37.850> get

of the summer and especially when we get

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.029 
of the summer and especially when we get
around<00:00:38.269> TAS<00:00:38.600> link<00:00:38.960> time<00:00:39.199> and<00:00:39.620> shortly

around TAS link time and shortly

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.590 
around TAS link time and shortly
thereafter<00:00:40.070> you<00:00:41.030> can<00:00:41.179> see<00:00:41.300> a<00:00:41.329> lot<00:00:41.570> more

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
thereafter you can see a lot more

thereafter you can see a lot more
diseases<00:00:42.109> out<00:00:42.440> in<00:00:42.679> corn<00:00:42.920> but<00:00:43.129> here's<00:00:43.429> here's

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
diseases out in corn but here's here's

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.520 
diseases out in corn but here's here's
what<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:44.179> problem<00:00:44.570> was<00:00:44.690> from<00:00:44.989> last<00:00:45.170> year<00:00:45.500> a

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
what the problem was from last year a

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.079 
what the problem was from last year a
lot<00:00:45.739> of<00:00:45.829> people<00:00:46.070> took<00:00:46.190> this<00:00:46.399> tassel<00:00:46.969> Aang

thing and they heard people talking
about<00:00:50.120> oh<00:00:50.210> you<00:00:50.359> want<00:00:50.660> to<00:00:50.719> spray<00:00:50.929> at<00:00:51.170> tassel

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
about oh you want to spray at tassel

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.200 
about oh you want to spray at tassel
that's<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.190> best<00:00:52.370> time<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:52.820> get<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.030> most

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
that's the best time to get the most

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.729 
that's the best time to get the most
yield<00:00:53.600> out<00:00:53.809> of<00:00:53.899> your<00:00:53.989> corn<00:00:54.199> fungicide<00:00:54.679> and

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
yield out of your corn fungicide and

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.380 
yield out of your corn fungicide and
they<00:00:54.829> thought<00:00:54.980> well<00:00:55.219> we<00:00:55.820> always<00:00:56.059> want<00:00:56.239> to<00:00:56.269> be

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
they thought well we always want to be

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.389 
they thought well we always want to be
early<00:00:56.809> with<00:00:56.960> fungicides<00:00:57.410> so<00:00:57.739> let's<00:00:57.920> even<00:00:58.249> hit

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
early with fungicides so let's even hit

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.009 
early with fungicides so let's even hit
it<00:00:58.519> right<00:00:58.640> before<00:00:58.820> tassel<00:00:59.449> that<00:00:59.600> is<00:00:59.749> something

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
it right before tassel that is something

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.049 
it right before tassel that is something
you<00:01:00.079> do<00:01:00.289> not<00:01:00.320> want<00:01:00.829> to<00:01:00.920> do<00:01:01.070> in<00:01:01.429> fact<00:01:01.670> there<00:01:01.879> was

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
you do not want to do in fact there was

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.900 
you do not want to do in fact there was
yield<00:01:02.449> loss<00:01:02.870> in<00:01:03.289> some<00:01:03.530> cases<00:01:03.800> when<00:01:04.400> fungicide

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
yield loss in some cases when fungicide

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.360 
yield loss in some cases when fungicide
was<00:01:05.090> sprayed<00:01:05.390> just<00:01:05.720> at<00:01:05.870> the<00:01:05.990> very<00:01:06.020> wrong<00:01:06.800> time

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
was sprayed just at the very wrong time

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.160 
was sprayed just at the very wrong time
so<00:01:07.730> you've<00:01:08.000> got<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.270> make<00:01:08.390> sure<00:01:08.450> you're<00:01:08.900> not

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
so you've got to make sure you're not

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.500 
so you've got to make sure you're not
only<00:01:09.470> waiting<00:01:09.800> for<00:01:10.010> full<00:01:10.310> tassel<00:01:10.940> for<00:01:11.120> all<00:01:11.240> the

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
only waiting for full tassel for all the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.360 
only waiting for full tassel for all the
tassels<00:01:11.960> in<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.140> field<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.770> come<00:01:12.980> out<00:01:13.160> but

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
tassels in the field to come out but

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.970 
tassels in the field to come out but
even<00:01:13.730> for<00:01:13.970> silking<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:14.840> begin<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:15.590> what<00:01:15.950> I

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
even for silking to begin so what I

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.070 
even for silking to begin so what I
would<00:01:16.100> do<00:01:16.430> is<00:01:16.640> once<00:01:16.880> your<00:01:17.060> field<00:01:17.330> starts<00:01:17.870> to

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
would do is once your field starts to

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.560 
would do is once your field starts to
tassel<00:01:18.590> probably<00:01:19.340> wait<00:01:19.550> another<00:01:19.880> week<00:01:20.120> or<00:01:20.360> 10

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
tassel probably wait another week or 10

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.230 
tassel probably wait another week or 10
days<00:01:20.600> then<00:01:21.500> you're<00:01:22.070> in<00:01:22.400> around<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:23.060> right

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
days then you're in around the right

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.870 
days then you're in around the right
time<00:01:23.540> frame<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:24.110> start<00:01:24.980> spraying<00:01:25.250> fungicide

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
time frame to start spraying fungicide

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.330 
time frame to start spraying fungicide
so<00:01:26.120> just<00:01:26.360> don't<00:01:26.510> spray<00:01:26.870> too<00:01:27.410> early<00:01:28.040> when<00:01:28.190> it

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
so just don't spray too early when it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.070 
so just don't spray too early when it
comes<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:28.670> fungicide<00:01:29.090> application<00:01:29.690> in<00:01:29.810> corn

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
comes to fungicide application in corn

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.990 
comes to fungicide application in corn
well<00:01:30.380> with<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.830> value<00:01:31.190> of<00:01:31.310> today's<00:01:31.610> corn

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
well with the value of today's corn

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.910 
well with the value of today's corn
craft<00:01:32.300> there's<00:01:32.570> no<00:01:32.810> question<00:01:33.440> that<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:33.740> should

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
craft there's no question that it should

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.890 
craft there's no question that it should
be<00:01:34.010> looked<00:01:34.220> at<00:01:34.400> as<00:01:34.580> a<00:01:34.610> specialty<00:01:35.270> crap<00:01:35.600> think

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
be looked at as a specialty crap think

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.620
