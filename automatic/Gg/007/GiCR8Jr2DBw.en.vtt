00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.589
 one 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.250
 it was a dream that we had that did not seem 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.660
 very difficult to achieve sincerely 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.310
 we had found out the possibility of 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.189
 loans in many banks and never 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.859
 gave us and finally finally with the 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.409
 procreation loan was a big boost 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:30.470
 to be able to show our house the 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:35.300
 construction but it did not arrive 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.190
 for the costs of having to buy 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.220
 the materials 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.370
 in this case I can make my hand 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:48.199
 of work what is easier is very 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:51.609
 beautiful having a house is like feeling 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:54.440
 full dress 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:57.110
 ah 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.390
 how 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.370
 an important impulse this of being able 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.680
 project say good I 'm going to 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.239
 elaborate every day I do many 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.190
 sacrifices all families and what 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.100
 good but for something we can achieve 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.050
 because I really she up to about 41 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.240
 very disappointed years and well we 're not going 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.729
 to be able to arrive never and today good 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.430
 we arrived and practically the fee is what 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.230
 that a rent would come and we can 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.020
 make that accessible is 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.320
 lacking less in rent does not suffer 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.730
 if you do not enjoy it to that payment students 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.730
 you can take out you can not get it out 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.710
 it's very different to be in a very place 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.439
 boy who is never is yours today 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.509
 we can not count the land the house we 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.630
 it seems all great not to wake up to the 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.090
 morning and say this is my house my god 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.000
 that a dream dream saw when it 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.190
 crystallizes a dream that one does not 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.250
 many words are left as if it were 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.899
 a dream a dream fulfilled the power 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.899
 be in front of your house 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.439
 ah 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.439
 do not
