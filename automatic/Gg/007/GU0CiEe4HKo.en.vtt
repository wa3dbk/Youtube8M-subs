hi Francis here from MTV our and I'm
here<00:00:06.069> to<00:00:06.279> talk<00:00:06.580> about<00:00:06.640> the<00:00:07.380> 9<00:00:08.380> or<00:00:08.530> jet<00:00:08.740> 9<00:00:09.510> so<00:00:10.510> I

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
here to talk about the 9 or jet 9 so I

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.740 
here to talk about the 9 or jet 9 so I
have<00:00:11.980> it<00:00:12.160> currently<00:00:12.580> SPECT<00:00:13.000> to<00:00:13.570> my

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 
have it currently SPECT to my

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.289 
have it currently SPECT to my
preferences<00:00:14.500> and<00:00:15.070> with<00:00:15.639> with<00:00:15.849> this<00:00:16.029> setup

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
preferences and with with this setup

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.010 
preferences and with with this setup
right<00:00:16.509> now<00:00:16.619> it's<00:00:17.759> under<00:00:18.759> 25<00:00:19.210> pounds<00:00:19.630> you<00:00:19.900> know

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
right now it's under 25 pounds you know

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.409 
right now it's under 25 pounds you know
even<00:00:20.619> with<00:00:20.710> pedals<00:00:21.270> 24.8<00:00:22.270> 24.9<00:00:23.230> pounds<00:00:23.710> so<00:00:24.460> it

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
even with pedals 24.8 24.9 pounds so it

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.659 
even with pedals 24.8 24.9 pounds so it
can<00:00:25.720> be<00:00:25.869> set<00:00:26.110> up<00:00:26.140> pretty<00:00:26.800> darn<00:00:26.950> light<00:00:27.220> the

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
can be set up pretty darn light the

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.870 
can be set up pretty darn light the
frame<00:00:27.880> itself<00:00:28.270> on<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:29.259> small<00:00:29.559> weighs<00:00:30.489> exactly

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
frame itself on the small weighs exactly

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.650 
frame itself on the small weighs exactly
6<00:00:31.570> pounds<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.730> it's<00:00:33.880> got<00:00:34.030> 3<00:00:34.239> inches<00:00:34.450> of<00:00:34.600> travel

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
6 pounds and it's got 3 inches of travel

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.279 
6 pounds and it's got 3 inches of travel
but<00:00:35.530> today<00:00:35.829> I'll<00:00:35.920> just<00:00:35.949> focus<00:00:36.219> on<00:00:36.640> on<00:00:37.289> mostly

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:38.289 
but today I'll just focus on on mostly

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:43.979 
but today I'll just focus on on mostly
the<00:00:38.379> frame<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.969> what<00:00:40.269> we<00:00:40.359> got<00:00:40.510> here<00:00:40.929> is<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:43.239> the

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
the frame so what we got here is the the

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.939 
the frame so what we got here is the the
kind<00:00:44.829> of<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:45.070> addition<00:00:45.760> to<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.269> 9<00:00:46.480> er<00:00:46.710> rip<00:00:47.710> 9

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
kind of the addition to the 9 er rip 9

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.169 
kind of the addition to the 9 er rip 9
which<00:00:48.879> has<00:00:49.089> four<00:00:49.359> inches<00:00:49.600> of<00:00:49.719> travel<00:00:49.809> so<00:00:51.179> and

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179 
which has four inches of travel so and

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.060 
which has four inches of travel so and
what<00:00:53.019> we<00:00:53.140> found<00:00:53.260> with<00:00:53.410> the<00:00:53.499> ripped<00:00:53.679> iron<00:00:53.859> was

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
what we found with the ripped iron was

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.590 
what we found with the ripped iron was
it<00:00:54.249> was<00:00:54.370> good<00:00:54.579> but<00:00:54.940> here<00:00:55.179> in<00:00:55.269> north<00:00:55.420> California

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
it was good but here in north California

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.389 
it was good but here in north California
and<00:00:56.289> when<00:00:56.649> you<00:00:56.739> want<00:00:56.890> to<00:00:56.949> enter<00:00:57.280> the

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
and when you want to enter the

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.700 
and when you want to enter the
occasional<00:00:57.820> race<00:00:57.969> or<00:00:58.149> not<00:00:58.239> it<00:00:58.749> it<00:00:59.559> was<00:00:59.679> a

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
occasional race or not it it was a

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.529 
occasional race or not it it was a
little<00:00:59.890> -<00:01:00.100> it<00:01:00.640> was<00:01:00.760> a<00:01:00.789> little<00:01:01.089> too<00:01:01.210> heavy<00:01:01.359> a

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
little - it was a little too heavy a

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.590 
little - it was a little too heavy a
little<00:01:01.839> too<00:01:01.929> much<00:01:02.079> suspension<00:01:03.269> it<00:01:04.269> wasn't

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
little too much suspension it wasn't

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.930 
little too much suspension it wasn't
quite<00:01:04.690> as<00:01:04.870> fast<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.920> I<00:01:06.010> think<00:01:06.310> what<00:01:06.550> this<00:01:06.700> bike

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
quite as fast and I think what this bike

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.639 
quite as fast and I think what this bike
really<00:01:07.330> achieves<00:01:07.659> is<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:09.640> over<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:10.479> jet<00:01:11.079> 9<00:01:11.259> or

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
really achieves is is over the jet 9 or

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.630 
really achieves is is over the jet 9 or
the<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:12.220> RIP<00:01:12.369> 9<00:01:12.549> speed<00:01:13.320> off<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.470> bat<00:01:14.829> that's

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
the the RIP 9 speed off the bat that's

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.149 
the the RIP 9 speed off the bat that's
what<00:01:15.790> we<00:01:15.880> notice<00:01:16.149> it's<00:01:16.420> it<00:01:17.049> feels<00:01:17.110> fast<00:01:17.770> it

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
what we notice it's it feels fast it

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.749 
what we notice it's it feels fast it
feels<00:01:18.430> very<00:01:18.549> nimble<00:01:19.259> three<00:01:20.259> inches<00:01:20.590> on<00:01:20.799> a<00:01:20.890> 29er

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
feels very nimble three inches on a 29er

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.289 
feels very nimble three inches on a 29er
platform<00:01:23.130> feels<00:01:24.130> like<00:01:24.340> more<00:01:24.579> it<00:01:24.729> really<00:01:25.030> feels

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
platform feels like more it really feels

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.980 
platform feels like more it really feels
like<00:01:25.390> four<00:01:25.689> four<00:01:26.259> and<00:01:26.380> a<00:01:26.409> half<00:01:26.439> on<00:01:26.920> this<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.990> so

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
like four four and a half on this and so

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.069 
like four four and a half on this and so
it's<00:01:29.140> very<00:01:29.369> responsive<00:01:30.369> to<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.600> acceleration

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
it's very responsive to the acceleration

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.440 
it's very responsive to the acceleration
forces<00:01:32.530> you<00:01:33.009> can<00:01:33.130> be<00:01:33.250> in<00:01:33.340> a<00:01:33.399> saddle<00:01:33.610> out<00:01:34.240> of

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
forces you can be in a saddle out of

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.330 
forces you can be in a saddle out of
saddle<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:34.960> it<00:01:35.619> just<00:01:35.770> scoots

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
saddle and it just scoots

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.639 
saddle and it just scoots
and<00:01:36.969> what<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.049> does<00:01:38.729> we'll<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:41.049> over<00:01:41.320> the

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
and what it does we'll have over the

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:42.810 
and what it does we'll have over the
hard<00:01:41.890> tail<00:01:42.100> so<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.340> know<00:01:42.430> you<00:01:42.490> can<00:01:42.670> have<00:01:42.759> a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
hard tail so you know you can have a

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.249 
hard tail so you know you can have a
nineteen<00:01:43.119> pounds<00:01:43.299> and<00:01:43.509> upon<00:01:43.689> hardtail<00:01:44.110> but

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
nineteen pounds and upon hardtail but

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.770 
nineteen pounds and upon hardtail but
what<00:01:44.409> this<00:01:44.649> offers<00:01:45.219> you<00:01:45.369> it's<00:01:46.000> just<00:01:46.240> amazing

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
what this offers you it's just amazing

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.980 
what this offers you it's just amazing
traction<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:48.250> suicide<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.359> wheel<00:01:49.780> size

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
traction the suicide the wheel size

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.410 
traction the suicide the wheel size
gives<00:01:50.289> you<00:01:50.469> a<00:01:50.710> bigger<00:01:51.070> footprint<00:01:51.729> gives<00:01:52.329> you

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
gives you a bigger footprint gives you

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.560 
gives you a bigger footprint gives you
more<00:01:52.539> traction<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.159> suspension<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:55.030> the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
more traction but the suspension of the

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.920 
more traction but the suspension of the
chip<00:01:55.810> 9<00:01:56.159> seems<00:01:57.159> like<00:01:57.280> it's<00:01:57.430> floating<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.810> know

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
chip 9 seems like it's floating you know

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.529 
chip 9 seems like it's floating you know
even<00:01:59.200> on<00:01:59.289> asphalt<00:01:59.560> when<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:00.520> when<00:02:00.729> I'm<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.240> I'm

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
even on asphalt when I when I'm and I'm

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.289 
even on asphalt when I when I'm and I'm
doing<00:02:01.869> this<00:02:01.990> undulation<00:02:02.439> slow<00:02:03.009> little<00:02:03.909> bumps

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
doing this undulation slow little bumps

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.060 
doing this undulation slow little bumps
you<00:02:04.899> know<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.049> can<00:02:05.229> I<00:02:05.320> can<00:02:05.500> feel<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:05.740> moving<00:02:05.890> it's

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
you know I can I can feel it moving it's

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.310 
you know I can I can feel it moving it's
always<00:02:06.369> moving<00:02:06.549> so<00:02:07.450> though<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.780> rear<00:02:08.050> tire<00:02:08.289> is

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
always moving so though the rear tire is

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.060 
always moving so though the rear tire is
always<00:02:08.679> planted<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.929> surface<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:12.010> you

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
always planted on the surface so you

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.950 
always planted on the surface so you
always<00:02:12.340> have<00:02:12.730> good<00:02:12.880> traction<00:02:13.090> when<00:02:13.840> you're

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
always have good traction when you're

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.890 
always have good traction when you're
cornering<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:15.790> know<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:15.940> downhill<00:02:16.450> or

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
cornering you know a downhill or

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.160 
cornering you know a downhill or
flat<00:02:17.200> corner<00:02:18.060> all<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.690> movement<00:02:19.959> of

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
flat corner all this the movement of

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.259 
flat corner all this the movement of
that<00:02:20.290> keeps<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.800> keeps<00:02:21.099> keeps<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:22.000> rear

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
that keeps that keeps keeps the rear

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.880 
that keeps that keeps keeps the rear
tire<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.810> front<00:02:22.989> tire<00:02:23.110> planet<00:02:23.530> as<00:02:23.680> well

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
tire and the front tire planet as well

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.830 
tire and the front tire planet as well
so<00:02:24.760> it's<00:02:25.660> very<00:02:25.959> easy<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.349> ride<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.830> have<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
so it's very easy to ride I have the the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.220 
so it's very easy to ride I have the the
schwabe<00:02:29.379> little<00:02:29.620> Albert's<00:02:30.040> right<00:02:30.280> now<00:02:30.459> and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
schwabe little Albert's right now and

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.210 
schwabe little Albert's right now and
it's<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.349> perfect<00:02:32.709> match

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
it's a perfect match

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.910 
it's a perfect match
I<00:02:33.250> think<00:02:33.879> for<00:02:34.239> for<00:02:34.810> this<00:02:35.019> bike<00:02:35.260> because<00:02:35.650> it's

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
I think for for this bike because it's

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.250 
I think for for this bike because it's
not<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.069> huge<00:02:36.310> tire<00:02:36.580> but<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.660> bike<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:37.840> plush

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
not a huge tire but the bike is plush

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.119 
not a huge tire but the bike is plush
and<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:40.330> it's<00:02:40.959> got<00:02:41.140> enough<00:02:41.319> traction<00:02:41.590> that

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
and and it's got enough traction that

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.490 
and and it's got enough traction that
you<00:02:42.390> know<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:43.599> this<00:02:43.810> matches<00:02:44.200> up<00:02:44.349> really

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
you know this this matches up really

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.800 
you know this this matches up really
well<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:47.459> we<00:02:48.459> have<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.599> way<00:02:49.690> they

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
well so we have the this is the way they

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.289 
well so we have the this is the way they
have<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.049> set<00:02:50.079> up<00:02:50.260> they<00:02:50.470> have<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:51.060> shock<00:02:52.060> of

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
have it set up they have the shock of

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:58.350 
have it set up they have the shock of
the<00:02:52.540> Fox<00:02:53.500> RPE<00:02:53.920> 23<00:02:54.910> on<00:02:55.150> this<00:02:55.989> bike<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.190> on<00:02:58.150> the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
the Fox RPE 23 on this bike and on the

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.670 
the Fox RPE 23 on this bike and on the
lockout<00:02:58.720> mode<00:02:58.750> it's<00:02:59.049> not<00:02:59.140> really<00:02:59.319> locked<00:02:59.530> out

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
lockout mode it's not really locked out

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.550 
lockout mode it's not really locked out
it's<00:02:59.860> a<00:02:59.920> little<00:03:00.010> just<00:03:00.250> more<00:03:00.430> firm<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:01.319> use<00:03:02.319> that

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
it's a little just more firm I use that

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.650 
it's a little just more firm I use that
mostly<00:03:02.829> on<00:03:03.160> an<00:03:03.280> AHA<00:03:03.730> when<00:03:04.239> I'm<00:03:04.329> on<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.510> asphalt

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
mostly on an AHA when I'm on the asphalt

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:12.119 
mostly on an AHA when I'm on the asphalt
or<00:03:05.459> on<00:03:06.870> on<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.930> very<00:03:08.640> smooth<00:03:09.640> long<00:03:10.450> climb<00:03:10.920> on<00:03:11.920> the

or on on a very smooth long climb on the

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.009 
or on on a very smooth long climb on the
non<00:03:12.280> lock<00:03:12.489> top<00:03:12.700> version<00:03:12.879> its<00:03:13.540> efficient

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
non lock top version its efficient

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.020 
non lock top version its efficient
enough<00:03:14.200> it's<00:03:14.470> fast<00:03:14.769> enough<00:03:15.099> sometimes<00:03:15.940> it

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
enough it's fast enough sometimes it

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.220 
enough it's fast enough sometimes it
psychological<00:03:16.599> you<00:03:16.660> want<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.870> lock<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.019> out

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
psychological you want to lock it out

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.559 
psychological you want to lock it out
but<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:17.829> bike<00:03:18.040> like<00:03:18.220> this<00:03:18.250> it's<00:03:18.940> really<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.329> great

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
but a bike like this it's really a great

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.400 
but a bike like this it's really a great
great<00:03:19.780> climber<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:21.269> it's<00:03:22.269> perfectly<00:03:22.900> match

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
great climber and it's perfectly match

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.840 
great climber and it's perfectly match
I'll<00:03:23.709> talk<00:03:23.980> about<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.310> stock<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.519> little<00:03:24.760> bit

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
I'll talk about the stock a little bit

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.059 
I'll talk about the stock a little bit
this<00:03:25.000> is<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.560> they<00:03:26.560> made<00:03:26.799> this<00:03:27.069> bike<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:29.530> match

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
this is a they made this bike to match

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.710 
this is a they made this bike to match
the<00:03:30.310> shock<00:03:30.579> really<00:03:30.880> well<00:03:31.030> it's<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:33.160> RIBA

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
the shock really well it's the the RIBA

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.170 
the shock really well it's the the RIBA
adjustable<00:03:34.720> shock<00:03:35.010> where<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.190> can<00:03:36.310> go<00:03:36.459> from<00:03:36.700> I

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
adjustable shock where you can go from I

adjustable shock where you can go from I
believe<00:03:37.239> 70<00:03:37.900> millimeters<00:03:38.470> of<00:03:38.590> travel<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.910> 105

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
believe 70 millimeters of travel to 105

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.979 
believe 70 millimeters of travel to 105
by<00:03:42.280> just<00:03:42.459> turning<00:03:42.639> this<00:03:42.880> you<00:03:43.060> turn<00:03:43.239> knob<00:03:43.450> and

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
by just turning this you turn knob and

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.360 
by just turning this you turn knob and
what's<00:03:44.170> cool<00:03:44.319> about<00:03:44.349> this<00:03:44.620> is<00:03:44.829> it<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.340> can

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
what's cool about this is it you can

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.159 
what's cool about this is it you can
really<00:03:45.700> change<00:03:45.819> the<00:03:45.940> bike<00:03:46.120> around<00:03:46.269> you<00:03:47.109> know

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
really change the bike around you know

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.409 
really change the bike around you know
if<00:03:47.319> you<00:03:47.410> want<00:03:47.620> not<00:03:48.190> only<00:03:48.519> shorter<00:03:48.940> travel<00:03:49.120> but

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
if you want not only shorter travel but

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.870 
if you want not only shorter travel but
a<00:03:49.450> steeper<00:03:49.810> head<00:03:49.989> angle<00:03:50.319> you<00:03:50.829> can<00:03:51.010> do<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.340> with

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
a steeper head angle you can do it with

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.360 
a steeper head angle you can do it with
this<00:03:52.030> shock<00:03:52.680> sleeper<00:03:53.680> head<00:03:53.829> angle<00:03:54.130> you<00:03:54.250> can

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
this shock sleeper head angle you can

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.210 
this shock sleeper head angle you can
climb<00:03:54.579> walls<00:03:55.209> really<00:03:55.690> easy<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.739> can<00:03:56.889> carve

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
climb walls really easy you can carve

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.400 
climb walls really easy you can carve
single<00:03:57.639> track<00:03:57.819> super<00:03:58.209> accurately<00:03:58.660> so<00:03:59.380> that

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
single track super accurately so that

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.500 
single track super accurately so that
works<00:03:59.859> out<00:04:00.010> really<00:04:00.069> well<00:04:00.459> so<00:04:01.419> there<00:04:02.200> you<00:04:02.290> go

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
works out really well so there you go

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.430 
works out really well so there you go
then<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.690> niner<00:04:04.900> jet<00:04:05.230> 9<00:04:05.410> highly<00:04:06.069> awaited<00:04:07.440> but

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
then the niner jet 9 highly awaited but

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.740 
then the niner jet 9 highly awaited but
it<00:04:09.010> delivers<00:04:09.639> in<00:04:09.849> terms<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.150> performance<00:04:10.569> and

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
it delivers in terms of performance and

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.270 
it delivers in terms of performance and
it<00:04:10.840> looks<00:04:10.989> great<00:04:11.230> too

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
it looks great too

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.120 
it looks great too
we<00:04:12.549> hope<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.940> probably<00:04:13.780> race<00:04:14.049> it<00:04:14.290> in<00:04:14.500> down<00:04:14.769> evil

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
we hope to probably race it in down evil

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.339 
we hope to probably race it in down evil
in<00:04:15.730> a<00:04:15.849> cross<00:04:16.030> country<00:04:16.209> course<00:04:16.479> eight<00:04:17.079> mile

in a cross country course eight mile
climb<00:04:17.590> i<00:04:18.010> believe<00:04:18.639> four<00:04:18.910> thousand<00:04:19.269> feet

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
climb i believe four thousand feet

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.279 
climb i believe four thousand feet
followed<00:04:20.229> by<00:04:20.349> a<00:04:20.380> 12<00:04:20.739> mile<00:04:20.919> descent<00:04:21.310> i<00:04:21.549> think

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
followed by a 12 mile descent i think
