00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.520
 hi to all the gravedigger's production 

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.870
 14 is in full swing but you have to 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.300
 to confess between two writing sessions 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.770
 sometimes the break is needed so I have 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:17.080
 fed up today and I come out the 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:18.490
 guitar since the pilot of the first 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.630
 gravedigger a little over a year ago you 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.890
 many of you have asked me 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.420
 tablatures for generics but 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.470
 also for background music and 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.640
 every time I told you that I 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.600
 do not have tabs because 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.980
 I do everything by ear 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.060
 so I had to promise a 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.350
 number of times to do some 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.939
 video tutorials to explain how 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.439
 play his tracks and so I start 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.479
 today with this tutorial dedicated to 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.589
 generic of the gravedigger so guitarists 

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:38.079
 budding and curious from all walks of life 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:39.159
 this video is for you to play this 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.859
 piece you need an instrument 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:43.300
 of guitar type tomorrow in pick or 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.129
 a particularly long nail and 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.999
 disgusting and finally an audience that 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.929
 potentially can express 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:54.629
 there we have a guitar a tuning 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:56.559
 classic but stop only 6 me 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.780
 first thing we'll get off 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:03.280
 guitars booming in a group of na 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.110
 word game barter drugs dea 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.850
 comes from the English to drop let go and as soon 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.340
 that they the Anglo-Saxon name of the note res 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.470
 so we will take the serious rope 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.270
 half and bring it down in a d 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.680
 so the ideal of course is to have 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.850
 a tuner but if you do not have one 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.580
 you can always base yourself on the 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.540
 third rope that of re or done 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.770
 ring both strings at the same time and 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.060
 you go down first until you 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.230
 that both are on the same note to 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.100
 an octave of difference of course 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.100
 demonstration 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.729
 it's officially between them 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.080
 it's a tuning that will allow you to 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.080
 play the chords in a very simple way 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.810
 so I'm going to play you a first 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.810
 times at normal speed 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.030
 fear 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.130
 I will now cut it out more 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.810
 in detail 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.789
 it's a pretty simple piece but 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.869
 ask for a pretty square rhythm we're going 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.039
 only play on the first three 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.849
 ropes to do what's called 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.290
 power-ups power agreements so 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.470
 we will use only four agreements 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.739
 re d sharp 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.580
 but that is to say the empty cords 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.360
 and the first three boxes 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.989
 so here's the piece now at 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.989
 slow motion 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.840
 now and the time of a few 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.049
 explanations well felt it's already written 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.640
 so in fact in this piece there will be 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.420
 three ways to play chords and 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.300
 the chords that will be played 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.500
 normally like that there 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.790
 other agreements that will be played 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.790
 percussive way like that 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.700
 you will type with the balm on the 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.550
 body of the guitar at the same time as 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.540
 you play the agreement finally there will be 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.980
 other agreements that will be completely 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.480
 smothered who have a pure then 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.530
 percussive we will call them agreements 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.820
 ghost so with all that we will create 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.290
 a very specific way of playing these 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.150
 chords with a rhythmic pattern well 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.410
 accurate and as you could see the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.730
 piece begins and ends with 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.920
 slides that is to say we will play a 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:34.340
 agree and then drag the hand 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:38.290
 on the neck I'll do it again now 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.290
 the omega rhythm has slowed down from death 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.180
 no 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.770
 m 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.920
 so you see the goal is to have a 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.420
 movement both fluid and percussive 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.650
 and for the little girl would have shot at 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.099
 middle I'll do it again 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.239
 precisely then the flourish in 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.910
 question she's playing on the second 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:24.550
 rope she is tuning in there she's going to 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.750
 play on the 3rd and the 5th box then 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.070
 the thing is I'm going to put the index 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.080
 on the third box of the second 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.220
 rope like that etc with the hand like that 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.430
 with the rest of the hand I'm going 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.539
 smother the other strings like that 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.449
 if I hit all the strings there will be 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.460
 just the second that will ring so already 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.870
 I played seven first notes 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.490
 then I want to do what is called 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.539
 a friend ron hammer that means brand 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.550
 early in English and I'm going to do the 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.350
 hammer with my other finger to come 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.639
 play the note that in 5th gas but seems 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.550
 serve as the right hand just with the 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.009
 left hand like that so if we add 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.050
 the first two steps that's it 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.249
 and after hammering 7/5 box with the 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.849
 left hand we will reuse the hand 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:03.379
 right to make a round trip 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:05.639
 and all that put end to end it gives this 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:08.689
 is this whole passage will consist of 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.689
 repeat this pattern twice 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.540
 and in the definitive piece it will take 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.540
 of course play it faster 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.530
 something is missing 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.860
 yeah the melodic patterns not the 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.240
 talent this melodic gel pattern had 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:32.250
 added to the registration part la 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:33.600
 rhythmic and it consists of playing 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.280
 notes while doing slides ie 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.280
 sliding to his demo notes 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.440
 1 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:46.589
 it will therefore be necessary to play alternatively 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.080
 note in the 15th box and this is the 9th 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:50.249
 good case that was on the first 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.679
 half of the piece but on the second 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:53.639
 half attention notes added by 

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:54.229
 example it will not be just this 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.189
 note 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.610
 but it will be these two play at the same 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:00.869
 time we will add the tiara and 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.520
 this third she is on the rope 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:07.649
 just below the boxes back 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.679
 same for this note it will be more 

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:13.369
 just this note but these two what 

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:13.369
 in all this gives 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.270
 good 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.770
 so this reason is you register it to 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.700
 share either you find a nice friend 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.139
 to play it at the same time as you 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:28.419
 either you do it yourself at the 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:29.770
 mouth but that's my style and that's it 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:32.190
 for this tutorial and I hope it will 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:48.540
 will have pleased it's over there absolutely 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:48.540
 something is missing to beat at
