00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
sticky throttle but this is different

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.730 
sticky throttle but this is different
with<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.210> Toyota<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.960> throttle<00:00:16.379> would<00:00:16.500> stick

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
with the Toyota the throttle would stick

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.939 
with the Toyota the throttle would stick
rarely<00:00:17.190> if<00:00:17.369> at<00:00:17.640> all<00:00:17.840> with<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:18.960> Honda<00:00:19.380> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
rarely if at all with this Honda the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.500 
rarely if at all with this Honda the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
every single time you push the gas pedal

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.730 
every single time you push the gas pedal
down<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.789> will<00:00:24.539> show<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.199> as<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.590> go

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
down I will show you this as I go

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.339 
down I will show you this as I go
through<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.099> gears<00:00:26.430> when<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> RPM<00:00:27.630> gets<00:00:28.170> to

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
through the gears when the RPM gets to

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.109 
through the gears when the RPM gets to
8,000<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.130> push<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.609> clutch<00:00:29.789> and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
8,000 I push the clutch and

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.089 
8,000 I push the clutch and

gas pedal

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.330 
gas pedal
I<00:00:32.910> then<00:00:33.750> wait<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> RPM<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.829> drop<00:00:35.070> before

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
I then wait for the RPM to drop before

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.670 
I then wait for the RPM to drop before
releasing<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.030> clutch<00:00:36.410> notice<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.559> it

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
releasing the clutch notice that it

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.740 
releasing the clutch notice that it
takes<00:00:37.829> over<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.250> second<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> RPM<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.510> drop

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
takes over a second for the RPM to drop

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
this keep your eye on the gas pedal and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.049 
this keep your eye on the gas pedal and
notice<00:00:51.960> how<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.140> RPM<00:00:52.710> remains<00:00:53.010> high<00:00:53.280> even

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
notice how the RPM remains high even

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:14.130 
notice how the RPM remains high even
after<00:00:54.300> my<00:00:54.420> foot<00:00:54.690> as<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.930> move<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.379> gas

think<00:01:23.530> you're<00:01:23.650> an<00:01:23.890> idiot<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:25.360> only<00:01:25.540> thing<00:01:25.690> you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
think you're an idiot the only thing you

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.570 
think you're an idiot the only thing you
can<00:01:25.930> do<00:01:26.050> is<00:01:26.260> to<00:01:26.380> continue<00:01:26.500> shifting<00:01:27.130> as<00:01:27.250> if<00:01:27.460> the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
can do is to continue shifting as if the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.450 
can do is to continue shifting as if the
RPM<00:01:27.970> did<00:01:28.210> drop<00:01:28.450> this<00:01:29.290> then<00:01:29.620> results<00:01:30.070> in<00:01:30.160> a<00:01:30.250> very

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
RPM did drop this then results in a very

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.790 
RPM did drop this then results in a very
jerky<00:01:30.729> drive<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.420> then<00:01:32.050> everyone<00:01:32.500> thinks

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
jerky drive and then everyone thinks

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.080 
jerky drive and then everyone thinks
you're<00:01:32.920> an<00:01:33.010> idiot<00:01:33.340> who<00:01:33.550> doesn't<00:01:33.880> know<00:01:33.970> how<00:01:34.060> to

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
you're an idiot who doesn't know how to

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.410 
you're an idiot who doesn't know how to

it<00:02:42.120> has<00:02:42.239> been<00:02:42.420> pissing<00:02:42.750> off<00:02:42.870> its<00:02:43.080> owners<00:02:43.410> for

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
seven years now I think it is safe to

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.470 
seven years now I think it is safe to
assume<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:47.040> there<00:02:47.640> will<00:02:47.790> be<00:02:47.820> no<00:02:48.090> firmware

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
assume that there will be no firmware
