 quite a good rank somewhere around 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.950
 bigstar and or lem something like that and 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.110
 him for something after all reporti 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.890
 all and now goes to point b 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.090
 and will go through a narrow tunnel 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.070
 time comes in the back 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.040
 Chick ass and start asking in the smoke 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.280
 stitch 1 pretty standard 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.470
 situation by the way I would note if with over 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.950
 Now I 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.570
 kaeshka fighting off the side and yes 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.970
 really now was very 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.450
 interesting clutch because what a point 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.149
 he was lucky strayed in from the side and 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.610
 returned to this type of terrorist 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.350
 who was in the tunnel and killed him and plus 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.060
 the last one was red which did 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.100
 on the bomb well and accordingly when you 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.550
 out of the tunnel yes you have 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.160
 definitely the focus is on the bomb which 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.950
 just got paid so he killed 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.110
 his quick 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.719
 there is a quiet game hulk us for 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.659
 terrorist bomb lies on a palm tree 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.820
 and as you can see with alcohol keeps point b on 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.640
 which is absolutely no one therefore 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.860
 most likely there is no bad when and 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.900
 helped you not say that the guy seems to be 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.080
 so clear movements well and here 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:22.440
 not guys go to midu 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:24.150
 1 minus 2 minus 3 are coming out waiting well 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.860
 not bad but he heard what he picked up 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:32.090
 device and pretty well killed him yes 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.730
 so here so here another clutch 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.410
 round performed by aspects 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.599
 almost in a row still passed over 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.599
 point b to the end but the syrup came to him 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.079
 kill on snatch 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.220
 not bad where I will note that it was not induced 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.880
 not on him in advance 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.480
 he on the tug killed the wagon of this which 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.720
 I was crucified and yet the terrorists 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.750
 nothing happens in time 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:05.329
 interesting are being killed at the point of the kern his 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:08.220
 traded to the bottom to hang out in the bottom 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.410
 Opponent well from aspects as if on infe 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.319
 obsess because we are for procedures 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.680
 Action before this in the bottom cover and more by us 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.250
 for 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.910
 killed his brother for whom nestor 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.180
 snake 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.700
 exchange again persistently and there and 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:29.430
 are trying to go out and whether there will be a warehouse now 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:36.000
 situation 13 situations we now saw 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:39.450
 on that kills without problems 2 ap ap ap 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.550
 there is there I am done pretty well 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.850
 okay so happened with the right of him 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.850
 so on the right, on the right you look at 2 hp with him and 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.460
 he doesn't quite pull everything out clearly 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.650
 was worked for the connection aspect i 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.870
 I can only praise him because 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.160
 really cool to watch 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.840
 a man whose clear movements 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.150
 thought points works and they take without 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.040
 problems this round 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.060
 Lebanon will let his friends I will not say 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.400
 because look at the total score of all 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.470
 of the players yes the alpha almost wondered a 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.519
 in general, all players and normal 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.830
 so all handsome play 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.800
 let's say so at the level so not here 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.410
 we have no reason to report this 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.510
 these guys are really you guys 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.940
 you meet on high 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.840
 ranks on ranks so now also to 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.370
 the situation should be a clutch because 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.190
 grandson he leaves he spins back 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.260
 to his three adversaries who were in 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.870
 the bank is killing a guy in the market who 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.440
 squeezed knows that there is pressing the bank 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:53.550
 he enters the enemy 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.770
 another head runs a good run runs away 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.030
 unfolds squeezed of course not from 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.850
 all killed 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.390
 but the guys here are really clean here 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.070
 good player is not a bad level therefore 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:08.580
 you can rewind to give another round 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.290
 look and rewind throw flash drives 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.180
 books from you appear that 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.750
 pretty good and 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.510
 I note that he did not do anything 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.569
 suspicious something that would indicate 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.929
 his participle 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:28.189
 and that's all again 

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:29.509
 desperate initial rush b usually play 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:30.759
 the lot of normal players is not 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:34.189
 passes 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:36.289
 deals with a plan without problems 54 situations 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:39.729
 There is info on flies and most likely already 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:43.520
 impov there is a rental from there go goes help 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:48.080
 stomping the enemy noticeably that there are many 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:51.949
 on glasses and knowing there is information about what 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.289
 there is a gate night with will push 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.800
 so I would do it in principle 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:02.689
 because flour shove is easy in 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:05.360
 one-to-one situations in an emphasis so oh or 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:09.259
 But this is a mistake and hello proper 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.080
 come let's put a verdict to 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:13.519
 you set please tell me 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.979
 have you ever seen any 

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:18.050
 suspicions my tough my tough 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.599
 position it's not enough it's just 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.059
 good player who is pretty clear 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.500
 focuses in principle on dusty 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:25.630
 and 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.360
 probably they play a glass that is 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.430
 good information and so on to me 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.080
 enough evidence to publish 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.780
 verdict 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:38.020
 that's what will be next my video is 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.780
 most likely leg I'm doing now 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:44.530
 release how to upnut global yes very 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:47.260
 interesting name and believe me 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.840
 it's very difficult to bring to you all my 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.320
 thoughts that I had about this 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.290
 Topics 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:56.440
 but I will try and wish you all good luck 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:59.190
 while watching my video with you was artem 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.190
 tank
