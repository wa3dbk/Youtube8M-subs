00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
going to roll this clip forwards and

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.779 
going to roll this clip forwards and
have<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.259> look<00:00:16.470> at<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.340> shot<00:00:17.580> from

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
have a look at it and this is shot from

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.970 
have a look at it and this is shot from
last<00:00:18.060> week<00:00:18.330> when<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.570> was<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:19.170> Centre<00:00:19.529> Court<00:00:19.710> and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
last week when I was on Centre Court and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.310 
last week when I was on Centre Court and
I<00:00:20.130> was<00:00:20.310> just<00:00:20.550> obviously<00:00:20.850> focusing<00:00:21.420> on<00:00:21.570> Federer

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
I was just obviously focusing on Federer

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.810 
I was just obviously focusing on Federer
for<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.590> second<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.070> there's<00:00:23.220> lots<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.760> stuff

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
for a second and there's lots of stuff

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.240 
for a second and there's lots of stuff
we<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.630> learn<00:00:25.019> from<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.439> one<00:00:25.769> clip<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.189> I'm

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
we can learn from this one clip and I'm

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.269 
we can learn from this one clip and I'm
going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.460> dissect<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:27.349> bit<00:00:28.349> by<00:00:28.380> bit<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:28.949> today

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
going to dissect it bit by bit but today

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.220 
going to dissect it bit by bit but today
I<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.550> want<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.000> have<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> look<00:00:30.420> at<00:00:30.660> how<00:00:31.170> you

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.100 
I just want to have a look at how you
can<00:00:31.500> do<00:00:31.800> something<00:00:32.250> incredibly<00:00:33.059> simple<00:00:33.570> for

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
can do something incredibly simple for

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.590 
can do something incredibly simple for
the<00:00:34.530> most<00:00:34.559> basic<00:00:35.190> shot<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.969> probably<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the most basic shot and probably the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.049 
the most basic shot and probably the
most<00:00:36.870> important<00:00:37.620> shot<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.820> game

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
most important shot in the game

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.260 
most important shot in the game
especially<00:00:39.329> when<00:00:40.050> you're<00:00:40.649> rallying<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:42.059> good

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
especially when you're rallying so good

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
this point off is drill down and let's

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.619 
this point off is drill down and let's
have<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.320> look<00:00:55.559> at<00:00:55.710> exactly<00:00:56.129> what's<00:00:57.000> behind<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
have a look at exactly what's behind the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.380 
have a look at exactly what's behind the
geometry<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.350> how<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:59.070> use<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.210> one

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
geometry and how you can use it so one

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.209 
geometry and how you can use it so one
of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> most<00:01:00.750> basic<00:01:00.960> shots<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.620> need<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.039> have

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
of the most basic shots you need to have

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.130 
of the most basic shots you need to have
in<00:01:02.309> your<00:01:02.430> game<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> consistent<00:01:03.329> basis<00:01:03.989> is

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
in your game on a consistent basis is

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.190 
in your game on a consistent basis is
the<00:01:04.890> cross-court<00:01:05.670> shot<00:01:05.820> now<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.869> trick<00:01:07.170> here

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the cross-court shot now the trick here

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.929 
the cross-court shot now the trick here
is<00:01:07.380> when<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.799> want<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.159> really<00:01:08.520> consistent

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
is when you want to be really consistent

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.030 
is when you want to be really consistent
and<00:01:09.360> keep<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> ball<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.439> nice<00:01:10.680> safe

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
and keep the ball in a nice safe

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.460 
and keep the ball in a nice safe
cross-court<00:01:11.850> position<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.810> hit<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.290> ball

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
cross-court position you hit the ball

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.100 
cross-court position you hit the ball
directly<00:01:14.220> over<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.790> net<00:01:15.000> strap<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.930> do

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
directly over the net strap and you do

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.210 
directly over the net strap and you do
that<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.500> couple<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.770> reasons

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
that for a couple of reasons

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.010 
that for a couple of reasons
obviously<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.150> net<00:01:18.420> stroke<00:01:18.689> will<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
obviously the net stroke will be the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990 
obviously the net stroke will be the
lowest<00:01:19.290> part<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.070> net<00:01:20.310> don't<00:01:20.670> forget<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
lowest part of the net don't forget the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.179 
lowest part of the net don't forget the
net<00:01:21.240> gets<00:01:21.720> higher<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.380> goes<00:01:22.560> out<00:01:22.710> towards

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
net gets higher as it goes out towards

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.240 
net gets higher as it goes out towards
the<00:01:23.310> net<00:01:23.490> posts<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.450> also<00:01:24.750> what<00:01:25.680> will<00:01:25.860> happen

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the net posts but also what will happen

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.520 
the net posts but also what will happen
is<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:27.000> will<00:01:27.030> get<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.570> ball<00:01:27.720> into<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.140> much<00:01:28.500> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
is you will get the ball into a much a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.350 
is you will get the ball into a much a
bigger<00:01:29.070> area<00:01:29.400> meaning<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.030> you're<00:01:30.180> more

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
bigger area meaning that you're more

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.390 
bigger area meaning that you're more
likely<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.840> keep<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.229> ball<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:32.070> let's<00:01:32.250> have

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
likely to keep the ball in so let's have

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.670 
likely to keep the ball in so let's have
a<00:01:32.460> look<00:01:32.610> at<00:01:32.729> how<00:01:32.909> Federer<00:01:33.299> does<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.530> can

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
a look at how Federer does that you can

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.440 
a look at how Federer does that you can
see<00:01:34.829> he's<00:01:35.040> played<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.460> return<00:01:35.850> well<00:01:36.240> away

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
see he's played that return well away

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.760 
see he's played that return well away

from the net strap there to hit it down
