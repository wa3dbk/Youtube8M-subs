if<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.860> let<00:01:44.009> go<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.369> button<00:01:44.490> now<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.939> is

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
if I let go of the button now this is

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.690 
if I let go of the button now this is
where<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.299> really<00:01:45.479> cool<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.619> now<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.159> can

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
where it's really cool so now I can

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.149 
where it's really cool so now I can
still<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.180> by<00:01:48.390> looking<00:01:48.420> at<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.380> focus<00:01:49.890> point

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
still see by looking at the focus point

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.550 
still see by looking at the focus point
that<00:01:50.310> I'm<00:01:50.400> in<00:01:50.520> dynamic<00:01:51.240> focus<00:01:51.689> mode<00:01:51.900> because

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
that I'm in dynamic focus mode because

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.700 
that I'm in dynamic focus mode because
the<00:01:53.400> focus<00:01:53.790> point<00:01:54.060> has<00:01:54.299> lots<00:01:55.020> around<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.530> and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the focus point has lots around it and

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.859 
the focus point has lots around it and
that's<00:01:56.070> basically<00:01:56.520> letting<00:01:56.850> me<00:01:57.030> know<00:01:57.060> which

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
that's basically letting me know which

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.069 
that's basically letting me know which
focus<00:01:58.320> points<00:01:58.650> being<00:01:58.920> used<00:01:59.240> in<00:02:00.240> dynamic<00:02:00.600> 9

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079

switch to the right

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.150 
switch to the right
I'm<00:02:05.369> now<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.670> dynamic<00:02:06.090> 21<00:02:06.509> point<00:02:06.780> mode<00:02:07.009> you<00:02:08.009> can

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
I'm now in dynamic 21 point mode you can

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.190 
I'm now in dynamic 21 point mode you can
see<00:02:08.310> more<00:02:08.880> focus<00:02:09.420> points<00:02:09.690> have<00:02:09.780> become<00:02:10.019> active

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
see more focus points have become active

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.039 
see more focus points have become active
let<00:02:11.190> go<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.489> button<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:12.000> again<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.900> can

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
let go of the button and again you can

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.590 
let go of the button and again you can
see<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.320> main<00:02:13.530> focus<00:02:14.070> point<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.670> now

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
see the main focus point is now

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.900 
see the main focus point is now
surrounded<00:02:15.840> by<00:02:16.170> more<00:02:16.769> dots<00:02:17.040> giving<00:02:17.820> me

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
surrounded by more dots giving me

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.569 
surrounded by more dots giving me
greater<00:02:18.180> coverage<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.500> again<00:02:20.040> I've<00:02:20.280> got<00:02:20.459> an

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
greater coverage so again I've got an

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.819 
greater coverage so again I've got an
idea<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:20.970> exactly<00:02:21.209> what<00:02:22.019> focus<00:02:22.470> points<00:02:22.769> are

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
idea of exactly what focus points are

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:23.809 
idea of exactly what focus points are
being<00:02:23.010> used<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.489> most

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
being used on most

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.270 
being used on most
object<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.359> of<00:02:25.200> course<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.680> can<00:02:25.829> see<00:02:25.980> what<00:02:26.099> mode

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
object and of course I can see what mode

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.729 
object and of course I can see what mode
I<00:02:26.310> mean<00:02:26.489> just<00:02:26.700> by<00:02:26.849> looking<00:02:27.180> at<00:02:27.359> the<00:02:27.620> at<00:02:28.620> the

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
I mean just by looking at the at the

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.289 
I mean just by looking at the at the
focus<00:02:29.069> points<00:02:29.400> on<00:02:29.519> screen<00:02:29.819> which<00:02:29.969> is<00:02:30.090> really

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
focus points on screen which is really

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:30.649 
focus points on screen which is really
cool

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
cool

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.809 
cool
hold<00:02:31.379> it<00:02:31.499> down<00:02:31.590> again<00:02:31.889> switch<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.639> right

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
hold it down again switch to the right

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.959 
hold it down again switch to the right
I'm<00:02:33.060> now<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.359> 51<00:02:33.840> point<00:02:34.109> mode<00:02:34.319> let<00:02:35.310> go<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.909> you

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:35.969 
I'm now in 51 point mode let go and you

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.390 
I'm now in 51 point mode let go and you
can<00:02:36.120> see<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.599> dots<00:02:36.840> basically<00:02:37.400> have

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
can see that the dots basically have

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.240 
can see that the dots basically have
completely<00:02:38.999> surrounded<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.659> whole<00:02:40.250> focus

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
completely surrounded the whole focus

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.940 
completely surrounded the whole focus
point<00:02:41.519> selection<00:02:41.849> area<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.739> just<00:02:43.859> move

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
point selection area and I can just move

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.280 
point selection area and I can just move
the<00:02:44.340> normal<00:02:45.000> single<00:02:45.359> point<00:02:45.719> around<00:02:45.989> within

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
the normal single point around within

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.160 
the normal single point around within
there<00:02:46.849> hold<00:02:47.849> it<00:02:47.939> down<00:02:48.030> again<00:02:48.389> switch<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.079> the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
there hold it down again switch to the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.580 
there hold it down again switch to the
right<00:02:49.349> so<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:49.739> in<00:02:49.889> 3d<00:02:50.310> mode<00:02:51.079> let<00:02:52.079> go<00:02:52.290> and

right so now in 3d mode let go and

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.699 
right so now in 3d mode let go and
that's<00:02:52.769> signified<00:02:53.340> by<00:02:53.599> a<00:02:54.599> single<00:02:55.109> focus<00:02:55.439> point

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
that's signified by a single focus point

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.580 
that's signified by a single focus point
on<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:55.980> screen<00:02:56.219> but<00:02:56.790> it's<00:02:56.909> got<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.389> dots<00:02:58.290> in<00:02:58.530> the

show you is the new virtual horizon on
the<00:03:29.400> d4<00:03:29.819> as<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.150> detects<00:03:30.479> pitch<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.079> roll<00:03:31.259> on

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
the d4 as it detects pitch and roll on

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.550 
the d4 as it detects pitch and roll on
the<00:03:32.189> d3<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:32.669> d3s<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.359> just<00:03:33.540> use<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.959> exposure

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
the d3 and d3s you just use the exposure

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.080 
the d3 and d3s you just use the exposure
meter<00:03:34.859> on<00:03:35.009> the<00:03:35.040> right<00:03:35.280> hand<00:03:35.489> side<00:03:35.669> to<00:03:35.699> tell<00:03:36.030> you

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
meter on the right hand side to tell you

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.409 
meter on the right hand side to tell you
if<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.299> camera<00:03:36.629> was<00:03:36.780> level<00:03:37.459> but<00:03:38.459> on<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.790> d4

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
if the camera was level but on the d4

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.759 
if the camera was level but on the d4
because<00:03:39.840> you've<00:03:39.989> got<00:03:40.109> pitch<00:03:40.349> and<00:03:40.620> roll

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
because you've got pitch and roll

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.559 
because you've got pitch and roll
there's<00:03:41.609> obviously<00:03:41.879> something<00:03:42.120> else<00:03:42.359> needs

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
there's obviously something else needs

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.119 
there's obviously something else needs
to<00:03:42.629> change<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.169> now<00:03:44.099> what<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:44.699> get<00:03:44.939> to<00:03:45.180> detect

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
to change so now what you get to detect

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.990 
to change so now what you get to detect
roll<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:48.810> can<00:03:48.959> see<00:03:49.139> that<00:03:49.379> is<00:03:50.129> the<00:03:50.459> focus

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
roll you can see that is the focus

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.629 
roll you can see that is the focus
points<00:03:52.280> quite<00:03:53.280> cleverly<00:03:53.729> go<00:03:54.239> left<00:03:54.509> to<00:03:54.659> right

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
points quite cleverly go left to right

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.460 
points quite cleverly go left to right
so<00:03:56.639> you<00:03:56.729> know<00:03:56.849> exactly<00:03:57.030> when<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.079> camera<00:03:58.439> is

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
so you know exactly when the camera is

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.569 
so you know exactly when the camera is
level<00:03:59.959> and<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.079> exposure<00:04:01.439> meter<00:04:01.769> obviously

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
level and the exposure meter obviously

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.539 
level and the exposure meter obviously
detects<00:04:03.030> pitch<00:04:03.959> so<00:04:04.650> that's<00:04:04.979> just<00:04:05.099> another<00:04:05.280> one

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
detects pitch so that's just another one

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.890 
detects pitch so that's just another one
the<00:04:05.729> small<00:04:05.939> changes<00:04:06.269> on<00:04:06.419> the<00:04:06.509> default

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
the small changes on the default

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.990 
the small changes on the default
