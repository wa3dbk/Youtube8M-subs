00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.730
 we copy text 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.939
 and we paste it in the folder 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.659

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.030
 5 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.180
 perfect story all for the part of the 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.950
 place it where it should be and go to 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.390
 to see how 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.390
 to activate the wheel 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.540
 good friends we are here now you 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.910
 we can repeat that the simple now that 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.180
 this one that is here is optional if 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.580
 they want to be mentioning and also the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.680
 I repeat again that the drawer of 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.680
 up disappears on the right 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.610
 stress will not be seen either 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.710
 ways to change 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:44.340
 now to make the wheel of arms 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.340
 we only use prayer from 77 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.290
 and here it ends up that we move with the 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.709
 analog control that we use for 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.709
 move 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.950
 I think not 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:14.970
 well as you see the cold does not appear 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.970

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:26.719

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.840
