00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
cramps are drug therapy so ence aids are

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.709 
cramps are drug therapy so ence aids are
often<00:00:32.800> recommended<00:00:33.489> like<00:00:33.730> ibuprofen<00:00:34.059> and

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
often recommended like ibuprofen and

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.950 
often recommended like ibuprofen and
this<00:00:35.590> helps<00:00:35.860> to<00:00:35.920> decrease<00:00:36.100> inflammation

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
this helps to decrease inflammation

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.020 
this helps to decrease inflammation
birth<00:00:37.960> control<00:00:38.380> pills<00:00:38.680> and<00:00:39.070> also<00:00:39.340> painkillers

birth control pills and also painkillers

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.240 
birth control pills and also painkillers
all<00:00:40.330> of<00:00:40.930> which<00:00:41.110> don't<00:00:41.410> really<00:00:41.920> get<00:00:42.040> to<00:00:42.160> the

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
all of which don't really get to the

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.400 
all of which don't really get to the
root<00:00:42.370> cause<00:00:42.610> of<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.360> menstrual<00:00:43.750> cramps<00:00:44.260> and

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
root cause of the menstrual cramps and

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.550 
root cause of the menstrual cramps and
all<00:00:44.770> of<00:00:44.890> which<00:00:45.010> have<00:00:45.340> side<00:00:46.030> effects<00:00:46.470> so<00:00:47.470> the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
all of which have side effects so the

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.930 
all of which have side effects so the
cause<00:00:47.740> of<00:00:47.770> menstrual<00:00:48.370> cramps<00:00:48.640> is<00:00:48.730> really

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
cause of menstrual cramps is really

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.990 
cause of menstrual cramps is really
inflammation<00:00:49.750> now<00:00:50.560> there<00:00:51.070> is<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.280> normal

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
inflammation now there is a normal

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.940 
inflammation now there is a normal
inflammatory<00:00:52.510> response<00:00:53.470> during<00:00:53.770> the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
inflammatory response during the

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.800 
inflammatory response during the
menstrual<00:00:54.370> cycle<00:00:54.820> as<00:00:54.970> estrogen<00:00:55.600> and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
menstrual cycle as estrogen and

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.930 
menstrual cycle as estrogen and
progesterone<00:00:56.410> build<00:00:56.739> up<00:00:56.890> during<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.280> cycle<00:00:57.520> a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
progesterone build up during the cycle a

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.450 
progesterone build up during the cycle a
rock<00:00:58.480> Edenic<00:00:58.930> acid<00:00:59.410> which<00:00:59.829> is<00:00:59.860> an<00:01:00.070> omega-6

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
rock Edenic acid which is an omega-6

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.090 
rock Edenic acid which is an omega-6
fatty<00:01:00.940> acid<00:01:01.450> is<00:01:01.600> stored<00:01:02.350> within<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.770> uterine

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
fatty acid is stored within the uterine

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.330 
fatty acid is stored within the uterine
muscles<00:01:03.520> and<00:01:03.850> this<00:01:04.540> omega-6<00:01:05.350> fatty<00:01:05.560> acid<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:06.310> a

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
muscles and this omega-6 fatty acid is a

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.990 
muscles and this omega-6 fatty acid is a
precursor<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:07.120> a<00:01:07.330> lot<00:01:07.510> of<00:01:07.659> inflammation<00:01:09.000> so

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
precursor to a lot of inflammation so

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.510 
precursor to a lot of inflammation so
that<00:01:10.150> normally<00:01:10.810> occurs<00:01:11.229> but<00:01:11.710> our<00:01:11.890> lifestyle

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
that normally occurs but our lifestyle

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.390 
that normally occurs but our lifestyle
such<00:01:12.760> as<00:01:12.880> our<00:01:13.000> diet<00:01:13.330> our<00:01:13.780> stress<00:01:14.590> can<00:01:14.890> really

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
such as our diet our stress can really

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.610 
such as our diet our stress can really
contribute<00:01:15.760> to<00:01:16.060> that<00:01:16.180> process<00:01:16.479> so<00:01:17.470> an

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
contribute to that process so an

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.770 
contribute to that process so an
inflammatory<00:01:18.130> diet<00:01:18.700> is<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.120> diet<00:01:19.570> that

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
inflammatory diet is a diet that

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.360 
inflammatory diet is a diet that
includes<00:01:20.049> foods<00:01:20.590> that<00:01:20.740> are<00:01:20.890> really<00:01:21.159> high<00:01:21.340> in

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
includes foods that are really high in

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.960 
includes foods that are really high in
in<00:01:21.940> red<00:01:22.510> meat<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:22.990> chicken<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.860> yet<00:01:24.460> egg<00:01:24.640> yolk

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
in red meat and chicken and yet egg yolk

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.820 
in red meat and chicken and yet egg yolk
and<00:01:25.299> certain<00:01:25.659> oils<00:01:26.049> those<00:01:26.350> foods<00:01:26.620> can

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
and certain oils those foods can

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.820 
and certain oils those foods can
contribute<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.760> cramping<00:01:28.270> also<00:01:29.170> tension

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
contribute to the cramping also tension

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.020 
contribute to the cramping also tension
stress<00:01:30.400> can<00:01:31.270> exacerbate<00:01:31.630> cramping<00:01:32.530> as<00:01:32.680> well

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
stress can exacerbate cramping as well

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.520 
stress can exacerbate cramping as well
so<00:01:34.030> it's<00:01:34.150> important<00:01:34.690> and<00:01:34.900> looking<00:01:35.290> and<00:01:35.440> in

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
so it's important and looking and in

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.620 
so it's important and looking and in
valuating<00:01:36.100> someone<00:01:36.400> who<00:01:36.490> has<00:01:36.729> menstrual

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
valuating someone who has menstrual

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.210 
valuating someone who has menstrual
cramps<00:01:37.960> you<00:01:38.110> take<00:01:38.290> a<00:01:38.320> really<00:01:39.040> thorough

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
cramps you take a really thorough

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.430 
cramps you take a really thorough
history<00:01:39.549> looking<00:01:40.270> at<00:01:40.390> diet<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:41.049> lifestyle

history looking at diet and lifestyle

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.890 
history looking at diet and lifestyle
factors<00:01:41.710> that<00:01:42.460> could<00:01:42.640> be<00:01:42.760> contributing<00:01:43.450> to

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
factors that could be contributing to

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.050 
factors that could be contributing to
the<00:01:44.020> cramps<00:01:44.440> so<00:01:45.250> when<00:01:45.340> I<00:01:45.369> treat<00:01:45.610> menstrual
